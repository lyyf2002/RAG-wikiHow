Relax.",How to Boost Your Intake of Polyphenol Antioxidants," Maintain high levels of polyphenols in your body and bloodstream throughout the day! Eat and drink the polyphenol-rich foods that are described below every few hours. Blood levels of polyphenols will peak soon after they are consumed, then decrease as they are metabolized or excreted from the body. Some polyphenols will not be absorbed into the bloodstream, but will merely pass through the digestive tract. These polyphenols are very important as well because they may help to prevent colon cancer and such diseases.;
, Refining of foods removes polyphenols, so eat fresh or freshly cooked fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes instead of refined foods and meat products. Polyphenols tend not to be destroyed by moderate cooking or heating, and cooked foods may offer a more bioavailable source of polyphenols. Eat fresh and cooked plant foods.

, Rich colors such as reds and purples or black indicate that plant foods are excellent sources of polyphenols. Choose foods such as blueberries, pomegranates, red grapes, cranberries, and red or purple sweet potatoes. Blueberries as well as foods such as black rice, purple barley, black sorghum, and purple potatoes are sources of anthocyanins, as well as other polyphenols. The compound responsible for the color of turmeric, called curcumin, also happens to be a polyphenol.

, Beverages are concentrated, easily absorbed sources of polyphenol antioxidants.


Choose fruit juices that do not have added sugar. Pure pomegranate, blueberry, red grape, and unfiltered apple juice or cider are excellent choices.

Tea and coffee are very rich sources certain types of polyphenols. Choose caffeinated tea and coffee, as the decaffeination process may remove polyphenols along with the caffeine.
Drink red wine and beer instead of other alcoholic beverages. Hard liquor is distilled so essentially does not contain polyphenols. Red wine is an associated with the ""French Paradox,""which essentially initiated the discovery that red wine and other plant foods may be very important to health and prevent chronic disease. Red wine is a very rich source of the famous polyphenol Resveratrol, which is present in high concentrations in the skins of wine grapes. For the highest concentrations of resveratrol, choose Pinot Noir wines from colder, damp climates such as New York and Oregon. Resveratrol is formed in large quantities by the grapes in such climates because the resveratrol is needed to protect the grapes from mold in such conditions. Beer is also a great source of polyphenols, and contains a great variety of polyphenols. This is because beer is made with barley as well as hops. Barley provides the majority of the polyphenols found in beer, but hops are an important source of a variety of polyphenols. For the highest concentrations of polyphenols, choose well-hopped bitter beers such as India Pale Ales or dark beers. Dark malt that is used to make dark beers provides melanoidin antioxidants that actually may help to keep the hop polyphenol antioxidants in the beer during the brewing process. Non-alcoholic red wine and beer are also available, and may be a good source of polyphenols as well.

, Chocolate and cocoa are somewhat refined, but are one of the richest sources of polyphenols. Choose dark, bitter chocolate and unsweetened cocoa. The saturated fat in chocolate should not raise bad cholesterol when consumed in moderation.

, Polyphenols tend to be astringent, bitter or harsh on the palate. Pure pomegranate juice is noticeably astringent. Yellow onions that make you cry are higher in polyphenols than sweet onions. Be sure to choose polyphenol-rich foods that have not been overly sweetened or diluted, as the sugar and other such ingredients can negate the healthy effects of the polyphenols. Unfiltered, astringent olive oils are also great sources of polyphenols.

, Plants raised organically or in more natural conditions can be much higher in polyphenols. An Italian study which found that organic peaches and pears have higher levels of polyphenols than conventional counterparts suggests that the absence of pesticides encourages a stronger antioxidant defense system (i.e. more polyphenols).Plants actually produce polyphenols in order to protect themselves from diseases and pests, especially when grown in less than ideal conditions. And then you eat the plants and the polyphenols protect you!

, Many supermarkets actually list certain polyphenols in the produce section for many vegetables, although it is unlikely that the word “polyphenol” will be used. Look for words such as “phenol” and “anthocyanin”. Other healthy plant compounds that are not polyphenols will also be listed, such as the carotenoid lutein. Try writing down these words and then search for them online to determine exactly what they are.

, Many current food products list polyphenols on their labels. Some polyphenols may be listed as substances such as flavonoids, flavonols, or anthocyanins. Current products such as antioxidant beverages and chocolate specifically list polyphenols and polyphenol flavonols. It is generally not legal for alcoholic beverages in the United States to list polyphenols on the label, although one Oregon winery has listed resveratrol on the label of their 2002 Pinot Noir.

, Polyphenols are antioxidants so will essentially be neutralized or destroyed by unhealthy free radicals. It is good that free radicals can be neutralized by polyphenols, but the polyphenols will not be able to act in the body to the extent that is desirable. Therefore, avoid foods that are high in free radicals such as deep fried foods, meats, and refined foods. Be sure to avoid overly cooked or charred meats and chemically treated meats such as bacon. Deep fried foods are notorious sources of free radicals, as the deep frying oil is continuously oxidized as it is heated. The fried food is also cooked at very high temperatures, so more free radicals are formed.

, Your body will use up antioxidant polyphenols faster if you are under stress.

Browse something that you are not familiar with the internet.",How to Exercise an Open Mind," Every decision you make in life is based on your belief system. To open your mind, start to list your fundamental beliefs, and for each one ask yourself why you believe it. Then ask yourself whether you could imagine being you if you didn't exactly believe it anymore, but believed something marginally different. Then marginally different from that. Pick a belief a week and work at it. Ask some really good friends what they believe and how they acquired their beliefs. Understand this: your belief system is absolutely unique to you; your friend's belief system is unique to them. An open mind is comfortable with differences and with using a variety of lenses to view an issue.


Do you think that Nutella sandwich or Spaghetti Bolognese is the most delicious food in the world? Test this belief. Eat as much of it as you want! Have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and pretty soon you'll be rethinking your original idea, doubting whether you original belief is still what you believe in. You just discovered something new with heaps of fun along the way! Think about it... eating as much chocolate as you want!
Try to set a goal- for instance, to change your mind about something once a week. Whether that is learning more about a group of people you used to dislike, losing an argument and admitting you were wrong, or even just watching Mythbusters and realizing that you were wrong about one of the myths. If you learn to enjoy improving yourself and understanding more about the world, then every time you change your mind will feel fun and enlightening.;
, By using your body in new ways, you can learn more about yourself and expand your mind. Walk backwards through your whole house for a completely new spatial perspective (being careful not to trip over anything or fall down the stairs). Learn to do a handstand, backflip, or a kip-up. Take martial arts classes. Try some hip-hop classes or learn a break dance move. Can you touch your toes? Work on it. Try skiing, snowboarding, jet skiing, hang gliding, parasailing, surfing, and anything else that pushes the limits of your comfort zone!


Learn to spin a pencil around your thumb, solve a Rubik's Cube, or try cup-stacking]]. Don't know what something is? Look it up!
Learn to juggle. A great workout for your brain, eyes and reflexes. Are three balls too easy? Try four, or better yet, five. If you get extremely good, try 10! 20! 50! Think it's impossible? Keep an open mind. Try contact juggling for a different challenge.
Try a new physical sensation. Take a dip in a glacial lake or a hot spring.

, Go to a cheap or free art gallery. Even if you think it's bad art, it can still be thought-provoking and introduce you to people with different tastes from your own. Watch movies or shows in genres that you don't normally explore. Immerse yourself in cyberpunk, horror, anime, documentaries, stand-up comedy (Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, Louis CK, etc.), or anything else you haven’t gotten around to trying (and potentially loving).


Watch shows that you discriminate against. Do you hate (or think you’d hate) the O.C.? Make a point of trying it once or twice. Do the same with a soap opera, science fiction, or fantasy show. Watch the Spanish channels, religious channels, the Discovery, Travel, or Disney Channel, even if only for a few days.
Try not watching any TV for two weeks. Fill your newly found free time with new and exciting activities.

, Listen to music you haven't had much exposure to, such as classical, new age, zouk, rap, hip-hop, drum and bass, dubstep, trance, metal, jazz, exotica, polka, international, mariachi, country, or Afro-blues. You don't have to like it at first, but if you keep an open mind, you can still find it interesting. Listen to a radio station you typically don't listen to or use an online music player such as Pandora that will expose you to new artists based on your proposed interests.

, A great gateway into this is Wikipedia, where you can read articles on a wide variety of practices, such as BDSM, swinging, Wicca, Christianity, the Green Party, conservatism, communism, anarchism, Sunnis, discordianism, Tutsis, tazkiah, and the Amish. Consider how many members they have worldwide. Volunteer with an organization that works with a community of people you are unfamiliar with.

, Take unusual classes at a community college or community-based educational program near you: pick up a catalog and open your mind to learning things like art history, basket-weaving, first-aid training, or business ethics. Your local university likely offers easy survey courses with no prerequisites, such as meteorology, nutrition, or Japanese pop culture. You could even find unexpected topics such as Vampires and Werewolves. Learn different languages (Norwegian, Esperanto, Japanese, French, Arabic, Italian, Turkish, Finnish, Saami, Chinese, Navajo, etc.), especially those with roots very different from your own. The internet is a great place to find obscure classes cheaply or for free. Look for free lectures on YouTube or KhanAcademy.org.


Join clubs based on things you have no knowledge of. A Scrabble club, investment club, folk dance club, etc., would not only teach you something new, but also make you new friends.
Build ridiculous things like radios, legos, robots, and trebuchets.

, Learn how to write or speak backwards. (Leonardo da Vinci, the quintessential Renaissance man and a jack-of-all-trades, wrote all of his notes backwards so that they could only be read with a mirror.) Or try writing upside down, or reading backwards. None of these is as hard as it might seem; you'll soon get the hang of it.


Learn to read and write any language that you don't know. Here are a few ideas: Norwegian, Portuguese, Turkish, Spanish, German, Italian, Arabic, Aramaic, Mandarin, Japanese, Maltese, Cantonese, Russian, Finnish, Latin, Welsh and Dutch.
Learn to count in a different numeral base than the one you're used to (chances are you're using decimal), use binary (base 2), octal (base 8), duodecimal (base 12), hexadecimal (base 16), vigesimal (base 20 used in Mayan numerals) or another numeral system. When you start getting familiar with basic operations, try converting from one system to another. Next, mix different systems in a single operation. Throw in some of this or that and one day you might be able to multiply rot13-encoded hexadecimal by xor'ed vigesimal.
Learn classical cipher schemes and algorithms. Encode and decode using the Vigènere cipher, a Bible cipher, or your own code.

, Start by trying new foods. Have you had sushi? What about Vietnamese? Mediterranean? Indian? Native-American? Cajun? Vegetarian? Have you ever tasted a boba? A shot of wheatgrass? A bowl of mushroom soup? Have you smoked a hookah or eaten durian or the Filipino delicacy, balut? While you’re at it, attend mosques, churches, synagogues, temples, trade union meetings, and meditations.

, While waiting (in line at the bank, a coffee shop, a restaurant, the grocery store, or waiting for someone to pick you up, or a show on TV to start), ponder things, calculate, and memorize. You can, for example, memorize digits of pi (you can get to 50 in a matter of hours, 200 in a matter of weeks), try to remember all of your high school teachers' names, memorize prime numbers, get good at reciting the alphabet backwards, learn the Greek alphabet (forwards and backwards), remember how many movies Tom Cruise has been in, or try doubling numbers (1, 2, 4, 8, 16…) until they become challenging. You can even try doubling numbers visually, as in picturing one simple object (like a marble), then two, then four, and so on. (A good way to do this is to imagine the objects in a grid or on a circle.)

, Are you computer-illiterate? Putz around on a computer for a while. Don't be scared. As long as you're using a Unix-like operating system, don't enter your root password and are careful, you won't break anything. Learn a programming language. Nothing is as hard as anyone makes it out to be. Build your own computer. Think it's hard? You'll never know until you actually do it. It's somewhat ridiculous how many how-to's there are on building a computer.

, You may find it hard to stomach at first, but in time you might find a grain of truth in what your nemesis has to say. Even if you don't, you'll be able to argue with one of ""them"" much more intelligently. Here's a hard but effective method: take a controversial issue that you have a strong opinion about. Write an essay defending your opinion with as much evidence and actual citations as possible. Then, write another essay defending the other side, again with evidence and citations, considering that side's arguments seriously and being scrupulously honest and putting in as much effort as you did the first essay.

, Do everyday things, like cleaning up your room or using your cell phone, with a blindfold. It puts things in perspective when you are forced to ""create"" new ways of doing things you've already figured how to do. You could also try using a different part of your body to do things, like write with your teeth or type with your toes.

, Strategy is the poetry of the mind. Bridge, checkers, chess, shogi, and Go are all great ways to exercise your mental flexibility. Doing jigsaw and/or brainteaser puzzles will also help you subconsciously think of things in new ways, and you may surprise yourself at how talented you are at certain types of puzzles!

, Becoming an outsider really exposes a mind to new things. You can even do this travel inside your country or state! How well do you know your own city? Have you tried using only a bike, or only using your own two feet and public transportation? (Ever considered what it's like if that was the only means to get around, say if you were physically unable to drive around? Being a pedestrian once in a while will make you a better driver.) Go off the beaten path!

, Which came first: the chicken or the egg? Or think about places like the Bermuda Triangle: why do so many people disappear? Check out books and sites on these strange topics.

, Piano is very popular. Or try learning the African drum Djembe. You do not need to have the best instrument to start learning. If you have a friend that can play a certain instrument, he/she will surely help you start. If you enjoy it, you can join a class.

, Chat up your bus driver, a protester, someone on his or her lunch break, a homeless person, or anyone else you might not otherwise give much thought to. Everyone likes to tell the story of their life.

, Wake up when you wake up and go to bed when you are tired. You'll see that a day is a lot longer than you thought and that the sun still moves without those little numbers ticking. What separates the real from the artificial?

, Life drawing will change the way you see the world. Practice is the best way to get good at it. Look for art lessons and books including a series by Andrew Loomis. Local groups sometimes get together offline for a Sketch Crawl or other ""plain air"" trips. Treat yourself to a pocket sketchbook, sketching set and a good pen or just improvise with free ballpoints or pencils and the backs of old printouts.

, Read random topics on Wikipedia. Type in a random word in a search engine and see what's happens. Try sites such as Stumbleupon and Digg to find different stuff on the web. Browse eBay. Look up recipes.

Age is no more than a circumstantial detail, like the color of your eyes, or the names of your parents; it does not define who you are. There are other things that do--those things we do have control over, such as how we think and what we do.;
, There is always something positive or something to look forward to each day. Enjoy the sun shining on your plants, or movies you are going to see. Look forward to reading a good book, or meeting with friends for lunch. If you feel lonely, go to the library. It is a great place to meet and talk to people who have a similar interest. Surround yourself with people, even if you might never see them again. You can do this at a supermarket, or even a department store or coffee shop.

, As long as you have your health, you can do just about anything you find an interest in doing. If you have never used a computer, buy one! Learn how to use it. If you find it interesting enough, learn how they work and how to fix problems or to program them! You will find you have brought the whole world into your room, and maybe some knowledge that will save you from spending money and make you feel younger. Just learn new things that you haven't learned before, don't worry if it's too ""young,"" nothing is.

, Take vitamins and eat healthy. Exercise at either a gym or at home. Dance to the music on a CD, as moving your body is great exercise. Get a full physical and visit your dentist at least once a year.

, Our bodies need to move. They need to be used to their full range and ability every day. Tai Chi is a good form of movement that will provide this whole body activity but it's not for everyone. Explore physical activities to find one that you enjoy, makes you feel good after practicing, and that you can do every day. Hiking and swimming are also excellent options.

, Don't worry about what happened in the past. Live just for today. The one thing that no one can change is the past. What has been is over and done with. The future has not yet come, so all we have is today. So enjoy today, let the past go, and plan for the future.

, Do crossword puzzles, learn a new language, or take up a hobby you were always too busy for. Exercise an Open Mind. Become a volunteer editor on websites. By volunteering time to a wiki you will meet other contributors online and keep your writing ability sharp, while helping others receive free knowledge. You can even share your knowledge over various forums.

, By doing this, you always will be able to converse with most people. Be up to date on what is new in politics, fashion, and/or in computers. Learn about the new methods of treatments and the new drugs available so you can advise your family members, who might need the information.

, Even with no close friends or family around, there are many opportunities to talk to new people. Strike up a conversation with people you meet in the supermarket. Greet people you pass on the street, and ask them how they're doing. You'll be surprised at how refreshed offering a kind word to a stranger will make you feel.

, Try to avoid thinking negative thoughts as it will get you no place except sadness. For example, trying to figure out why a mate died and left you alone will only bring tears to your eyes. Instead, remember all the wonderful years you shared, and how you both brought such wonderful children into this world. Go out with a smile on your face, and enjoy the rest of your life as best as you can. There may even be a new mate on the horizon. You never know!

, The local newspapers usually have a weekly schedule of activities. Find one that you would enjoy and go for it! Perhaps the museum or a flower show might tickle your fancy this week.

, Take dancing lessons. Ballroom dancing is back, and just think of how great you would feel dancing the Cha Cha once again, as you did in your youth. Go to bingo night at your local community center. Meet with like-minded people, and help those less fortunate than yourself. Most of all, have fun doing it.

, Look at something you always wanted to do or did on the side and love doing, ask whether it can become a new career. Many great painters didn't start till their sixties, seventies or eighties. Retirement income can become starting capital for a new independent business. The arts are a good direction in many ways because retirement income can support you while you learn the trade but there's no age discrimination involved.

See if you have a simple sprain.,
Determine if you have tennis elbow or golfer’s elbow.,
Check for symptoms of bursitis.,
Consider nerve pain as the cause.,
Know that a repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a possibility.,
Check for symptoms of angina.",How to Heal a Sore Arm1," Sprains occur when tissues are stretched, twisted or torn. Symptoms are pain, swelling, bruising, limited mobility and a “popping” sound when the injury occurred. The sprain is temporary and tissues are not permanently damaged. Sprains usually improve in just a few days., These conditions, also known as tendonitis, lead to pain in the elbow area of the arm. Causes usually include overuse of the muscles and tendons around the elbow joint. Pain can last several weeks or even months but taking care of the injured arm will help it heal faster.

, Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, which are small pouches of fluid that sit over joints to protect them. Normally the amount of fluid in the bursa is very small, but with injury it can swell up and become very painful causing bursitis. It usually develops from repetitive movements of the arm, and the pain often improves in a few weeks. Swelling can last longer but will gradually get better as well.An area affected with bursitis will be swollen or red and will likely hurt when you press on it.
Cases of bursitis along with injuries that have broken the skin may become infected and require antibiotics.

, The nerves in the spinal cord can become compressed, especially as you age. Symptoms include radiating pain from the neck to the arms or a feeling of pins and needles. Pain can fluctuate from day to day but usually improves with non-prescription painkillers, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and exercise.


A trapped nerve can happen in the arm as well. If it happens in the wrist, it is referred to as carpal tunnel syndrome, and when it happens in the elbow, cubital tunnel syndrome. Symptoms usually include pain and tingling in the affected arm or hand.

, When you use your arm or hands to do tasks regularly, such as at manufacturing, manual handling, heavy machinery and computer jobs, RSI can occur. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one type of nerve injury that can result from repetitive motion like typing. Employers can improve conditions and modify your workspace to help prevent aggravating your condition by, for example, offering an adjustable chair or moving your work platform so that you don’t have to reach up as high., Angina results when arteries that lead to the heart become hardened and narrowed. Symptoms include dull, tight or heavy feeling chest pain that can radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw or into the back for several minutes. The pain usually shows up during activity or stress. Always see your doctor if you have chest or left arm pain related to exercise.



Women in particular more commonly present with less ""classic"" symptoms of angina, such as arm pain only.

Visit your doctor or a wound clinic.,
Learn how to change your dressing.,
Wear a compression bandage.,
Call for help with your compression bandage if you experience severe pain or swelling.,
Ask your doctor about taking pentoxifylline.,
Discuss aspirin therapy with your doctor.,
Consider surgery if your ulcer doesn’t heal in six months.,
Identify and address complications.",How to Heal Venous Leg Ulcers1," Cleaning and dressing the wound is an important first step, but this should be done by a trained healthcare professional. They will clean any debris or dead tissue from your wound and apply a clean non-stick bandage.It’s very important to visit your healthcare provider or a vascular specialist right away for treatment if you notice you have an ulcer on your leg.

The first sign of a venous ulcer is skin that turns dark red or purple over the area where the blood is leaking out of the vein. The skin may also become itchy, thick and dry.;
, Leg ulcers should heal in about 3-4 months with proper care. In the meantime, your dressing should be cleaned once a week. Often, this requires professional care. Some people can learn to do this at home with proper training, so ask your healthcare provider to show you exactly how to change and reapply your dressing, and whether that's something you can attempt on your own.If you do not feel comfortable changing your own dressing, that’s okay! Ask your doctor if you qualify for a home-care nurse to come by and help you once a week. You can also visit a wound care clinic weekly.

, Your doctor or nurse will give you a compression device to wear over your dressing. This improves circulation to your leg, and is probably the most important step in healing your ulcer.Wear this exactly as your healthcare provider directs you to, and do not remove it without permission – it should only be applied and removed by a healthcare provider.Usually, you will wear your bandage continually until your wound heals, and your nurse will help you change it once a week when you change your dressing.

The compression bandage may feel painful at first. This will improve in about 10-12 days. Ask your doctor for a pain medicine like paracetamol, or ask how best to manage the discomfort.
Call your nurse if you have any problems with your compression bandage. Don’t try to take it off yourself.
There are several different kinds of compression bandages, and none are proven to be better than the others., It’s normal for your bandage to feel tight at night – getting up and taking a short walk may help. However, contact your nurse or doctor right away if you experience any of the following problems:

Severe pain in the front of your ankle
Severe pain on the bottom of your foot
Swelling in your toes that turns your toes blue

, Some people benefit from taking the medicine pentoxifylline (Trental) three times a day in addition to using a compression bandage. This medicine improves blood flow in your veins and arteries.Pentoxifylline can make you feel dizzy or sleepy, so know how it affects you before driving. Talk to your doctor about your other medications and health conditions to find out if this medication is right for you.Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, take any blood thinners, are pregnant or want to get pregnant, have an upcoming surgery, or are allergic to caffeine.

, Talk to your doctor about whether taking aspirin may help your condition. You may take 300mg of aspirin daily, which is safe for most people.This may speed up your healing time if you also use your compression bandage.

, Most ulcers heal with proper treatment. However, if your treated ulcer does not heal after six months, you may need a surgical procedure. Discuss these options with your doctor:Surgical “debridement” is scraping away dead tissue in the ulcer, which can help promote healing.
Skin grafting can improve healing of really large ulcers, and involves covering the ulcer with skin from your own body, from someone else, or with artificial skin. This won’t help if you have a lot of swelling, though.
Other surgeries are on the veins themselves, to improve blood flow.

, Leg ulcers can sometimes become infected by bacteria. If you notice any signs of infection, see your primary doctor or a vascular specialist immediately for treatment and assistance. Signs of an infection include:

Worsening pain
Green or unpleasant, possibly foul-smelling discharge from the ulcer site
Red, swollen skin around the ulcer
High body temperature

Apply pressure to stop the bleeding.,
Wash your hands before touching the scratch.,
Clean the scratch.,
Determine if you need to see a doctor.",How to Heal Scratches1," Some scratches may stop bleeding on their own. Others may bleed more heavily. To stop it from bleeding, place a clean tissue, cotton ball, cloth, or piece of gauze on it. Press down to apply pressure to stop the bleeding., Though many scratches are not very deep, you should never touch them with dirty hands. Any open wound, even a thin scratch, can get infected if you transfer contaminants from your hand. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water before touching the scratch., Place the scratch under running water. This helps clean any dirt, bacteria, or debris from the scratch. You can also clean around the scratch with mild soap.Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine on a scratch. It can irritate the wound.

, Most scratches and scrapes can be treated at home without a doctor’s care. However, you may find that the scratch needs medical attention. If the bleeding doesn’t stop or it continues to soak through your bandage, you may need to see a doctor.If the scratch gets infected, you should see a doctor. Signs to look for include increased pain, swelling, and redness around the scratch and warmth around the area. Look for pus oozing from the scratch. Infections may also make you have a fever.
If the wound is deep, punctured, or dirty, you may need a tetanus shot. If you have not had a tetanus booster in the last five years, visit your doctor to get one.

Use a tourniquet only in very serious cases.","How to Heal Cuts Quickly (Using Easy, Natural Items)"," You should always wash your hands with soap and water before treating a cut. This will help reduce your chances of infection.Wash your hands in warm water and air dry or dry with a clean towel, preferably paper.
If the cut is on your hand, try to avoid getting soap in the cut, as this can irritate the wound.;
, Hold the cut skin under warm running tap water and then apply a bit of mild soap to the cut to clean it. Gently rub the soap around the cut and then rinse the cut with warm water..


Check for gravel or other debris that might be embedded in the area as you rinse the wound and make sure that you remove any foreign bodies that you find. You can use tweezers that have been disinfected with rubbing alcohol to remove any debris.Natural cleansing should be sufficient for most of the shallow cuts that only require home treatment.
For deep cuts or cuts with embedded objects, seek medical attention.

, If the cut is still bleeding after you finish washing it, then apply a piece of sterile gauze and apply pressure to the cut. You can remove the gauze after the cut stops bleeding or cover the cut with a piece of gauze or other low-lint, sterile material. Do not use a “wiping” motion on the cut, as this could pull the cut open further.

, Use a gentle normal saline solution to help clean the area and prevent infection. Normal saline is the safest solution to use.It has about the same saltiness as blood, tears, and sweat, which is about 0.9%.To make your own normal saline solution, dissolve ½ teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of boiling water.Allow it to cool, then pour it over the cut and gently wipe away the moisture with a piece of sterile gauze.
Use fresh saline solution each time you rinse. Throw away any solution that you don’t use.Bacteria can grow in saline solution in as little as 24 hours.Be sure to keep your cut(s) clean and disinfect them at least once each day until the skin closes completely. If your cut appears red or inflamed, see a doctor.

, Although hydrogen peroxide is commonly recommended as a treatment for wounds, it actually does not appear to kill bacteria effectively. Hydrogen peroxide may slow the natural healing process and irritate the wound.Iodine may also irritate the cut.Stick with pure, running water or a normal saline solution to rinse the wound.

, Silver is a natural antimicrobial agent that has been in use for a long time. A 0.5% to 1% colloidal silver ointment may help to reduce your risk of infection.You can find colloidal silver antibacterial ointments at most drug stores and pharmacies.


Apply a thin layer of antibacterial silver ointment to the cut, then cover it with an adhesive bandage.
Keep in mind that antibacterial ointments do not heal cuts faster. However, they can help you avoid an infection and encourage your body to heal itself., Several herbs have natural antimicrobial effects that can help reduce infection. Some herbal remedies may interact with other medical conditions or prescription medications, so consult with your doctor or pharmacist before using them.


Calendula. Calendula has antimicrobial properties and has been shown to accelerate healing.Apply an ointment containing up to 5% calendula to your cut. This concentration has been shown to promote wound healing in animal studies.Tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial and antifungal agent. Try dabbing a few drops of 100% tea tree oil on the cut using sterile gauze.Echinacea. Echinacea can help to improve wound healing during periods of high stress, but it has no effect on wound healing during times of low or moderate stress.Try applying a cream or ointment that contains echinacea to help with healing., Apply pure aloe vera gel a few times a day if the wound is shallow. Don't treat deep wounds with aloe vera, including surgical wounds, since it can actually slow healing when it's applied deeper in the body.Aloe can reduce inflammation and moisturize the affected area.
In rare cases, individuals may have an allergic reaction to aloe vera. If your skin becomes red or irritated, stop applying aloe and see a doctor.

, Most honeys have natural antibacterial properties, and they also help keep minor cuts moist and protected from bacterial agents.Look for manuka honey, which has been shown to be one of the most effective types of honey for wound treatment.Apply a thin layer of honey to your cut after cleaning it. Cover with an adhesive bandage. Change the dressing frequently.
You could also try coconut oil, which also has natural antibacterial and antimicrobial properties., Cover the cut with sterile gauze and secure it with medical tape after applying your dressing of choice.

When you need to change the dressing, remove the old bandage, cleanse the cut with a saline solution, and apply a clean bandage.Clean and replace the bandage daily or whenever blood soaks through the pad.
Always wash your hands before changing your bandage or touching your cut.

, Help a cut heal faster by eating more protein and increasing your intake of vitamins that promote healthy skin, especially vitamins A and C.Zinc may also help with wound healing.If you're nutrient deficient, your skin will take much longer to heal. Eat plenty of the following foods to get adequate nutrition, vitamins, and minerals: Lean Protein: lean meats such as chicken and turkey; fish; eggs; Greek yogurt; beans
Vitamin C: citrus fruits, cantaloupe, kiwi, mango, pineapple, berries, broccoli, peppers, brussels sprouts, cauliflowerVitamin A: eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, orange colored fruits and vegetables, broccoli, spinach, and dark leafy green vegetables, cod liver oilVitamin D: fortified milk or juice, fatty fish, eggs, cheese, beef liver Vitamin E: Nuts, seeds, peanut butter, spinach, broccoli, kiwiZinc: Beef, pork, lamb, dark chicken, nuts, whole grains, beans, Studies have shown that green tea extract may help wounds heal faster.Look for a 0.6% concentration of green tea in an ointment.


You can also make your own by mixing green tea extract with petroleum jelly., Try using witch hazel to help the inflammation go down and reduce redness.Apply a small amount to your cut with a clean cotton ball.


Witch hazel is widely available in drug stores

, Drink at least eight ounces of non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages every two hours. This will replace fluids lost through sweating due to a fever or bleeding at the time of injury. Dehydration may cause the following complications:Dry Skin
Headaches
Muscle Cramps
Low Blood Pressure

, Engaging in moderate exercise may strengthen the body’s ability to fight infections, reduce inflammation and speed up the rate of healing.Do not exert the part of the body with the wound. Exercise at least three days a week for 30 to 45 minutes. Ask your doctor what exercise will work best for you. Some easy, low-intensity exercises are:


Brisk walking
Yoga and stretching
Light weight training
Bicycling at 5 to 9 miles per hour
Swimming

, Apply an ice pack if swelling or inflammation persists or becomes uncomfortable. Cold temperatures can help numb the area and reduce pain as well as prevent any further bleeding.You can make your own ice pack by moistening a towel and placing it in a zip-top freezer bag. Freeze the pack for 15 minutes.
Wrap a damp towel around the bag and apply to the affected area.
Do not apply an ice pack to an open or infected wound.
Do not apply ice directly to the skin as this can be harmful.

, A moist environment can help improve the wound healing process.Use a humidifier to help add moisture to the atmosphere and keep the skin from drying or cracking. Make sure that the humidifier is kept clean to avoid the spreading of bacteria that could cause infection.If the humidity is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive .
If the humidity falls too low, the people in your home may suffer from dry skin and develop throat and sinus irritations.
Measure humidity with a gauge called a humidistat, which can be purchased from most hardware stores.

, Examine the cut to gauge whether you need medical attention or can treat it at home. If the cut is very deep or severe, go to the hospital and have it treated by a medical professional. Serious flesh wounds may need stitches in order to heal properly.Visit the emergency room if the following is true of your cut:


Red muscle or yellow fat tissue is exposed deep in the cut.
The cut stays open when you stop holding the edges closed.
The cut is located on your face, near a joint, or another high-activity area where it won't stay closed without stitches.
The cut is dirty and you can’t get the dirt out.
The cut feels tender and/or drains a creamy, thick, grayish fluid.
Bleeding won’t stop after 20 minutes of firm pressure.
You develop a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.
There are red streaks near the wound.
You have not had a tetanus shot in 5 or more years and the wound is deep.The cut sliced open an artery – a thick, high-traffic blood vessel. Arterial blood is usually bright red in color. It comes out in spurts, profusely, and there is a high pressure behind it., Regardless of the severity of your cut, it is important to keep yourself from losing any more blood than you must. Place a clean strip of sterile gauze over the cut and apply firm, steady pressure until the bleeding stops.Once the bleeding has stopped, the wound can begin to heal.


Don't press too hard. If you apply too much pressure, you could cut off the circulation. This will impede the clotting of your blood, thus keeping your cut bleeding longer.
If blood seeps through the gauze, apply another piece on top to soak up the spillage. Don't remove the first piece. Keep constant pressure on the wound.
Visit the emergency room or get to a doctor if the blood quickly soaks through the gauze, and pressure doesn't seem to be stopping the bleeding.

, The only time that you should apply a homemade tourniquet to a cut is when you are losing an alarming amount of blood. Improper tourniquet use could cause serious damage to your limbs and blood flow, and it might even result in a need to amputate.

Rest the sore area.,
Use wraps or compressive elastic bandages.,
Remove all jewelry.,
Wear a sling.,
Elevate your arm.",How to Heal a Sore Arm2," Don’t exercise, lift, type or do anything to make the sore arm feel worse. Your tissues need to relax in order to heal and prevent further injury. Discontinue all activities that make the pain worse, and focus on using the injured arm as little as possible.

, To decrease swelling and help protect your arm, you can wrap the area with an elastic bandage (such as an Ace wrap). Be careful not to wrap your arm too tightly to avoid swelling around the wrapped area. Always loosen bandages that become too tight.


Numbness, tingling, an increase in pain, coolness or swelling around the bandage are all signs that your wrap is too tight.
Talk to your provider if you have to use a wrap for more than 48-72 hours.

, Your arm, hand and fingers can swell a lot after an injury. Be sure to take off rings, bracelets, watches and all other jewelry. They can be harder and more painful to remove later as swelling increases and can contribute to nerve compression or restricted blood flow.

, Slings can help keep your arm elevated and protected. They can also keep pressure off the injury, make you more comfortable and offer support. Contact a medical provider if you need to use the sling for more than 48 hours.

, Keep your arm above or at heart level to reduce swelling. When lying or sitting down, you can use pillows on your chest or side to keep your arm elevated. Don’t make your arm so elevated that you don’t get adequate blood supply.

Cold can be applied for up to 20 minutes several times a day.

, When 48-72 hours have passed after the injury, you can apply heat to the sore area. Don’t use heat if you still have swelling. You can also alternate between heat and cold to help make your arm feel better. Avoid heat on the area for the first 48 hours because it can increase swelling—this includes hot showers, tubs and packs.

, Over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen and acetaminophen can be used to help with pain and swelling. Always follow the directions on the label and don’t take more than the recommended dose. Never give children aspirin.

, You can use gentle pressure to rub or massage the sore area. This can help with pain and get blood flowing better to repair the damaged tissue faster. If it hurts too much, don’t try to massage it until your pain level decreases.


One way to massage areas that are sore is to use a tennis ball. You roll the ball over the sore area, and when you feel a tender spot, roll it slowly over the area for a maximum of 15 times.You can also go get a massage regularly from a professional, which may prove helpful.

, Always consult with a doctor for any questions or concerns you may have regarding your sore arm. If you are unable to control the pain, it lasts more than 2 weeks or your pain gets worse, then you need to see a doctor.

Listen to your body.,
Drink water.,
Eat well.,
Reduce stress.,
Learn proper form and movement.,
Don’t smoke.,
Do stretching exercises.",How to Heal a Sore Arm4," Don’t force your arm to move a certain way or pick something up if it hurts. Pain lets you know you need time to recover.

Dairy and dark green, leafy vegetables are foods you should incorporate into your diet regularly for vitamins and minerals.

, Stress lowers your immune system and makes it harder for your body to repair itself. When you are injured, it’s important that your body can focus on repairing the damaged tissue instead of trying to regulate a stressed system. Practice meditation and deep breathing exercises to encourage healing.

, When you do certain activities, you need to use the proper positions and movements to avoid straining muscles, joints or tendons. If you make the same arm movements often throughout the day, then you should consider finding other ways to move your arms to avoid RSI. It is sometimes necessary to have a professional evaluate your arm movements at work or while performing other actions to ensure they aren't problematic.


Always make sure that the equipment you are using to exercise or do sports with are correct for your ability level and size.
Call your human resources department at work to discuss modifications, other ways of performing job tasks or about getting another position within the company if what you are doing is causing sore muscles, tendons or joints.

, Smoking can slow healing. It can decrease blood supply and prevent enough oxygen from getting to your damaged tissues to repair them in a timely manner. Smoking can also increase your chance of getting bone issues like osteoporosis that can lead to more severe injuries.

, Do slow, gentle stretches of the area that is hurting. Do not use jerky movements, and don’t stretch beyond what is comfortable. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds and repeat if you want to.


A tricep stretch can be performed by raising your hands above your head and bending one elbow down. Grab the wrist of the bent arm with the other hand and pull it down toward your back. Repeat with the opposite arm.
Stretch your biceps by clasping your hands together behind your back and straightening your elbows. Bend forward, moving your clasped hands toward the ceiling.
You can stretch your shoulders by putting one arm across the chest and using the opposite arm to grab your forearm. Gently pull the arm toward your back shoulder. Repeat with the other side.
To stretch your wrists, cross your hands together to form a cross. Push down with the top hand, so your wrist flexes. Repeat with the other hand. "

Elevate your leg every day.,
Wear compression stockings to manage swelling.,
Live a healthy lifestyle.,
Use moisturizer for itchy skin.",How to Heal Venous Leg Ulcers2," Sit or lie down and elevate your leg so that your toes are at your eye level or higher. This improves blood flow and helps to heal ulcers. Do this three to four times every day for at least 30 minutes.Elevate the end of your bed about six inches, so that your leg is elevated while you sleep. You can use boxes or books for this., If you have venous ulcers, you may also have swelling in your feet and legs. Wearing compression stockings can help this. Compression stockings differ from the compression bandage you wear while your ulcer heals, because you can take stockings on and off.Request compression stockings from your doctor or pick some up at your local drug store or pharmacy. Ask your doctor the following questions:

How many hours a day should I wear my stockings?
Should I take them off at any point in the day?
When shouldn’t I wear them?
Can I wear them while my ulcer is still healing?
What size and tightness should I wear? (If you don't get them from the doctor directly)

, Obesity, smoking and inactivity can all cause venous leg ulcers. Do your best to eat a healthy diet, stay away from cigarettes, and be as active as possible in your day to day life.

Try to go on daily walks.
Stay away from fast food, processed food, and foods that have high sugar and simple carbohydrate contents, such as white bread.
Create circulation by doing ankle rotations and raising and lowering your foot when you’re sitting. Standing still and sitting without elevating your leg can make swelling worse.
Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise regime to find out what's safe for you.

, Your skin may feel itchy if it doesn’t get good blood flow. Do NOT scratch it – this can damage your skin and cause more ulcers! Use regular moisturizing lotion on dry, itchy skin.If that doesn’t help, ask your doctor for recommendations – they may give you a steroid cream to improve the itchiness.
Keep your skin well moisturized to prevent breaks in the skin that can turn into ulcers. Do not put lotion on an open wound or between your toes, however."

Remove clutter and any furniture that blocks pathways.
Keep items used daily in a place where they are easily accessible. Consider purchasing extended grabber reaching aids in case something is dropped to place around the house. Bending down to pick something up is a common cause of dizziness and falls for seniors.;
, Providing proper lighting in important areas can help prevent trips and falls in the house. Make sure there are at least two bulbs illuminating important areas such as doorways and hallways, and that there are switches placed at accessible heights on either side of a room entry or hall.If you are helping to care for an independent senior, consider helping them purchase and install lights that can be set on timers so that lights automatically come on during important portions of the day, such as at nightfall.

, Furniture that is too high or too low, especially chairs, sofas, and beds, can create a serious tripping and falling hazard for seniors. Make sure that the senior individual can sit up straight and have their feet comfortably sit flat on the floor, and that their knees don’t rise above their hips.If furniture legs are too long, they may need to be shortened or the furniture replaced. If the legs are too short, you can generally buy risers or supports to lift the furniture up to the right height.

, Have grab bars installed in the tub and shower and next to the toilet to help the senior individual lift and support themselves in an often slippery environment. These can be easily purchased from a home improvement store or installed by a professional.Work with the senior person to help ensure that the grab bars will be at right height for their needs. Have them sit or stand in the necessary areas to gauge where you should install the bars.
Install a raised toilet seat, as this can make it easier to sit down and get up, unless the person in question is very short.

, There are a number of alert systems available for seniors so that they can report a fall. Some are wall-mounted, such as buttons or switches, while others are wearable. Talk to the senior individual and let them decide what system is right for them.A personal alert necklace or watch is often preferable as switches and buttons need to be installed in every room throughout the house, and may still be inaccessible after a senior falls.

Some of these may even include the markers or paint with them, so you don't have to buy them

, Sometimes expressing your feelings, frustrations, and fears can be awesome! Writing can also take your mind off of the pain in your arm. If you aren't able to write with your hand, try typing. You can even keep an online journal about your experience.


For example, you can create a how-to-cope article for other people with broken arms or turn your whole experience into a fictional story.

, When you see people with casts and see all of the signatures on them, it makes you want to sign it, right? Well now lucky for you, you have a cast of your own to write and draw on! You can ask people to sign your cast, or you can just draw on it yourself. It's also a great thing to have for (believe it or not) to-do lists and things you need to remember.If you are going to draw on your cast, get silver or gold sharpies to use because if your cast is dark, you want to use colors that will show up.

, This is a great activity for when you're feeling extra bitter about your cast. Try to plan out all the things you want to do once it's off. You can even keep a list or a little notebook with you to add to when you think of something.


For example, you can list simple things like clapping or cutting your food. Or go for bigger things like rock climbing, swimming, or handstands.
Let your frustration serve as a motivation to try new things once your arm has healed.

Pull over to the side of the road.,
Pay attention to where the other car is pulling over.,
Turn on your hazard lights.

,
Check yourself and passengers for injuries.,
Call the Emergency Services.,
Look for eyewitnesses.,
Step out of the car, away from traffic.,
Introduce yourself to the driver.,
Tell the driver that you would like to exchange insurance information.,
Use your cell phone to take photos of both cars and skid marks.,
Wait until the police have released you.,
Check with the other driver before driving away.,
Call your insurance company.",How to Handle a Fender Bender," Removing yourself from the flow of traffic will reduce the risk of accident and a pile-up. Make sure you have a safe place where you and the other driver can get out of the car., If the other car does not pull over, try to view and remember their license plate once you are stopped on the side of the road. Write the license plate number down as soon as you can.

,, You will want to address any injuries when you call the Emergency Services, if paramedics need to be called.

, If there is any worry that harm may have been caused, the police will serve as a neutral third-party and document the scene of the accident. If the other person drove off, you can tell them the license number when they arrive.


There are cases when the fender bender is so minor that the parties skip this step and simply exchange car insurance information. Consider this only if both sides agree to it and there doesn’t seem to be any risk of injury.

, Some good Samaritans and pedestrians will pull over to see if everyone is ok after an accident. You will want to ask them to stay in order to give a statement to the police.

, Take a few deep breaths and try to avoid anger in your next interactions. Staying calm will reduce the likelihood of other altercations.

, Don’t admit fault if you are unsure about the accident situations.

, Grab your insurance information from your car or wallet. Also, grab a cell phone or pen and paper that you can use to write down the other driver’s insurance information.


If the driver is uninsured, ask for their name, driver’s license number, license plate number, address and contact number. They will face legal consequences and you can report this information to the police.
Do not accept any arrangement whereby money exchanges hands without notifying insurance companies, even if you are not at fault.

, You can submit these photos to your insurance company. The police are likely to take their own photos if they have been called.


Don’t put yourself in the way of traffic to take the photos.

, Arrange to pick up a copy of the police report. Make a note of the police officer’s name, precinct and badge number so that you can follow up., Don’t leave abruptly, or it may appear you are trying to run away from the situation.

, Look on your insurance card for an “in case of accident/claim” number. You may want to program this number into your phone for easy access.


Calling your insurance company to report an accident will protect your property, but it will also give your insurance company a chance to prepare to argue on your behalf.

Roll to safety.,
Avoid dangerous objects.,
Practice falling in a safe environment to become an expert it types of rolling.,
Look down and assess the situation.,
Relax.,
Protect your face and head when falling.,
Fall into a triangle pose.",How to Fall Without Hurting Yourself1," When you are falling, you can reduce the chance of injury by tucking yourself into a ball and rolling.Not only will this tuck in your fragile body parts, but it will also reduce the impact your body will take when it hits the ground. There are various techniques to rolling successfully.


For a gymnastic roll, you want to place your hands in front of your body and tuck your chin down. Use your falling momentum to roll. You want to make sure you keep your body symmetrical as to avoid injury. This type of roll, when done correctly, may even carry you into a standing position.A second type of roll is a parkour or asymmetric roll. The trick to this roll is to try and take the brunt of your fall with your shoulder before you begin the roll. Your goal is roll along your back in a diagonal fashion. This type of roll is preferable by martial arts and parkour experts as it protects your hands and vertebra.;
, If you are falling and you see dangerous items like broken glass or sharp objects, try and propel yourself away as you fall by pushing yourself or rolling.If you can not avoid these dangerous objects, protect your face by covering it with your arms.

, You can visit a gym or a martial arts studio to practice falling on soft mats and padded floors. Just like anything in life, falling without hurting yourself will take practice! Minimize damage to yourself by practicing in a safe environment first.

, If you are falling straight down, called a vertical fall, it is best if you look below and calculate your landing. You can look for a safer place to fall, or warn people if they are below you.There are also a number of techniques parachutists use in vertical falls to aid in safer landings.Land on the ball of your feet and twist your body away from the direction of momentum. Try and press your knees together.
Once you hit the ground, bend and twist so that your calf and your thigh muscles will hit the ground before your head and shoulders.
Ensure that your head remains as tucked into your chest as tightly as possible. You want to avoid head and neck injuries at all cost.

, Humans have an innate fear of falling. However, it is best if you try and relax your limbs, especially your legs, when you fall. Tensing your muscles can cause more of an impact, increase resistance and torsion and therefore, cause more injuries.If you are falling backward, attempt to bend your knees and curve your back. This will help you relax before impact, minimizing jarring movements. If you are falling to the side, curve upward to avoid slamming your head into the ground. Keep your body relaxed and breathe to avoid tensing muscles before impact.

, Never try to break your fall! To protect your head from impact, keep your chin up and protect yourself with your arms.A common source of injury during falls is a laceration on the tongue from biting into it. Throughout the fall, try to keep your tongue planted on the floor of your mouth, tucked up behind your lower teeth, so that the impact does not cause your jaws to close on it and injure it.

, To avoid smashing your face or groin into the ground, try a triangle pose. This is a front fall designed by police officers. You want to maximise the surface area when you hit the ground by falling with your hands above your head in a triangle shape. Place your feet equi-distant apart and try and land on your toes (kind of like a push up position). "

Get yourself to safety.,
Check yourself and others for injuries.,
Remain calm.,
Report the accident to local law enforcement.,
Do not leave the scene.,
Take photos of the scene.,
Obtain information from any witnesses who are willing to provide it.,
Contact your insurance company.,
Do not admit fault for the accident to anyone.,
Contact an attorney.,
Follow your doctor's orders.,
Maximize your insurance claim entitlement.,
Wear protective gear.,
Never operate a motorcycle while intoxicated.,
Adjust your riding style to weather/road conditions.,
Exercise caution and good judgment.,
Ride defensively and be vigilant.,
Avoid situations beyond your level of comfort and skill.",How to Handle Yourself After a Motorcycle Accident," The first thing you should do after an accident is remove yourself from harm's way by getting off the roadway and out of traffic. Distance yourself from anything that may cause you additional harm, such as:


A vehicle that is leaking gasoline.
A vehicle or structure that is on fire.
Damaged structures that could collapse.
Roadside cliffs or drop-offs.;
, Call 9-1-1 immediately if you or anyone else involved in the accident is hurt. Very few motorcyclists walk away from accidents without some kind of injury, and some of the most serious injuries are not readily identifiable. As such, you should seek medical attention even if you believe you are not hurt.Although less common than injuries to the lower and upper extremities, injuries to the chest and abdomen from motorcycle crashes tend to be more serious.This is due to the potential for organ damage and/or internal bleeding from blunt-force impact to the midsection.
Lower extremity injuries are the most common type of motorcycle crash-related injury.These often involve bone fractures and are usually not fatal if dealt with properly by medical professionals.

, Although it may be difficult to maintain a calm demeanor when you have just been involved in a motorcycle accident, it is important that you do not do or say anything that could make the situation worse in any way or indicate culpability. For example, do not:Argue with other parties involved in the accident.
Assign blame for the accident.
Physically engage others in a hostile manner.
Intentionally inflict additional damage to property.

, This is only necessary if emergency services (9-1-1) were not contacted. Except in very minor incidents (such as those that result in no injuries and minimal property damage), law enforcement may be needed involved in order to:


Control traffic.
Record details of the accident.
Determine whether immediate legal action is required.

, It is important that you remain at the site of the accident long enough to exchange relevant information with all parties involved and/or law enforcement officials. At a minimum, you should obtain the following details:


Property damage information in the form of photographs or written descriptions.
Insurance and/or contact information from all parties involved.
Identifying information for the vehicles involved, such as make, model, and year.

, If you have a working cell phone or camera with you, take pictures of the scene and the damage to the vehicles or other property involved so there is contextual evidence of the details of the incident.


Do not perform this step if doing so will put you or others at risk of injury or cause further property damage.
Be sure to capture information about your surroundings, such as street signs or nearby buildings.

, This could include anything from a name to a written description of what they saw. If you end up in a legal dispute regarding the events of the accident, a witness' account of the incident could be useful in arguing your case.


Don't pressure witnesses to say or do anything they don't want to do. Some might be willing to make a statement to police but won't want to be asked to testify in court or be harassed by insurance companies.
At a minimum, take down voluntary witnesses' names and phone numbers so you or your representative can get in touch with them later. Again, make sure it's okay with them that they be contacted.

, As soon after the accident as you are able, you need to inform your insurance company of the incident.Provide the agent with all relevant information you collected at the scene, such as the names of the parties involved, the make, model, and year of all vehicles involved, and the names and contact information of any witnesses.
If you are asked about your injuries and/or damage to your vehicle, say that you will furnish these details once you have had your injuries assessed by a doctor and your motorcycle's damage assessed by a mechanic. This will help ensure that you do not underestimate compensation to which you may ultimately be entitled.

, This includes other parties involved in the incident, law enforcement officers, and insurance company representatives. This will help you avoid being blamed for anything that was not your fault and will keep your insurance company from inappropriately denying your claim.It is best to simply limit who you speak to regarding details of the accident. Even simple statements such as ""I'm okay"" can be used against you later if you end up seeking compensation for your injuries.
If an attorney is assisting you in handling your accident, direct inquiries surrounding the incident to him or her.
Never lie about your role in an accident, especially to law enforcement or your insurance company.

, Many lawyers specialize in motorcycle accident cases. It may be in your financial and legal best interests to acquire assistance dealing with your situation. The following are good reasons to seek legal advice:You were wrongly accused of being at fault by other parties involved in the accident.
Your insurance claim was denied.
Your damages (medical or otherwise) exceed the limits of your insurance coverage.
You incurred severe physical injuries and associated costs as a result of your accident.

, If you were injured in your accident and received medical care, your doctor likely gave you instructions or recommendations for your rehabilitation. In order to heal from your injuries and minimize any lasting effects, be sure to do exactly as your physician says.


Follow up with your doctor as recommended.
Adhere to instructions for prescribed medications.
Follow through with prescribed therapies or procedures.

, Even if your injuries and/or damage to your motorcycle seem minor, be sure you are not undercompensated in an accident that is someone else's fault. Here are a few things to consider before agreeing to an insurance claim settlement:Some injuries have long-term impacts. You should have a doctor conduct a thorough assessment of your injuries and inform you of any potentially long lasting issues. These should be factored into your claim.
Compensation can extend beyond medical care and vehicle repair. If you lose wages from an inability to work, are stuck with hefty transportation costs associated with your medical care, or encounter any other expenses associated with your accident, you should build these costs into your claim.
You cannot re-open a claim once a settlement is finalized. This is a good reason do it right the first time. Be thorough in assessing damages and asking for the compensation you deserve so you don't end up getting short-changed.

, Always wear a helmet, a thick jacket, pants, and padded gloves when riding a motorcycle, whether you are the driver or a passenger. You are very exposed on a motorcycle, so wearing protective equipment (even if your state does not legally require it) will minimize your injuries and could save your life should you become involved in an accident.Motorcyclists wearing helmets are 40% less likely to die of a head injury in a crash.
Motorcyclists wearing helmets are 15% less likely to suffer nonfatal injuries in a crash.

, You are much more likely to get into an accident if you ride while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Alcohol consumption reduces reaction speed, affects balance, and impairs judgment.You are putting yourself and others at increased risk of injury or death by riding under the influence. It's also illegal!


Statistics show that 29% of motorcycle crash fatalities involved a rider with a blood alcohol level above the national legal limit (which is 0.08%).One third of motorcycle accidents are the result of a rider being under the influence of alcohol.Motorcyclists aged 20 to 24 years experience a higher rate of alcohol-related crashes than any other age group., It is easy to lose control of your motorcycle in poor weather, especially in precipitation or conditions of reduced visibility. It can be difficult to come to a quick stop on a wet road, which increases your chances of having an accident.


Reduce your speed in bad weather. This will allow you extra time to react to unexpected situations and will reduce the time and distance it takes to slow or stop your motorcycle.
Keep a wide breadth when passing or following other vehicles. You can't predict what other drivers will do, and they are even less likely to be aware of you if visibility and/or weather conditions are poor. You will have more time to react if you keep your distance.
Turn carefully. You are more likely to lose traction in corners and crash if road conditions are wet or icy. Reduce this risk by slowing down and staying as upright as possible when turning or cornering in bad weather.

, This means obeying traffic laws, adhering to posted road signs, and avoiding risky maneuvers. Many motorcycle accidents are attributed to reckless behavior on the part of the motorcyclist, meaning they are easily avoidable with common sense.


Do not speed. More than a third of motorcycle accidents are at least partially attributable to excessive speed on the part of the motorcyclist.Speeding reduces control, increases necessary stopping distance/time, and increases the likelihood that a crash will be fatal.
Always signal when turning or merging. Failure to use turn signals when merging or turning on a motorcycle increases the likelihood that another motorist will accidentally hit you. Motorcycles are hard enough to see as it is; make yourself as visible as possible!
Do not ""split lanes."" This practice (riding between two designated traffic lanes) exposes motorcyclists to the increased possibility that another motorist could unknowingly merge into them. By staying within the designated lanes, you are much less likely to be accidentally struck by a merging vehicle.

, Many motorcycle crashes are the result of reckless or aggressive driving by other motorists. It can also be difficult for the driver of a car to see a motorcycle. Cars merging or turning suddenly, for example, pose significant risk to motorcyclists.Use your horn and lights. You can make your presence known to other motorists by using your horn if they get too close or start to merge into you. By having your headlight and brake light on, you will be more easily seen by other motorists.
Scan traffic far ahead of you so you can be prepared to slow or brake your motorcycle if necessary. If you see a lot of brake lights or road obstructions up ahead, you can anticipate necessary actions and slow down early to avoid rear-end collisions.

, Inexperienced motorcyclists are more likely to get into accidents, especially in busy traffic or when road conditions are dangerous. Knowing your limits could save your life!


Stick to roads with lower speed limits and less traffic, such as surface streets and highways, until you are used to your motorcycle and have a high degree of control while riding.
Do not assume that a friend's motorcycle will handle the same as yours, or your new bike will be similar to your old one. Every motorcycle is different in terms of handling, weight, traction, acceleration, and braking. Until you are comfortable on that particular bike, exercise extra caution.

Put on a pair of everyday shoes.,
Relax your arms and let them hang down over the crutches.

,
Adjust the crutches so that at least 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) separate armpit and crutch pad.,
Adjust the crutches further to accommodate the hand grips.,
Make any final accommodations for comfort.",How to Fit Crutches1," Your shoes should have low heels and good support. In fitting, try to use the same shoes you'd ordinarily use walking around, or ones you anticipate using with crutches.;
,, This is where many people get things wrong, thinking that the crutch pad should sit right beneath the armpit. In fact, there should be enough space so that the crutch pad doesn't touch the armpit unless the user leans down slightly. Crutches are designed to get support from the arms and ribcage, not from the shoulders.


If your crutches don't have notches to perfectly accommodate the two inch gap between armpit and pad, opt for the lower setting instead of the higher setting. Higher-set crutches may have a higher likelihood of dislocating the shoulder. This will also stop you from leaning on your crutches when you don't have to.

, With your hands hanging relaxed at your sides and standing upright, the crutches' handgrips should be level with your wrist crease.

, Crutches are meant to deliver additional support to ailing legs and, as such, can be used more or less properly. Accommodations, however, may be made in order to help the subject feel comfortable.

Prepare for trial.",How to File a Personal Injury Lawsuit," As soon as is practicable after the accident, write an account of it while your memory is still fresh.Keep a running log of what happens to you following the accident or any actions you take, including phone calls, doctor's appointments, lost work or wages, property repairs, and anything else you missed out on because of the injury.;
, Auto insurance may pay for injuries from auto accidents, while property liability insurance may pay for injuries that occurred on someone else's property.


Finding an insurance policy can help you figure out if you actually stand any chance of collecting monetary damages from your lawsuit. While you may go to court and a judge or jury may find the defendant liable for your injuries, if the individual is broke you may never see a dime., As soon as you can, take photos of your injuries and the place where you were injured, and document any other damage or important information.For example, if you tripped and fell on a sidewalk, make sure you take pictures of the place where you tripped. Take pictures all around and from all angles so your lawyer can use them later if the defendant attempts to alter the scene, such as by putting up a sign after your accident that warns pedestrians of the dip in the sidewalk.
You also should take pictures of all injuries and property damage as soon as possible after the accident. If you have physical injuries, consider taking pictures every few days as they heal.
Try to preserve any physical evidence, but if you can't preserve it as it is, take a picture. For example, if your car was damaged, take pictures of the damage before you get it fixed.
Bring along a witness to testify to the date and time when the photographs were made, or use a camera that time-stamps all photos., If anyone happened to see the accident, make sure you have their name and phone number or some way to get in touch with them if you need them to testify later.


When you speak to anyone about the accident, take notes of the conversation or record it if you can, and make note of the date and time you talked to them., Since personal injury lawyers typically work on contingency, there's no real reason why you shouldn't hire an attorney to help guide your claim through the system.


You can have an attorney review your claim at no charge. Talk to friends and family or visit your local bar association's website to find an attorney who has expertise in the type of claim you have.
For example, if you were injured in a car accident, you don't necessarily want to hire an attorney who specializes in slip-and-fall cases.
When you first speak with the attorney, find out how long she's been practicing, what kind of experience she has with your kind of claim, and the results she's gotten with claims like yours in the past.If you are looking to sue a business or an insurance company, they no doubt have their own attorneys, and although you could attempt to settle a claim on your own, you may find you get better deal by having an attorney on your side.Before you hire an attorney, make sure you're comfortable talking to and working with her, and that you understand how her office operates. For example, if you would prefer a hands-on attorney who is personally available to you, make sure the attorney you've chosen won't be farming out a lot of the work on your case to a paralegal or other staff member., As soon as you figure out who might be liable, let them know that you plan on filing a claim for any injuries or property damage.


Because you have a legal deadline, usually about a year, to file a lawsuit against the person or company you believe is liable for your injuries, you should notify them of your intentions as soon as possible after the accident occurs.Depending on the type of accident, you may have to notify different types of people or companies.If you don't have an attorney, send a formal notification letter to every individual or company you think might be responsible for your injuries as soon as possible. Keep it short and simple, stating only that an accident happened at a particular date and time, that you were injured, and that you believe they are responsible. Give them a deadline to respond back to you in writing., Your attorney may send a demand letter to potential defendants or to their insurances companies, letting them know how much money you will accept to resolve the claim.


If there is an insurance company, you or your attorney may receive a settlement offer. If you receive a settlement offer from an insurance company and you don't yet have an attorney, consider having an attorney look over the settlement offer before you sign it to make sure your rights are fully protected.

, If you and the defendant cannot come to an agreement on a settlement of your claims, your attorney may file a complaint in the appropriate court.


The complaint first identifies you and the defendant or defendants. It then tells the court that on a particular date and time, you suffered injuries as a result of an accident that either occurred on the defendant's property or because of the defendant's negligent or intentional acts, and asks the court to grant you relief in the form of monetary damages for your injuries.Once a complaint is filed and the defendant is served, the lawsuit is set in motion., If you haven't already, make sure your attorney has all the information you have, as this will assist her in preparing your case.


After the complaint is filed, the case enters a pre-trial stage known as ""discovery,"" during which both sides share evidence and witness information.
During discovery, you may need to appear in court periodically to inform the judge of the status of the case.Depending on the amount of money at stake and the complexity of your case, the discovery process could take anywhere from six months to a year or more., The defendant will have the opportunity to file interrogatories and requests for production. These documents are composed of lists of questions you answer either through your own testimony or by giving documents to the defendant.For example, the defendant may ask for all medical records associated with your injury.

, Both your attorney and the defendant's attorney may take depositions, which are live interviews with witnesses or parties to the case.


Depositions are taken under oath with a court reporter present to transcribe the entire interview word for word.
During the deposition, both sides will have the opportunity to ask questions of the person being deposed., If you and the defendant have reached an impasse in discussions, a neutral third party may be able to help you find common ground for settlement through mediation.


Mediation is less expensive and less formal than a trial. Rather than deciding who's right and who's wrong, mediators are focused on arriving at a compromise with which all parties are comfortable.Although some cases may settle before a complaint is even filed, it is more likely that you and the defendant will reach settlement after the discovery process has gone on for awhile and both of you have a better idea about the other's case., If you are unable to settle your case, you and your attorney will prepare for a formal trial in court to resolve your claim.

Wash your hands.,
Wash the wound with water and mild soap.,
Place a cold compress on the split.,
Assess the injury.,
Dab on a topical analgesic ointment.,
Apply a liquid bandage.,
Seek emergency treatment.",How to Heal a Split Lip1," Before you touch your face or injured lip, place your hands under warm water for at least 20 seconds and lather them up with soap. If you are outside and without water access, run an alcohol wipe over your hands before proceeding. This minimizes the germs that could transfer from your fingertips to the cut., Place your lip under the faucet and let the water run into the split area, cleansing it of dirt or debris. Apply a bit of microbial soap to a cotton swab or ball and gently dab the injured area. Wash the soap away with water. Avoid scrubbing the split spot or you may cause it to break open further.Be aware that lip wounds that are not properly cleaned are more likely to scar or require further treatment., If your mouth or lips feel swollen or bruised, put a small ice back on the area for a few minutes until the swelling begins to subside. If you can’t find an ice pack, a clean hand towel run under cold water has the same effect. Give children a popsicle to suck on to numb the pain and minimize bleeding.The cold should also minimize bleeding, so that you can take a closer look at your injury. If the wound does not stop bleeding after a few rounds of cold compresses and mild pressure, then reach out to your doctor.
Avoid putting an ice cube directly on your lip, as it can damage the surrounding skin. Likewise, don’t hold a cold compress onto your lips for more than a few minutes at a time., Now that you can see clearly into the split area, get in front of a mirror and try to assess the depth and extent of the injury. If the cut is very deep and you are worried about it not closing fully or properly, then contact your doctor for advice. If the cut impacts your ability to speak or involves a dental injury, then a visit to the dentist may be in order. If you decide to treat the injury yourself, then reassess it every day., Once you are satisfied that the split is clean, protect the area from infection by applying a small amount of analgesic or antibiotic ointment. Place a pea-sized amount of the ointment on a cotton swab and then apply it to the split. Reapply as directed on the package.The salicylic acid in analgesic ointments will reduce the itching if your lip is split due to an insect bite. Look for ointments with aloe vera or eucalyptus for even more healing help.

, If the cut is shallow enough for you to treat, then purchase a plastic skin bandage kit. Shake the bottle and swipe on a thin layer of liquid bandaging. Aim for a thin coating of the injured area. Apply a second coat after the first one dries. The liquid bandage will be flexible enough to accommodate your split healing and should last for a week.Keep the applied layers thin or they will peel off.

, If the split is deep enough so that the two sides cannot easily come together, then you may need stitches. If the split is located in the corner of your mouth and continues to bleed without stopping after ten minutes of pressure, then a doctor should assess the injury. The same goes if you are concerned that an object or debris may be located in the wound.Be aware that if the split was caused by an object injury, then you might need to receive a tetanus shot. Check with medical professionals ASAP if this is the case."

Dry hair shampoo. This is a great item if you aren't able to lift your arm fully or get your cast wet. You simply spray it on the roots of your hair and massage it in. It's a quick way to get your hair looking freshly washed, and it won't stain your clothing.If you have the ability, you can even go to a salon for regular hair washing. Some salons may give you a discount if you are only going to have your hair washed.

, One of the most annoying problems with a cast can be situating yourself in bed. For example, it's hard to turn over when you can only use one arm. It can also be painful to keep your broken arm in one position all night.


Try instead to prop your arm up with pillows. You can even build yourself a pillow fortress to make sure you don't roll over onto your arm during the night., If you don't have someone with you to help you cut food, you may have a slight struggle on your hands. However, if you are alone, you can problem solve by eating foods that only require a spoon or fork - or foods soft enough to be cut with either.


You can also use food delivery services like Blue Apron or Fresh Direct which will not only save you from having to carry groceries but also do the food prep for you. A lot of their meals come pre-portioned, so rather than trying to cut up and measure ingredients, you can get straight to the cooking.
If you get really desperate, though, try a pizza cutter instead of a knife.

, It's hard to zip or button up with only one hand. Though it can be done with practice and time, you don't want to exhaust your injured arm in the process.


Try wearing pants with elastic bands, instead. You should also make sure you are wearing shirts that you can fit over your cast.
It’s also a good idea to get dressed cast arm first, so you know what you picked out will work.

Assess your bones.,
Wear protective equipment.,
Buy the right safety equipment.",How to Fall Without Hurting Yourself2," A common injury in falls is broken bones. Broken hips and arms are especially common in the elderly. You may experience pain or swelling. You may hear grinding, snapping, or creaking. . If you think you have broken a bone due to a fall, call EMS and contact your doctor immediately.

, If you are doing something that has a high risk of falling (biking, hiking, construction, manual labor, etc) make sure you wear the proper protective equipment to help minimize risk of injury. These may include helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, and mouthguards.

, You can hurt yourself if you wear ill-fitting equipment or use the equipment incorrectly. Know how and what to buy — and how to wear it — when doing a particular task like renovation or construction work."

Look for established paths and safety items.,
Keep your environment clear of hazards.",How to Fall Without Hurting Yourself3," If you do not have to be out inclement weather, try your best to avoid it. If you live in a climate when you get ice and snow, tune in daily or hourly to get an updated look at conditions. This will help you dress properly and minimize fall risk.

, Does your morning commute include walking up a steep hill? If it does, you might want to find an alternative route if that hill is prone to getting slippery in the rain or snow. Practice driving or walking various routes to find the safest conditions.

, People can sometimes have a lot on their minds and may not be paying attention to their surroundings. Avoid falling by looking out for uneven ground, broken terrain, curbs, and other hazards., Make sure you aware appropriate clothing and footwear in order to ensure that you do not accidentally fall. This may include rain boots for wet conditions, or sturdy footwear. Women should avoid wearing high heels if walking in soft terrain., Look for safety rails and ramps to assist you in walking or climbing. Be aware of signs that state warnings of dangerous areas or terrain., You can face falling hazards in your home. You may trip over a pet or an item that is out place. Make sure that items such as pet bowls and shoes are put away to avoid accidental falling. Establish a house cleaning routine to keep your living space free of clutter.

Put on a pair of everyday shoes.,
Stand up as straight as possible and let your arms fall down to your sides, relaxed.

,
Take the forearm crutch and fit the hand grip so that it falls in line with your wrist joint.,
Fit the arm cuff mid-way up your forearm.",How to Fit Crutches2," Go with shoes you'll likely have on when you use the crutches.

,, Correctly fitted, the wrist grip should line up roughly with where you usually wear a watch.

, The half-circle or V-shaped cuff should sit halfway between your wrist and elbow. They shouldn't push your shoulders up when holding or make you hunch over.


This sizing is important because you'll want a 15 - 30 degree bend in your arms when using the crutches. Sizing correctly will give your arms and shoulders their full range of motion, allowing you to consistently plant the crutches at 30 degree angles.

Get comfortable going up and down stairs.,
Cushion the crutch pad to make it more comfortable and reduce the possibility of nerve damage.",How to Fit Crutches3," In most injury or assistance situations, your doctor or physical therapist will give you a pair of crutches and explain how to use them. In the unlikely case that you get to choose which kind of crutches you want to use, here's a breakdown of what each crutch is good at and not so good at.


Underarm crutches:

Usually for temporary use involving injury
Less upper-body mobility, but more overall mobility
More difficult to use and may involve risk of nerve damage in the axilla (underarm)


Forearm crutches:

Usually for long-term use involving ongoing leg weaknessOffers more upper-body mobility than underarm crutches
Allows patients use of forearms without setting crutches down



, Plant your crutches 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.5 cm) in front of you, squeezing on your ribs and upper arms. Pushing down on the hand grips and not on your underarms, take a step with your weaker leg. Follow with your stronger leg. Repeat.

, Hold both crutches by the hand grips in one hand while pushing up with the other hand on the chair. Put one crutch under each arm and proceed as normal.

, Place both crutches in one hand holding the hand grips together and reach for the chair with your other hand to lower yourself down slowly. This is essentially reversing the process of standing up.

, Whenever possible, use a handrail when going up and down stairs. Place one crutch under one arm and use the handrail with the other arm for support.


Going up stairs: step up with the stronger leg, then the sore leg, and lastly bring up the crutch.
Going down stairs: lower crutch down to the step, move your sore leg down and then bring your stronger leg down. Make sure the crutch tip is completely on the stair

, Take an old sweatshirt or even a memory foam pad and fit it above the crutch pad for a little extra cushion. Even with extra padding, medical professionals advise against leaning on the crutch pads with your underarms.

Apply a turmeric paste.,
Avoid irritating foods.,
Keep your fingers and tongue away.,
Talk with your doctor or dentist.",How to Heal a Split Lip2," In a small bowl, mix together three teaspoons of baking soda and one teaspoon of distilled water. Stir until a thick paste forms. Dip the cotton swab into the paste and then apply a layer onto the injured area. Let it sit for 3-5 minutes. Rinse off with water. Repeat as needed to minimize pain and swelling., In a small bowl, place a cup of lukewarm water and a tablespoon of salt. Dip a cotton ball or swab into the solution and then apply it to the injured lip. It will sting or burn slightly. Repeat as desired.The salt will help to reduced inflammation and counter infection in the split area.

, In a small bowl, place three teaspoons of turmeric powder. Add teaspoons of water until a thick paste forms. Use a cotton swab to apply this paste directly onto the split. Let it sit for 3-5 minutes and then rinse off with cool water.The turmeric helps to kill off any nasty bacteria in the wound.

, Be aware that as your lip heals it will be particularly sensitive to salty, spicy, or citrusy foods. Stay away from orange juice or hot wings, for example, unless you want to experience some stinging. Eating these items may also cause the lips to swell up again, which can extend the healing process., The more that you lick the area, the more that it will dry out and crack. You may also create a cold sore within, or next to, the split. Try to avoid the temptation to pick at or explore the injured area with your fingers, too. You could deepen the wound or introduce it to harmful bacteria., If the cut begins to redden or increases in soreness after your initial treatment, then reach to your doctor, as you could have an infection. Or, if your teeth are increasingly painful, then talk with your dentist, as you could have sustained a dental injury. A medical professional can also help you if you are suffering from persistent mouth dryness and cracked lips."

Apply lip balm.,
Increase your water intake.,
Use a humidifier.,
Monitor your medications.,
Take a multivitamin.",How to Heal a Split Lip3," After your lip has healed, buy a non-medicated, beeswax-based, unflavored lip balm and apply it frequently. It’s even better if the balm contains lanolin or petroleum. Some lip balms even have an SPF rating and can help protect your lips from dryness caused by sun exposure.Don’t use lip balm from a pot as it can lead to infection due to bacteria., To keep your entire body hydrated, and avoid cracked and split lips, drink at least eight glasses of water per day. To promote healing of a split lip, boosting your water intake up by a few glasses might even help., Wintery and cold weather can create dry conditions that will cause your lips to crack. These cracks can then turn into deep splits. To counter this pattern, use a humidifier in your room at night. Or, install a humidistat device on your interior heating and cooling system.This is especially a good idea if you are a known mouth-sleeper, which can dry out your lips even more., If you suffer from continue split lips, it could be that your medications are to blame. Read all of the warning labels for your meds, looking for any cautions against dryness. If you see something that concerns you, talk with your doctor about medication alternatives.For example, some acne medications dry up the moisture and oils on your entire face, including your lips.

, Split lips are often a sign of a vitamin deficiency. To counter this problem, take a quality multivitamin each day that contains iron and zinc. B9 (folate) and other B vitamins can also promote skin healing. Try out a few different vitamin combinations, with the guidance of your doctor, to see what works the best for you."

Understand the importance of injury prevention.,
Learn the basics of what to do with certain basic injuries, such as broken bones, cuts, etc.

",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Injury Prevention," In order to spread the message, it is important to know the facts. The basics are:


Many serious injuries can be prevented if parents and other caregivers supervise children carefully and keep their environment safe.
Young children are at risk on or near roads. They should not play on or near the road and should always have someone older with them when they are near or crossing a road. They should wear a helmet when on a bicycle or motorcycle and should be securely strapped into an age-appropriate child restraint when being transported in a vehicle.
Children can drown in less than two minutes and in a very small amount of water, even in a bathtub. They should never be left alone in or near water.
Burns can be prevented by keeping children away from fires, cooking stoves, hot liquids and foods, and exposed electric wires.
Falls are a major cause of injury for young children. Stairs, balconies, roofs, windows, and play and sleeping areas should be made secure, using barriers with vertical bars to protect children from falling.
Medicines, poisons, insecticides, bleach, acids and liquid fertilizers and fuels, such as paraffin (kerosene), should be stored carefully out of children's sight and reach. Dangerous substances should be stored in clearly marked containers and never in drinking bottles. Child-resistant closures, where available, should be used on the containers of poisonous products.
Knives, scissors, sharp or pointed objects and broken glass can cause serious injuries. These objects should be kept out of children's reach. Plastic bags, which can cause suffocation, should be kept away from young children.
Young children like to put things in their mouths. To prevent choking, small objects, such as coins, nuts and buttons, should be kept out of their reach. Children's foods should be cut into small pieces that can be easily chewed and swallowed.;

Wash your hands.,
Stop the bleeding, if necessary.,
Clean the wound and the surrounding area.,
Sterilize the wound with antiseptic.,
Put an antibiotic on the wound.,
Dress the wound with a bandage.,
Seek medical help, if necessary.,
Monitor the wound until it heals.",How to Disinfect a Wound1," Soap and water are all you need. Work up a good lather. Then, rub your hands together long enough to sing the “Happy Birthday” song. Make sure you get the backs of your hands, fingertips, and under your fingernails, if possible. Dry your hands thoroughly with a clean towel., If the wound hasn't stopped bleeding on its own, place a sterile bandage over it and apply direct pressure. Elevate it above the level of your heart. This will direct the blood flow away from the injury point.If you can't raise the wound, apply pressure to a pressure point on the wrist, bicep, at the top of the thigh, or behind the knee.If the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure and elevation, seek medical assistance. Call emergency services if you can't get transportation to the emergency room., Rinse the wound with clean water. This can be either under a faucet or a container filled with water. Use a soapy washcloth to clean around the wound. Avoid getting soap in the wound, as it could cause irritation. Rinse the area with clean water and dry it with a clean towel or cloth.Alternatively, you could clean the wound with salt water and a piece of gauze. Dip the gauze in the salt water and gently blot the wound with it.If any dirt or debris is in the wound, try to remove it with a pair of sterilized tweezers. Seek medical help if any dirt is too deep for you to reach., This can be rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. Apply a couple of drops to a cotton ball. Gently blot the wound with the cotton ball, being careful not to get any stray cotton in the wound., This can be ointment like Neosporin. Apply a pea-sized dollop to a cotton swab. Cover the wound with the antibiotic., An adhesive bandage or a piece of gauze and medical tape will work. Keep the dressing dry. Change it at least daily, especially after bathing. This will allow the wound to heal and lower your risk of developing an infection., Go to your doctor or the emergency room if you have a deep cut or puncture wound. Tell them exactly how you were wounded. They'll take steps to better sterilize your wound. You'll likely get stitches if your wound is deep enough. Expect a tetanus shot for a puncture wound., When you change the dressing, make sure the wound is developing a scab and gradually shrinking. Look for redness, swelling, or drainage. If you see any of these signs or if the wound is not healing, seek medical help. You should also contact your doctor if you feel pain (beyond minor stinging) or warmth around the wound."

Your experience of pain and depends on the severity of your finger fracture. After sustaining an injury to your finger, treat it carefully and keep an eye on your pain levels.It can be hard to identify if you have a finger fracture right away, because acute pain and tenderness are also symptoms of dislocations and sprains.
Look for other symptoms and/or seek medical attention if you are unsure of the severity of your injury.;
, After sustaining a fracture to your finger, you will notice acute pain that is followed by swelling or bruising. This is part of your body’s natural response to injury. After fracture, your body activates the inflammatory response followed by swelling caused by fluid released into the surrounding tissues.Swelling is often followed by bruising. This happens when the capillaries around the injury swell or burst in response to the increased fluid pressure.It may be hard to know if your finger is fractured at first, as you still may be able to move it. After you try to move your finger, swelling and bruising begin to become apparent. The swelling may also spread to other fingers or down the palm of the hand.
You are likely to notice swelling and bruising 5-10 minutes after your first sensations of pain in your finger.
However, minor swelling or the absence of immediate bruising may be indicative of a sprain instead of a fracture.

, A finger fracture consists of a segment of the bone that is cracked or broken in one or more places. The bone deformity can show up as unusual bumps on the finger or a finger that points in a different direction.If there are signs of misalignment, the finger is probably broken.
You usually cannot move your finger if it is fractured because one or more sections of the bone are no longer connected.
It is also likely that swelling and bruising makes your finger too stiff to move comfortably following the injury.

, Go to your nearest accident and emergency department if you think you have a finger fracture. Fractures are complicated injuries and their severity is not readily apparent from external symptoms. Some fractures require more involved treatment in order to heal correctly. If you aren't sure whether an injury is a fracture, it's better to err on the side of caution and see a doctor.If you have significant pain, swelling, bruising, or any deformity or decreased movement of your finger, seek medical attention.Children with finger injuries should always see a doctor. Young and growing bones are more susceptible to injury and to complications if those injuries aren't treated properly.
If your fracture is not treated by a medical professional, then it is possible that your finger and hand will remain painfully stiff when you try to move your finger.
A bone that re-knits out of proper alignment can further hinder your successful use of your hand.

, If you suspect a finger fracture, seek medical attention. During a physical exam, your doctor evaluates your injury and determines the severity of your fracture.Your doctor will take a note of your finger’s range of motion by asking you to make a fist. She will also look for visual signs, such as swelling, bruising, and bone deformities.
Your doctor will also manually examine your finger to look for signs of reduced blood flow to the area and nerve impingement.

, If your doctor cannot determine during a physical exam whether you have a fractured finger, she may recommend an imaging test to diagnose the fracture. These include X-ray, CT scan or an MRI.


X-rays are often the first imaging tests used to diagnose a fracture. Your doctor places your fractured finger between an X-ray source and an X-ray detector, then sends low-level radiation waves through your finger to create the image. This process is completed within a few minutes and is painless.A CT or computed tomography scan is constructed by putting together X-rays that scan different angles of an injury. Your doctor may decide to use a CT to create an image of your fracture if the initial X-ray’s results are inconclusive or if your doctor suspects that there are also soft tissue injuries related to the fracture.An MRI may be needed if your doctor suspects that you have a hairline or stress fracture, the kind of fracture that is produced after repeated injuries over time. MRIs produce finer details and can also help your doctor differentiate between soft tissue injuries and hairline fractures in your finger., Surgical consultations may be required if you have a severe fracture, such as a compound fracture. Some fractures are unstable and require surgery in order to put bone fragments back into place with aids (such as wires and screws) so that the bone can heal properly.Any fracture that seriously hinders mobility and puts the hand far out of alignment likely requires surgery in order for the finger to regain articulate movement.
You may be surprised at how difficult it is to execute everyday tasks without full use of all of your fingers. Professionals such as chiropractors, surgeons, artists, and mechanics require full use of their fine motor skills in order to accurately perform their jobs. Thus, caring for finger fractures is vital.

, Manage the swelling and pain by icing, compressing, and elevating the finger. The faster after the injury you give this type of first aid, the better. Make sure that you are also resting your finger.Ice the finger. Wrap a bag of frozen vegetables or an icepack in a thin towel and apply it gently to your finger to help reduce your swelling and pain. Apply ice immediately after you sustain the injury for no longer than 20 minutes as needed.
Compress the injury. Gently but securely wrap your finger with a soft elastic bandage to help manage the swelling and immobilize the finger. At your initial appointment with your doctor, ask if it is appropriate to keep your finger wrapped in order to reduce your risk of bringing on additional swelling and to keep from impeding movement of other fingers.
Elevate the hand. When possible, keep your finger elevated above your heart. You may find it most comfortable to sit on a couch with your legs over the cushions and your wrist and fingers resting on the back of the couch.
You also should not use the injured finger for everyday activities until cleared by your doctor.

, Splints are used to immobilize your fractured finger to keep it from developing further damage. A makeshift splint may be crafted out of a popsicle stick and a loose bandage until you get to the doctor for a better wrapping.The kind of splint you need varies according to which finger is fractured. Minor fractures may benefit from “buddy taping,” which consists of immobilizing the injured finger by taping it to the finger next to it.
A dorsal extension-block splint keeps your injured finger from bending backward. A soft splint is placed to keep your injured finger slightly and gently curved toward the palm and is held in place with soft fastenings.
An aluminum u-shaped splint is an inflexible aluminum splint that keeps the injured finger from extending. It is placed on the back of the injured finger to keep it immobile.In more severe cases, your doctor may apply an inflexible fiberglass splint that goes from your finger to past your wrist. It's essentially like a mini-cast for your finger.

, Surgery is required to properly treat and heal a fracture when immobilization and time cannot effectively fix it. In general, fractures that require surgery are more complicated than those that only require immobilization.A compound fracture, a fracture that is unstable, loose bone fragments, and a fracture that compromises a joint all require surgery because the broken pieces need to be guided back into place in order for the bone to heal in the right configuration.

, Your doctor may recommend you take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help manage pain associated with a broken finger. NSAIDs work by reducing negative effects of long term inflammation, and alleviating pain and pressure put on the nerves and associated tissues. NSAIDs do not inhibit the healing process.Common over-the-counter NSAID medications used for managing fracture pain include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). You can also take acetaminophen (Tylenol), but it is not an NSAID and does not reduce inflammation.Your doctor may also give you a codeine-based prescription medication for short term management if you experience major pain. The pain is more likely to be worse at the beginning of the healing process, and your doctor will reduce your prescription strength as the bone heals.

, Your doctor may instruct you to make a follow-up appointment a few weeks after your initial treatment. She may repeat X-rays 1-2 weeks after the injury to see how it's healing. Make sure you keep any follow-up appointments to ensure that you're on the mend.


If you have questions about your injury or anything else, contact your doctor's office.

, In general, fractured fingers heal very well after consultation with a doctor and a 4-6 week healing period. The risks for complications following a finger fracture are minimal, but it is still good for you to be aware of them:Joint stiffness may occur as a result of scar tissue forming around the fracture site. This can be addressed with physical therapy to strengthen the finger muscles and reduce the scar tissue.
A section of the finger bone may rotate during the healing process, resulting in a bony deformity that may need to be addressed by surgery to help you grasp things properly.
The two pieces of the bone may not fuse together properly, resulting in permanent instability within the fracture site. This is known as “nonunion.”
Skin infection may occur if there are lacerations to the fracture site and they are not properly cleaned prior to surgery.

, The human hand is made up of 27 bones: 8 in the wrist (carpal bones), 5 in the palm of the hand (metacarpal bones) and three sets of phalanges in the fingers (14 bones).The proximal phalanges are the longest part of the finger located closest to the palm of the hand. The intermediate, or middle, phalanges come next, and then the distal phalanges are the farthest out, forming the “tips” of the fingers.Acute injuries, such as falls, accidents, and sport injuries, are the most common causes for finger fractures. Your fingertips are one of the most injury-prone areas of your body because they are involved in almost every activity you partake in throughout the day. , Stable fractures are defined by a broken bone but little to no displacement at either end of the break. Also known as a nondisplaced fracture, stable fractures can be difficult to identify and may demonstrate symptoms similar to other forms of trauma., Any broken bone in which the two primary sides of the break are no longer touching or aligned is considered a displaced fracture.

, A fracture in which the broken bone has been displaced and a portion of it pushed through the skin is referred to as a compound fracture. Because of the severity of the damage to the bone and the surrounding tissue, this injury always requires immediate medical attention.

, This is a displaced fracture in which the bone has shattered into three or more pieces. This is often, but not always, associated with substantial tissue damage. The extreme pain and immobility of the affected limb that are often associated with this form of injury make it easier to diagnose.

Monitor the wound for signs of infection.,
Obtain a first-aid kit.,
Locate nearest medic station, urgent care center, or emergency room.,
Call 911.",How to Treat a Stingray Sting," Although alarming and quite painful, stingray wounds are rarely fatal.In fact, most fatalities caused by stingrays are not due to venom intoxication but rather from internal organ injury (if stung in the chest or abdomen), excess blood loss, allergic reaction, or secondary infection. These complications can be managed by trained medical personnel if they occur.;
, Take a brief moment to identify what your symptoms are. Common symptoms include:Pain
Swelling
Bleeding
Weakness
Headache
Muscle cramps
Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
Dizziness/Lightheadedness
Palpitations
Difficulty breathing
Fainting

, Medically speaking, certain symptoms are more serious than others. Determine if you are developing an allergic reaction, suffering from excess blood loss, or experiencing venom intoxication. The presence of these symptoms should trigger seeking immediate medical attention.



Allergic reaction: Swelling of tongue, lips, head, neck, or other body parts; difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing; red and/or itchy rash; fainting or loss of consciousness.

Excess blood loss: Dizziness, fainting or loss of consciousness, sweating, elevated heart rate, decreased blood pressure, rapid breathing.

Venom intoxication: Headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, muscle cramps, seizures.

, Depending on the severity of your symptoms, obtain the medical care/supplies that is most appropriate for you. This may range from obtaining a first-aid kit, visiting the local medic unit, or calling 911 for an ambulance.


Whenever in doubt, always choose a higher-level of care (i.e. calling 911).

, While still in the water, irrigate the wound with sea water, removing all debris and foreign bodies from the affected area. Use tweezers from a first-aid kit if necessary. Once the area is thoroughly irrigated and all foreign bodies are removed, come out from the water and dry the area off with a clean towel, taking care not to injure yourself further.



DO NOT remove any penetrating debris from neck, chest, or abdomen.

, Bleeding is common after a sting. As always, the best way to stop bleeding is by applying direct pressure at the source or slightly above the source with one finger for a few minutes. The longer the pressure is held, the more likely the bleeding will subside.


Try using hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with holding pressure to help stop bleeding if you cannot control it with direct pressure alone. Careful, hydrogen peroxide may sting!

, You can combine this step with the previous step of applying direct pressure to control bleeding. Soaking the wound in hot water helps alleviate the pain by denaturing the venom protein complex. Optimal temperature is 45°C (113°F), but be certain not to cause any burns. Leave the wound soaking for 30 – 90 minutes, or until the pain has subsided., Proper wound care includes keeping the area clean by applying soap and rinsing with water as well as keeping the wound dry at all times. Keep the wound uncovered and apply antibiotic ointment daily. Avoid non-antibiotic creams, lotions, and ointments.


Over the next several days, if the area becomes red, tender, itchy, sore, or begins to swell or develop a cloudy discharge, seek medical attention at the local urgent care center or emergency room. You may need antibiotics and/or drainage of an abscess.

, Depending on where you are, a first-aid kit should be easily accessible. Ask someone to grab it for you while you begin identifying your symptoms and treating your wound. Items found in the first-aid kit that will be most useful to you include:Gauze
Wound cleanser (hydrogen peroxide, alcohol wipe, soap)
Tweezers
Pain killer
Antibiotic ointment
Band-aid

, Having a healthcare provider evaluate and treat your wound(s) is not a bad idea. Not only will you be treated by an experienced professional, you will also reduce your chances of infection and other complications. A treatment plan with instructions and recommendations will be provided to you based on the provider's assessment.


If the closest facility requires at least a 10 minute drive, you should first obtain a first-aid kit and control any bleeding before transporting.

, This is your safety net. Call 911 in any of the following situations:


Penetrating wound to head, neck, chest, or abdomen.
No access to a first-aid kit or medic station.
Symptoms of allergic reaction, excess blood loss, or venom intoxication.
History of prior medical conditions and/or medication use that may influence the wound treatment.
When in doubt, confused, inebriated, obtunded, insecure, scared, or anything else you can think of.

If you're able to, call the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for advice while you wait.;
, If possible, get a picture of the snake or at least have a fellow hiker also take a mental picture of the snake to verify what you've seen.


Don’t try to catch the snake-- snakes are very fast and unless you are an experienced snake catcher, they have the advantage.
Don't walk toward the snake or spend a lot of time trying to get a better look at it if you are still in harm's way. This is not safe. Simply look at the snake quickly and then move away.

, You should immediately get out of the snake's range, so you don't get bitten a second time. Get to a safe spot a fair distance away from the site where the bite occurred. However, do not run away or move too far. Your heart will start pumping faster if you move too quickly, spreading the venom more quickly through your body.


Move to a place where the snake is not likely to return. Find a flat boulder a bit above the path, a clearing, or another area without a lot of hiding places for snakes.
Try to remain as still as possible once you have reached a safer area.

, Do not apply a tourniquet but do restrict movement in the bitten area. Also keep the area at or below the level of your heart. This will help make sure that if it was a venomous snake the spread of the venom is slowed down.


Keeping the bitten part of you below the level of your heart slows down the flow of any affected blood towards the heart, which would then pump the venom throughout your body.If you can, fashion a splint to keep the area surrounding the bite from moving. Use sticks or boards and place them on either side of the bite area. Then tie a piece of cloth at the bottom, middle, and top of the boards to keep them in place.

, Bites from venomous snakes can cause rapid and severe swelling. Even a loose piece of clothing can become too tight as the bite area swells.

, Take a clean cloth soaked in water and clean the wound gently but as thoroughly as possible. When the wound is clean, cover it with a clean cloth.

, The best you can do is find medical help as soon as possible. The good news is that once you have cleaned the wound and have removed any jewelry, if there is little or no swelling, the bite is less likely to be from a venomous snake. However, even if this is the case there is still a risk of infection or a serious reaction, including allergic reactions, so you still need medical attention as soon as possible.

, There are a lot of myths about how to care for a snake bite and some of these myths could actually make your situation worse.


Don't try to cut or suck the venom out. Cutting the wound could cause more problems and increases the risk of infection. Anyone sucking out venom may actually swallow some and be poisoned themselves.
Don’t use a tourniquet or use ice on the wound. Experts believe that a tourniquet could potentially restrict blood flow too much and ice can increase the damage to the wound.Don’t drink any alcohol or caffeine-- this can increase your heart rate and spread any venom that may be there. Instead, stay hydrated with water.

, At the ER, you will be treated for swelling, pain and any symptoms of a venomous snake bite. These symptoms include nausea, dizziness, numbness and any difficulty breathing or swallowing. The ER will also observe you for drops in blood pressure, any signs of damage to the blood or nervous system, allergic reactions, and swelling.


The treatment will depend on any symptoms you develop. If no symptoms develop, you may still be kept for a 24-hour observation period because in some cases it takes that long for symptoms to develop.
If the snake that bit you is venomous, you may get treated with antivenin (aka antivenom or antivenene). This is a combination of antibodies made to counteract snake toxins and has been shown to be safe and effective in both adults and children. Depending on symptoms, you may get more than one dose.
You will also likely be prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic to make sure the wound does not get infected. A tetanus shot may also be given.
For very severe snake bites, surgery may be required.

, By the time you are released from the hospital, your main concern should be keeping the snake bite area cleaned and covered and following medical instructions for wound care. These instructions should include how often to change the dressing, how to clean the healing wound (usually warm water and soap), and how to recognize a possible infection.


Signs of possible infection include swelling, tenderness, redness, drainage, and heat coming from the infected area, or a new fever. If you experience any of these symptoms at the site of the snake bite, call your physician as soon as possible.

, If you're out in the wilderness, with no hope of paramedics getting there soon, the best you can do is get as comfortable as possible and wait for the venom to leave your system. In most cases, snakes don't inject enough venom for the bite to be fatal. Treat the individual symptoms that may occur, and most importantly, stay calm and move as little as possible. Fear of snakes and the anxiety that follows being bitten are often what leads to fatalities, since a pounding heart makes the venom spread more quickly.


If you're out hiking and see other people, ask if they can call or go for help, or if they have a snake-bite kit of pump suction device.

Also call if the identification section leads you to believe the scorpion could be dangerous, or if the victim is a child, elderly person, or someone with a weak heart or lungs. Some of these abnormal symptoms include muscle spasms, dizziness, and may also include those symptoms experienced with snake bites



Find an online ambulance number listing to learn the emergency number for other countries.;
, If you are not in need of immediate medical attention, call a poison control center to report your symptoms and request expert advice. If your region's poison control center is not listed below, search for your region's name and ""poison control"" online. If you cannot find one, call one of the following numbers long-distance, choosing one in a location as near as possible to you.


In the USA, phone Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222, or search this database for a poison center nearer to you.
Outside of the USA, locate a poison control center using the World Health Organization's database.

, The victim's approximate age and weight are useful for medical personnel to help them evaluate the risk and recommend treatment.If the victim has any allergies or medical conditions especially to insect bites or medicines, let the emergency services or poison center know.


Also communicate the exact time the victim was stung if possible. If you're not sure, say so and mention when the injury was noticed.

, An emergency response service may not be able to advise you over the phone, but a poison control center should ask you for a detailed description of the scorpion. See the section on identifying scorpions for advice on danger signs and how to capture the scorpion if it is still around.

, Because scorpion venom can produce involuntary muscle motion, the victim may not be able to drive or walk if dangerous symptoms develop. Find someone with a car or other transportation that can take the victim to a hospital in case they cannot reach an emergency ambulance service. The victim should not be left alone for at least 24 hours, and preferably monitored for the next week in case symptoms worsen., No matter what, children, infants, the elderly, and people with a damaged heart or lung should always seek medical attention for a scorpion sting. Still, most scorpion stings can be treated at home, although the most dangerous venom requires professional medical attention. Seek medical attention immediately if you see any of the following symptoms.Vomiting, sweating, drooling, or foaming at the mouth
Involuntary urination or excretion (peeing or pooing)
Thrashing or twitching muscles, including involuntary head, neck, or eye movements, or difficulty walking
Accelerated or irregular heart rate
Difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or seeing
Severe swelling from an allergic reaction

, A scorpion sting may or may not swell noticeably. Any scorpion sting, however, will cause a sharp pain or burning sensation at the time of injury, followed by tingling or numbness. Sting areas generally are near lower portions of the body but may include the rest of the body.

, Gently remove any clothing from around the area and wash gently. This helps remove any residual venom around the area and keeps the wound clear to reduce risk of infection.

, Unlike some injuries, scorpion sting wounds should never be raised above the heart, as this can cause the venom to spread more quickly through your system. Keep the affected area at heart level or lower, and minimize the victim's movement to prevent a faster heart rate that will spread the venom more quickly, Anxiety or excitement can cause a faster heart rate, which will increase the rate that venom is absorbed. Reassure the victim if possible, and prevent him from moving. Remind them that the majority of scorpion stings result in no permanent damage.

, Apply the cold pack or bag of ice for ten to fifteen minutes at a time, waiting an equal amount of time between applications. This treatment is most effective within two hours of the time of injury.If the victim has circulatory problems, apply ice for five minutes at a time instead to prevent damage., Use ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen to relieve discomfort and pain. Always follow the directions on the label. Do not use opiate painkillers (narcotics), as these can suppress breathing. Ibuprofen and aspirin are best as they are both NSAIDs, or Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs that will help to reduce swelling. If pain is intense, seek medical attention.

, Unconsciousness or severe spasms are rare, but if they occur, call an ambulance immediately. Learn the basic steps of CPR and use them on the patient immediately if you have any suspicion her heart has stopped.

, Even if you feel that you've recovered through self-treatment, it is highly advisable to see a doctor or medical professional. In order to reduce the risk of infection and other complications, you may be advised to get a tetanus shot, take muscle relaxants, or use antibiotics. Do not give yourself these medicines without a doctor's advice.

, While the majority of scorpion stings are not harmful to adults, be aware of symptoms that indicate serious health risks. If any of the following describe the victim or his symptoms, seek medical attention before attempting to identify the scorpion:Children, infants, the elderly, and people with a damaged heart or lung should always seek medical attention for a scorpion sting.
Vomiting, sweating, drooling, or foaming at the mouth
Involuntary urination or excretion (peeing or pooing)
Thrashing or twitching muscles, including involuntary head, neck, or eye movements, or difficulty walking
Accelerated or irregular heart rate
Difficulty breathing, swallowing, speaking, or seeing
Severe swelling from an allergic reaction

, Identifying the scorpion species allows you to determine whether treatment is necessary, and in the case of venomous species, will allow medical professionals to give you the correct treatment.If you have a glass jar much larger than the scorpion (a quart or liter size is usually suitable), attempting to capture it will give an expert the greatest chance of identification.However, if you cannot see the scorpion, or do not have an appropriate container, do not attempt this step.


Find a large glass jar, easily large enough to cover the scorpion and tall enough that your hands will be well out of reach of the stinger when you hold it upside-down. If you have them, find a pair of tongs that are at least 10 inches (25 cm) long.
Capture the scorpion with the jar or tongs. Hold the jar upside-down and place fully over the scorpion. If you have tongs long enough to use them while staying out of reach, use them to firmly grasp the scorpion and place it into the jar instead.
Fasten the lid. If the jar is upside-down, slide a large piece of heavy construction paper or cardboard under the opening, then hold it from the outside as you flip the container upside-down. Attach a tight lid or place a large, heavy book over the opening.

, If you do not have the correct tools for capturing the scorpion, photograph it instead. Take several photographs from different angles if possible. Having images to refer to will help you find details you may not remember, and if you need to seek expert attention, will help a medical professional identify the species for you.

, Scorpions with thick, fat stingers and tails are often more dangerous than scorpions with thin stingers. While it is still useful to capture or photograph the scorpion for specific species identification, you should seek medical attention even if you have not yet experienced serious symptoms, especially if you are in Africa, India, or the Americas.


If you only got a good view of the pincers, you can estimate your risk from them as well: large, powerful pincers often indicate the scorpion relies on them for defense more than venom. This is not a foolproof system, but may be valuable information to pass on to a medical professional.

, If you are in the southwestern United States or northern Mexico, look for images of the ""Arizona bark scorpion"" online and compare them to the scorpion that caused the injury. Note that bark scorpions at high elevations tend to be striped, while desert dwelling bark scorpions are usually a uniform tan or light brown. The stings of these scorpions can be fatal and require immediate medical attention.


If you are elsewhere in the United States, there is low risk of serious injury from scorpion stings.You should still treat the injury site as described below, and be prepared to see a doctor if you experience allergic reactions or other serious symptoms.

, The ""deathstalker scorpion"", also known as the Israeli desert scorpion, grows to a maximum of 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) and can vary widely in color and pincer size.Because of the risk of heart or lung failure associated with their stings, any sting from a scorpion smaller than an adult's hand encountered in this region should be treated by medical professionals as soon as possible.


As noted earlier, fat-tailed scorpions can be extremely dangerous as well, and many species are found in this region.
Unidentified, thin-tailed species are typically low risk, but due to the large number of scorpion species in Africa, not all of which have been thoroughly studied, be prepared to seek medical attention if any symptoms besides pain and slight swelling develop.

, Most scorpions in this area are not dangerous to adults, but there are exceptions. One of the more dangerous is the ""Brazilian yellow scorpion;"" as with many dangerous scorpion, it tends to have a thick, fat tail.

, The are few remaining scorpion species that can cause fatality or serious injury in adult humans, but as not all species have been identified, it is always a good idea to seek medical attention if the victim experiences any symptoms besides pain and mild swelling around the injury site.


Stings from small, red or orange scorpions in India, Nepal, or Pakistan should be treated with medical attention immediately.These may be Indian red scorpions.
There is low risk of death or serious injury for an adult due to scorpion venom from Europe, Australia, or New Zealand.Identification is still a good idea in case you do experience severe symptoms and need to report them to a medical worker.

Treat a non-venomous snake bite like a puncture wound; the first step is to apply firm pressure to the wound with a sterile gauze or bandage, so you don't lose too much blood.Don't treat the bite as a non-venomous bite unless you're absolutely sure that the snake was not venomous. If there's any doubt, it's important to get medical attention right away.

, Wash it with clean water and soap for several minutes. Rinse the wound thoroughly with more water, then wash it again. Pat it dry with a sterile piece of gauze.Use an alcohol-soaked pad if one is available.

, Apply a thin coating of antibiotic ointment to the clean wound. Then bandage the wound. This will protect it and help to prevent infection.

, Your doctor will make sure that the bite is cleaned and cared for properly. Feel free to ask him or her if further medical care is needed, including whether or not you need a tetanus shot., Even non-venomous snake bites may lead to infection. Look for any signs of infection such as redness, streaking, swelling, drainage, or a fever. If you see any, return to your doctor to get it checked out.

, It's important to stay properly hydrated as your body heals from the snakebite.In general, you should aim to drink about 2 liters of water per day."

Learn about venomous snakes.,
Determine if you are in a region where venomous snakes live.,
Learn about snake bites.,
Understand the behavior of snakes.,
Avoid contact with snakes.,
Purchase a snakebite kit.",How to Treat a Snake Bite3," Most snakes are not venomous, but all snakes can bite.The most common venomous snakes are cobras, copperheads, coral snakes, cottonmouths (water moccasins) and rattlesnakes. While most venomous snakes have a triangular shaped head, the only real way to know if a snake is venomous is to be able to identify it or locate the fang glands on a dead snake., Cobras are found in Asia and Africa. Copperheads are found in the southern and eastern portions of the US, and parts of Australia and Asia. Varieties of coral snakes can be found in the southern US, parts of India and SE Asia, China, and Taiwan. Cottonmouths, or water moccasins, are found in the Southeast US and rattlesnakes range from the southern parts of Canada and extend all the way down into Argentina.


Certain areas of the world, such as Australia, have a higher concentration of highly venomous snakes than others. Remember that venomous snakes can and do live in cities as well as the wilderness, and exercise appropriate caution.

, When a non-venomous snake bites, the biggest concern is infection and tissue swelling. When venomous snakes bite, in addition to tissue damage and infection, the concern is the effects of the snake venom. Most snakes will not bite unless they are disturbed or handled by people.


Fangs in snakes can be fixed or folded back until the snake bites. Venomous snakes can have either type of fang, although snakes with fixed fangs, such as the coral snake, tend to affect the nervous system, while those with folded fangs, such as rattlesnakes, tend to affect blood cells.All types of snakes have substances that can cause tissue destruction-- if you get bitten by a snake, limiting this damage may be the most critical problem.

, Snakes are “cold-blooded,” meaning they get their body heat from their surroundings and the sun.Because of this, snakes and snake bites are much less common in cooler climates or colder seasons because the snakes are hibernating.


Snakes and snake bites are more common the closer you get to the equator because the snakes found in these areas don’t hibernate and are more active during the hotter days.

, The best way to treat a snake bite is to avoid a snake bite. According to wilderness experts, here are the best ways to avoid snakes and their bites:


Don’t sleep or rest next to areas where snakes may be hiding. This includes brush, tall grass, big rocks, and trees.
Don’t poke your hands into rock crevices, hollow logs, heavy brush, or any place a snake may be waiting for its next meal.
Look down as you walk through any brush or tall grass.
Don’t try to pick up any snake, dead or alive. Snakes have a reflex where they can bite for a minute or so after they are dead...strange but true!
ALWAYS wear hiking boots to cover your ankles and keep your pants legs tucked into your boots.
Make noise. Most snakes don’t want to see you anymore than you want to see them!To ensure that you don't scare a snake, make sure they can hear you coming.

, If you are a frequent hiker or wilderness explorer, consider investing in a snakebite kit that includes a pump suction device. Do not use kits that include razor blades or suction bulbs."

Wash your hands, if possible.,
Apply pressure.,
Examine the wound when the bleeding stops.,
Clean the wound as best you can.,
Cover the wound, if possible.",How to Clean a Wound Without Proper Supplies1," Before treating a wound, it's reccomended that you do so with clean hands. This can prevent bacteria from your hands affecting the wound.If you have access to running water and soap, use this to clean your hands. However, wounds often happen when camping. In this case, you may have to improvise.


If you have any kind of clean, disposable gloves, try using these. However, do not use regular gloves, as these probably contain a lot of bacteria. Only use previously unused disposable plastic gloves, that have been stored in a sealable bag or container.
If you have some kind of hand sanitizer, you may want to use this. It can get some of the bacteria off of your hands.;
, You want to stop bleeding, as blood loss can lead to serious complications. Most minor wounds will stop bleeding if you apply a small amount of pressure to the wound.You should apply pressure for 10 to 15 minutes, then examine the wound. If it's still bleeding, apply pressure for another 10 to 15 minutes.Ideally, you would use a clean cloth or band-aid in this situation, as all materials should be sterile. Without proper supplies, however, you may have to improvise.


If you have clean gloves, direct hand-to-wound contact may be safe in this case, and even preferable to using unclean cloths or clothing.Without gloves, however, things can get complicated. You could see if you have any supplies on hand. Sterile bandaids can help. Tampons are generally sterile, and some soldiers and campers have used them to apply pressure or dress a wound. This can also be an option in a bind.Keep in mind there is no substitute for safe, sterile material you would find in a hospital or in a conventional first aid kid. If you have to apply pressure to a wound with questionable material, you should seek medical attention as soon as you are able. If you're camping in a group, it's a good idea to have someone seek out medical help while you're applying pressure to a wound.

, Once the bleeding stops, examine the wound. You want to assess how serious the damage is, as this information can be useful when you receive medical care. The area outside the wound should be pink. The wounded party should not be experiencing loss of sensation.If you notice loss of sensation, or any major discolorations, this is a sign of a serious infection. Your top priority should be seeking medical help. Do so before proceeding. Untreated infections can cause serious, possibly deadly, complications.

, If the wound does not look seriously infected, proper cleaning can prevent infection. Ideally, you would should use saline, tap water, or disinfected water. Do not use water from a stream to clean a wound.In a bind, tap water is fine. If you're camping, see if you have any bottled water on hand to clean the wound. Iodine, rubbing alcohol, or hydrogen peroxide should be avoided, however, as these can cause tissue damage.
Pour water over the wound to wash away any dirt and bacteria. Be careful. Pour with enough force to dislodge any foreign materials, but do not pour so vigorously dirt and debris gets further lodged in the wound.

, Covering a wound can greatly help prevent infection. If you have sterile material, you can use this to bandage the wound. Ideally, you should use sterile bandages or gauze from a first aid kit.You may have to improvise, however, and make temporary use of sterile materials like tampons.


A minor cut or scrape can probably be left uncovered. It may be safer to leave minor scrapes uncovered if you do not have proper supplies."

Seek medical attention immediately.,
Receive stitches, if necessary.,
Get proper dressing for a wound from medical professionals.,
Change your dressing at least once a day.",How to Clean a Wound Without Proper Supplies2," You should not leave a wound improperly treated for long. As soon as you or the wounded party is stable enough to move, seek medical attention. If you have cellphone reception, call 9-1-1. If you do not have reception, move to an area where you get reception and make the call. It's critical to seek medical attention immediately if you've dressed or cleaned a wound without proper supplies.


If you're without a phone, find the nearest rode and try to flag down help.
If you're camping, make use of emergency devices. Use emergency flares to signal you need help, if you have them. You can also blow a whistle to try to get the attention of other campers or people nearby., A deep wound may require stitches. At the hospital, a doctor will evaluate whether stitches are necessary. If they are, you will receive stitches in the hospital after the wound is properly cleaned.Stitches that are applied quickly after a wound is discovered are unlikely to leave heavy scarring. It also greatly reduces the risk of infection.
There are many different types of stitches. The proper care protocol for your stitches depend on their type, and the amount. Talk to your doctor about follow up care for your stitches before leaving the hospital. Follow all your doctor's instructions regarding caring for your stitches at home.

, Not all wounds will require stitches. Some wounds merely need to be covered to prevent infection. At the hospital, you should receive proper covering for your wound.Adhesive tapes and bandages can be used to dress wound. You can also use paper tape, rolled gauze, or an elastic bandage.
At the hospital, a doctor or nurse will choose the best dressing for you given your wound's stage. As long as you're getting dressing from a hospital, it is probably clean and safe.

, A wound's dressing needs to be changed to prevent infection. As your wound heals, you'll need to change the dressing as it becomes messy or wet. Usually, you'll need to change the dressing at least once a day. For more serious wounds, dressing may need to be changed more often.Usually, your doctor will provide you with instructions on how to change your dressing before you leave the hospital. You can usually buy fresh dressing at a drug store. You doctor may also provide you with extra dressing before you leave the hospital.

Travel with a first aid kit in the future.,
Get a tetanus shot.,
Be aware of your surroundings when camping.,
Make sure you know the quickest way to receive medical help in an emergency.",How to Clean a Wound Without Proper Supplies3," It's not safe to clean a wound with material that aren't sterile. In the future, carry a fist aid kit when camping. This way, you'll have clean gauze and other supplies on hand in the event of an accident or injury. Working with clean and sterile material greatly reduces the risk of a wound becoming infected.

, Tetanus is a bacteria disease that affects a sufferer's nervous system. Bacteria that causes tetanus can be found in dust, soil, and dirt. A wound accrued when camping or hiking can cause tetanus if you have not been vaccinated.Check your vaccination records. You can usually get these from your doctor. As a lot of vaccinations are given out when you're young, try asking your parents. They may know where your vaccination record is.
If you have not had a tetanus shot in the past 5 years, get one. It's especially important to get vaccinated before camping, as you do not want to get tetanus if you end up wounded. If you're being treated for a wound at the hospital, a tetanus shot may be reccomended., When camping, know your surroundings. When you set up your tent, do so during the day. Scan the area for bumps, hills, and crevices. Know where you're likely to slip and fall, and avoid these areas to prevent injuries., If you go camping, make sure you know how to access emergency services quickly. Know where the nearest highway is, and take an emergency flare or whistle so you can call for help if necessary. It's also a good idea to carry a charged cell phone when camping. In the event you need assistance, you can call for help on your cell.

Learn about different symptoms.",How to Treat a Caterpillar Sting," If the caterpillar is still on your skin, you need to remove it. Do so without using your hands. Use pliers, tweezers, or thick gloves to pick up the caterpillar. This is important, as you could get stung again if you try to remove the caterpillar with just your fingers.In addition, you should use tweezers to remove a stinger, if you see one.;
, Use scotch tape, duct tape, or something similar, and place it over the site of the sting. Then, quickly remove it. The tape will catch any poison hairs or spines that remain on your skin. This is important in minimizing sting symptoms and preventing additional stings.You may want to place and remove tape on the sting site several times to make sure you’ve removed all hairs and spines.
You can also use the adhesive part of a bandaid to remove hairs or spines.

, Use soap and warm water to wash the area thoroughly. In addition, wash the surrounding area as well. Finally, make sure to wash both of your hands thoroughly just in case you came into contact with poison or stingers., Mix a tablespoon of baking soda with a tablespoon or two of warm water. Then, liberally apply the paste and allow it to sit for a couple of minutes. This baking soda paste should reduce itching and other discomfort. Reapply the paste every couple of hours., If the baking soda fails to alleviate your symptoms, rinse your baking soda paste off and then apply a liberal amount of hydrocortisone cream. Allow the cream to sit. It may take up to an hour for it to sooth the sting site. Reapply the cream per the instructions on the product., If hydrocortisone cream also fails, wash off the baking soda and hydrocortisone cream, and then apply a liberal amount of antihistamine cream. Wait up to half an hour to see if you notice a difference. In many cases, antihistamine creams have proved ineffective in soothing the symptoms of a caterpillar sting. However, you may find that the cream works for you., After you’ve applied baking soda paste or a cream, you can put a cold compress on the site of the sting. Place a bag of ice or frozen meats or vegetables on the site of the sting for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Reapply the cold compress every hour or two., If your symptoms worsen or your blisters are severe, you should contact a medical professional immediately. This is important, as some people could have potentially deadly allergic reactions to caterpillar stings., If you haven’t had a tetanus booster in the last 5 or 10 years, you should get one within 72 hours of getting stung by a caterpillar. This is because the sting/wound site may become open to bacteria and infection., Contact poison control at 1-800-222-1222 any time of the day or night if you have any more questions about how to treat a caterpillar sting. A poison specialist will answer the phone and provide you with recommendations about how to treat the sting site., Caterpillar stings can result in a variety of symptoms. Depending on the type of caterpillar and whether you are allergic, symptoms could be very mild or very severe. Common symptoms include:Itchiness and contact dermatitis, blisters, weals(welts), small red bumps, pain.
Acute conjunctivitis, if hairs penetrate the eyes.
Rash and hives.
Difficulty breathing.
Nausea and vomiting.
Bleeding and renal failure can occur after contact with the South American Lonomia caterpillar.

Avoid alcohol or caffeine.,
Don't cut the wound.Popular belief suggests cutting the bites can help release the venom.,
Don't suck the wound with your mouth.,
Don't apply a tourniquet.,
Don't apply ice or immerse the wound in water.It's important to keep preserve the viable tissue for as long as possible.,
Don't pee on the bite.,
Don't give the person anything to eat or drink while waiting for care.This includes medication and alcohol.",How to Treat a Rattlesnake Bite," If the snake feels threatened, it can strike again. Therefore, the person who was bitten should move out of range of the snake.Get at least 20 feet away from the snake.;
, It's important to seek medical attention as quickly as possible. Most hospitals will have an appropriate antivenom, and most treatments attempted by people before the hospital do not help much. If you're in an area where you can call an ambulance, that is your best option. If not, try to find help to take you or the injured person to the nearest hospital.Even if you're not sure if you were bitten by a rattlesnake, it's important to go to the hospital immediately. It's better to be at the hospital if you start to exhibit symptoms of the venom entering your body., If you place the area above the heart, the blood containing venom from the bite will go to the heart more quickly., If possible, keep the person from moving until help arrives. Movement increases blood flow, spreading the venom more readily. Therefore, you or the person bitten should try to minimize movement as much as possible.Of course, if you are alone, it is more important to find help than to stay immobile.

, The area around a snakebite can swell significantly, so cut away or take off any clothing near the bite. Also, remove jewelry from the area, as well. If it is not taken off before the area swells, it can constrict blood flow, and jewelry may need to be cut off., Allow the bite to bleed freely for about half a minute. This process may allow some of the venom to flow out of the wound., It is good to try to suck out the venom, but only if you have a device made for that purpose. The pump will come with instructions on how to use it, but basically, you place the pump over the bite to help suck out the venom., Don't wash the wound, as that can remove the venom from your skin. The medical professionals may be able to use what's on your skin to assist in your treatment, by allowing them to figure out what kind of rattlesnake you were bitten by., A sling or splint can help keep the wound immobile, helping to slow the blood flow to the area. In turn, that can keep the venom from spreading as much.To make an arm sling, make a triangle out of fabric by folding it or cutting it. Wrap the triangle around the arm with the elbow at the middle point. Your arm or the person's arm should be bent at the elbow to fit into the sling. Tie the other two ends together around the shoulder. Let the hand stick out at the base of the triangle.Find items to support the limb, such as sticks, rolled-up newspapers, or even rolled-up fabric. Lay the supports alongside the limb, trying to incorporate a joint above and below the wound. Secure the supports to the limb with whatever you have on hand, from belts to tape to bandages. Don't wrap around the wound; wrap on either side of it. If the wound swells too much, you may need to decrease the pressure of the splint., Talk to them. Ask them questions to help keep their mind off the bite.Anxiety and panic can increase the heartbeat and make it easier for the venom to spread.If you're the one who's been bitten, try to remain calm. Take a few slow, deep breaths to help soothe your nerves.
You can also call Poison Control services while you wait.

, One of the easiest ways to tell the bite was most likely venomous is to watch for the area to swell. It may also change colors.Another indication of a venomous snakebite is one to two puncture wounds rather than a row of small punctures, indicating smaller teeth.
Dizziness, pain at the site, blurred vision, and prickling in other parts of the body are also signs of a venomous bite, as well as heavy sweating., One symptom is paleness.Other signs of shock include rapid heartbeat, fast breathing, nausea, and dizziness. Also, look for a person's pupils getting larger.If the person starts to go into shock, lay them down on their back, raising their feet up at least a foot. Also, keep the person warm by wrapping them in a blanket or an extra layer of clothing.Start CPR if the person does not show signs of life, such as breathing, coughing or movement., These substances make your body take in the venom more quickly. Therefore, do not drink these beverages immediately after having been bitten by a rattlesnake., However, tests have proven that this method doesn't help, and you can infect the wound if you use a dirty knife., By sucking, you introduce the venom to your mouth. Also, your mouth is bacteria-ridden, so you could also infect the bite with germs from your mouth.In fact, within 15 minutes, the venom has already entered the lymphatic system, so sucking after this point is useless.

, A tourniquet cuts off blood flow to the limb. This advice was given in the past, as it was thought to stop the venom from traveling to the rest of the body. However, it often does more harm than good., Using ice or water would not help the preservation because it would slow blood circulation., A common myth is to urinate on the bite to help neutralize toxins. Urine will not help the bite. Instead, spend that time getting to the hospital., You want to keep the metabolism low."

A first-degree burn will be red and painful. It turns white when you put pressure on it.
This type of burn usually heals within 3-6 days. The skin may peel during healing. There is usually little to no scarring.;
, A second-degree burn is more severe than a first-degree burn. It affects deeper layers of the skin. It will be red or splotchy, swollen and very painful. There may be blisters.


This type of burn usually heals within 2-3 weeks. You may have some scarring.
If your burn is any larger than about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters), see your doctor immediately.

, Third-degree burns are the deepest and most serious burns. They damage all the layers of the skin. The skin may be whitish (charred) or black.


Third-degree burns require immediate medical attention. Do not attempt to treat this type of burn on your own.
Third-degree burns are not usually painful because the nerves have been damaged.
These burns may take months to heal and may scar during healing.

, Immediately after getting burned, use cold, running water to cool the area to a comfortable level. Do this for at least 5 minutes.


Second-degree burns should be cooled for at least 15 minutes.Do not apply ice to the burned area.

, Use medicinal honey to cover the entire burned area and onto the surrounding, undamaged tissue. Don’t skimp on the honey. You want to have a pretty thick layer of honey over the wound. Depending on where the burn is, try to have the honey about ¼ inch thick (about ½ centimeter).



Use medicinal honey if possible. Examples of medicinal honeys are manuka honey from New Zealand and Medihoney from Germany.If you can’t find medicinal honey, a good choice is organic, unfiltered raw honey. Don’t use regular honey from the grocery store.Avoid using rhododendron-based honey. It can contain toxins known as grayanotoxins and is known as “Mad Honey” because it has been known to cause lightheadedness and hallucinations. , Use a thin plastic bag, sandwich bag or wooden ice cream stick to gently spread the honey over the burned area and surrounding skin.

, Use a clean, dry gauze bandage or a non-stick dressing like Telfa. Cover the burned area completely with the dressing. Hold it in place with medical adhesive tape., If you have received a large second-degree burn (larger than 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters), or you have a third-degree burn, get medical attention right away.


For second-degree burns, you should still cool the burn with cold, running water for 15 minutes, or until help arrives.

, All electrical, chemical and radiation burns (with the exception of mild sunburn) should be treated by medical professionals as soon as possible.


A chemical burn should be flushed with cool, running water for at least 5 minutes. Get medical attention immediately.

, Make sure you have clean hands before changing the dressing on your burn. If your hand is burned, ask someone to help you. Have them wash their hands with soap and water first.

, If any loose skin sticks to the dressing, let it pull away from the burned area.Studies have shown that honey helps loosen and separate skin more easily and without pain, so this should be relatively easy to do.Throw away the old dressing.

, Examine the burn area and look for signs of infection. This might include:


Pus or discharge
Swellings filled with anything but clear fluid (if the skin has blistered, leave the blister intact)
Reddish streaks which radiate from the injury
Fever

, If you think you have an infection but it seems minor, you can use a triple-antibiotic cream/ointment on it, though the honey generally prevents infections.


If you think you may have a more serious infection (for example, you are running a fever or you see red streaks), contact your healthcare professional immediately.

, Removing tissue (loose skin) from the burned area can cause further damage such as scarring. There is no need to remove tissue that remains on the burned area after you’ve removed the dressing. Let your body do the work. The tissue will fall off normally, and the honey will speed up this process.

, The honey has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. It can prevent infections most of the time.The honey forms a protective barrier over the area, and removing it will expose the vulnerable tissue. Leave the honey on the injured area.

, Use as much honey as is needed to cover over the burn area. Use enough to make a ¼ inch thick layer (about ½ centimeter).

, Use gauze or Telfa to cover the burned area completely. Secure with medical adhesive tape.

, Keep changing the dressing and applying more honey every day. Watch for the wound to look pinkish and bumpy.

, Every day, leave the dressing off for 1-2 hours. This will allow the injured area to get some air. Then, reapply honey and a fresh dressing of gauze or Telfa.

, A first-degree burn should heal within a week. A small second-degree burn should heal within 2 weeks. Once the burn is healed, wash off the honey with cool running water.


If a burn is taking longer than 2 weeks to heal, see your doctor to have the burn checked.

Learn to identify and avoid poisonous snakes in your area.",How to Survive Being Bitten by a Venomous Snake," This is 911 in the US, 999 in the United Kingdom, and 000 in Australia. The key to surviving a venomous snake bite is to get an antivenom as soon as possible.


Call the emergency responders even if you are not sure whether the snake was venomous. Do not wait to see if symptoms develop. If the snake turns out to be a danger, then the venom may spread while you are waiting.
The emergency responder on the telephone will decide whether to send an ambulance/helicopter to get you or whether you should go yourself to the nearest emergency room.
If you go yourself to the emergency room, have someone drive you. Do not drive yourself. As the venom kicks in, it may cause symptoms like blurred vision, difficulty breathing, fainting, and paralysis that could impair your ability to drive.;
, The faster your heart beats, the faster the venom will spread throughout your body. Do not attempt to suck out the venom from the bite; this will not help, it is already spreading. , When you call for help, describe the snake to the emergency responders. This may help them to prepare the right antivenom and have it ready for you, but medical staff in the emergency department may also consult Poison Control experts to choose the best treatment. If you or someone with you can safely get a clear photo, this can help a lot. Give as much information as you can about the snake’s characteristics. How long was the snake?
How thick was the snake?
What color(s) did the snake have on it?
What patterns or distinct markings did it have?
What was the shape of the snake’s head? Was it triangular?
What was the shape of the snake’s pupils? Were they round or vertical slits?
If you have a friend with you that can quickly take a picture of the snake while you are on the phone calling the emergency responders, bring the photo with you.
Do not try to kill the snake to bring it with you. This is very dangerous because you risk being bitten again, you are wasting precious time before getting an antivenom, and the more you move and exert yourself, the faster the venom will spread through your body.Some antivenom is polyvalent – that is, it is effective against multiple types of venom.

, Try your best to stay calm, still and quiet while traveling to the hospital or waiting for an ambulance. The faster your heart beats the more you increase the blood flow to the bitten area, increasing the spread of the venom.The bitten area is likely to begin swelling. Quickly remove any jewelry or restrictive clothing.
Keep the bitten area below your heart to reduce circulation of the venom to the rest of your body.
If you were bitten on an arm or leg, splint it to restrict your movement. This will prevent you from moving it without realizing it. You do not want to increase the circulation in the bitten area.
If you know someone who is strong enough to carry you, let them carry you so that you won’t increase your circulation by walking.
If you have to walk, reduce your physical exertion by not carrying anything (like a hiking backpack).

, More blood will come out at first because there are typically anticoagulants in the venom. If a snake bite is deep enough to cause spurting blood (i.e. the strike hit a major artery and you are losing blood fast), immediately apply pressure to the wound.


While some sources say washing the wound or near it with soap and water is ok, others advise against it saying that traces of venom found in or around the wound may help the medical professionals identify what kind of snake bit you and determine which antivenom to give you.Cover the bite with a clean, unmedicated bandage., The symptoms vary by what kind of snake it was, the severity of the bite, and the amount of venom injected into the wound. Symptoms may include:Redness, discoloration and/or swelling around the bite
Great pain or a burning sensation
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Low blood pressure
Dizziness or fainting
Difficulty breathing
Blurred vision
Headache
Salivation
Sweating, fever, and thirst
Numbness or tingling in the face or limbs
Loss of coordination
Slurred speech
Swelling of the tongue and throat
Abdominal pain
Weakness
Rapid pulse
Convulsions
Shock
Paralysis
Vertigo

, These days most cell phones have GPS capabilities making it possible for rescue workers and medical teams to find you even if you are hiking in remote areas, so always call emergency responders to discuss your options. Remember, the only effective treatment is an antivenom. Without it, the bite could be fatal or cause permanent injuries. If you cannot contact emergency responders, your options include:


Hiking out until you reach an area where you can call help. If you do this, try to be as quick as possible, but also minimize the exertion. If you have a friend with you, ask them to carry your backpack.
If hiking out is not an option, wash the wound with soap and water to reduce your chances of infection.
Wrap a bandage around the limb two to four inches above the bite to restrict, but not cut off, the circulation. You should be able to still get a finger under the bandage. This will slow the spread of venom without damaging the limb.If you have a snake bite first aid kit with a suction pump, use it according to the manufacturers directions. Many sources say that this is inefficient at removing the venom and a waste of precious time, but if you will not be receiving an antivenom, it is worth a try. Do not attempt to use your mouth.Rest and try to stay calm. Keep the bitten area below your heart to slow the spread of the venom. Snakes do not always inject venom when they bite and when they do, they do not always inject large amounts. You might be lucky.

, Applying cold compresses or ice packs will reduce circulation, concentrate the venom in your tissues, and this may make tissue damage more likely., Do not cut across the wound. This is often done prior to applying suction, but it increases your chances of infection.Because snake fangs are curved, the venom is unlikely to have been injected where you expect.The venom will have already begun spreading.

, And, in the process you will transfer bacteria from your mouth into the wound, increasing the chances of infection.


Most of the venom will remain in your body, making it a better use of time to get medical help as soon as possible.
While some sources recommend using a pump suction deviceothers argue that it is ineffective., Do not take any medications or painkillers unless directed to do so by a doctor. Medications are not a substitute for an antivenom., This may harm you and has not been shown to be effective., Reducing the circulation will concentrate the venom in that limb, making tissue damage due to the venom more likely and cutting off the circulation entirely could permanently damage the limb.You may consider applying a pressure bandage two to four inches above the bite to slow the spread of the venom if you are far from medical help.However, this is also likely to concentrate the venom in that limb, increasing the danger to the limb.
Do not completely cut off blood flow to the limb.

, If you see a snake, walk around it giving it a very wide berth. Snakes can move fast when striking.


If you hear the distinctive rattle of a rattlesnake, move away immediately.
Most snakes will avoid you if given the chance. They are more afraid of you than you are of it.
Do not attempt to harass or poke a snake with a stick.
Do not try to pick up snakes.

, Snake leggings are leather chaps that you can strap on over your boots, which will protect your legs from a snake bite. They are heavy to hike in and hot, but worth it if they save you from a snake bite. You can also purchase snake boots that are specifically designed to prevent snakebites.Protective footwear and snake leggings are especially important if you are hiking at night when you could step on a snake without seeing it.

, Tall grass makes it hard to tell where you are stepping or if you are near a snake. If you must hike through tall grass where there could be snakes hiding, use a long stick to sweep the grass out of your way in front of you. The stick will move the grass away so you can see the snake and likely scare it away.

, Don’t turn over rocks and logs where snakes might be hiding underneath. If you must do so, use a long stick and keep your hands out of any hole where you can't see into it.


If you are landscaping or gardening in an area with poisonous snakes, wear thick leather gloves to protect your hands. It is best if the leather gloves also have long arms to protect more than just your hands.

, To protect yourself, find out what the poisonous snakes in your area look like and be extra careful to avoid them if you see them. Also remember to be alert and listen for the distinctive rattle of a rattlesnake. If you hear rattling, back away as quickly as possible!

Use ammonia.As soon as you are stung, use ammonia to rinse the area as quickly as possible.",How to Treat a Fire Ant Sting," Most stings occur when people accidentally step into or sit on a fire ant mound, disturbing hundreds of thousands of fire ants primed to defend their home. If you start feeling stings, the first thing to do is get up and leave the area as quickly as possible.;
, Fire ants clamp onto the body with their mandibles, and are difficult to remove. Quickly pick them off one at a time and drop them on the ground.


You can try brushing the ants away, but if they have already clamped down with their mandibles, they may continue hanging on tight.
Refrain from slapping at the ants, as this only agitates them.
If there's a chance more ants have gotten into your clothes, remove them immediately.

, It's rare to be allergic to fire ant stings, but if you are, you'll need to get medical treatment immediately. Swelling and pain are normal, but if you have these symptoms, get to an emergency care center or hospital immediately:


Hives, itching and swelling in areas other than the place where you were bitten.
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Tightness in the chest and difficulty breathing.
Swelling of the throat, tongue and lips, or difficulty swallowing.
Anaphylactic shock, which occurs in the most severe cases, can lead to dizziness, blackout, and cardiac arrest if not treated right away.

, You allergic reaction will be treated with epinephrine, antihistamines or steroids at the hospital to stabilize your symptoms.


If you know yourself to be allergic to fire ant stings, you might already be carrying an epinephrine shot, commonly called an epi-pen (epinephrine). Inject yourself or have a friend help you, then proceed to the hospital.

, While you're on your way home to get further treatment, hold your arm in an elevated position to help minimize the swelling.

, Gently wash the area to remove dirt and any other debris from the area. This will help prevent an infection.

, This will help to alleviate the itching by bringing down the swelling and numbing the stung area.

, These over-the-counter medicines will help alleviate the pain and itching.

, After a few hours, the swelling will subside a little and a blister will form. As long as you don't pop the blister, the area shouldn't become infected. Avoid scratching it, as this can cause it to break.


If the blister breaks, cleanse the area with soapy water and monitor it for signs of infection.
If the area becomes discolored or starts leaking pus, it may have become infected. Seek medical attention immediately.

,


After brushing off the ants, immediately rinse the area with rubbing alcohol and leave it wet.
Elevate the area and sprinkle a generous amount of meat tenderizer on the area.This will prevent the effects of the sting from progressing beyond the moment of treatment.

, Golfers sometimes use this method in Florida.


Keep a bottle of liquid hand sanitizer handy in your bag.
Apply the hand sanitizer to the bite area liberally after freeing your skin of ants.
Let it stay in place. This will help alleviate the burn for the time being and the usual symptoms may not kick in for hours, allowing you to continue with your activity.
Take Benadryl or equivalent antihistamine when you get back home.

,


A paste made from baking soda and vinegar may also work. As can vinegar on its own.,


Be aware that ice can burn skin if kept on it for too long.

, A common product that contains ammonia is Windex or any other window cleaner product. This will minimize the effects of the stings.

Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke.",How to Stay Safe in the Sun," Contrary to popular belief, the SPF, or ""sun protective factor"" number, does not signify how strong the SPF is. It tells you how long it will keep you protected from ultraviolet B (UVB) rays––at least theoretically. It is calculated by how many minutes it would normally take for your skin to burn multiplied by the number (SPF value) that tells you how long it should last. So, if you burn in 5 minutes of sun exposure without any protection, SPF 30 will keep you protected for 150 minutes (in theory).The American Academy of Dermatology recommends an SPF of 30 or higher. It is not recommended to use higher SPF formulas because they give a false sense of security in the sun and a higher dose of chemicals on your skin. In fact, experts now say that sunscreen with values above SPF 50 do not provide any more real protection than sunscreen with values below SPF 50.;
, UVB rays are what cause sunburn. However, UVA rays also cause skin damage, including signs of aging like wrinkles or spots. Both types of UV light increase your risk of skin cancer.Look for sunscreen that provides broad spectrum protection, meaning that the sunblock will protect against both kinds of damaging ultraviolet light.The SPF factor refers only to the sunscreen’s ability to block UVB rays.The “Broad spectrum” label refers to the ability to block both.

, Some chemicals are allergens (like parabens), potential hormone disruptors (such as oxybenzone), or just plain unnecessary (like fragrances and other inactive ingredients).Retinoids (a form of vitamin A) are a common inactive ingredient in sunscreens. Canadian studies suggest that these additives can increase your sensitivity to UV light from the sun.Oxybenzone is believed to be a hormone disruptor. It can mimic estrogen in the body and has been shown to alter sperm production in males and may cause endometriosis in women.Octinoxate is another ingredient believed to be a hormone disruptor. Octinoxate can mimic hormones and has been shown to affect the reproductive system and the thyroid in laboratory studies. It can also cause an allergic reaction on some users' skin.Homosalate is a commonly-reported hormone disruptor that may also be toxic when broken down inside the body.Octocrylene has a relatively high rate of reported skin allergies in some users.Paraben chemicals are commonly used as preservatives in sunscreen. Butyl-, ethyl-, methyl-, and propyl-parabens are believed to be linked to allergic reactions, hormone disruption, and toxicity in the body.Look for a PABA-free sunscreen. Para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA, was used in sunscreens for a long time, but it can cause an allergic reaction in some people, and has been linked to severe liver toxicity at high doses.Avoid sunscreens with added insect repellent. Added insect repellent can actually reduce the effectiveness of sunscreen, and added sunscreen can increase the toxicity of chemicals in an insect repellent. For this reason, experts recommend using two separate products: an effective sunscreen and a safe insect repellent., Remember, no sunscreen is truly waterproof, so you should reapply the sunscreen frequently, according to package instructions.Recent updates to FDA regulations have changed the way water resistance may be labeled on sunscreen in the United States. Labels must now indicate water resistance according to one of two categories: 40-minute protection or 80-minute protection., Wearing sunscreen need not be unpleasant, so try different sunscreen brands and styles to find the one(s) that are best suited for you.Some daily sunscreens aren't as gooey or smelly as some of the heavy-duty outdoor sport formulations.
Some sunscreens come in spray-on, roll-on, and stick formats. However, experts warn that spray-on and powdered sunscreens may cause lung irritation due to the risk of inhalation of the chemical contents. Additionally, these formats may not be as effective at protecting your skin as a liquid-based sunscreen.However, spray sunscreens may be helpful for hairy areas, such as the chest or head.Alcohol or gel-based sunscreens may be more effective for people with oily skin.For those who wear moisturizer, many daily moisturizers contain sunscreen protection. However, if you are using both a moisturizer and sunscreen, add the moisturizer first, then add sunscreen. This helps maximize absorption and protection., Mineral-based UV filters like zinc and titanium are considered least likely to cause an allergic reaction in children and people with sensitive skin, but they may be less effective than chemical-based UV filter sunscreen.Most sunscreens are fine to apply on children older than 6 months.It's generally recommended that you avoid using sunscreen for babies under 6 months of age. Experts say that shade is the best preventative measure (natural, or from an umbrella). If you must use sunscreen on a baby under 6 months of age, consult with your child's pediatrician to decide a safe course of action.Spot test any sunscreen on children. Children's skin is more sensitive and likely to react to sunscreen, so make sure that your child won't have an unpleasant reaction to a tiny amount before applying it all over., In the US, sunscreen must remain effective for at least 3 years after it is manufactured. However, you should always note and follow expiration dates to ensure that you get the best protection.If the bottle does not have an expiration date when you buy it, write the date of purchase on a label and put it on the bottle. That way you will know when it’s time to buy new product.

, It takes about 30 minutes for the chemical agents in sunscreen to fully bind to your skin and offer protection. Apply sunscreen before you go outside, about 30 minutes before you’ll be exposed to the sun.Don’t forget your lips! Apply a lip balm with SPF 45-60 minutes before going outdoors., If you're using a cream, the amount of sunscreen you should use is about the size of a regular golf ball, or 1 ounce (about the quantity it would take to fill a shot glass).Use more than you think you need. During an extended beach outing, you should plan on using between a quarter to half of an 8-ounce bottle.Be sure to cover the most vulnerable areas of your body––the entire face and forehead, especially the nose and tips of your ears, as well as your scalp, the back of the neck, backs of your knees and hands, and arms. Don't forget the tops of your feet, if you're wearing sandals - sunburned feet can be very sore! Any skin that will be exposed to sunlight should be covered.
Don't just grease it on. Put a little on and rub it in. Then do it again and again, until you have a deep, penetrating layer of sunscreen. Do it right and you won't notice it at all, and it will truly protect you from the sun.
Have a friend help with hard-to-reach spots like backs and shoulders.

, Factor in conditions like sweating and/or swimming. As sweat or water washes away the sunscreen you've applied, you will usually need to reapply more sunscreen more quickly than the quoted SPF value would indicate., Light layers of clothing with a tight weave work best.Try a shell or tank top, and then wear a light long-sleeved camp shirt open over that. Long pants will offer more protection than shorts. Natural fibers like cotton are coolest.


Although light clothing does not absorb heat as much as dark clothing, dark clothing offers more sun protection.Very thin clothing, such as a white t-shirt, does not offer much sun protection. Apply sunblock under your clothes if you’re wearing light, loosely-woven clothes.If you’re going swimming, consider a long-sleeved swim shirt, or “rash guard.” These can help you avoid burning while you’re in the water.

, A lot of clothing, especially that from outdoor activity stores, will carry a label indicating the UV protection level of the clothing., Choose a hat with at least a 3-inch (8 cm) brim all around.Baseball caps leave the ears and neck exposed, so they're not the best choice for sun protection.
A hat will also help to protect your eyes from glare.
Make sure children wear sun hats as well. Choose hats that shade the face and the neck., Choose sunglasses that block UV light and wrap around to block light from the sides, too. Long term exposure to UV light can lead to cataracts and may expose the skin of your eyelids to UV radiation. Wear sunglasses in conjunction with a hat to optimize your eye protection.If you're not sure whether your old sunglasses adequately block UV rays, ask an optometrist to have them checked.

, Water is the best choice for keeping hydrated on warm and hot days (and cold days too!). Experts recommend that males consume around 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day, and females should consume about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day.Experts recommend that you drink about 1 cup of water every 15-20 minutes if you are doing moderate activity outside in the heat.Experts advise that water can usually hydrate you better than sports drinks, despite the touted benefits of electrolytes. That's because most sports drinks have high levels of sugar and sodium. Although these are electrolytes, sugar also contains a lot of calories and salt can dehydrate you.If you’re concerned about your electrolyte levels, grab a handful of pretzels or nuts to help restore them., Both can dehydrate you, and are best avoided. The occasional cold soda is unlikely to cause dehydration,but it’s best to stick to water for hydration purposes. Additionally, alcohol can impair your judgment and increase response time. Up to 70% of deaths in adults and teens that occur during water recreational activities are linked to alcohol.If you do have the occasional summer beer, make sure to drink at least twice as much water as alcohol.

, Thirst occurs in the human body after dehydration has already occurred, so it's important to sip water throughout the day to avoid thirst altogether., If you have an infant, make sure s/he stays well hydrated by giving him or her at least the usual amount of breast milk or formula while you’re outside.In addition, check with your doctor to see when your baby can have small amounts of water, juice, or infant oral electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte or Enfalyte in addition to formula or breast milk.


Because babies don’t sweat the same as adults, they are at greater risk of becoming overheated and dehydrated when outside. Keep a careful eye on your child to make sure s/he is safe and comfortable., The National Weather Service uses weather forecast information to create a daily index that assesses the risk of damage caused by UV exposure. Knowing in advance what the index predicts for that day can help you avoid getting burned., This is especially important between the peak hours of 10 AM and 2 PM; UV is at its highest around the middle of the day, when the sun is directly overhead.If you are outdoors during this time, stay in the shade. You can still sunburn in the shade (or even on overcast days), but shade will help protect you.Create your own shade. As well as using a hat, carrying an umbrella or parasol and making use of it to keep off the sun is a very good way of keeping you safe.
If you have heavy physical activity to perform outside, try to do it in the morning or evening, not the heat of midday. If you do have to work midday, take plenty of breaks and drink at least 1 cup of water every 15-20 minutes.When walking babies and children outdoors, choose the coolest parts of the day. Use a shade canopy over a baby's stroller and ensure that children are adequately covered with clothing, hats, sunglasses and sunscreen when out in the heat of the day.

, UV intensity is correlated with the angle of the sun relative to your position on earth. If your body is casting a short shadow, you may want to retreat into the shade., Spending too much time in the sun can cause heat exhaustion in addition to sunburn. Wet a towel with cool water and place it on your forehead or neck to help you cool down.


Take a swim. Submerging your body in cool water can help lower your body temperature--but don't let it drop too low. Body temperatures can drop 25 times faster in cold water than in cold air, and if your body temperature drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, you may experience hypothermia.Knowing the water temperature and air temperature forecasts in advance can help you avoid extreme swings in body temperature.

, Roll up car windows and run the air conditioning rather than dangling your arm out the window. Glass blocks UV light reasonably well, but you should still apply sunscreen to yourself and any passengers.If you’re lucky enough to drive a convertible, make sure to apply sunscreen and wear a protective hat.

, If you experience any of the following symptoms, get out of the sun (preferably someplace cool) and drink plenty of fluids:skin that is hot to the touch
excessive sweating
dizziness or disorientation
fatigue
nausea or vomiting
rapid heartbeat
dark and/or infrequent urination
If symptoms do not improve after a half hour, seek medical attention immediately.

Use glue.,
Try using tape.,
Use tweezers.,
Try using pantyhose.,
Try buffing off the needles.",How to Remove Cactus Needles1," Considered the most effective way to remove cactus needles, using white school glue on your skin will help peel out the majority of glochids. Spread a layer of the white glue onto your skin over the top of the small cactus needles. Wait 5-10 minutes for the glue to dry, and then peel off the glue. The glochids should come out of the skin and stick to the glue. Repeat this process as necessary to remove all of the needles.;
, Duct tape has proven successful in removing glochids from the skin. Simply stretch a piece of duct tape over the area where the cactus needles are stuck. Press the duct tape onto the skin, and rub it onto the needles gently to make sure they are stuck. Then, grab one end of the duct tape and quickly rip it off, pulling the glochids up with it. If necessary, repeat this with fresh pieces of tape until all of the needles are removed.







, Tweezers may be time-consuming, but they allow you to remove all of visible needle-hairs that might be stuck. Move into an area with bright light – natural light is preferable – and use a magnifying glass if necessary. Carefully pluck each of the needles from your skin near the base of the needle, where it meets your skin. Using this technique in addition to one of the aforementioned techniques may be the least annoying and most effective means.








, Although it may not remove 100% of the needles, using pantyhose is a good way to quickly pull out glochids. Grab an old pair of pantyhose (that you don't mind throwing away afterwards), and ball them up. Rub this quickly back and forth across your skin; the cactus needles should stick to the pantyhose and be pulled out as you rub. Continue this using new sections of the hose until all of the needles have been removed.








, If you have needles on a part of your body that isn’t particularly sensitive – such as your feet – you can buff off the needles. Buffing won’t pull them out, but it will break off the tips of the needles. Use a pumice stone to rub back and forth over your skin at the location of the needles. You can rinse off your skin with water afterwards to remove any needles that might be left.

Consider seeing a doctor.",How to Soothe a Burnt Tongue2," Look for cough drops that contain benzocaine, menthol or phenol. All of these ingredients act as local anesthetic, numbing your tongue and helping to relieve pain. Anesthetic mouthwash which contains these ingredients may help as well.

, Chewing a gum that contains menthol can help to activate the cold-sensitive receptors on your tongue, making your tongue feel nice and cool. Both peppermint and spearmint flavor gums contain menthol derivatives., If the pain in your tongue is very bad, consider taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen. This will ease the pain and help to bring down any swelling.

, Most burn creams and ointments are designed for topical use only.


They should not be applied to the tongue, as they may contain ingredients that are toxic if ingested.
The only exception to this are burn creams and ointments that are designed specifically for oral use.

, If your burnt tongue remains painful or swollen for more than 7 days, it is recommended that you see a doctor. The doctor may prescribe stronger forms of pain relief or medication to speed healing.


If the burning sensation in your tongue arises on its own, without having physically burned it on hot food or drink, you may have a condition known as burnt tongue syndrome. This can be very painful and may affect other areas of the mouth.
If you suspect that you may have burnt tongue syndrome, it is recommended that you see your doctor immediately as it may be a symptom of a more serious underlying issue such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, depression or food allergy."

Avoid touching the spines.,
Use tweezers to remove the spines.,
Clean the wound.",How to Remove Cactus Needles2," Even though the big cactus spines might appear easy enough to grab out with your fingers, they often contain small hair-like needles known as glochids. Touching these even very lightly will get them stuck in your skin, and they’re much more difficult to remove than spines. Leave the spine, and stick to using tools to pull it out.








, Carefully pinch the base of the spine with the tweezers as close to the skin as you can get. Slowly pull out to remove the spine, pulling in the same direction as the spine.








, Because cactus spines are rather large, they often leave small puncture wounds that may or may not bleed. Regardless of any blood present, you should clean the wound so that it does not become infected. Use witch hazel or hydrogen peroxide to clean the cut; pour some onto a cotton pad, and dab it onto the cut. Use a bandaid or gauze pad to bandage the wound, if necessary.

Distinguish the radius from the ulna.,
Know the characteristics of the distal end of the radius.,
Understand how the radius connects to the wrist.",How to Classify Distal Radius Fractures1," The radius is the larger of the two forearm bones. When the palm of the hand faces forward, the radius is the outer bone.;
, The distal end of the radius is biconcave and triangular, and it is covered with hyaline cartilage. It has a smooth ridge that divides its articular surface into two facets: a triangular lateral facet, which connects with the scaphoid (a wrist bone), and a quadrilateral medial facet, which connects with the lunate (another wrist bone).


The lateral surface of the distal radius elongates into the prominent radial styloid process, which attaches to the brachioradialis muscle.
The medial surface of the distal radius forms a semicircular notch, also covered with hyaline cartilage, which connects with the head of the ulna. This is what allows the radius to swing around the ulna.

, The wrist joint is formed by the lower ends of the radius and ulna, all eight carpal (wrist) bones, and the upper ends of all five metacarpal (hand) bones.

Follow a rehabilitation program to regain knee mobility and strength.",How to Avoid Re Tearing an ACL," Squats are a very effective exercise for avoid ACL re injury, as they strengthen the gluteal and gracilis muscles that help in supporting of the hip joints and the knee joints. To do a squat:


Stand about one foot away from a wall, then lean back until your back is touching it.
Slide down the wall, bending your knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Don't allow your knees to extend beyond your toes.
Hold this position for 10 to 15 seconds, then return to the starting position and repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.;
, This exercise helps to strengthen the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and rectus femoralis — a group of muscles that support the knee joint. To do one-legged bridges:


Lie on your back on the ground, facing a wall. Bend one knee, but extend the other leg so your foot is against the wall.
Use your bent leg for support as you lift your hips and straight leg off the floor, so your body forms a diagonal line from your foot to your shoulders.
Hold this position for 10 to 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat the exercise 10 to 12 times.

, This forward lunge exercise helps to support the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius and gracilis — muscles which support the thighs and knee joints To do a forward lunge:


Stand up straight with your feet one shoulder-width apart. Take a large step forward with one foot and bend your knees until the front knee forms a 90 degree angle and the back knee is almost touching the floor. Make sure the knee of the front foot doesn't extend beyond the toes.
Next, take a large step forward with the back foot and repeat the exercise, this time with the opposite leg in front. Keep performing the lunges, in a walking motion, until you have completed 10 to 15 steps. This counts as 1 set. Repeat for 2 to 3 sets.

, Performing small, controlled jumps allows you to practice landing properly, putting minimum stress on the knees. This landing technique can then be applied when you return to sporting activities. To do the jumps:


Stand with your feet one shoulder width apart and take a small jump forward. Try to land on both feet simultaneously, as this helps to distribute your weight and avoids putting more stress on one knee than the other.
It is very important to bend your knees as you land, as this absorbs the shock of the jump and avoids stressing the knee joints and the ACL. Try to maintain proper body alignment, with the hips placed over the knees and the knees placed over the ankles.Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times, for 2 to 3 sets. Once your knees have become stronger, you can increase the intensity of this exercise by jumping off a low box (up to 12 inches in height) instead.

, Performing balance exercises helps the injured knee to regain stability while also strengthening the gluteal and gracilis muscles that support the thigh and knees.Stand on your injured leg on a stable surface with the slightly bent and your body properly aligned (knee over ankle, hip over knee). Try to hold the one-legged stance for 10 to 30 seconds, before relaxing. Repeat 8 to 12 times on each leg.
As your balance improves, you can make the exercise more difficult by closing your eyes as you do it, lifting the opposite knee up and down, standing on an unstable surface, or throwing a ball back and forth with a partner.

, Resistance bands help to strengthen the knee joint and the surrounding muscles, by making them work harder to perform a simple action. Resistance bands can be used in a multitude of exercises, to increase their difficulty level. Here are a few simple exercises you can do:


Sit on a chair with your back straight and place a resistance band around your ankles. Raise your injured leg until the band is stretched and you feel resistance in your quadriceps. Repeat 10 times.
Lie on the floor on your stomach and place one end of the resistance band around the ankle of your injured leg and the other around a sturdy object (like the leg of a table). Bend your leg at the knee, bringing your heel towards your butt, until the band is stretched and you feel resistance in your hamstrings. Repeat 10 times., Wearing a knee brace following an ACL tear can help you to avoid re-injury. The brace is made from lightweight materials that support the knee and protect the ligaments inside the joint.


There are different types of knee braces depending on the type of physical activity you intend to pursue — lightweight ones for people who just want to go for a daily walk, or more heavy duty ones for athletes returning to sport., It is essential to warm up properly before doing any form of exercise, as this warms the muscles, joints and ligaments and prepares them for physical activity. This significantly reduces the chance of injury.


You can warm up by doing 5 to 10 minutes of dynamic stretching, such as jumping jacks, straight leg kicks or running on the spot.

, Pushing yourself too far too soon is one surefire way to re-tear your ACL. It is essential that you go through the entire rehabilitation process following an injury to regain full strength and mobility in your knee joint, and that you delay returning to your regular exercise or sports routine until your physical therapist gives you the okay.


When performing the rehabilitation exercises, it is essential that you stop or decrease the intensity of the exercise once you start to feel any pain. These exercises should challenge the muscles, ligaments and joints, but they shouldn't be painful.

, If you have already experienced an ACL injury, you are probably familiar with the symptoms of a torn ACL. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms early on so you can seek treatment and begin the path to recovery. Symptoms of a torn ACL include:


A popping or cracking sound at the time of the injury.
Pain that ranges from moderate to severe, depending on the extent of the injury.
Swelling and inflammation around the knee joint, accompanied by tenderness, redness and a feeling of warmth.
Inability to move or extend the knee, or knee instability., Immediately following an ACL injury or tear the RICE method must be used to prevent the injury from becoming any worse and begin the healing process. The RICE method works as follows:


Rest: The knee must be rested for at least the first 72 hours following the injury. Avoid doing any form of physical activity.
Ice: Apply an ice pack or cold compress to the injured knee for 10 to 20 minutes intervals. This reduces swelling and inflammation.
Compression: Wear an elasticated knee brace around the injured knee to support the joint, prevent unnecessary movement and prevent swelling.
Elevation: The knee must be elevated above heart level using cushions and pillows to prevent and reduce swelling., Following an ACL tear, your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to relieve pain and bring down swelling. The most commonly prescribed NSAIDS include ibuprofen and Voltaren.


If you have a history of gastrointestinal upsets, gastric or peptic ulcers, renal or hepatic diseases, or you are currently taking any blood thinners such as Warfarin, you need to be very cautious about taking NSAIDS, so speak to your doctor first.

, For most people, following the RICE protocol and and completing a thorough rehabilitation program will be enough to restore full mobility and strength to the knee. However, in the case of severe injuries, surgery may be required to repair the torn ACL. This surgery is particularly common amongst athletes.


The surgery is normally performed several weeks following the injury to allow time for the swelling and inflammation to go down.

, Regardless of whether you have undergone surgery or not, a thorough rehabilitation program (usually lasting for up to 6 months) will be necessary to return your knee to full strength and mobility. For more detailed information on how to rehabilitate your knee following an ACL injury, see this article.

If you think you're going to be getting dirty often while your cast is on, neons or pastels might not be such a good choice., Some doctors offer you the option of embellishing your cast with accents like glitter and designs.If your doctor doesn't do this, go to your local craft store to decorate your cast. Buy glitter, stickers, or paint. If your dominant hand is broken or if you don't think of yourself as an artist, ask a friend or your art teacher to help you., Cover it with a plastic bag while you're eating or drinking. Keep dirt and sand away from the cast if you're playing outdoors.A clean cast will prevent skin irritation. It will also keep the color intact so that you can save it when it comes off., Fiberglass can get damp, but it can still cause itching if you get it too wet.If you can afford it, buy a cast cover from your doctor or pharmacist. You could also fit a clean plastic bag from bread or produce over your cast. Check it for holes and put it in place. Then, wrap some medical tape around the opening of the bag., Pens and pencils won't show up very well on fiberglass casts. To make it easier for your friends, carry at least one permanent marker with you. If you've chosen a light-colored cast, make sure your marker is dark. Black or dark blue is a good choice. If your cast is a darker color, have a silver or other light-colored marker ready. Sharpie is the best known brand of permanent markers. You can buy them in a variety of sizes and colors.If you have a small cast but lots of friends, stick to a marker with a thinner nib so that everyone cat fit their signatures. If you have a larger cast, you could go for a marker with a thicker nib.
Avoid washable markers, which can smear if you get your cast wet. You should also avoid highlighters, which won't show up very well.

, You don't want to throw your cool new work of art in the trash after you heal. Tell your doctor you want to keep your cast after they remove it. Make sure you do this before they start the process. This way, they'll be careful to do as little damage as possible if they have to cut it."

Recognize Colle’s fracture.,
Identify Smith’s fracture.,
Understand Barton’s fracture.,
Recognize Chauffeur’s fracture.,
Identify die punch fracture.",How to Classify Distal Radius Fractures2," Colle’s fracture is the most common distal radius fracture, and it occurs in all age groups, although it is especially prevalent in older men and women with osteoporosis (reduced bone density). It typically occurs when someone falls onto an outstretched arm, bending the hand backward at the wrist.


Colle’s fractures occur at the metaphyseal region (right above the end of the bone, where growth takes place). The articular surface remains intact, and the broken fragment is displaced backward, where it gets impacted.
In about fifty percent of all cases, there is also an ulnar styloid fracture.
The typical treatment for a Colle’s fracture is closed reduction and immobilization in a “Colle’s cast,” which extends from just below the elbow to the knuckles of the hand. If the fracture is unstable, it may need to be treated with open reduction and internal fixation – surgical procedures designed to correct fractures that won’t heal properly with a splint or cast.

, Smith’s fracture occurs in the same location as Colle’s fracture; in fact, it is often referred to as a “reversed Colle’s fracture.” Less common than Colle’s fracture, it typically occurs when someone falls backward onto the palm of an outstretched hand (or, in some cases, when there is a direct blow to the back of the forearm). The fractured segment, hand, and wrist are displaced forward relative to the forearm.


The typical treatment for a Smith’s fracture is closed reduction and immobilization in a cast. If the displacement is severe, it may need to be treated surgically – with open reduction and internal fixation, like a Colle’s fracture.

, Barton’s fracture also occurs at the distal end of the radius, but it is accompanied by a dislocation of the radio-carpal joint (the joint that connects the radius to the wrist bones). The fractured piece may be pushed backward or forward.


In many cases, a Barton’s fracture happens along with a fracture of the radial styloid process.
Unlike Colle’s and Smith’s fractures, Barton’s fractures are usually visible on an x-ray.
Typical treatment is surgical: the doctor will open the arm and align the bones, fixing them with a plate and screws. In some cases, if the fracture is less severe, it may be treated without surgery.

, Chauffeur’s fracture (sometimes called backfire fracture or Hutchinson fracture) occurs when the scaphoid bone is compressed, fracturing the radial styloid process. It occurs when someone falls on an outstretched arm, and the hand is deviated outward, with the palm facing forward.


Ligaments typically maintain the alignment of the styloid process with the carpus; however, the broken fragment might be significantly displaced from the rest of the radius.
In general, treatment is surgical: the doctor will open the arm and fix the styloid with stainless steel pins or a cannulated lag screw.

, Die punch fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius. It is a depression fracture of the lunate fossa (a concave surface at the distal end of the radius, which accommodates the lunate, one of the wrist bones). The joint becomes unstable due to radiolunate ligament avulsion.


One treatment option for a die punch fracture is percutaneous pinning, in which the fracture is manipulated to a near normal position (with the help of an x-ray). Pins are then inserted through the skin along the fragmented bones, keeping them in line. They are kept in place for four to six weeks and removed as the fractured pieces rejoin.
Another option is external fixation, in which holes are drilled above and below the fracture site. Screws are fixed in the holes and connected by a rod with special ball-and-socket joints. These joints are adjusted to keep the fractured pieces in alignment. When the x-ray shows evidence of healing, the joints can be removed.

Understand the Frykman classification.,
Know the Melone classification.,
Consider the universal classification.",How to Classify Distal Radius Fractures3," This classification method considers articular involvement, as well as radio-carpal and radio-ulnar joints and the presence of absence of an ulnar fracture. There are six varieties of distal radius fractures under the Frykman classification system.


Under this classification system, “Type I” refers to an extra-articular and transverse metaphyseal fracture.
“Type II” refers to a “Type I” fracture that also includes a distal ulnar fracture.
“Type III” refers to an intra-articular fracture that involves the radio-carpal joint.
“Type IV” refers to a “Type III” fracture that also includes a distal ulnar fracture.
“Type V” refers to a severe fracture that includes the distal radio-ulnar and radio-carpal joints.
“Type VI” refers to a “Type V” fracture that also includes a distal ulnar fracture.

, This classification method is used for intra-articular fractures only. It considers the shaft, radial styloid, and dorsal medial and palmar medial parts. There are four varieties of distal radius fractures under the Melone classification system.


Under this classification system, “Type I” refers to a fracture that is stable and minimally displaced.
“Type II” refers to a die punch fracture of the radioscaphoid joint, which is unstable and moderately to severely displaced. This kind of fracture involved backward angulation and a shortening of the radius, and percutaneous pins are typically used to maintain reduction. In “Type IIb” fractures, there is a double die punch fracture, with fragmentation of both the inner and rear piece. This type of fracture is typically treated surgically, with internal fixation and iliac bone grafting.
“Type III” refers to a die punch or lunate load fracture, which also includes a radial shaft fracture that projects forward. The lunate bones puts pressure on the lower end of the radius. The surgical placement of small screws or wires is typically necessary to stabilize the joint.
“Type IV” refers to a severe fracture that involves all the major joint articular surfaces, including the radioscaphoid and lunate joints. Broken fragments may be separated widely or rotated. In almost all cases, a “Type IV” fracture needs surgical treatment: open reduction and internal fixation.

, This classification method is the simplest; it considers only articular involvement and displacement. It also differentiates stable from unstable fractures. There are four varieties of distal radial fractures under the Melone classification system.


Under this classification system, “Type I” refers to an extra-articular and undisplaced fracture.
“Type II” refers to an extra-articular but displaced fracture.
“Type III” refers to an intra-articular and undisplaced fracture.
“Type IV” refers to an intra-articular and displaced fracture.

Recognize the Torus fracture.,
Identify the greenstick fracture.,
Know epiphyseal fractures.",How to Classify Distal Radius Fractures4," Distal radial fractures are very common in children, often occurring due to a fall or sports injury. Certain classifications (usually extra-articular) are specific to children, including the Torus fracture – a mild bulging of the cortex at the distal end of the radius. The cortex is the outer, hard part of the bone. In Torus fractures, there is no displacement because the fracture is incomplete. It heals rapidly with cast immobilization.

, Greenstick fractures are also incomplete; they occur when the bone is bent suddenly by a fall on an outstretched hand or a direct perpendicular blow. The convex side of the bone is broken, but the concave surface remains intact.

, Epiphyseal fractures occur at the growth plate of the radius and are subdivided into five types based on the location of the fracture line. Also known as a “Salter-Harris fracture,” an epiphyseal fracture sometimes involves premature fusion of the growth plate, leading to shortening of the limb.

Read the manufacturer's instructions.,
Gather your supplies to prepare for washing.,
Fill the bowl with warm (not hot) water.,
Mix the ingredients together well with a large spoon or whisk.,
Remove the brace from your wrist.,
Remove metal splints inside the brace, if necessary.,
Rub the cleaning solution on the wrist brace using a clean, lint-free cloth.,
Rinse the wrist brace.,
Squeeze excess water out of the brace.,
Return the metal strips to the brace when it has completely dried, if necessary.",How to Clean a Wrist Brace1," If there are instructions on how to clean the brace, read them carefully to ensure that you don't damage the fabric or structure. The fabric of your brace needs to remain both strong and flexible in order to support your wrist during daily activities or exercise.


You can find these instructions on the brace itself or enclosed within the product packaging.
Usually these instructions will include specific information about the proper washing temperature, proper chemical detergents, and safe drying techniques.;
, In order to wash the brace, you’ll need: laundry detergent, a clean cloth, a large bowl, and a colander. Gathering your supplies in advance will save you time and energy.


Use only mild detergent, in order to protect the synthetic fibers of your brace and the skin of your hands.
You may substitute 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dish soap for laundry detergent., Most powdered detergents are designed for use with warm water, and warm water is recommended for man-made materials, as it removes stains and dirt with a lower chance of shrinking your brace than hot water.You can also try a coldwater detergent as a more eco-friendly option, as a number of coldwater alternatives are equally efficient at cleaning fabrics., Make sure that the detergent fully dissolves to avoid leaving residue on the brace, which could damage the fabric quality and irritate your skin.

, Move with care and attention to your injury or pain, as your wrist will no longer have the support of the brace.

, The chemicals in your detergent may damage or rust the metal components of the brace. Take note of the proper location for the metal splints so that you can replace them correctly after washing., Using the cloth, instead of just your hand, will reduce your exposure to potentially harsh chemicals and will ensure a more thorough clean.


Avoid vigorous rubbing that may damage the fibers of the brace.Pay attention to small, hidden areas, especially between the finger area, to fully remove dirt and bacteria.

, If your faucet has a sprayer, place the brace in the colander and rinse. If not, submerge the brace in a clean bowl of water and squeeze the water through until clear.Rinse completely: residue remaining in the brace could irritate your skin.
Avoid using running water, as the force of the water may stretch the fabric and reduce its effectiveness., Avoid ""wringing,"" or twisting while squeezing, in order to prevent damaging the brace. Twisting can pull the fibers of the fabric apart and weaken the brace's support structure.Lay the brace flat on a dry towel, then gently roll the towel and brace together to remove more water.Avoid hanging to dry, as the weight of the water may stretch the fabric. Do not dry the brace in direct sunlight, as the artificial materials of the brace can shrink when exposed to hot temperatures, and the UV rays of the sun may bleach or lighten the colors of the brace., The synthetic fabric will dry quickly in just a few hours, although be sure check interior of any splint pockets to ensure they are thoroughly dry. Dampness in those slots could damage the metal components and decrease the long-term usability of the brace.

, This will keep your muscles loose and in better condition, and you will feel better later on.

, Icing can't hurt, and it can stop injuries quickly before they force you to take time off.

, Lunges, squats, and calf raises are great for your legs, while you can exercise your feet by scrunching a towel with your toes, and trying to balance on one leg. There are many other exercises that are good for you, but spending a few minutes each day addressing weaknesses in your body can do a lot to prevent injuries.

Cover the cut.,
Change your dressing regularly.,
Wash the cut each day.,
Avoid picking the wound.,
Go to the emergency room under certain circumstances.,
Check if you need a tetanus shot.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Care for a Cut," You do not want to touch a cut with dirty hands. Before attempting to clean your cut, wash your hands with soap and water.Lather your hands in soap and wash them for about 20 seconds. Make sure to wash under your fingernails and on the backs of your hands.If you have disposable gloves, it's a good idea to put these on in addition to washing your hands. This can help prevent infection.;
, Usually, a cut should stop bleeding on its own. If it does not stop bleeding on its own, you can control the bleeding by applying direct pressure on the cut. Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze when doing this.Elevate the wound while applying pressure.
You do not need to press too hard. Gentle pressure should be enough.

, Clean the cut with antibacterial soap and water and remove as much dirt from the cut as possible. You should also clean around the wound with soap and a washcloth.If any dirt or debris are still in the cut after you wash it, use tweezers to carefully remove it.
Just use antibacterial soap. Things like hydrogen peroxide and iodine can irritate the wound.

, Use an antibiotic ointment (such as Neosporin and Polysporin) to prevent infection. It may burn slightly at first, but the burning will eventually subside.Keep in mind these products do not make the wound heal faster, so don't expect speedy results. They can act to prevent infection, so they are important to use.
For some people, antibiotic ointments can cause a mild rash. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment.

, Depending on the size of the cut, put on the appropriate sized Band-Aid or bandage over the cut. This can help shield your wound from harmful bacteria. While most cuts should be covered, very minor cuts and scrapes do not require covering., Change the bandage frequently to prevent infection and moisture from getting into the cut. If you find you're allergic to adhesives found in bandages, use sterile gauze or adhesive-free bandages. These can be secured in place with paper tape., When you're changing the bandage, gently wash the wound again. This can help prevent infection. You should use soap and water, and always avoid substances like hydrogen peroxide and iodine., Eventually, a scab will form. This means the wound is healing. Do not pick at the scab. This can prolong the healing process and leave you with a scar.If you have trouble resisting the temptation to pick, try clipping your nails short or wearing gloves.

, Normally, a cut is not a major medical concern; however, under certain circumstances, you should go to the nearest ER for evaluation.Go to the ER if the skin is separated enough that you can push it together.
A wound that won't stop bleeding requires immediate medical attention.
A wound made by a high impact object, like a bullet, should be evaluated by a doctor in an ER.
If your wound is caused by an animal or human bite, seek medical help. If a rusty object caused your wound, you also need medical attention.
A cut located on or across a joint requires medical attention.

, Look at your vaccination records and see if you're up to date on your tetanus vaccinations. This is particularly important if a wound is very deep or dirty. If you have not had a tetanus shout in the past five years, make an appointment to get one., Redness, increased pain, drainage (yellow or greenish-colored pus), swelling, and warmth all indicate an infection. If your cut shows signs of being infected during the healing process, see your doctor."

Recognize the symptoms of a broken jaw.,
Stabilize your jaw.,
Apply a cold compress.",How to Care for a Broken Jaw1," You may have injured your jaw by falling, getting in a car accident, being assaulted, or suffering from a sports or recreational injury. You will most definitely know if you have broken your jaw. If you think you may have broken your jaw, you may be experiencing some of the following symptoms:A swollen or bruised face
Problems opening your mouth wide or closing your mouth
Loose or damaged teeth
Numbness on your face, particularly in your lower lip area
Jaw pain or tenderness that is worse when you bite or chew
Bleeding from your mouth
Pain in your face or jaw that gets worse when you move
A lump or abnormal appearance of your cheek or jaw
Upper and lower teeth do not match up when you bite down;
, Hold your jaw in place with your hands or use a bandage. Wrap the bandage under your jaw and over the top of your head. Be careful not to wrap the bandage too tight. You may feel the urge to throw up because of your injury, so you need to be able to easily remove the bandage.Keeping your jaw stabilized can prevent any further injury until you can get to the emergency room.
If you do not have a bandage, try using a scarf, neck tie, or handkerchief.

, A cold compress can help reduce swelling. Keep the ice or cold compress on for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.If you are using ice, wrap the ice in a towel first to prevent frostbite.Lightly place the compress on your jaw. Too much pressure can cause more pain and damage.
If you don't have an ice pack or compress, you can use a bag of frozen vegetables, like peas or corn.

Return the metal splints to the brace when it has completely dried, if necessary.",How to Clean a Wrist Brace2," The label should indicate machine temperature and/or cycle setting, such as ""Gentle Cycle.""


If the label includes a water temperature, but not a cycle setting, you can assume the regular cycle is appropriate.
Consider always using ""Gentle Cycle"" setting in order to protect the fabric fibers from too much agitation in the machine and to extend the life of your brace.

, Be sure to move with care and attention to your injury, as your wrist will no longer have the support of the brace.

, This will prevent damage to the metal splint inside the brace that is used for stabilizing and splinting the wrist. Additionally, removing the metal splints will protect the fabric from damage caused by any shifting of the metal components during the agitation cycle.


Take note of the proper location for the metal splints so that you can replace them correctly after washing., Fasteners may catch on other fabrics in the wash or become twisted, which may stretch the brace components and impair the support structure of the brace.


Consider putting the brace in a mesh lingerie wash bag or a pillowcase to protect the it and other wash items from becoming entangled or twisted.

, Most powdered detergents are designed for use with warm water, and warm water is recommended for man-made materials.


Avoid using hot water, as it can shrink and damage the brace.
You can also try a coldwater detergent as a more eco-friendly option, as a number of coldwater alternatives are equally efficient at cleaning fabrics., Strong detergents or bleaches may harm the integrity of the brace and impact the effectiveness of the support.


If your brace is particularly malodorous, you can add 1/2 cup of baking soda to the wash to freshen the material and increase the cleaning power of your detergent., Avoid ""wringing,"" or twisting while squeezing, in order to prevent damaging the brace. Twisting can pull the fibers of the fabric apart and weaken the brace significantly.Lay the brace flat on a dry towel, then gently roll the towel and brace together to remove more water.Avoid hanging to dry, as the weight of the water may stretch the fabric. , Place the brace somewhere shaded, with good air flow, to promote quick drying.Do not dry the brace in direct sunlight, as the artificial materials of the brace can shrink when exposed to hot temperatures, and the UV rays of the sun may bleach or lighten the colors of the brace., The synthetic fabric will dry quickly in just a few hours, although be sure check interior of any splint pockets to ensure they are thoroughly dry.

Go to the emergency room.,
Have surgery performed on unstable fractures.,
Allow your minor fracture to heal.,
Take antibiotics.,
Take pain medicine.",How to Care for a Broken Jaw2," If you break your jaw, get medical care as soon as you can. It is best to have your jaw examined at a large hospital so you have access to surgeons and specialists. The doctor will conduct a physical exam and possibly order X-rays.Your doctor will want to rule out other injuries as well, such as damage to the cervical spine.Because your jaw is broken, your tongue has lost support and you may have trouble breathing. If you are having any trouble breathing, call 911 immediately.
Take along a plastic cup while you are in transit. This will be what you can spit saliva or blood into while you are on your way to see a professional.
The doctor may also order a CT scan to evaluate your jaw.

, A broken jaw may heal on its own or it may require surgery. If you have surgery, a doctor will wire your jaw to hold the jaw in place and allow the bones to heal. In some cases, screws and plates will be placed in your bones to heal your jaw.If you have surgery, it may take one or two months to heal.

, If your fracture is less severe, you will not need surgery. Your doctor may recommend eating a soft diet for 3 weeks and prescribe you pain medicine.These fractures will heal on their own.If your jaw was dislocated, the doctor will place it back into the correct position and bandage your jaw to stabilize it. You should avoid opening your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks if the doctor had to reset your jaw.
If you feel pain when you yawn or sneeze, support your jaw with your hands.

, If your doctor thinks there is a high risk for an infection, antibiotics will be prescribed.Follow your doctor's instructions for taking your antibiotics. Even if you feel better, continue to take the full course of your medicine.Let your doctor know of any other medications you are taking. This can prevent any adverse drug reactions.

, Your doctor may give you a prescription pain medicine or advise you to take an over-the-counter pain medicine. Take the pain medicine as directed. If your do not get any relief from your pain medicine, contact your doctor. There may be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.Increased pain or swelling may indicate that you have an infection.

Eat a soft diet.,
Adjust your diet if you are losing weight.,
Brush your teeth after you eat.,
Avoid activities that will hinder your healing.,
Know when to contact your doctor.",How to Care for a Broken Jaw3," A soft diet minimizes any pain you may feel from chewing. Foods should be blended so you are able to sip them through a straw. Continue to eat a balanced diet. Even though you are not able to chew, your body still needs all of the same nutrients.Remove skins, seeds, and peels before you blend them.
Cook meat and vegetables before you blend them.
You can add juice, broth, or gravy to thin out a mixture.
Avoid blending foods with small seeds such as blackberries and strawberries.
Don't blend raw eggs. Use powdered eggs instead.
You can continue to eat many of the foods that you liked before. For example, if you like spaghetti and meatballs, prepare the dish and then put it in a blender.

, You may be losing weight because of your soft diet. If this is the case, add extra calories to your food. Foods that you may add include:Powdered milk and protein powder
Sweets such as honey, ice cream, molasses, or sugar
Extra fats such as sour cream, cream cheese, nut butters, cream, and half-and-half.

, Brush your teeth with a soft bristle brush. Use your finger to pull out the cheek on the side that you are brushing. Then gently brush in a circular motion. In addition to brushing, rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt in 8 oz of water).A child sized toothbrush may work better until your jaw heals. The head of the brush is smaller, and it will be more comfortable than an adult toothbrush.
Good oral care will prevent tooth decay, food buildup, and bad breath.Your doctor may prescribe a special mouth rinse for you to use. Always follow your doctor's instructions if this is the case.
Once you have finished brushing apply lip balm or Vaseline to prevent dry, cracked lips.

, Do not smoke, drink alcohol or participate in any strenuous activities (e.g. running, contact sports, etc.) while your jaw is healing. Smoking will dry out and irritate your mouth and gums and slow healing. Alcohol can cause dehydration and nausea. Strenuous activities cause your jaw to move and will prolong the healing process.Ask your doctor what activities are okay for you to engage in.
Walking after surgery is encouraged and is usually a safe activity.If you have surgery, avoid water related activities like swimming because it will be difficult to remove water from your nose and airway., You may experience some complications during your healing process. It is important that these complications are handled quickly so you can continue heal properly. Pay attention to any changes that you experience. Reach out to your doctor as soon as possible if you experience any of these:Trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking
Red streaks in your jaw area
A fever
Pus draining from your jaw
Your mouth is bleeding
Your jaw does not seem to get any better

Look at the SPF number.,
Choose a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen.,
Look for a water-resistant sunscreen.,
Decide what you like.,
Go home and try a small portion around your wrist.,
Check the expiration date.,
Apply before going out in the sun.,
Use enough.,
Apply sunscreen to all skin.,
Don’t forget your face.,
Reapply after 15-30 minutes.,
Stay in the shade.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Keep young children out of the sun.",How to Apply Sunscreen," “SPF” refers to a sunscreen’s “sun protective factor,” or how effectively it blocks UVB rays. The SPF number reflects the amount of time it takes to sunburn wearing the sunscreen vs. not wearing the sunscreen.For example, an SPF of 30 means that you can spend 30 times as long in the sun before burning compared to not wearing any sunscreen at all. So, if you would usually begin to burn after 5 minutes in the sun, an SPF of 30 would theoretically allow you to spend time outside for 150 minutes (30 x 5) before you burn. However, your unique skin, your activities, and the sun’s intensity all cause variation in how effective sunscreen is, so you may need to use more than other people.
The SPF number can be tricky, because its protection doesn’t increase proportionally. Thus, SPF 60 is not twice as good as SPF 30. SPF 15 blocks about 94% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks about 97%, and SPF 45 blocks about 98%. No sunscreen blocks 100% of UVB rays.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends an SPF of 30 or higher.The difference between extremely high SPFs is often negligible and not worth the extra money.;
, SPF refers only to the ability to block UVB rays, which cause sunburn. However, the sun also emits UVA rays. UVA rays cause skin damage, such as signs of aging, wrinkles and dark or light spots.Both increase your risk of skin cancer.A broad-spectrum sunscreen provides protection from both UVA and UVB rays.Some sunscreens may not say “broad-spectrum” on the packaging. However, they should always state whether they protect against UVB and UVA rays.
Most broad-spectrum sunscreens contain “inorganic” components such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, as well as “organic” sunscreen components such as avobenzone, Cinoxate, oxybenzone, or octyl methoxycinnamate., Because your body expels water through sweat, you should look for a water-resistant sunscreen. This is especially important if you are going to be very active, such as running or hiking, or if you’ll be in the water.No sunscreen is “waterproof” or “sweat proof.” In the US, sunscreens cannot market themselves as “waterproof.”Even with water-resistant sunscreen, reapply every 40-80 minutes or as directed on the label.

, Some people prefer spray sunscreens, while others prefer thick creams or gels. Whatever you decide, make sure you apply a thick, even coating. The application is as important as the SPF and other factors: if you don’t apply it properly, the sunscreen won’t do its job.Sprays may be best for hairy areas, while creams are usually best for dry skin.Alcohol or gel sunscreens are good for oily skin.You can also purchase wax sunscreen sticks, which are good for applying near the eyes. This is often a good choice for children, as it avoids getting the sunscreen in the eyes. They also have the benefit of not spilling (such as in a purse) and can be applied without getting lotion on your hands.
Water resistant ""sports type"" sunscreens are often sticky, so they are not good choices for applying under makeup.For acne-prone individual, take care in selecting your sunscreen. Look for those that are designed specifically for your face and will not clog pores. These often have higher SPF (15 or higher), and are less likely to clog pores or increase acne breakouts.

Many acne-prone individuals find that zinc oxide-based sunscreens tend to work best.
Look for ""non-comedogenic"", ""will not clog pores"", ""for sensitive skin"", or ""for acne-prone skin"" on the labels.



, If you see any allergic reaction or skin problem, buy a different sunscreen. Repeat the process until you find the right sunscreen, or talk to your doctor about recommended brands if you have sensitive skin or allergies.


Itching, redness, burning, or blisters are all signs of an allergic reaction. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are less likely to cause allergic skin reactions.

, The FDA requires sunscreen to retain its protective power for at least three years from the date of manufacture. However, you should always note expiration dates. If the date has passed, ditch the old bottle and buy some new sunscreen.If your product doesn’t have an expiration date when you purchase it, use a permanent marker or a label to write the purchase date on the bottle. This way you’ll know how long you’ve had the product.
Obvious changes in the product, such as color changes, separation, or different consistency, are signs that the sunscreen has expired.

, The chemicals in sunscreen take time to bind to your skin and become fully protective. Apply your sunscreen before you go out.Sunscreen on the skin should be applied 30 minutes before you go out into the sun. Lip sunscreen should be applied 45-60 minutes before going into the sun.Sunscreen needs to :""cure"" on the skin to be fully effective. This is especially important in the water-resistance factor. If you put on sunscreen and jump into the pool 5 minutes later, much of your protection will be lost.
This is also very important for caring for children. Children are usually wriggly and impatient, and are usually doubly so when excited about an outdoor adventure; after all, who can stand still when the ocean is right there? Instead, try to sunscreen before leaving the house, or in the parking lot, or waiting for the bus.

, One of the biggest mistakes in using sunscreen is to not use enough. Adults usually need about one ounce -- a palm-ful, or about a shot glass full -- of sunscreen to cover exposed skin.To apply cream or gel sunscreen, squeeze a dollop into your palm. Spread it all over the skin that will be exposed to the sun. Rub the sunscreen into your skin until you can't see the white anymore.
To apply spray sunscreen, hold the bottle upright and move the bottle back and forth across your skin. Apply an even, generous coating. Make sure the wind doesn’t blow the sunscreen away before it contacts your skin. Don’t inhale spray sunscreen. Be careful when applying spray sunscreens around the face, especially around children.

, Remember areas like your ears, neck, the tops of your feet and hands, and even the part in your hair. Any skin that will be exposed to sunlight should be covered with sunscreen.It can be hard to fully cover hard-to-reach areas such as your back. Ask someone to help you apply sunscreen to these areas.Thin clothing often doesn’t offer much sun protection. For example, a white t-shirt has an SPF of just 7. Wear clothing designed to block UV rays, or wear sunblock under your clothes., Your face needs even more sunscreen than the rest of your body, as many skin cancers occur on the face, especially on or around the nose. Some cosmetics or lotions may contain sunscreen. However, if you’re going to be outside for more than 20 minutes (total, not at a time) you’ll want to apply a facial sunscreen too.


Many facial sunscreens come in cream or lotion form. If you use a spray sunscreen, spray it into your hands first, then apply it to your face. It's best to avoid spray sunscreens on the face if possible.
The Skin Cancer Foundation has a searchable list of recommended facial sunscreens.Use a lip balm or lip sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 on your lips.
If you are bald or have thin hair, remember to apply sunscreen to your head, too. You can also wear a hat to help protect against sun damage., Studies have shown that re-applying your sunscreen after about 15-30 minutes after going into the sun is more protective than waiting 2 hours.Once you’ve done this initial reapplication, re-apply sunscreen every 2 hours or as directed on the label.

, Even when you’re wearing sunscreen, you’ll still be exposed to the sun’s powerful rays. Staying in the shade or using a sun umbrella will help protect you from sun damage.Avoid “peak hours.” The sun is highest between 10AM and 2 PM. If you can, avoid sun exposure during this time. Seek shade if you’re out and about during this time., Not all clothing is created equal. However, long-sleeved shirts and long pants can help protect your skin from sun damage. Wear a hat to offer your face extra shade and protect your scalp.Look for tightly-woven fabric and dark colors, which offer the most protection. For people who are very active outdoors, there is special clothing with built-in sun-protection, available at specialty stores or online.
Remember those sunglasses! The sun’s UV rays can cause cataracts, so purchase a pair that block UVB and UVA rays.

, Sun exposure, especially during the “peak” hours of 10 AM to 2 PM, is especially harmful to young children. Look for sunscreens specifically made for children and babies. Consult with your pediatrician to determine what is safe for your child.Infants under the age of 6 months should not wear sunscreen or be exposed to direct sunlight. Young babies’ skin is not mature yet, so they may absorb more of the chemicals in sunscreen. If you must take young infants outside, keep them in the shade.If your baby is older than 6 months, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Be careful when applying sunscreen near the eyes.Dress young children in sun-protective clothing, such as hats, long-sleeved sun shirts or lightweight long pants.Get your child sunglasses with UV protection."

Make sure you don't have broken ribs.,
Ice the injured area.,
Take pain medication.,
Rest.,
Manage your breathing.,
Visit a doctor if the pain is persistent or unbearable.",How to Treat Bruised Ribs," A rib that's bruised or cracked is damaged, but still in its place in the rib cage. A broken rib, however, is dangerous because it's been dislodged from its normal position, and could potentially puncture a lung or another organ. Before you start treating yourself at home, make sure your rib isn't broken.


Lightly run your hands over your ribcage. The area around a cracked or bruised rib might feel swollen, but you should not notice any huge protrusions or dents. If you do suspect a broken rib, see a doctor as soon as possible.
Look out for flail chest. Flail chest occurs when you break three or more ribs right next to each other, and it can seriously hinder your breathing.If you suspect more than one rib is injured and you physically can't take a deep breath, see a doctor.;
, Icing your rib will help reduce pain and swelling, so that the bruised tissue can heal more quickly. Stick to ice for the first 72 hours after an injury, and resist the urge to break out a heating pad instead.


Find a bag of frozen vegetables (like peas or corn), or fill a resealable plastic bag with chipped ice. Wrap the bag of ice in a towel or T-shirt, and lay it over your bruised rib.

, If every breath hurts, controlling the pain will go a long way to helping you feel better. Take an over-the-counter painkiller such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen according to the instructions on the bottle.


If you're under age 19, you're still at risk for Reye Syndrome. Take something other than aspirin.

, Now's not the time to exert yourself, especially if breathing is painful. Resting is the best thing you can do to heal up quickly. Grab a book or turn on a movie, but be sure not to stay in one position for a prolonged period.


Get the next day or two off work, if you can. Especially if your job involves standing for long periods of time or manual labor.
Try lying on your injured side. If your neck and back are in good shape, consider lying on the side with the bruised rib. It sounds counterintuitive, but it will actually help you breathe easier. (Just make sure you're keeping up on your painkillers first.)
Don't play sports, or engage in any activity that could aggravate your injury.

, Before, the most commonly recommended treatment for bruised ribs was wrapping the ribcage in a compression bandage. Turns out that's a terrible idea, because restricted breathing can lead to complications like pneumonia. Repeat: don't wrap your ribs in an elastic compression bandage. Here's what to do instead:


Take a deep breath whenever you can. Every few minutes, try to take one good, prolonged inhale, and let it out slowly.

If your ribs are so damaged that this seems out of the question, try to take one deep breath every hour, on the hour.
If you literally cannot do one deep breath per hour, call a doctor.


Do breathing exercises. When you feel like you can breathe somewhat regularly again, practice inhaling slowly for three seconds, holding your breath for three seconds, and exhaling for another three seconds. Repeat this pattern for a few minutes, once or twice a day.
Don't smoke. When recovering from a rib injury, lung irritants can make you more prone to infection. Use this as an opportunity to quit smoking.

, Chest pain can have a number of causes, and some can be life-threatening. An accurate diagnosis ensures that you're treating the right problem. Your doctor may order chest x-rays, a CT scan, an MRI or a bone scan if a fracture is suspected to reach an accurate diagnosis. However, injured cartilage or bruises will not show up in these tests. Here's when to get medical help:


You are suddenly short of breath.
You're experiencing increasing pain in your chest, abdomen, or shoulder.
You develop a cough or fever.
The pain in your chest is intense, but you can twist to look over your shoulder without a marked increase in pain. A bruised rib will feel worse with twisting your torso; something more serious will not.

Wear a helmet and wear it correctly.,
Practice rugby-style tackling.,
Engage in good sportsmanship conduct.,
Report all injuries to the appropriate staff.,
Put on all other safety equipment.,
Recognize the symptoms of a concussion.,
Be aware of symptoms of a epidural hematoma.,
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Take the appropriate time to rest and recover.,
Do not return to play without medical clearance.",How to Avoid Football Related Brain Injuries," Helmets are one of the first lines of defense when it comes to preventing and avoiding head injuries in football.Players need to wear helmets at all times, even during practice to ensure they avoid any injuries.


Some studies have shown that wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of head injuries by over 80%.If you or your child is just starting football, make sure to spend time with the coach to learn how to get fitted for an appropriate helmet and how to wear it correctly.
Players always need to wear a helmet, even in times of practice when they think it may be unlikely to get an injury.
Note that although helmets are one of the best defenses to head injuries, helmets are not designed to completely prevent head injuries. Unfortunately, there is no ""concussion-proof"" helmet.;
, Rugby-style tackling is gaining headway with college and professional football players because it is safer than football-style tackling.By tackling this way, you are protecting your own head and the opposing teammate's head as well.To practice rugby-style tackling, you use your shoulder to take down other players near the hip or thigh.

, Another important part of preventing and avoiding head injuries in football is how the player conducts himself in practice and on the field.


All players should attempt to avoid hits to the head and neck area. Many head, neck and spine injuries occur during tackles in football.Players should also be aware of appropriate tackling techniques and all of the appropriate rules regarding tackling.Lastly, players should always maintain good sportsmanship like conduct and report any issues where other players are not engaging in safe or appropriate behavior., Many times, head injuries and resulting complications are missed, due to players not reporting their injury to the appropriate staff member or medical team.No matter how minor the injury, all injuries at all times should be reported to the coaching staff and medical personnel so the player can be appropriately evaluated.If a player experiences any hits to the head or any head injuries, they should always be assessed for a possible concussion or other brain injuries. They also need to be monitored to make sure no delayed signs or symptoms appear.Talk to the coach about any previous injuries. The coaching staff should always be aware of any previous injuries - especially head or brain injuries - to any player., In addition to helmets, it's important to put on and wear other safety equipment.


Although items like mouth guards and pads may not be directly related to preventing head injuries, it's important to ensure that you or your child is wearing all the required safety and protective gear and equipment.
Also, make sure that the protective gear is the appropriate size and is worn correctly.

, Concussions occur where there is a traumatic hit to the head causing the brain to shake inside the skull.One of the best defenses to preventing serious, long-term injuries from a hit to the head or concussion is being aware of the symptoms.


Studies have shown that many football players had experienced one or more signs or symptoms of a concussion but did not seek medical treatment as they were unaware the symptoms were associated with a concussion.Typical symptoms reported by players include: headache or pressure, nausea and vomiting, difficulty balancing, sensitivity to light and noise, confusion, difficulty concentrating and mentally foggy.Typical signs that are apparent to others include: appearance of being dazed or confused, moves clumsily, is forgetful, answers questions slowly, is unconscious and shows mood or behavior changes., This type of injury is more severe than a concussion. It results after a traumatic hit to the head causing blood to accumulate between the brain and the skull.Typical symptoms reported by players include: severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, increased pupil size, and sudden weakness in one arm or leg.Symptoms noticed by others may include: slurred speech, convulsions or seizures, difficulty recognizing people or places and decreased coordination., If you or your child has experienced a head or neck hit or injury during a football game, it's important to seek out medical attention.


Even if the player is not exhibiting signs, if a hit to the head was experienced the player should be evaluated by the team medical personnel to make sure they do not have any signs or symptoms of a concussion.
If the player is exhibiting any signs of a concussion after a game or practice, they should be brought to the ER immediately for evaluation and treatment.
Do not delay in seeking medical treatment for head injuries. It's when too much time has passed with no intervention that serious or long-term complications may result.

, If you have experienced a head or neck hit or have been diagnosed and treated for a concussion or other head injury, it's important to take the appropriate amount of time to rest and recover.


Players that have experienced a head or brain injury may need several days or weeks to fully recover.
Players who are in school - either grade school or college - may also need to take time away from their studies. Consider spending fewer hours at school, taking more breaks and asking for more time to complete assignments.It may also be recommended for players to disengage in physical activity and spend much less time reading or looking at computer screens., Although players may be eager to return to football practices and games, they should not do so or be allowed to return without a medical clearance.


Players that return to sports too soon are at an increased risk for getting a second head or brain injury. These 2nd injuries generally result in more permanent and serious damage.Players should not return to any type of practice or physical activity until cleared by a physician.

Maintain a healthy weight.,
Practice daily stretching.,
Protect your feet.",How to Avoid an Achilles Tendon Injury1," Extra weight adds stress to the Achilles tendons and may contribute to serious injuries. Proper diet and exercise can help keep off unwanted weight and allow you less stress and greater flexibility as you exercise and throughout your daily activities.Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-impact cardiovascular activity for at least five days a week to help maintain a healthy body. Activities may include running, walking, swimming, instructional fitness courses, or anything that elevates your heart rate.
Practice portion control and eating a balanced diet that focuses largely on vegetables and fruits, with a secondary emphasis on proteins such as meats or vegetable proteins. Try to keep simple carbohydrates and refined sugars to a minimum to maintain a healthy weight.;
, Consistently tight muscles can contribute Achilles tendon injuries, so it is important to make sure that you regularly stretch out both your calf and your adductor muscles. Even on days when you choose not to exercise, spend a few minutes stretching out these areas.A daily yoga practice with a focus on the legs can help you keep these areas stretched, even if only undertaken for a few minutes a day.
You may also stretch your calf by extending your legs alternately, either by taking a lunge-like stance or stretching straight forward down your leg and toward your toes while seated.Stretch your adductors, or inner thighs, by placing both your legs outward and moving them far apart from one another. Bend your hips forward and push your hands down your legs for as far as you are comfortable. Take a few deep breaths before releasing., If you find you are more prone to tension or resistance in your Achilles tendon, try a protective heel pad or orthotic insert specially designed to alleviate stress on the Achilles tendon. These can usually be found in specialty footwear stores, athletic stores, and some drugstores or pharmacies.These orthotics can be worn on a daily basis or just when you exercise, depending upon your personal needs.
Complete shoes are also available for supporting the Achilles area if you find you want daily support and durability.
Those with pre-existing arch and heel problems are more likely to have Achilles tendon issues, and may find orthotics a helpful preventative measure in everyday life.

Clean and shave the leg.,
Do not apply skin traction to damaged skin.,
Administer painkillers if prescribed.,
Explain the procedure.",How to Apply a Skin Traction1," Use soap and water to clean the limb. Make sure to clean the entire limb, not just the site of the injury. Shave the patient’s skin wherever traction straps will be applied. A single blade razor should be sufficient. Wipe away any leftover soap or shaving cream with a wet cloth and then pat dry with a clean towel. Make sure that the limb is totally dry.Ask the patient if they are allergic to adhesive if adhesive skin traction has been prescribed (this is quite uncommon).;
, Avoid using skin traction on a patient that has cuts, scrapes, or surgical incisions where you would need to apply the wrap. Similarly, do not use skin traction on a patient experiencing ulcers or numbness., As skin traction can potentially be painful, a pain management strategy has likely been planned. Ensure that any necessary pain medication is administered and documented., Tell the patient why skin traction has been prescribed, and how it will help them. The procedure requires more explanation than some others, as the visual and tangible experiences associated with skin traction can be frightening. If administering skin traction to a child, explain the procedure to them as well.For instance, explain what each piece of the traction apparatus is by saying something like ""This material is called traction strapping. It adheres to the skin and helps pull your bone into the correct position."" or ""We will run this traction cord through this pulley, and attach a small amount of weight that will help keep your leg in alignment.""

Assess what exercises may cause injury.,
Wear proper shoes.,
Warm up by stretching.,
Alternate your routine.,
Listen to your body.",How to Avoid an Achilles Tendon Injury2," Any exercise that engages your legs and feet may cause an Achilles tendon injury, even walking; however, exercises that are done in excess or that place a great deal of stress on your ankle area may be more likely to cause injury.


Runners are especially prone to Achilles tendon injuries. To help prevent injury when running, make sure you have proper shoes and alternate between long, intense runs and more modest jogs throughout your routine.
People who practice cross-fit are also very prone to Achilles tendon injuries. Limiting the number of cross-fit routines you do on a weekly basis to around three and alternating low impact exercises on non-cross-fit days may help prevent some injury to the area.
Anything that involves a great amount of jumping, such as trampoline training or basketball, can also cause Achilles tendon injuries. Choosing the right shoes for these activities is essential, as is alternating between the jump-heavy exercises and a low-impact exercise.

, Wearing the right shoes for the exercise is important not only to ensure that you are getting the most from your exercise, but also to make sure that you prevent injury to yourself. Something like a running shoe does not provide any lateral stability for cross-training exercises, while cross-trainers might not have the forward padding of a proper running shoe.It may be beneficial to have your food examined and your gait examined by a sports physician or physical therapist. They can help you choose a shoe that will give you the proper support for your particular foot and the type of activity in which you plan to participate.
Improperly fitted shoes, whether too big or too small, can quickly lead to injury.
Try to outfit yourself with a couple pairs of athletic shoes that meet the needs of different exercises. If you enjoy both running and weight training, for example, try to find a durable set of running shoes as well as a pair of training shoes with a good grip on the sole.

, Help keep your muscles loose during your exercise by stretching before you begin. Spend five or so minutes stretching your calves and thighs, or walking at a brisk pace to engage your muscles before exercise.Try standing stretches such as reaching toward your toes or deep lunges to stretch out your legs before exercise. Stand up straight, bend down from your core, and extend your fingers as close to the ground as possible. Breathe deeply and hold this position for five to ten seconds at a time.
Alternatively, if stretching is prohibitive, walk at a brisk pace for five to ten minutes before your exercise. This helps stretch out and engage your muscles in low-impact manner.

, Alternating between high-impact exercises like running or jumping with lower impact exercise such as walking or swimming can help reduce stress on the Achilles tendon area. Create a varied exercise routine that alternates between high and low impact activities throughout the week.Generally speaking, try not to schedule more than one or two days of consecutive high-impact activity. If you prefer a higher impact workout routine, try a schedule like running three days a week, and walking twice a week in between run days.
Also remember that it is important to allow your body time to rest and recover from intense physical activity. Build in recovery days to allow your body to recover properly and protect yourself from injury.

, Stop your activity if you notice any pain in your Achilles tendons and the surrounding area. Rest your legs and cut back on your routine if needed, or opt for more low-impact exercises such as water aerobics and restorative yoga.If you find yourself frequently pained by certain activities, talk to a personal trainer or medical professional about what you can do to alleviate the pain, or what exercises you can swap in to replace the painful exercise.

Don’t wait to see a doctor.,
Meet with a personal trainer.,
Try physical therapy.,
Seek a doctor for an already-injured tendon.",How to Avoid an Achilles Tendon Injury3," If you notice pain or pressure in your heel, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Let them know what symptoms you’ve been experiencing, and that you are looking to avoid any injury to your Achilles tendon.Try to rest your leg and foot as much as possible in between when you notice symptoms and when you are able to see your doctor.
Treatment consists of activity modification, relative rest, ice, stretching, and strengthening. Stretching and strengthening are best guided by a physical therapist.

, A certified personal trainer can help you develop an exercise routine that will meet your fitness goals and still consider what impact your body can handle. Meet with a personal trainer to develop a cross-training exercise schedule that will help you maximize results while minimizing risk of injury.Let the trainer know that you want to pay particular attention to avoiding Achilles tendon injuries. Ask them, “Do you have any recommendations for stretches or exercises to help me protect my Achilles tendon?”

, If you believe you may already have some stress or damage to the Achilles tendon area, consider physical therapy to help you recover. Physical therapy may include exercise, massage, and other physical treatments to help you strengthen and regain control of your tendon.Always talk to your doctor before starting with a physical therapist. In many cases, physical therapists may need a doctor recommendation to begin the process.
Check with your insurance to see if physical therapy is covered with a doctor’s referral, or if you may need to pay on your own.

, If you believe that you have already injured your Achilles tendon, seek the help of a doctor immediately. A podiatrist will likely be the most helpful, but you may need a referral from your general practitioner to see one.


Depending upon the severity of the injury, your doctor may recommend treatments such as changing your exercise routine, physical therapy, or surgery.
Carefully follow your doctor's recommendations for your injury and ask them, ""What should I do to avoid injuring the area in the future?""

Apply traction strapping.,
Pad the ankles while wrapping the leg.,
Elevate the leg.,
Apply weighted resistance as prescribed.",How to Apply a Skin Traction2," Gently lift the straightened leg and pull it away from the patient’s body in the direction of their sole. Apply traction starting at, but not above, the fracture line. Run strapping down one side of the leg, around a 3-inch (7.5 cm) spreader, and up the other side of the leg. The spreader should extend approximately 6 inches (15 cm) beyond the end of the patient’s leg. The extra strap beneath the foot will appear like a loose stirrup.Instead of a spreader, your facility may be equipped with a foam and metal stirrup that can be bent around the heel and ankle of the injured leg and wrapped onto the strap.

, At this point, you will carefully wrap the leg in crepe wrapping or gauze. As you do so, pad the sides of the ankle and any other bony areas, such as the sides of the knee. Wrap the leg in alternative spirals instead of consistent circles to reduce tightness. Start at the ankle and move upward in slow, even rotations. Conclude the wrap just before the end of the adhesive strip. The bandage should not go past the fracture.If using a stirrup, make sure it is also wrapped securely into place above the traction tape.

, Usually, skin traction is used in tandem with weight resistance that helps apply pressure to the leg through the adhesive strip. If you’re using weights as well, elevate the leg. If possible, do so by elevating the end of the bed where the leg is resting. Once elevated, attach a traction cord through the spreader at the midpoint of the adhesive tape., If weighted skin traction is to be used, a doctor will have prescribed a specific amount of weight to be attached to the end of the traction cords. Depending on the injury, this traction cord may run over the end of the bed with the weights hanging below. Alternatively, some scenarios may call for the use of pulley systems, with the weight on one side and the suspended leg on the other.Never exceed 11 lbs. (4.99 kg) of weight.
You may need to shorten the traction cord to ensure that the weight is suspended in the air, as opposed to resting on the floor or bed.

Reduce pressure to keep skin healthy.,
Record neurovascular observations hourly.,
Keep the patient entertained.",How to Apply a Skin Traction3," The condition of the patient’s skin should be steadily monitored. In particular, blisters and pressure sores may develop. Check the patient’s legs, heels, and bottom for sores or discomfort from maintaining a constant position. Place a rolled up towel or pillow beneath the patient’s heel to relieve undesired pressure. Further, encourage the patient to slightly adjust their position once per hour.If using adhesive, watch out for a rash or other allergic reaction, as the pressure induced by traction may cause a reaction in patients who do not know they are mildly allergic.
Remove and reset the weight, including the stirrup, once every few hours to check skin condition.
Change wet sheets immediately.

, Neurovascular issues and/or compartment syndrome may develop from overly tight wraps. Watch out for signs that blood circulation has slowed, such as discoloration or numbness. Remove the wrap and reapply if any neurovascular signs change during application of skin treatment. Contact the orthopedic team if circulation doesn’t quickly return., Though they are mostly immobile, try to keep the patient active. Have them sit up when able and read, do crafts, play games, or watch TV. This will improve comfort as well as hygiene. Further, constipation may also occur from immobility.If the patient reports constant pain, ensure medication schedules have been kept, and contact a doctor if you feel those schedules may need to be revised.

Stretch regularly and warm up before each game.,
Club up.,
Ease back into the game with some basic practice.,
When addressing the ball, it is recommended that you change your stance a little when you're working from a back back.,
Start your back swing by moving your hips simultaneously with your hands and club.,
Take special precautions when using downswing.,
Avoid twisting around at all times.,
Don't push yourself too hard.",How to Play Golf With Back Pain," This is a very important step. Always stretch your back muscles to help prevent further injury and to loosen your back. Ask your doctor or physiotherapist for suitable stretching exercises that will continue to strengthen your back and for specific exercises that you can implement prior to a game. Some stretching that may be suitable includes:Stretch the shoulder and torso: Hold a golf club behind your neck and shoulders grasping both ends of the club with your hands and rotate your torso gently from side to side. Do this a few times.

Stretch the hips: Pull one knee to your chest. Drop gently and then pull the other knee to your chest. Repeat a few times.

Stretch the hamstrings: Bend over and try to touch your toes. Don't go further than you can or you may cause more problems and only do this if your physical therapist has approved the move. Flexible hamstrings are important to enable better hip motion and to reduce pressure on the lower back discs.Easy, gentle swings will help you to warm up before the game; practice some before beginning each game.;
, When you have back pain, you'll need to accept that you will lose some power. Help yourself out by 'clubbing up' one or two clubs.


When practicing, start with small irons and work up to large wood. This eases the muscle groups into gradual warming up., Spend a little time practicing at a drive range to put yourself in sync. This may feel repetitive but it will help your body to slowly regain the required movements and your muscle memory will restore sooner with easier moves.

, Aim to stand 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) closer to the ball than you previously stood. This positioning will give you a better center of gravity and it helps you to turn your hips easily.

, Bend your left knee (if you're right handed, opposite if left handed) a little more to allow your hips to turn further.


To prevent back pain at any time, golf players should aim for smooth swings. Aim to gently rotate the shoulder, hip, chest and lower spine at the same time, so that all these parts of the body share the load., The problems really start on the downswing for people with back pain. Most golfers initiate their downswing with the hips, but when you can't torque your hips as much, they get way ahead of your hands. To avoid this, start your downswing with your hands moving slowly, and then engage your hips to blast through the ball.

, While golf swings naturally create torsion (twisting), don't twist right around when swinging and certainly don't twist around to observe – move your whole body instead to see where the ball has gone. And be aware that you don't have to twist your body around to finish in a perfect pose. Just make sure to finish with the club high. Over your head is fine.

, If you can only manage a few holes initially, that is better than none. Listen to your body as you're moving around the course and take a break when you need to.


Remember to carry all golf items with care, especially the golf bag. You can undo a whole day's careful golf playing with poor bag carrying! Avoid repeated bending over to collect the bag by using a wheeled stand that keeps the bag upright or a rolling cart bag. If you're carrying a bag on your shoulders, make sure that it has two straps to evenly distribute the weight."

Call emergency services.,
Check the person over.,
Make the person rest.,
Apply ice.,
Apply pressure.,
Be prepared to administer first aid if necessary.",How to Treat a Mild Concussion1," If someone has a head injury, you should call 911 and have him checked out by medical professionals. Even minor concussions should be checked out by a doctor.If you choose not to call emergency services after a minor head wound, you still need to watch for severe symptoms. If you notice any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately:


Vomiting
Having pupils of unequal size
Being dizzy, confused, or agitated
Being unconscious
Seeming drowsy
Having neck pain
Having slurred or difficult speech
Having trouble walking
Having seizures;
, After a head injury, check the person. Look for loss of consciousness first. Then, check his mental awareness. Don’t move him unless it’s absolutely necessary.


To check for mental awareness, ask the person his name, what day it is, how many fingers you're holding up, and if he remembers what just happened.
If he is unconscious, check his airways, breathing, and circulation to make sure he's breathing, and immediately call emergency services.

, After someone suffers a blow to the head, he needs to rest. If the head wound isn't major, the person can sit up. Make sure he is in a comfortable position. Cover him with a blanket if one is available.If the head wound is severe, or you believe the person has neck or back damage, don't move him unless necessary., If the injury is not bleeding, apply ice to any swollen areas. Make sure not to put ice directly on the skin. Instead, place a cloth between the ice and the swollen area.You can use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have an ice pack or ice available.

, If the wound is bleeding, apply pressure to it to stop the bleeding. Use a towel, article of clothing, or other piece of cloth to staunch the bleeding. If at all possible, make sure the cloth is clean, but if you don't have access clean cloth, use the cleanest piece of cloth you can find. Don't press too hard; you want to stop the bleeding, but not cause any additional pain. Gently press the cloth to the wound.If at all possible, keep your hands away from the wound. Only touch the wound with the towel to avoid transferring bacteria into the wound.
If you believe there is a serious injury, don’t move the person’s head or remove the debris from the head. Wait for emergency services to arrive.

, If the person loses consciousness while you wait for help, you will need to monitor his breathing and pulse. Watch for obvious signs of breathing (such as the rise and fall of his chest) or see if you can feel his breath on your skin by placing your hand near his nose and mouth. Check his pulse by placing your index and middle fingers against the groove in the neck, just beneath the jaw and to the right or left of the voice box or Adam's apple.


If the person throws up, carefully turn him on his side, making sure his head and neck do not twist. Clear his mouth of debris so he does not choke on his vomit.
If at any time the person stops breathing or has no pulse, begin CPR. Continue until emergency personnel arrive.

It is possible for doctors to predict the level of radiation exposure from the timing and the nature of the symptoms. The severity of symptoms will vary depending on the radiation dose received, and the parts of the body that absorbed the emissions.The determining factors in the degree of radiation sickness are the type of exposure, the exposed parts of the body, the duration of exposure, the strength of the radiation, and how much your body has absorbed.
The cells in your body that are most sensitive to radiation include the lining of your stomach and intestinal tract, and the cells found in your bone marrow that produce new blood cells.
The degree of exposure guides the presentation of symptoms. Initial symptoms involving the gastrointestinal tract can appear within ten minutes.
If the skin was directly exposed or contaminated, redness, rash, and burning can begin almost immediately.;
, There is no way to predict the exact course of a radiation exposure event that leads to radiation sickness since there are many variables involved. The symptom presentation is, however predictable. The degree of exposure, ranging from mild to very severe, can alter the timing of symptom development. The following symptoms are consistent with radiation sickness.Nausea and vomiting
Headache
Fever
Dizziness
Disorientation
Weakness and fatigue
Hair loss
Bloody vomit and stools
Infections and poor wound healing
Low blood pressure

, Four categories and their ranges of exposure are used to diagnose the levels of severity for radiation sickness. The levels are based on a sudden exposure over a short amount of time. The severity is determined by the degree of exposure and the onset of symptoms.Mild severity is exposure to radiation that resulted in a body absorption of 1 to 2 gray units (Gy).
Moderate severity results after exposure that causes the body to absorb 2 to 6 Gy.
Severe exposure results in an absorbed level measured at 6 to 9 Gy.
Very severe exposure is absorption at 10 Gy or higher.
Doctors can gauge the absorbed dose by measuring the time between exposure and the first signs of nausea and vomiting.
Nausea and vomiting that begins within ten minutes of exposure is considered very severe exposure. Mild exposure involves the onset of nausea and vomiting within six hours.

, Radiation exposure is measured in different ways. In the United States, the level of radiation sickness is described as the amount of radiation absorbed by the body.Different types of radiation are measured using different units, and to further complicate things, the country you are in may use yet a different unit.
In the United States, absorbed radiation is measured in units called a gray, abbreviated as Gy, in rads, or in rem. Generally conversions are as follows: 1 Gy is equal to 100 rads, and 1 rad is equal to 1 rem.
The rem equivalent for different types of radiation is not always expressed as just described. The information provided here includes basic conversion factors.

, Two types of exposure are possible; irradiation and contamination. Irradiation involves exposure to the radiation waves, emissions, or particles, while contamination involves direct contact with radioactive dust or liquid.Acute radiation sickness only occurs with irradiation. It is possible to have come into direct contact and also have experienced irradiation.
Radiation contamination results in absorption of radioactive material through the skin and transportation to the bone marrow where it can result in health problems such as cancer.

, Radiation sickness is possible but unlikely and actual incidents are rare. Radiation exposure caused by an accident at a work site that uses radiation could cause radiation sickness. Potentially, a natural disaster that alters the integrity of a structure that contains powerful radiation, such as a nuclear power plant, is possible.Natural disasters, like earthquakes or hurricanes, could potentially damage the integrity of a nuclear facility causing a localized release of potentially dangerous radiation; although this type of structural damage is unlikely.
An act of war that involves the use of a nuclear weapon could cause widespread exposure leading to radiation sickness.
A terrorist attack using dirty bombs could cause radiation sickness to people in the immediate vicinity.
Space travel has risks related to radiation exposure.
While possible, it is highly unlikely that exposure from equipment used for medical purposes could lead to the development of radiation sickness.
Nuclear energy is all around us. Safeguards are in place to protect the public from accidental exposure.

, Radiation is around us everywhere; some in the form of waves and some as particles. Radiation can be unnoticed and cause no risk at all, while other forms are potent and dangerous if exposed. There are two types of radiation and four primary types of emissions from radiation.The two forms of radiation are ionizing and nonionizing.
The four most common types of radioactive emissions include alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and X rays.

, Ionizing radiation particles can carry a lot of energy. These particles cause changes when they comes in contact with other charged particles. This is not always a bad thing.Ionizing radiation is also used to safely create a chest x ray or a CT scan. Exposure to radiation for use as a diagnostic aid, such as x rays and CT scans, has no clear limit.
According to guidelines published by the multidisciplinary field of study known as nondestructive testing, or NDT, 0.05 rem per year is recommended as a limit for exposure created by the use of medical equipment.There may be limits set by your doctor or determined by your illness if you are routinely exposed to radiation as a method of treatment for a disease, such as cancer.

, Nonionizing radiation causes no harm and is used in items you come in contact with daily. Your microwave oven, a toaster with infrared heating, lawn fertilizer, your smoke detector in your home, and your cell phone are examples of nonionizing radiation.Common food items, such as wheat flour, white potatoes, pork, fruits and vegetables, poultry, and eggs, are irradiated with nonionizing radiation as a last step before appearing in your grocery store.Major well-respected agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Medical Association support the procedures used to irradiate foods to help control bacteria and parasites that may be dangerous if consumed.
Your smoke detector protects you from fire by constantly emitting a low level of nonionizing radiation. The presence of smoke blocks the stream and tells your smoke detector to sound the alarm.

, If you were exposed to ionizing radiation, the types of emissions that were present influence the level of sickness you may, or may not, experience. The four common types of emissions include alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and x rays.Alpha particles do not travel very far and have trouble passing through anything with substance. Alpha particles release all their energy in a small area.
Alpha particles have trouble penetrating the skin, but if they penetrate the skin, then they can do a lot of damage, killing nearby tissues and cells.
Beta particles can travel farther than alpha particles, but still have trouble penetrating through skin or layers of clothing.
Beta particles are similar to alpha particles in that they can do more harm to the body if they are on the inside.
Gamma rays travel at the speed of light and penetrate through materials and skin tissue much easier. Gamma rays are the most dangerous form of radiation.
X rays also travel at the speed of light and can penetrate through skin. This is what makes them useful in diagnostic medicine and some industrial applications.

, Call 911 and remove yourself from the area immediately. Do not wait for symptoms to develop. If you know you have been exposed to ionized radiation, seek treatment the fastest possible way. Mild to moderate forms of radiation sickness can be treated. More severe forms are usually fatal.If you think you have been exposed to a dose of radiation, remove all clothing and materials you were wearing at the time and place them in a plastic bag.
Wash your body with soap and water as soon as possible. Do not scrub the skin. That may cause irritation or break the skin which can lead to systemic absorption of any remaining radiation from the surface of the skin.

, Understanding the type of ionized radiation at the site where your exposure occurred and how much your body absorbed are key factors in reaching a diagnosis of the level of severity.The goals for treatment for radiation sickness include avoiding any further contamination, treat the most immediate life-threatening problems, reduce symptoms, and manage pain.
Those who experience mild to moderate exposure and receive treatment often have a full recovery. For a person who survives the radiation exposure, the blood cells will begin to replenish themselves after four to five weeks.
Severe and very severe exposure results in death ranging from two days to two weeks following exposure.
In most cases, the cause of death from radiation sickness is due to internal bleeding and infections.

, Often, radiation sickness symptoms can be effectively managed in a hospital setting. The approach to treatment involves maintaining hydration, controlling the progressive development of symptoms, preventing infection, and allowing the body to recover.



Antibiotics are prescribed to treat infections that more commonly occur in people with radiation sickness.
Since the bone marrow is sensitive to radiation, you be given certain medications that promote the growth of blood cells.
Treatments may include the use of blood products, colony stimulating factors, bone marrow transplant, and stem cell transplant as indicated. In some cases, blood and/or platelet transfusions may help to repair the damaged bone marrow.
Those receiving treatment are usually kept separate from others to help prevent infection. Visitation is sometimes limited to reduce the change of contamination with infectious agents.
Medications are available to help manage internal organ damage, depending on the specific types of radiation particles or emissions involved.

, Symptom management is part of the treatment, but for people that have received high doses, greater than 10 Gy, the treatment goals will be to make the person as comfortable as possible.Examples of supportive care include aggressive pain management and medications provided for ongoing symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
Pastoral care and psychological counseling may be available.

, People exposed to a radiation event that develop radiation sickness have a greater than normal chance of developing health problems, including cancer, years later.A single, rapid, large dose of radiation to the entire body can be fatal. Exposure to the same dose spread over a period of weeks or months can be treated with a good survival rate.
Animal studies show that severe irradiation can result in birth defects caused by irradiated reproductive cells. While it is possible that radiation sickness can cause problems with developing ova, sperm, and genetic alterations, these effects in humans have not been demonstrated.

, Standards set by OSHA provide guidelines to companies and facilities that use equipment involving ionizing radiation. There are many types of radiation beyond what is discussed here, as well as many safe applications in our world that we depend on every day.Workers that are exposed to radiation as a part of their jobs are often required to wear badges that keep track of a cumulative dose.
Workers are not allowed to remain in a situation of risk once they have reached the company or government limitations, unless there is a declared state of emergency.
Standards for radiation exposure in the workplace in the United States set limits at 5 rem per year. In situations of emergency, those levels are raised to 25 rem per year, which is still considered within the range of safe exposure.As your body recovers from radiation exposure, it is possible to return to that same work environment. There are no guidelines and little evidence to suggest that there may be future health risks associated with such repeated exposures.

Rest.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Avoid mind-altering substances.,
Take pain reliever.,
Use an ice pack.,
Stay with someone for 48 hours.",How to Treat a Mild Concussion2," Treating a mild concussion requires both physical and mental rest. That is the single most important thing a person can do to recover as quickly as possible.Physical rest means refraining from physical activity and exertion. A person should not get involved in any sports or any vigorous activity until his symptoms are gone or his physician clears him.
Mental rest means not engaging in thinking, reading, using the computer, watching TV, texting, schoolwork, or any activities that require concentration. Do not drive or operate machinery or tools.

, In addition to resting while awake, a person with a concussion needs to get plenty of sleep at night. This is just as important as resting.Try to get at least seven to nine hours each night.

, When someone has a concussion, he should avoid mind-altering substances. Do not drink alcohol, and do not take any recreational drugs., If a person has headaches, he can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain.Avoid ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), aspirin, and Naproxen (Aleve). These pain relievers can increase internal bleeding., If someone has a bump or a bruise that hurts, use an ice pack. Don’t place the ice pack directly on the person's skin. Wrap it in a towel, and hold it on the bump or bruise for 10 to 30 minutes. Repeat every two to four hours for the first 48 hours.If an ice pack is not available, a bag of frozen vegetables can be used.
Ice packs can help with the inner headache as well.

, When someone has a concussion, he should not be alone for 48 hours after the injury. Someone needs to stay with him in case he starts exhibiting serious symptoms."

Recognize the symptoms of a concussion.,
Monitor for delayed symptoms.,
Watch for symptoms in children.,
Monitor for red flags.",How to Treat a Mild Concussion3," After someone hits his head, he or someone close to him needs to monitor for symptoms. He needs to know if he has a concussion. The most common symptoms of a concussion include:Headache or a sense of pressure in head
Nausea or vomiting
Dizziness or loss of balance
Double or blurry vision
Sensitivity to light or noise
A sense of feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy
Confusion, or concentration or memory problems like amnesia of the event
General sense of not feeling right
Seeming dazed, stunned, confused, forgetful, and moving clumsily
Loss of consciousness
Slow to answer questions
Mood, personality, or behavior changes

, Some concussions symptoms can be delayed. Symptoms can occur minutes, hours, or even days after the injury. A person should continue to watch for symptoms for a few days after the concussion.These include:


Concentration or memory problems
Irritability and other personality changes
Sensitivity to light and noise
Sleep disturbances, such as not being able to go to sleep, difficulty staying asleep, or not being able to wake up
Psychological adjustment problems and depression
Disorders of taste and smell

, In young children, it can be difficult to detect a concussion. In children, symptoms of a concussion include:A dazed or confused appearance
Listlessness
Easily tired
Irritability
Loss of balance and unsteady walking
Excessive crying with nothing working to soothe the child
Any change in eating or sleeping patterns
A sudden lack of interest in favorite toys

, Some symptoms that occur after a concussion are red flags. Red flags are signs that someone should get immediate medical attention. These red flags include:Repeated vomiting
Any loss of consciousness that lasts longer than 30 seconds
A worsening headache
Sudden changes in behavior, the ability to walk, like sudden stumbling, falling or dropping objects, or thinking ability
Confusion or disorientation, like not recognizing people or surroundings
Slurred speech or other changes in speech
Seizures or uncontrolled tremors
Vision or eye disturbances, like pupils of unequal sizes or very large, dilated pupils
Dizziness that doesn’t get any better
Any symptoms that get worse
Large bumps or bruises on the head (other than the forehead) in children, especially in infants under 12 months of age

Signal rescuers.",How to Survive After a Shipwreck," Perhaps the most important thing to surviving a shipwreck is staying calm. This is even more important in the first chaotic moments in a tragedy at sea. If you don’t stay calm, you could put yourself in more risk.If you find yourself panicking. Tell yourself to relax and breathe deeply.
Think before you act. Don’t just run to the first life boat, or jump in to the water at the first sight of danger. Consider all your options.;
, As the craft you’re on is sinking, you should make it your primary goal to find some sort of flotation device. Without a flotation device, you probably won’t survive for very long in the water. Some devices include:

Life preservers.
Solid life boats.
Inflatable rafts., If you must jump from a boat, make sure to keep your shoes on. Look down before you jump to make sure you don’t land on other people or objects. Place one of your arms on your abdomen. Then, grasp your opposite elbow. Use the opposite hand to hold your nose closed. Finally, jump as far off as you can. As you fall, cross your legs and try to enter the water with your feet first., Large ships tend to create a suction effect and suck things down with them as they sink. As a result, the larger the vessel, the farther you should get away from it as it sinks. This is important, as large boats can bring you down even if you’re wearing a life preserver., If you don’t have a life preserver, raft, or something else to float on, look around the area of the shipwreck for any debris you could use to stay afloat. There are many possible items that you could use, such as:


A door
Pieces of the boat that are still floating.
Spare lifeboats or life preservers that aren’t being used.

, After you’re a safe distance from the boat, you should take a quick look at yourself to see if you’re injured or not. This is important, as you could need immediate medical attention. Pay attention to whether:



You’re bleeding. If so, and the wound is bad, you may need to use a tourniquet to stop loss of blood. This is important, as blood loss could fasten the pace at which hypothermia sets in.You have a broken limb. A broken limb could seriously inhibit your ability to swim. If you have one, you’ll need to immediately ask for the assistance of another survivor.

, After you’ve checked yourself and found a way to keep yourself afloat, see if you can offer assistance to other survivors who may need help. Other survivors could be in serious distress and need immediate help.Assist others who may be in shock. Talk to them, tell them things will be okay, and let them know you are there to help them.
Treat people who have concussions.


, After you’ve adjusted to your new status, you need to talk to everyone in your group and get them organized. Survivors in your group may have knowledge, expertise, or ideas about how to increase your survival chances and get rescued.Stay together. Your chances of surviving and being rescued are a lot higher if your group is organized and stays together.

, After you and other survivors have found a way to stay afloat, start organizing and gathering supplies. Ultimately, the more supplies you have and the better you manage them, the longer you’ll be able to survive until you are rescued. Pay special attention to:


Fresh water. Store and ration your fresh water as well as you can.
Food.
Signal flares and other items you could signal rescuers with.

, Next to drowning, hypothermia is the biggest threat to your survivor after a shipwreck. This is because exposure to cold water will lower your body temperature. If your body temperature gets too low, your body will eventually shut down and you will die.

If you’re in the water with a flotation device and not on a raft, hug your knees to your chest. This will help maintain body warmth.
If you’re with others in the water or in a raft, stay close together, and hug each other.
Keep your clothes on. Even if they’re soaked, they’ll help maintain your body temperature., Next to hyperthermia and drowning, one of the biggest dangers on the open water are sharks. Sharks are especially dangerous around shipwrecks because they’re attracted to blood from injured people and by the fish that gather around floating objects on the surface of the water.

Avoid splashing around. This will minimize the attention that you draw to yourself and your group.
If someone has an open wound, do your best to stop the bleeding. Blood will draw fish and sharks from great distances., Once you’re relatively safe and stable on the water, you should look start to look for land. If you don’t find land, you’re chances of survival will drop every day as your supplies slowly disappear. There are many ways you can find land:


Estimate your position based on your last known position. You can do this using charts, maps, or the stars.
Look for signs of land like the presence of birds, driftwood, or trash. If you see birds, look at the direction they come from and fly toward.
Try to visually spot land on the horizon. Depending on you distance, it could be hard to spot, but you should try., If you find yourself in need of water and have a few basic supplies, you may be able to create some. Take a plastic tarp and set it out across your raft or lifeboat. Use it to collect rainwater. In addition, if there isn’t rain, you may be able to collect condensation off of it in the morning.Never drink salt water. It will dehydrate you.

, Whether you’re on a boat, floating on the water, or on land, you should try to signal rescuers as often as is possible. Without a signal, rescuers may not be able to spot you and other survivors after a shipwreck. Some methods of signaling include:


Shooting a flare gun. Depending on how many flares you have, you may want to save these for when you see a boat or aircraft passing in the distance.
A mirror. Use a mirror to reflect the sun toward a possible search craft.
A fire. If you’re on land, light a fire to gain the attention of rescuers.
Building a sign or some other sort of structure on a beach. For instance, create a “SOS” sign with coconuts or driftwood."
"
Find a suitably-sized square of cloth.,
Fold the cloth in half diagonally to make a triangle.,
Clean and dress any wounds before wearing the sling.,
Remove any jewelry from the injured arm.,
Slip one end of the cloth under your arm and the other over your shoulder.,
Bring the other end of the sling over your other shoulder.,
Tie the ends of the sling behind your neck.,
If desired, close the edge of the sling with a safety pin.,
Maintain good posture while you wear your sling.",How to Make a Sling for Your Arm1," This method uses a square of fabric to replicate the functionality of a real sling. Depending on your height and size, the precise size of the cloth you'll need can vary. For most people, a square of fabric that's roughly 40 inches (1 meter) on each side will work well. Ideally, you'll want a fairly inelastic piece of fabric - stretchy fabric allows your arm to bend and move, which can aggravate your injury.


One easy way to get a 40 inch (101.6 cm) square piece of fabric is to cut an old pillowcase or bed sheet that you don't mind ruining to size with a pair of sharp scissors or a fabric knife. In a pinch, you can even use your bare hands to tear these things to the right size.
When it comes to your sling fabric, err on the side of using a fabric square that's too big, rather than too small. A sling that's too big can be tightened by adjusting the knot behind your head while wearing the sling, but there's no real way to make a sling looser than the length of its fabric allows.;
, Next, you'll want to fold the fabric of the cloth across itself diagonally to form a triangle. When worn as a sling, the ""fat"" middle portion of the triangle will support your arm and the thin corners of the triangle will form a comfortable neckband behind your head.


If, for some reason, you find that the sling isn't comfortable while folded, you can alternatively cut the square diagonally to create the same shape.

, When wearing the sling, your arm will be held in contact with cloth which, if you're making your own sling from home materials, has probably not been disinfected. Thus, if your injured arm has any open wounds, it's extra-important to insure that all of your wounds are cleaned, dried, and carefully bandaged before you introduce them to the sling's material. Below is a rough guide for cleaning minor wounds - see How to Care for Minor Abrasions and Scratches for more information. If you have a serious injury or see a bone at the site of the injury, don't attempt to make yourself a sling - go to a hospital immediately.First, wash any open wounds BUT do not use extremely cold or extremely hot water. And use slow flowing water. Not harsh. If you do anything mentioned not to, you will surely hurt your arm even more.
Remove dirt or any other debris from the wound with a clean pair of tweezers if it is not rinsed out by water.
Apply a bandage over the wound. Use a bandage that covers the wound completely with no adhesive portion touching the wound itself. If needed, you may want to place clean gauze between the bandage material and the wound.
Do not directly touch the wound unless you have medical experience...

, Next, you'll want to take off any rings, bracelets, and/or armbands that you are wearing on the injured arm. If the injured arm swells as it heals, jewelry (particularly tight-fitting pieces) can constrict the flow of blood to the arm, causing pain and irritation and even becoming stuck.

, Position your injured arm at a 90 degree angle across your chest (horizontal to the floor). Use your other arm to slip the folded, triangular piece of fabric over the shoulder of your uninjured arm. Let the rest of the fabric hang so that it lies behind the injured arm with the ""point"" of the umbrella pointing roughly towards the hip that is on the same side of the body as the injured arm.

, Use your uninjured arm to grab the corner of the triangle that is pointing towards the floor and bring it up across your body, over the opposite shoulder as the other end of the fabric, and behind your neck. Do this gently, as the fabric should now be touching the injured arm and can jerk on the arm if pulled roughly. The length of the sling material should be such that the injured arm can hang comfortably at a roughly 90 degree angle.


Your fingers should extend just far enough beyond the ""cuff"" of the sling that it's possible to use them for simple tasks like writing while the hand is still supported by the sling. If this is not the case, adjust the fit of the sling as needed.

, When you've found a comfortable length for your sling, tie a simple knot in the two ends of the sling material to secure the sling behind your neck. If you need to adjust the height at which your sling hangs, loosen this knot and tie a new one either further ""up"" or ""down"" the length of the fabric. Congratulations! Your new sling is ready to wear.


If this knot uncomfortably digs into your neck, slip a small pad or towel under it.
Be sure to avoid the hair at the nape of your neck when tying your knot. If you accidentally tie some of your hair into the knot, it can be painfully yanked when you move your arm or walk.

, If you have a safety pin handy, pin the two edges of the sling material near your elbow together. This creates a ""backstop"" for your elbow to rest against. Without this backstop, it's possible for your arm to slip out the back of the sling as you move or for the sling material to bunch up near your wrist.

, A sling transfers the weight of your injured arm onto your upper back and neck. This added burden can cause back and neck strain - even if you don't experience serious strain, over time, you'll probably notice that your sling causes the area between your shoulder blades to become fatigued. Lessen this effect by maintaining proper, erect posture. See below for brief posture instructions:


When you stand while wearing your sling, keep your back straight and your shoulders in a pulled-back but relaxed position. Keep your chin up and avoid slouching.
When you sit while wearing your sling, keep your back against the chair's backrest, if there is one. Keep your back straight and upright. Keep your head and chin up so that your neck stays straight. Keep your feet planted on the ground. Don't sink into a slump or slouch. If you can comfortably support your arm on the chair's armrest, you may do so.
If at any point while wearing a sling, you experience severe back or neck pain, see a doctor. Avoid wearing a sling if you have a known neck or back ailment.

Use a walking aid or immobilizer.",How to Know if You've Sprained Your Ankle," Try to remember what happened at the moment that you were injured. This may be difficult, especially if you are in a great deal of pain. However, your experience at the moment of injury may provide clues.


How fast were you moving? If you were moving at a very high speed (e.g., skiing or running at top speed), there is a chance your injury is a bone fracture. This will require professional medical attention. A lower speed injury (e.g., rolling your ankle while jogging or walking) is more likely a sprain that may heal on its own with proper care.
Did you feel a tearing sensation? In many cases you will, in the case of a sprain.Was there a popping or snapping sound? This can occur with a sprain.It is also common with a bone fracture.;
, In the case of a sprain, your ankle will become swollen, usually immediately.Examine your ankles side-by-side to see if the injured one looks larger. Pain and swelling will usually occur in ankle sprain or fracture.


Foot or ankle deformity and unbearable pain usually indicate ankle fractures. Make sure to use crutches and go to your doctor immediately.

, A sprain also often causes bruising.Examine the ankle for signs of discoloration resulting from bruises.

, A sprained ankle will often feel tender. Gently touch the injured area with your fingers to see if it is painful to the touch., Stand up and gently put some weight on the injured ankle. If it is painful to put weight on the ankle, it could be sprained or fractured. Get medical attention immediately and use crutches.


Feel for a ""wobbliness"" in the ankle. A sprained ankle often feels loose or unstable.In the case of a severe sprain, you may not be able to put any weight on the ankle at all, or use that foot to stand. Doing so will cause too much pain.Use crutches and seek medical attention immediately.

, Ankle sprains come in three different grades. Treatment options will be determined based on the severity of the injury. The least severe is a grade I sprain.This is a minor tear that doesn't affect your ability to stand or walk. While it might be uncomfortable, you can still use your ankle normally.
A grade I sprain may result in minor swelling and pain.
In a minor sprain, swelling will usually go away in a few days.Self-care is usually enough for a minor sprain., A grade II sprain is a moderate injury. It is an incomplete but substantial tear of a ligament or ligaments.In a grade II sprain, you will not be able to use your ankle normally and will have trouble putting weight on it.
You will experience moderate pain, bruising, and swelling.
The ankle will feel loose and may look as if it has been pulled forward somewhat.
For a grade II sprain, you will need medical attention and may need to use crutches and an ankle brace for a while to walk.

, A grade III sprain is a complete tear and loss of the structural integrity of the ligament.With a grade III sprain, you will be unable to put any weight on the ankle and will be unable to stand without help.
Pain and bruising will be severe.
There will be significant swelling (more than 4 cm) around the fibula (calf bone).
There may be notable foot and ankle deformity and high fibular fractures just below the knee, which can be determined by a medical examination.
A grade III sprain requires the immediate attention of a doctor.

, A fracture is a bone injury that is especially common with high-speed ankle injuries in the healthy population or minor falling injuries in the elder population. The symptoms are often similar to a grade III sprain. A fracture will require X-rays and professional treatment.


A fractured ankle will be very painful and unstable.
A minor or hairline fracture may be identical in symptoms to a sprain, but only a trained medical professional with X-rays can diagnose or rule this out.
A popping sound at the moment of injury may be evidence of a fracture.
An obvious foot or ankle deformity, such as your foot laying in an unusual position or angle, is definite evidence of a fracture or ankle joint dislocation., Regardless of the degree of your injury, it is a good idea to contact your doctor if the pain and swelling continues for more than one week, to determine the best treatment.


If you see any evidence of a fracture and/or a grade II or grade III sprain, you must see a doctor. In other words, if you cannot walk (or experience significant difficulty doing so), have a numb feeling in the area, are suffering extreme pain, or heard a pop at the time of the injury, see a physician.You will need X-rays and a professional examination to determine treatment.
Self-care is often adequate for a minor sprain. But, a sprain that doesn't heal properly may lead to ongoing pain or swelling. Even if you only have a grade I injury, contacting your doctor for advice is the best course of action., While waiting to see a doctor, you can use a self-care regimen referred to as RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression splinting, and Elevation). This is an acronym that stands for the four treatment actions. For a grade I sprain, RICE may be all the treatment you need The first step is to rest the ankle.Avoid moving the ankle, and immobilize it if possible.
If you have cardboard handy, you can fashion a temporary splint that will protect the limb from any further injury. Try to splint your ankle so it's set in a normal anatomical position.

, Putting ice on the injury can reduce swelling and discomfort. Get something cold to put on the ankle as soon as you can.Place some ice in a bag gently on the joint. Cover it with a washcloth or towel to avoid possible frostbite on your skin.
A bag of frozen peas also makes a good ice pack.
Ice the injury for 15-20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours. Continue icing the injury in this way for 48 hours., For a grade I sprain, compressing the injury with an elastic bandage can help provide stability and reduce the risk of another injury.Wrap the area with bandage using a ""figure-eight"" pattern around the ankle.
Don't wrap it too tight, or you may worsen swelling. You should be able to get a finger between the bandage and your skin.
If you believe you have a grade II or grade II sprain, seek a doctor's advice before applying compression.

, Elevate the limb above your heart. Place your foot up on two pillows. This will decrease blood flow to the area and allow the swelling to improve.Elevation will assist gravity in clearing the swelling, and help the pain.

, To help manage the pain and swelling, you can take NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Common over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (trademarked names include Motrin, Advil), naproxen (trademarked as Aleve), and aspirin. Acetaminophen (also called Paracetamol or trademarked Tylenol) is not an NSAID and does not manage inflammation, but it can help reduce pain.Take only as directed on the packaging, and don't take NSAIDs for pain for more than 10-14 days.
Do not give aspirin to children under the age of 18 due to the risk of developing Reye syndrome.
For severe pain and/or a grade II or III sprain, your doctor may prescribe a narcotic to take for the first 48 hours.

, Your doctor may suggest a medical device to help you move around and/or immobilize your ankle. For example:You may need crutches, a cane, or a walker. Your level of balance will determine which is best for your safety.
Depending on the level of injury, your doctor may recommend using a bandage or ankle brace to immobilize the ankle. In severe cases, an orthopedic surgeon may put your ankle in a rigid cast.

Improvised slings are not as good as professionally-designed slings.,
Use a long-sleeved garment as a sling.,
Use a belt as a sling.,
Use a tie as a sling.,
Duct tape.,
Seek medical attention (and/or a real sling) immediately.",How to Make a Sling for Your Arm2," Modern slings are much more comfortable, ergonomic, and protective than what most individuals can craft. However, arm injuries can happen and you may have to improvise. If you are injured in the wilderness while on a camping trip, if may be impossible to obtain cloth to make the sling above. It is certainly better than no sling at all.

, Use a sweater, sweatshirt, button-up shirt, or other long-sleeved garment. Tie the garment's sleeves behind your head and carefully insert your injured arm through the loop formed. Allow the clothing material to support the weight of your arm somewhere along the forearm or wrist - wherever is comfortable.


Try to adjust the length of the garment's sleeves that your knot allows to hang so that your arm can hang at a roughly 90 degree angle (horizontal to the ground).
If you have safety pins handy, you may want to try ""closing"" the fabric of the long-sleeved garment around your elbow as a makeshift backstop for your sling as described in the method above.

, One piece of clothing seemingly tailor-made for improvised slings is the belt, due it having the built-in ability to form a loop with an adjustable size. Secure the belt buckle behind your neck and slip your arm through the loop formed by the rest of the belt. Allow your arm's weight to be supported by the belt along the forearm or wrist. Tie or fasten the belt behind your neck so that your arm is supported at a 90 degree angle.


The belt's buckle can be uncomfortable against the back of the neck, so may want to shift the belt so that the buckle is in the length of belt stretching between your arm and neck. You can also put padding between the belt and your neck for greater comfort.

, If you're injured in an office setting or while wearing formal ware, a necktie can suffice as a makeshift sling until a real one is available. As with the methods above, simply tie the necktie behind in a simple knot your neck and pass your arm through the loop formed. Adjust the positioning and length of your makeshift sling so that your arm hangs at a 90 degree angle.

, Duct tape can be used very effectively to help immobilize the arm. It has strength, flexibility, and a fabric-like quality which lends itself quite well to this situation.


A loop of duct tape can substitute for a belt or tie, supporting the wrist, arm, and elbow.
Duct taping the injured arm to the torso can help reduce movement.
Be sure to avoid getting duct tape residue on the skin. Duct tape should be faced so that it does not adhere to the skin.

, The types of situations in which you'll need to make a sling from your clothing are usually situations in which actual medical care is for some reason unattainable. If your injury is at all serious or persistent, seek the help and advice of a trained medical professional as soon as you can. Improvised slings are usually better than no sling at all, but they are no substitute for a real sling (to say nothing of the other treatments for an injured arm that a hospital can provide). It's better to be safe than sorry - don't risk worsening your arm injury by neglecting to show it to a doctor.

Seek medical attention for broken bones or dislocations.,
Head straight to the emergency room if you can see a bone in the wound.,
Only try to reset a bone if you are at risk of losing a limb.",How to Make a Sling for Your Arm3," A homemade sling may be a good choice for minor arm injuries, but it's not enough to ensure proper healing in the case of serious fractures or dislocations. Allow a doctor to examine the injury, take x-rays, and discuss a treatment plan with you. A doctor's final treatment plan may involve the use of a sling – but your injury might also require a cast or surgery. If you use a homemade sling to set a broken bone or a dislocated limb, your arm might heal poorly. You may experience lasting discomfort, and you may need further medical attention.


Common symptoms of broken arms include:Intense pain
Tenderness
Swelling
Loss of motion
Difference in appearance relative to the uninjured arm


Common symptoms of dislocated arms (most commonly in the form of a dislocated shoulder) include:Pain in the arm, shoulder, and/or collarbone
Deformation (a bump on or near the shoulder)
Swelling
Bruising



, When a broken bone sticks through the skin—or a wound forms in which bone is visible following a fracture—this is called an ""open fracture"" or ""compound fracture."" These fractures are exceptionally painful, dangerous, and difficult to treat. Be aware that the types of injuries that cause compound fractures can also cause other serious trauma.It is essential that you get yourself prompt, effective medical treatment.


Do not try to realign compound fractures without the help of a qualified medical professional. The only exceptions to this rule are rare, special cases: when you will not be able to secure immediate medical treatment, and setting a compound fracture by hand is preferable to the alternative of doing nothing at all.

, You should only ever attempt to realign broken bones when signs of poor circulation appear. Again: if possible, wait for a doctor to reset your broken bones. The exception is when it appears that a fracture is preventing blood from circulating through the limb. Your limb may not be receiving any blood if the area of the limb past the fracture looks pale or blue, has no pulse, looses sensation, or grows cold. In these cases, the potential loss of the limb outweighs the dangers of having an amateur re-set the bone – or of doing the job yourself.


If this is the case, visit How to Realign a Fractured Bone for more information.

, If the cut or sore is bleeding and is very near the edge of the nose, then gently apply pressure, using clean materials, until the bleeding stops. Do not block the breathing, and do not pack the nostril.If the injury is not clearly visible or is not right on the edge of the nose, then use accepted first aid methods to stop the bleeding.Sit up straight and lean forward. Maintaining this position helps to reduce the pressure in the vessels located in your nose, and prevents you from swallowing the blood.
Pinch the nose shut, using your thumb and index finger, and hold the nose shut for about 10 minutes. The person should breathe through their mouth during this time. After the 10 minutes, release the hold.
If the nose is still bleeding then repeat the procedure. If it still bleeds after 20 minutes, seek medical advice as the injury may be more serious than first anticipated.
Keeping the person cool during this process can be done by cool cloths or by sucking on something cold, like ice chips., To reduce infection and possible complications, you can use sterilized tweezers to remove any debris that remains in the cut., If you think something is lodged in the area, or if you just need to clean out any skin fragments, tissue, or blood clots, sterilize the items you plan to use. If you are not able to sterilize the tools, make sure they are as clean as possible.,
Wash the utensils, like tweezers, thoroughly with soap and water, then rinse completely.
Place the items in a pot or pan, with enough water inside to cover every item.
Cover the pan with a lid, and bring the water to a boil. Continue to boil the water for 15 minutes with the lid in place.
Remove the pan from the heat, keeping the lid in place, and let it cool to room temperature.
Drain the water from the pan without touching the sterilized items. If you are not ready to use the items, then leave them in the drained pot or pan with the lid on.
Carefully remove the items when you are ready to use them. Avoid touching the parts of the tools that will come in contact with the injury. Touch only the handles or grips.

, If you cannot easily see the cut, or reach it, then you may have trouble properly treating the area. You could do additional damage or introduce bacteria if the cut is up inside the nose., Usually, soap and water is the best way to clean a wound, cut, or minor injury to the skin. In some more delicate and sensitive areas, products that are both cleansers and antibacterial agents are sometimes recommended.One common product that is both a soap cleanser and anti-infective is called chlorhexidine, and is available without a prescription in most retail pharmacies.Chlorhexidine should be highly diluted before using on mucous membranes (the inside of the nose).

, Do not use any product that is not approved for use inside the nose.

, In order to reach the cut to clean it, you may need to carefully use a cotton swab or a piece of rolled up gauze.Use clean or sterilized tweezers to hold the gauze in order to effectively clean the area.Use fresh water and mild soap, or a small amount of chlorhexidine on the end of the cotton swab or gauze.Repeat your method with clean, fresh water, and clean tools, to rinse away any soap residue., Your cut is an entrance for unwanted bacteria into your bloodstream., Anti-infective, or antibiotic creams and ointments are made to be used on superficial cuts and scrapes, but may not be appropriate for more severe injuries further up inside your nose. Ask your doctor if this product can be safely used to treat the cut inside your nose. Products like this can be purchased without a prescription at your local pharmacy.If your doctor approves, place a small amount of the anti-infective cream or ointment on the end of a cotton swab, or on a small piece of gauze. Carefully apply the medicated cream or ointment to the area surrounding the cut., If you must use your hands to apply treatment, then be sure you have washed them thoroughly., Once you have applied the medication, leave the area alone. Keep your fingers away, and do not pick at the scab. Picking at the area can prevent the cut from healing and increase your risk of infection.Gently cleaning the area and using an emollient safe for your nasal area may help to prevent the formation of large and uncomfortable scabs. Consider using the anti-infective ointment, or a small amount of petroleum jelly to keep the area moist.
This should help the cut to form smaller and softer scabs, and help the area to heal on its own.

, Depending on the placement of the cut, its length, and depth, you may need to repeat the application of the medication every day, or every few days. Use caution not to introduce any bacteria., Persistent bleeding can indicate a broken bone, a deep cut inside your nose, or a more severe medical condition. Bleeding that continues for more than 15 to 20 minutes is a warning sign that something more serious may have happened., Some injuries that occur inside the nostrils may need to be medically treated. The nose is a sensitive area with a lot of blood vessels, fluids (like mucus), and sinus drainage – all of which contain bacteria. Some injuries that occur inside the nose need to be treated by a doctor, or even a specialist, such as an ear, nose, and throat doctor.In some cases, the wound may seem to heal properly, but returns in a few weeks or months. This is a sign of a possible infection. You may need to ask a doctor about antibiotics and medical procedures that can prevent your sore from coming back., If your cut was caused by an animal, or by something dirty with ragged and uneven edges, you need to be certain that the area is properly cleaned and treated. The earlier you identify an infection, the easier it will be to safely treat and control.See a doctor as soon as possible if your nasal injury was caused by something that could carry the potential for a serious systemic infection., Regardless of the cause of the cut, infections warrant prompt medical attention. Heed the following symptoms of infection:The area does not improve in a few days, or begins to get worse.
The area begins to swell, and feels warm to the touch.
The wound is causing a thick or pus-like drainage, and you notice an odor coming from the injury or the drainage.
You start to run a fever.

, In most cases, a physician will write you a prescription for an oral or topical antibiotic. Depending on the treatment, you can expect the cut to heal within a week or two once you have begun an antibiotic regimen."
"
Ice the area.,
Elevate the bruised area.,
Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen.,
Rest.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Get Rid of Bruises1," Putting something cold on the bruise will reduce swelling and help it heal more quickly. Do this as soon as possible, and you can stop the bruise from spreading so far.


Fill a resealable plastic bag with ice chips, or find a bag of frozen vegetables like corn or peas. Wrap the bag in a towel or T-shirt, and lay it over the bruise.
Flexible gel-filled ice packs, specifically designed for injuries, are available from sports shops. Athletes usually keep a few on-hand to fight bruises.
Put ice on the area for 15 minutes out of every hour. Over-chilling the skin around the bruise can lead to frostbite.
;
, Reduce blood flow to the area with gravity's help. Lifting the bruised area so that it's above your heart will prevent blood from pooling in the bruised area, and reduce discoloration.


For instance, if the bruise is on your leg, settle onto the couch and rest your leg on top of a few pillows. If your leg is even a few inches above your heart, you're good.
If your arm is bruised, try to prop it up on an armrest or a few pillows, so that it's at heart-level or above.
If your torso is bruised, you might be out of luck. Focus on icing the area instead.

, If the bruise is particularly painful, take an over-the-counter painkiller for relief. Read the label for the recommended dose.


Avoid aspirin, which is a blood-thinner and could make your bruise worse.

, Working your muscles increases blood flow to that area, and increased blood flow is not what you want to be doing to a bruise. Call it a day and cool your jets, both to prevent further injury and give your bruise a chance to heal.


Hang out on the couch. Watch a movie, play a game, read a book — just do something that doesn't require much physical activity.
Head to bed early. Your body needs sleep to repair itself, so hit the hay as soon as you feel tired.

, Most bruises aren't indicative of a serious medical condition, and can be treated safely at home. However, consider calling a doctor if any of the following apply to you:


You're bruising without any significant bumps, falls or other injuries.
You have a high fever, or you can see signs of infection around the bruise (redness, pus or other drainage).
If you feel extreme pressure around the bruise, which is large, call a doctor immediately. A significant decrease in blood an oxygen supply to one area is known as compartment syndrome, and can be life-threatening.

Help him or her down.,
Position the person on his or her back.,
Help the person rest if he/she regains consciousness.,
Check for a pulse if the person does not regain consciousness quickly.Call or ask someone else to call EMS.,
Initiate CPR if no pulse is found.,
Stay calm and reassure the victim.",How to Deal With Fainting1," If you notice a person starting to faint, try to catch him or her and slowly lower the person to the ground. When people faint, they are unable to protect themselves with their hands when they fall. Although typically a person who faints does not incur serious injuries, preventing hitting the ground will protect him or her. Of course, do this only if it is safe for you--if the person who is fainting is much larger than you, for example, this may put you into a hazardous situation.;
, Tap or shake the person, to see if she has regained consciousness. In most cases, people who have fainted regain consciousness quickly (usually between 20 seconds and 2 minutes).When people faint, they fall, which brings the head to the same level of the heart. In this position, it is easier for the heart to pump blood to the brain. Therefore, recovery can be just as sudden as fainting is.If the person regains consciousness, inquire about any pre-existing symptoms or conditions that may have caused the fainting. Symptoms such as headache, seizure, numbness or tingling, chest pain or trouble breathing are all worrisome. In such cases, emergency services (EMS) should be called., Loosen any constrictive clothing (like a tie or collar) on the person to make him/her comfortable.


Let the person lay on the ground and rest for at least 15-20 minutes. This provides enough time for blood to return to the brain.Give the person room to breathe, and fan the victim with fresh air. If fainting happens in a public place, crowds typically gather in order to see what happened. Ask people to back up unless they are actually helping the situation.
Give the person water and/or food once she is conscious and stable; food and water will help revive him/her. Dehydration and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) are common causes of fainting.
Do not let the person get up too quickly. Encourage him/her to stay lying down for a few minutes. This will allow blood flow to the brain to fully regain. Additionally, abrupt rise may precipitate another fainting episode. Once people have regained consciousness, they may try to brush it off by standing and trying to walk too soon after the incident.
If the person has a head injury, additional symptoms (such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe headache, etc.) or a preexisting condition (pregnancy, heart disease, etc.), he/she should consult a doctor.

, This is also an opportunity to have someone look for an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED). Assess the pulse at the person's neck because that is where it will be the strongest. Place your index and third fingers on the neck of the person to the side of the windpipe and feel for the pulse.Assess the pulse only on one side of the neck at a time. Checking both sides can compromise the blood supply to the brain.
If there is a pulse, try to raise the person’s legs a couple of feet above the ground. This helps blood flow back to the brain.

, If you're not familiar with CPR, consider seeing if anyone around you is a medical professional.Kneel next to the person.
Place the heel of one hand at the center of the person’s chest.
Place the other hand on top of the first.
Be sure not to bend your elbows.
Use your whole upper body weight and compress on the person’s chest.
The chest must be compressed as you push straight down by at least 2 inches.
Push down on the chest at about 100 compressions each minute.
Continue chest compressions until EMS arrives and takes over.

, Staying composed and in control of the situation can make all the difference.

Add warm water into a cup.,
Add a tablespoon of vinegar and mix well.,
Soak the solution you have made into cotton wool.,
Understand that sometimes it is easier to store pre-made disinfectant supplies at home.,
Purchase antiseptics.,
Use topical antibiotics.,
Try other natural remedies that decrease the chance of wound infection.",How to Make a Quick Disinfectant for Minor Cuts and Abrasions," The best way to do this is to apply direct pressure to the wound and, if possible, to raise it above the level of the heart (if bleeding is severe). This will diminish blood flow to the area, and give time for a clot to form at the site of the wound. , Start by washing the area thoroughly with cool, running water. Then use an antibacterial soap, if possible, such as Dial or Soft-soap (if you do not have either of these, regular soap will do) to clean the wound. If there is still debris in the wound, you may want to use a pair of clean, sterilized tweezers to remove it.

, If the bleeding won't stop, or if is a deeper wound or has ""foreign objects"" in it (materials that cannot be removed easily), it is important to seek the advice of an experienced physician.


Similarly, if the injured person has stepped or fallen on a sharp object (such as a nail) or been cut by a metal or rusty object, it is important to go to the Emergency Room to receive a tetanus shot (if necessary) and appropriate medical evaluation.

, Make sure that the cup is clean. Then add a teaspoon of salt into the water.


Salt can be iodized. The salt used for regular cooking will be ideal.
Mix well until all the salt dissolves in the water. Using warm water helps it to dissolve faster.
Salt mixed with water has been proven to be effective as a disinfectant, as shown by researcher Dr. Sarah Forgie (a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta). , Any kind of vinegar (processed or natural) will do the trick. Vinegar contains a mild acetic acid, which can cleanse and disinfect wounds.


Vinegar has been recognized for its medicinal uses and anti-infective properties since the age of Hippocrates (460-377 BC, considered the ""father of modern medicine""). If vinegar is unavailable, fresh lemon juice will also suffice.

, Then apply it to fresh cuts and abrasions on the skin. It is preferable to open a sealed pack of cotton wool to ensure optimum cleanliness.


Make a fresh preparation each time this procedure needs to be repeated. This is the safest way to ensure the solution does not get contaminated in any way.

, Especially if you are in a household with children — who are prone to frequent cuts and abrasions while playing — it can be helpful to have some supplies in the house that are ""easy-access"" for when an injury does occur.


These can be purchased over-the-counter at any drugstore or pharmacy, and are described in more detail in the steps below.

, Either iodine or hydrogen peroxide is effective as an antiseptic — meaning they work to reduce the likelihood of infection in a wound.Do not rub the area too hard when applying the antiseptic, as this may further the injury or cause irritation to the wound. Gently applying it is all that is required. Use a cotton ball to apply the antiseptic to the wound surface; this is because the cotton ball is clean, so it will not further contaminate the wound, as opposed to using your hand.
Note that hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used antiseptic, and it can be purchased at any drug store or pharmacy. , Antibiotic creams or ointments, such as Neosporin or Triple Antibiotic, can be applied directly over the cut, and then covered by a Band-Aid. These greatly diminish the possibility of bacterial infection of the cut or abrasion. , These have been shown to boost the immune system and to increase speed of healing. Examples include gently rubbing aloe vera, honey, or lavender oil on the wound, and then covering it with a bandage.

Encourage bleeding at the site of puncture.,
Wash the wound.,
Dry and cover the wound.,
Flush splashes of blood and needle contents on other parts of your body with water.,
Irrigate eyes with saline, clean water or sterile irrigants.Gently flush the eyes if any splashing occurred there.

,
Remove and change potentially contaminated clothing.,
Seek medical attention immediately.,
Determine whether HIV exposure is possible.,
Determine whether other exposures are possible.,
Report the incident.,
Have follow up testing and medical supervision of your recovery.,
Have a plan of action for next time.,
Ensure safe working practices in a health care environment at all times.,
Ensure safe working practices in other workplace environments.,
Avoid unnecessary distractions when working with needles and syringes.",How to Deal With a Needle Stick Injury at Work," Do this by running cool water over the bleeding area for several minutes.In this way potential infectants are expelled from the wound and washed away, minimizing entry into the bloodstream. Once the virus enters your bloodstream, it may start to multiply, so it is best to keep the virus cells from entering the bloodstream in the first place.;
, Gently cleanse the site of the needle stick or sharps entry with plenty of soap after you have bled the wound and flooded the site. This will help to kill viruses and bacteria, removing sources of infection and reducing the chance of infection.Do not scrub the wound while you're washing it. This can make the injury worse.
Never try to suck the wound., Use a sterile material to dry the wound and immediately cover the wound with a waterproof plaster or dressing.

, If the contents of the needle splashed to nose, mouth, face or other skin areas, wash them well with soap.,, Place clothing in a sealed bag awaiting washing and sterilization. After undressing, wash your hands and parts of the body that were in contact with the potentially infectious clothing, then don fresh clothing.

, You will need to explain the circumstances of the injury and discuss possible disease exposures. Your blood may be tested to determine whether further treatment is needed.In the case of known exposure to other pathogens, immediate treatment will be administered. This could involve antibiotics or a vaccination.You might need a tetanus shot, depending on your prior history.

, Measures should be immediately taken to prevent sero-conversion from occurring. Scientists have proven that sero-conversion due to needle stick injuries for HIV is about 0.03 percent.This percentage is extremely low, so there is no need to panic.


The HIV status of the worker affected and the person whose blood was transferred will be checked. Hospitals and other medical facilities have rapid tests available to give a confirmed HIV status.
If exposure is likely, prophylactic medication (known as post exposure prophylaxis, or PEP) should be administered, preferably within an hour. Anti-retroviral drugs can reduce the rate of transmission if given soon after possible infection.All clinics and hospitals have a protocol in place for prompt action when responding to needle stick injuries.

, The risk for hepatitis transference is much higher that that for HIV (about 30% for Hepatitis B and about 10% for Hepatitis C), so swift action is essential, as well as preventative measures (i.e., being vaccinated against Hepatitis)., Check the reporting procedures of your workplace. It is important to let your workplace know what has happened, and the statistics so gathered can help to improve workplace practices for everyone's future safety. This includes injuries with sterile, ""clean"" sticks.

, This should be done at required intervals through the window period, the time during which a person exposed to a virus still tests negative, even though the virus is multiplying.


Retesting for HIV exposure usually occurs at six weeks, three, six, and 12 months to look for HIV antibodies.
Retesting for HCV antibodies usually occurs six weeks after the incident, and again at four to six months.

, If your workplace doesn't already have a protocol in place for dealing with needlestick injuries, create one. This information is freely available on any telephonic helpline or is physically available at pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and other medical care centers.

, The World Health Organization recommends the following for workplaces dealing with needle sharps:Hand wash after direct contact with patients.
Use protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, aprons, masks, and goggles when in direct contact with blood and other body fluids.
Collect and dispose of needles and sharps safely. Use puncture- and liquid- proof boxes in each patient care area.
Prevent two-handed recapping of needles. Use the one handed needle capping technique.
Cover all cuts and abrasions with a waterproof dressing.
Promptly and carefully clean up spills of blood and other body fluids with gloves on.
Use a safe system for health care waste management and disposal.

, Tattoo parlors, piercing shops, and many other types of workplaces also put workers at risk for needlestick injuries. Take the following precautions:


Wear appropriate clothing and protective gear when handling potentially dangerous items such as garbage bags or picking up piles of garbage.
Take care when sticking your hands into places you cannot see, such as sinks of water, holes, the backs of beds and sofas, etc.
Wear solid footwear when walking through or working in areas known for drug-use, such as parks, beaches, public transportation hubs, etc.

, Concentrate on your work and on what you are currently doing at all times.


Avoid looking away or working in bad light while dealing with the needle stick.
Be careful with restless or panicking patients who can easily move as you insert or withdraw the needle. Reassure them and only insert the needle when you're sure it is safe to do so.

"
Gently massage the bruise and surrounding area.,
Get some sun.",How to Get Rid of Bruises2," Do this several times a day beginning the day after the bruising occurs. This will help your body's normal lymphatic process to clear it away.


Keep in mind that the pressure shouldn't be painful. If the bruise is too painful to touch, hold off.

, Ultraviolet light breaks down bilirubin, which is the product of hemoglobin breakdown that causes the yellowish color of a bruise. If possible, expose the bruise to sunlight (safe amounts, don't sunburn) to accelerate the isomerization of the remaining bilirubin.


Try to get 10 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight a day. This should be enough to help break up your bruise without leading to a sunburn.

"
"
Rub the bruise with vinegar.,
Eat pineapple.,
Apply parsley.,
Use arnica ointment or gel daily.,
Apply a live leech.,
Apply heat.",How to Get Rid of Bruises3," Mix vinegar with warm water, and rub it over the injured area. Vinegar increases blood flow near the skin's surface, so it may help to dissipate the blood that has pooled in the bruised area. Witch hazel will also do the trick.

, Bromelain, a digestive enzyme found in pineapples, breaks down proteins that trap fluids in the tissues after an injury.

, Take a handful of fresh parsley leaves, crush them and spread them all over the bruise. Wrap the area with an elastic bandage. Some experts claim that parsley decreases inflammation, reduces pain and can make a bruise fade more quickly.

, Arnica is an herb that has long been recommended for bruises. It contains a compound that reduces inflammation and swelling. Find an ointment that contains arnica, and rub it over the bruise once or twice a day.

, If you have access to a holistic medicine supply store or a very well-stocked Chinese medicine store, you can apply a live leech. It will remove the surface blood in a bruise in a few seconds. The leech's saliva also acts as a mild painkiller, so you won't feel the bite. Apply rubbing alcohol or petroleum jelly to remove the leech.


This is only recommended if you can be sure that the leech is farm-raised and free of disease.

, Elevate the injured area on a cushion or pillow. Use a reusable heat pack; try not to use electric blankets. Wet heat is better for injuries than dry heat.


Apply heat pack for only a couple of minutes at a time, and only after attempting to use an ice pack. Only try using the heat method if ice hurts too much or makes your skin ache. For some people, this is a real problem and ice can exacerbate cold reactions.

Learn to recognize the signs of an oncoming fainting spell.,
Find somewhere to lie down if you feel about to faint.,
Breathe deeply.,
Call for help.,
Try to stay safe if you do faint.,
Take some preventative steps to avoid fainting in the future.,
Consult a doctor if the problem continues.",How to Deal With Fainting2," One of the best things you can do if you are prone to fainting is to learn to recognize the signs. Keep a notebook or log of your own symptoms if you are prone to fainting. If you can tell in advance that you are about to faint, you can take the proper safety precautions and potentially avoid a serious injury. Signs that you may be about to faint include:Nausea, dizziness or lightheadedness
Seeing white or black spots or experiencing blurry or tunnel vision
Feeling very hot or sweaty
Having an upset stomach

, Raise your legs to encourage blood flow to the brain.


If it's not possible to lie on the ground, sit down and put your head between your knees.
Rest for about 10-15 minutes.

, Take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This can also have a calming affect.

, Calling for help is a good idea because it alerts other people to your situation. Another person can then catch you if you fall, place you in the recovery position, and call a doctor if necessary.

, If you have recognized that you are about to faint, it's important that you remove yourself from any potential dangers and take some steps to minimize the severity of the faint.


For example, try to position your body such that you fall out of the path of sharp objects.

, In some cases, it is possible to prevent a potential fainting spell by taking the proper precautions and avoiding possible triggers. Some preventative steps include:



Staying hydrated and eating regularly: It is essential to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and other fluids, especially on hot days. Eating regular, healthy meals can help ameliorate feelings of dizziness and weakness associated with hunger.

Avoiding stressful situations: For some people, fainting is brought on by stressful, upsetting or anxiety-producing situations. Thus, it is important to stay calm by avoiding these kinds of situations as much as possible.

Avoiding drugs, alcohol and cigarettes: These items are full of toxins that are generally unhealthy and can induce fainting in some people.

Avoiding changing position quickly: Fainting is sometimes caused by sudden movement, such as standing up too quickly after sitting or lying down. Try to stand up slowly, and hold onto something stable for balance, if possible.

, If you find yourself fainting on a semi-regular or regular basis, it's important to consult your doctor. The fainting may be a symptom of a more serious underlying issue, such as heart problems or orthostatic hypotension.


You should also contact the doctor if you hit your head while fainting, are pregnant, suffer from diabetes, a heart condition or another underlying issue, or if you experience accompanying symptoms like chest pain, confusion or shortness of breath.Your doctor will evaluate your medical history to figure out why you have fainted. Further tests such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work may be performed also.

Be on the offensive side of the ball.,
Stay dry when outside in the cold.,
Know the signs of hypothermia so that when you see them, you will know to immediately call emergency services.,
Make 100 percent sure that you know the proper versus the improper way to start warming someone back up.,
Start CPR only if the victim is unconscious without a pulse.",How to Treat Severe Hypothermia," This means to try to prevent the factors that lead up to hypothermia in the first place. Wear hats and gloves; bundle up warmly. Pay attention to the weather; when the weatherman speaks of the wind chill factor, know that this is a serious factor that contributes to more cases of hypothermia than any other.;
, Be extremely cautious around water, and don't walk on ponds or lakes that look frozen over, unless you see a truck drive by on it. Even solid looking ice can be deceiving. If you are exercising outside and perspire, though you might feel hot, take precautions with the cold air and the wind. Stay covered up and only remove clothing when you are out of the elements.

,


Violent shivering, then pauses. This is a sign that the body is trying desperately to generate heat, but is not compensating enough.
Pale skin. Some people are naturally pale; however, if their pupils are dilated also, you have a real problem on your hands. If you haven't called emergency services by this point, stop anything else you are doing and get on the phone.
Hallucinations. This is a very good indicator that the person is suffering from severe hypothermia. In general, any hallucination is not good and the paramedics need to be called at any rate.

, Improper re-warming can cause shock and cardiac arrest from metabolic acidosis.


Slowly remove any wet clothing and replace with dry clothing or blankets. No sudden movements.
Do not rub the victim's skin or move their joints or excessively cause them to move around. If they are conscious, you may give them some room temperature (not hot!) beverages, such as water, juice or tea. Do not give alcohol or caffeine.
Skin to skin contact is the best method for re-warming the victim. Remove clothing (be modest and considerate) and lie next to the victim's body. An electric blanket can be used if it is not already at the maximum temperature. It needs to come up gradually.
Put a dry hat on the victim. Most body heat leaves through the head. One of the defense mechanisms of the human body is to try to keep the central organs warmest with blood flow, so the extremities will not have as much blood flow so be sure to cover up the hands and the feet as well.

, Even if a light or very faint pulse is present, do not attempt CPR; this could cause more damage than good.

Check the person's body temperature.,
Move the person out of the cold.,
Cover the person in warm, dry blankets.,
Introduce warm liquids to the person.,
Share body heat to raise temperatures.",How to Treat Mild Hypothermia1," If you have quick access to a thermometer, you can check the person's temperature. The typical body temperature usually sits around 98°F (36.7°C). Mild hypothermia can manifest with a body temperature of 96–97.5°F (35.6–35.4°C). If it's lower than this, the hypothermia may be severe and you should seek medical help. Make sure to check his pulse and breathing. A person with severe hypothermia may appear unconscious, have a low pulse and difficulty breathing. If his breathing has stopped and you are trained in CPR, you can administer it immediately to get him breathing again. In all cases that breathing or pulse is abnormal, contact emergency medical service immediately by calling 911. ;
, If the person was outside in inclement weather without protection, in cold water, or even an elderly person in air conditioning for too long, make sure to remove her from the situation. The body will not be able to warm back up until the root cause of the temperature drop is changed.


If the person was in water, remove her wet clothes immediately. You will want to keep her movement as minimal as possible, so if needed, use scissors to cut the clothing away. Dry her off with towels, and cover her with blankets, being sure to put a blanket beneath her to insulate her from the ground.
If you are unable to get the person inside quickly, insulate her from the cold best you can. For example, put dry blankets or clothing below her so that she is not sitting on the cold ground.

, You want to avoid warming him up too quickly as this can cause the body to go into shock. Blankets are a great way to gradually raise body temperature while allowing the person to retain his own body heat, without making the changes too dramatic. , Hypothermia can cause dehydration. Introducing a warm, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free liquid. Broth, soup, warm milk or decaffeinated tea can be good options.If possible, give her a liquid that contains calories such as broth, soup, or warm milk. Carbohydrate-rich food will quickly release energy into the bloodstream, which causes a brief and sudden surge of heat. Also, proteins will help over time build up heat as her body attempts to metabolize it.

, Remove both of your clothing and lay skin-to-skin with the person under a blanket. This will raise the person's body heat gradually. "

Learn some hamstring stretches.,
Perform static hamstring stretches.,
Perform dynamic hamstring stretches.,
Try yoga or pilates.,
Stretch your hamstrings for the sake of your back.",How to Prevent Hamstring Injuries1," The two primary ways to prevent hamstring injury are by increasingly flexibility with stretching, and achieving a good balance across your muscle groups through training.There are a number of effective hamstring stretches you can practice, including static and dynamic stretches.;
, Static hamstring stretches can be effective in releasing tension and increasing flexibility. They are the easiest of the stretches to perform and are relatively more safe and less lightly to cause injury than dynamic stretches.There are a number of basic static stretches to learn.


To do a standing hamstring stretch simply stand facing a chair and lift one leg so the foot is on the chair seat. Then, with your chest and back straight, bend forward at the hips until you feel the stretch in your hamstring.
For a seated hamstring stretch sit so the knee of your right leg is bent and the bottom of your right foot is pressed against the inside of the left thigh. Stretch out your left leg ahead of you flat on the ground, and slowly lean down toward your left foot.Remember to switch legs after each stretch and repeat on the opposite side.

, Dynamic stretching is slightly move intensive than static stretching, as you are adding some movement to the stretches. You should generally do your dynamic stretches after completing some static stretches.Simple dynamic stretches include:


A straight leg toe touch. To do this stand straight up, hold your arms out in front of you and swing one leg up towards your hands, and then back behind you. Do ten or fifteen swings on each side.A one-leg bird stretch. Start with an upright posture, and then lift one leg straight behind you as you bend forward at the hips and try to touch your toes. Hold this position for a few seconds and then release it.You should stop if you feel pain performing these stretches.

, One way to incorporate regular stretching routines into your week is by trying out some yoga or pilates. Look for a class near you and give it a try. Doing either of these activities will help you to increase strength and flexibility across all your muscle groups., Carrying out hamstring stretches will not only improve the flexibility of your hamstrings, but it can lower the chances of back injury and pain. The hamstring muscle connects to your lower back and extreme inflexibility can cause back pain.Even if you are not an athlete and do not feel as though you will injure your hamstring, failure to stretch this muscle can lead to chronic back pain and injury.
Hamstring stretches can relieve lower back pain."

Call the emergency services immediately if the patient’s has a fever of 104 °F (40 °C) or higher.,
Move the person out of the sun and into the shade or an air conditioned room.,
Cover the patient's body with a damp sheet or spray them with cool water.,
Apply ice packs to the patient’s body if you have any available.,
Assist the patient into a cold shower or tub of cold water.,
Rehydrate the patient by giving fluids if possible.,
Pay attention if the patient begins to shiver and slow down the cooling process.,
Take the patient's temperature to determine if he or she is suffering from heatstroke.,
Look for other symptoms if you do not have a thermometer.,
Give the paramedics a full report when they arrive.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Do not over exert yourself and avoid the outdoors during the hottest times of the day.,
Wear loose fitting, lightweight and light colored clothing.",How to Treat Heatstroke," Even if the patient's temperature is slightly below the fever threshold, you should call an ambulance as body temperatures can range from 1 to 2 F or ½ to 1 C.If the ambulance dispatcher chooses to stay on the line with you and walk you through the steps you should be taking to treat the heatstroke patient, follow those steps instead of the ones in this article.;
, An air conditioned room is ideal as this will help begin to cool the patient down immediately.Once in the shade or the air conditioning, remove any unnecessary clothing that the patient may be wearing.If you do not have air conditioning, fan air over the patient. A notepad will work well.
You might lay the patient in the back seat of a car with the air conditioner on high.

, Find a sheet that is big enough to cover the person from their neck to their toes and wet it in the sink. Cover the patient with the wet sheet and fan them with a notebook. If you do not have a sheet, use a water bottle to spray the patient's body with cool water.You can also apply water to the patient using a sopping wet sponge or cloth.

, Place the ice packs under the patient's armpits, and on the groin, neck, and back. These areas contain blood vessels that are very close to the skin. Applying ice to these areas can help the body cool down more quickly.You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables if you don't have an ice pack handy.

, Have the patient sit in the shower and direct the cold water over them, as they may not be strong enough to stand. If you are outdoors and do not have a bathroom available, a lake, pond or stream or even cold water from a hose will help cool the patient as well., Sports drinks are ideal because they provide fluids as well as salt that the body will need to recover. If you do not have sport drinks you can make your own by adding 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar for every quart of water.Have the patient drink about half a cup of the drink every 15 minutes.


Make sure that the person does not drink too quickly. Tell them to drink it slowly.
Do not pour liquids into a patient’s mouth if they don’t seem alert enough to swallow. You might cause them to choke, adding another layer of danger to an already critical situation.
If you have neither sports drinks nor salted water, regular cool water will be fine.
Don’t offer the patient energy drinks or soft drinks. Caffeine disrupts the body’s ability to regulate its temperature, so these drinks will only make the situation worse., Shivering is the body's natural method of heating itself up, which would be counterproductive under these circumstances. In this case, shivering means that you're cooling the body too quickly, so ease off a little bit until the shivering subsides., The main symptom of heatstroke is a body temperature above 104 F (40 C).To take the patient's temperature with a thermometer, place the thermometer either in the patient's mouth or under the patient's arm. The thermometer should be held in place for approximately 40 seconds.Normal body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C), but can range from 1 to 2 F or ½ to 1 C.

, There are a number of other symptoms that indicate heatstroke aside from a high temperature. These include flushed skin, rapid breathing, racing heart rate and headache. Patients may also be confused, agitated and slur their speech. Lastly the patient's skin will be moist to the touch if they have been doing physical activity or hot and dry to the touch if they have been in hot weather.Talk to the patient to determine if they have a headache, slurred speech, confusion and or agitation.
Place your hands on the patient's chest to determine if they have heavy breathing, rapid heart rate, and/or flush, warm or moist skin.

, Tell them exactly what you have done to administer first aid thus far, and give them a detailed list of the patient’s symptoms.

, If you will be outside on warm days and doing something that requires physical exertion, be sure to drink plenty of water and sports drinks to stay hydrated. This can help prevent heatstroke before it starts.Try drinking a quart of water per hour.

, If you need to work outside, work in the early morning hours or the later afternoon hours. This is when temperatures are cooler, and cooler temperatures reduce the risk of heatstroke.Everyone reacts to heat differently, but physical exertion should be avoided at temperatures over 90 F (32 C).

, Excess, tight fitting clothing makes it difficult for the body to cool itself and increases the risk of heatstroke.Likewise, dark clothing will heat up the body and increase the risk of heatstroke. By dressing properly while you are active outdoors you can help prevent heatstroke before it starts.


You should also apply sunscreen to any exposed skin to help protect yourself from sunburn."

Know the symptoms of heat rash.,
Move the affected person into a cool, shady environment.,
Loosen or remove tight, damp clothing.,
Drink plenty of cold fluids.,
Take cool showers or baths to lower your temperature quickly.,
Avoid popping blisters.,
Use over the counter medication to ease discomfort.,
See a doctor if symptoms worsen or last longer than 2 days.",How to Treat Heat Rash1," Heat rash usually occurs underneath the clothes, where moisture and heat trap clothes close to the skin. It feels itchy and looks like a patch of bumps or pimples. Other symptoms include:


Pain, swelling, or warmth of the skin.
Red streaks.
Pus or fluid draining from itchy areas.
Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, or groin.
Sudden fever (over 100.4°F or 38°C).;
, Get out of the sun and somewhere cool and dry if possible, around 70°F. If you cannot get inside then move into the shade.


Most heat rash will go away soon after cooling off., Expose the affected area and let it air dry. Since blocked sweat glands cause most heat rash, you want the skin to be able to breath freely to prevent further blockage.


Do not use a towel to dry your skin-- air should be fine., Heat rash is a symptom of your body overheating. Avoid hot beverages and drink plenty of cold water to lower your body temperature., The water does not need to be cold, just cool enough to be relaxing. Use a gentle cleaner or antibacterial soap to lightly clean the affected area and pat or air dry afterwards.

, Blisters are filled with fluid meant to heal your skin, and they can scar if popped prematurely. While some blisters will pop, try to let your skin heal naturally and avoid picking at it., Treat heat rash with an application of 1% hydrocortisone cream or calamine/aloe lotion to relieve itching. For more extreme cases, antihistamines like Benadryl or Claritin can ease itching and swelling., While most heat rash will disappear soon after cooling off, severe heat rash can lead to infections that need treatment. Call a doctor if pain increases or spreads, if yellow or white pus begins to leak from your rash, or the rash does not disappear on it's own. Immediately call emergency services if you feel:


Nausea and Dizziness
Headaches
Vomiting
Fainting"

Know when to seek medical help.,
Do not apply direct heat to the afflicted person.,
Avoid prolonged exposure to cold environments.,
Understand who is at risk for hypothermia.,
Take steps to prevent hypothermia risk.",How to Treat Mild Hypothermia2," What starts as mild hypothermia can worsen into a condition that needs immediate help. Some signs to look for include confusion, shallow breathing, a weak pulse, or body parts like limbs or lips turning colors, which can indicate moderate to severe hypothermia.


If you see these signs do not try to move the person as these jarring movements can cause severe complications, especially to the heart. Severe hypothermia can cause complications like deadening of tissue like frostbite or even death. However, be sure to cover the person in dry blankets and remove wet clothing while you wait for help to arrive. , This includes a heating pad or hot water because this can cause irregular heartbeats or a burn injury. If you have access to something like a warm first-aid compress, apply this to her neck, chest, or groin. Do not apply to arms or legs because this forces cold blood from her extremities back into her lung or heart. This can be fatal.

, Do not stay out in the cold too long, particularly if you are not wearing the proper clothing.


Just because someone is indoors does not eliminate the risk of hypothermia. People, especially infants or elderly, that are in places with inadequate heating or air conditioning that is too cold can get hypothermia. , A number of factors like age, health, and medications can make someone more prone to hypothermia. You can take extra steps to make sure these at-risk people are not exposed to environments conducive to hypothermia. People who are very young or very old. Older people can have trouble regulating temperature and are more susceptible to environmental problems. Children lose heat faster than adults and may also lack the development and faculties to remove themselves from a situation, such as playing too long in the cold.
Alcohol and drug users. Alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate which means the body will lose heat faster. Also, the shiver response to cold that can help warm the body naturally is diminished when intoxicated. If you or a friend are intending to drink alcohol, avoid situations that can lead to hypothermia.
Medical conditions can affect the body's ability to regulate body temperature. These include an underactive thyroid, nerve damage, or even arthritis. If you or someone you know has these medical conditions you'll want to be aware of their sensitivities to environmental extremes like cold. Also, medications to treat a variety of conditions can affect how the body is able to regulate its own temperature. If you have any questions about the risk factors of a certain medication you should consult your physician. , Make sure to wear warm clothing in the cold, stay dry, and avoid activities that would make you sweat too much in cold weather.


Watch children carefully. Make sure they are adequately dressed. If they begin to shiver or are outside for too long, make sure they are coming inside regularly to warm up.
Keep emergency kits in your car. Anytime you are driving in the winter, a simple car malfunction can put you at risk for hypothermia. Keep candles, matches, blankets, and food and water in the back of the car in case you get stuck. If you break down somewhere cold, take the supplies in the car with you and if there are more than one of you, huddle together for warmth.
Be careful of exposure to cold water. Water does not need to be extremely cold to cause hypothermia and prolonged exposure to even cool water can bring it about. If you fall in cold water, get out as soon as possible. While you are in the water, do not attempt to swim unless you are close to safety as this can use up energy. Do not remove your clothing while in the water since this can help insulate you from the water.

Understand the importance of muscle balance.,
Stretch your quadriceps.,
Perform equal hamstring and quad strength training exercises.,
Consider consulting a trainer or physical therapist.",How to Prevent Hamstring Injuries2," As well as increasingly flexibility, it's important to have a good balance of strength across your different muscle groups. This means not working really hard on your hamstring but ignoring the other muscles around them. These kinds of imbalance are a common cause hamstring trouble., The quadriceps are the muscles on the front of your thigh, and they oppose the hamstring on the back of the thigh. An imbalance between these two muscles is cited as one of the most common causes of hamstring injuries.When you stretch your hamstrings, don't neglect your quads.


Place your right hand against a wall. Take the left hand and grab the left foot while bending your knee. Align your knees and tilt your pelvis forward as you pull up your left foot behind you.
Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat twice on each side.

, Leg curls are a common way to build up quad strength, but it's important to balance this with your hamstrings. Do the same number of sets and repetitions for a quad leg curl (sitting up and pushing your leg up into a straightened position) as a hamstring leg curl (sitting and pulling your leg down into a bent position).


If you are doing squats, taking them more slowly and minimizing the amount you lean forward will help you keep a good balance between quads and hamstrings., If you have a pronounced strength imbalance, or want more personally tailored workout plans, it can be a good idea to ask for some guidance from a professional.This is especially relevant if you are doing weighted exercises where there is greater risk of injury.


If you are strength training be sure to give your muscles a chance to rest and repair between workouts.

Warm up before starting any athletic activity.,
Stretch after the warm up.,
Cool down and stretch.",How to Prevent Hamstring Injuries3," Before any serious athletic activity you should always perform a warm up. The warm up should get the blood flowing through your body and increase your heart rate. It needs to be active and dynamic.Jumping jacks and jogging can be good warm up exercises.
If you are exercising in cold weather you should allow extra time for your warm up., You should devote several minutes to stretching before you run, play sports, swim or workout on machines, in order to decrease your risk of hamstring injury. This is especially important if you have had hamstring injuries in the past. After your initial warm up exercises, run through a few static and dynamic hamstring stretches.


Warm and stretched muscles are less likely to tear during exercise.A good warm up stretch involves lying on your back with your knees bent. Cup your hands behind one knee and bring it down towards you chest.
Hold it for around fifteen seconds keeping your head, back and butt on the ground.
Release and switch sides.

, After exercises repeat you should perform a cool down and stretch. Do some light aerobic exercise, such as jogging on spot and then stretch your hamstrings. Do not wait for the muscles to cramp up before repeating the stretches you did before your workout. After exercise your muscles are pliable and this can reduce injury and cramping.


A good cool down stretch just involves sitting down with your back straight and your legs out in front of you.
Reach down towards your toes with both hands, hold for ten seconds, release and repeat.
You might it easier to do this while sitting on a yoga block or a cushion.

Reduce your weight if you are overweight or obese.,
Stay hydrated.,
Have a healthy balanced diet.,
Have an active life.",How to Prevent Hamstring Injuries4," People who are overweight have increased stress on their leg muscles and joints, which leads to a higher risk of injury during exercise and everyday movement. Consult with your doctor about a safe combination of diet and exercise to bring your weight level down., Dehydration can lead to muscles cramping, which increases the chances of muscle injury.Drink plenty of water, with the standard eight glasses a day as your target. This is an important part of staying generally healthy, but it is especially important to stay hydrated when exercising to avoid cramping up.Drink 15 to 20 oz. (0.4 to 0.6l) of water 2 hours before you exercise.
Drink 8 to 10 oz. (0.2 to 0.3l) of water 10 minutes before you begin exercising.
Drink 8 oz. (0.2l) of water for every 15 minutes you exercise.
Increase your intake during intense exercise or hot weather. Drink at least 16 oz. (0.5l) of water after a workout., As well as staying hydrated, you need to keep your muscles fed with all the nutrients and minerals they need to be healthy. Having a well-balanced diet will help you to do this.


Some doctors recommend antioxidant supplements to help prevent muscle strains.Be sure to eat enough carbohydrates, if muscles don't have enough fuel they can cramp up., Doing regular exercise will help keep your body in good shape, and increase the strength and flexibility of your muscles. Simply walking around the office, home or outdoors can make your hamstrings more flexible than if you are stationary for too long.


Regular short walking breaks of 5 minutes every hour can have real health benefits."
"
Wear loose, breathable clothing in hot climates.,
Avoid strenuous physical activity in hot, humid environments.,
Take regular, 20 minute breaks from the heat.,
Dress infants like you would dress and adult.,
Sleep in cool, well-ventilated areas.",How to Treat Heat Rash2," You don't want your fabric to rub against your skin uncomfortably or trap sweat close to your body. Synthetic fabrics and baggy clothing work best.

, Heat rash is commonly caused by exercise, when you have a higher body temperature and create lots of sweat. If you feel a rash developing, take a break and cool off.

, Cooling off, changing out of damp, sweaty clothes, or jumping into a cool pool from time to time can help your body effectively regulate temperature, preventing heat rash before it occurs.

, Most heat rashes occur in infants, when well-meaning parents over-dress their child during hot weather. Babies should wear loose, breathable clothing in the heat as well.


Just because a baby's feet or hands feel cool to the touch does not mean they are cold., Heat rashes can appear overnight when you are trapped in damp, hot sheets for extended periods of time. Use fans, open windows, or turn on the AC if you wake up sweaty and uncomfortable."

Wear loose clothing that covers your arms and legs.,
Be aware that you can still get sunburned through your clothes!,
Monitor your fluid intake.,
Give yourself time to get used to the heat after moving to a new climate.,
Take extra care if you think you might be prone to heat stress.,
Listen to your local weather station to be aware of heatwaves.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Heat Stress," This is the most severe form of heat stress and it can be deadly. Heatstroke occurs when your body is unable to cool itself and your temperature rises to 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) or higher. Symptoms include hot skin (often without sweating, because the person may be too dehydrated to sweat), hallucinations, chills, severe headache, confusion, dizziness, slurred speech.
Call emergency responders immediately. Not only can heatstroke be fatal, but it can also cause permanent damage to the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.Do not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages (like soda).Cool down while you wait for the ambulance to arrive by sitting or laying in the shade or in an air conditioned building. Wet your clothes or sit in front of a fan.
When you arrive at the emergency room, the doctor may order tests to confirm heatstroke and start treatment to cool you down by using fans, ice packs or cooling blankets or by immersing you in cold water. These may include a blood test to monitor your electrolyte levels, a urine test to check for dehydration and kidney damage, muscle function tests, and imaging tests to verify that there has been not damage to your organs.If necessary, you may be given intravenous fluids to rehydrate you.;
, Heat exhaustion occurs when you lose too much water and salt, usually through sweating. During heat exhaustion, the body temperature has risen slightly. It must be treated immediately to avoid progressing to heatstroke.Symptoms include extreme sweating, weakness, tiredness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, clammy skin, pale or flushed skin, muscle cramps, quick, shallow breathing.
Rehydrate by drinking water or a beverage with electrolytes like a sports drink or fruit juice.
Lower your body temperature by sitting or lying quietly in the shade or an air conditioned building,taking a cool shower, or fanning your skin.
Seek medical care if you worsen or don't improve within 1 hour or if your temperature reaches 104°F/40°C or higher.

, Heat syncope occurs when you suddenly pass out or start to black out. Risk factors include dehydration or being in a hot climate that you are not used to, especially if you are sitting or standing for a long time, or get up too quickly.Symptoms include fainting and light-headedness.
Sit or lie down immediately when you feel symptoms coming on. Afterwards, rehydrate with water, juice or a sports drink and take it easy in the shade or a cool place.

, If you have been sweating extensively, chances are you lost a lot of water, salt and electrolytes. The reduced salt and electrolytes may make you prone to cramping.Symptoms include muscle spasms in the abdomen, legs, or arms.
Treat the cramping by stopping all strenuous activity and relaxing where it’s cooler.
Replenish your electrolytes and salts with a sports drink or juice. Just drinking water may not solve the problem, because you need to simultaneously get electrolytes.
Call a doctor if you have heart problems, are on a low salt diet, or if the cramps don't go away in one hour., Heat rash can occur due to extreme sweating, particularly in hot, humid weather when your skin can get irritated by remaining damp.It manifests as red bumps or small bubbles on the skin which might itch.
Reduce your exposure to heat and wash and dry the area.

, This will provide you with some shade, protect you from sunburns, and breathe better than tight clothing.Avoid dark colors which absorb the heat from the sun.
Wear light, natural fabrics which will breathe better than synthetics.
Wear a large brimmed hat for extra shade.
Take breaks and rest when working or exercising in hot weather. If you can, avoid exercising or working outside during peak hours (11am-3pm) and overexertion.

, If you are wearing loose weave fabrics, it may be necessary to put sunscreen on even on parts of your body that are covered.

, By the time you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated. Drink regularly during your heat exposure, even when you are not thirsty. In a temperate climate, men should drink about 13 cups/3 liters (0.79 US gal) of total beverages a day and women should drink about 9 cups/2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of total beverages a day.If you have reduced urine output or it is darker colored, then it is likely that you are not drinking enough.
Do not drink alcohol, highly sugary drinks, or strongly caffeinated drinks.
Avoid recreational drugs that may increase your sensitivity to the heat, such as amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy. Amphetamines and cocaine can increase your body temperature., It may take several months before you have the stamina and endurance that locals have. Being out in the heat is exhausting, so chances are you will be more tired than you expect.


Avoid strenuous activities during the hottest time of the day (10 am to 4 pm).
Plan frequent breaks to give yourself a chance to cool down.

, Groups who are likely to be extra sensitive to the heat include:Elderly people
Children
Pregnant women
Laborers working outside
People moving from colder climates
People with other health conditions, particularly those with asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, lung problems or obesity.People at risk for dehydration, including those who may be suffering from digestive conditionsSome medications increase the patient’s sensitivity to the heat. These include some diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, tranquilizers, and antipsychotics. Talk to your doctor before exposing yourself to extreme heat if you are on these medications., This will enable you to be extra careful during times of unusually hot weather.


Be aware that on humid days, your sweat evaporates more slowly making it more difficult for your body to remain cool.Heat stress can happen fast within minutes, but it can also come on slowly due to prolonged exposure to heat over several days."

Identify when you have a heat cramp.,
Stop exercising.,
Rest in a cool environment.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Perform gentle stretches to the affected muscle group.,
Monitor the cramp.,
Do not return to the activity right after cramps go away.,
Anticipate future recurrences.",How to Treat Heat Cramps1," Heat cramps are painful muscle spasms that result from dehydration, typically due to exercising or working in hot environments.Heat cramps are not simply caused by heat or being in a hot environment, as the name might suggest. Intense sweating from the exertion results in a loss of both fluid and the electrolytes (salt) needed for proper muscle function.Though you can experience heat cramps in any muscle group, they are most common in the calves, arms, abdominal muscles, and back muscles., Heat cramps are not something you “push through” during exercise. They are your body’s way of telling you that it needs a break. The first step to treat a heat cramp is to cease the exercise routine or activity that led to the cramp., Heat cramps are most commonly associated with overexerting yourself in the summer heat. If this is the case, get out of the sun as well. Find a cooler spot in the shade or indoors and give yourself time to rest and cool down.You can help your body cool down by applying a wet towel to the back of your neck.

, The cramp is a response to dehydration and loss of electrolytes, so you should also drink lots of fluids while you rest, preferably a sports drink (Gatorade, etc.) or an electrolyte beverage such as Pedialyte.Sports drinks with 25 – 200 mg of sodium are best.


Clear juice is also an option that will provide both the fluids and electrolytes you need.If all you have available is water, then dissolve a quarter or half teaspoon of regular table salt into one quart of water.It might not taste as good as a sports drink, but it will do the trick.

, You can also help make the cramp go away more quickly by gently stretching the muscle group. Use range-of-motions stretches rather than intense stretches.This will help reduce the spasming and pain in the muscles.

, By resting and replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, heat cramps usually subside fairly quickly. Note the time when the cramp first began. If the cramp hasn’t gotten better (or has gotten worse) after an hour, then you should call your doctor., The subsiding of the cramp alone does not indicate that you’ve adequately replaced the lost fluids and electrolytes in your body, so don’t take that as an indication to resume the exercise. You should continue drinking fluids and wait several hours before resuming any strenuous activity.Otherwise you risk another cramp or even a worse heat-related condition such as heat stroke.

, If you work outside in the summer or prefer to run as exercise, you can’t exactly avoid the summer heat, but you can prepare and minimize the risk of future heat cramps. Keep yourself hydrated before you before exerting yourself and take periodic drinks of a sports drink as you go to prevent developing a heat cramp.


You may still experience heat cramps for the first few days, but once accustomed to the hot environment, your adequate fluid replacement alone should eliminate any cramping.If the heat index is between 103 – 115°F (39.4 – 46.1°C), you should be drinking at least four cups of water an hour."

Drink water.,
Drink coconut water.,
Drink diluted fruit juices.,
Add a slice of fruit to your water.,
Avoid energy drinks.",How to Stay Hydrated During the Summer1," Our bodies are made up of 75% water. We need water to live. So drink up! Bottled water, filtered water, or (in most places) water straight from the tap will do just fine.One rule of thumb is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses (2 liters) of water per day.
Another good rule is to drink half of your body weight in ounces. So if you weigh 140 lbs., you should try to drink 70 ounces of water per day.;
, Coconut water is delicious and filled with electrolytes, so it makes an excellent alternative to water on hot days. If you have been sweating or working out, replenishing your body’s electrolyte stores is a great way to stay hydrated. Look for unsweetened varieties, as sugar hinders your hydration., If drinking water is too bland for you, you can enjoy diluted fruit juices. Choose natural, 100% juice options with no added sugar, such as apple juice or cranberry juice, then just add water. The higher your water-to-juice ratio, the more healthy hydrating power you’ll receive.Be sure to read ingredient labels.
Avoid fruit punch and cranberry juice cocktail, as these tend to have added sugar.
Avoid juices with artificial sweeteners added (such as sucralose or aspartame), as these are not great for hydration either.

, Spice up your glass of water by adding a bit of fruit. Slices of lemon or lime are classic choices and can make your glass of water more refreshing. You can also think outside the box with slices of cucumber, mandarin orange, or grapefruit. A simple slice of fruit can improve the taste of your water, and may even add a bit of Vitamin C to your drink., Anything high in sugar or caffeine is going to dehydrate your body, so avoid beverages with exceptionally high levels of both: energy drinks. These powerful mood-altering beverages can actually be dangerous in the summer heat.Not only do these drinks cause dehydration, they have adverse effects as well, which can increase the risk for cardiac complications, such as palpitations, tremor, shaking, agitations, shaking, chest pain, ischemia, dizziness and paresthesia (numbness and tingling).
If you do consume an energy drink, be sure to compensate with lots of extra water.
If you must enjoy an energy drink, limit yourself to one, and do so with caution.

Note your other symptoms.,
Take your temperature.,
Find a cooler environment.,
Drink cold water or sports drinks.,
Remove unnecessary clothing.,
Take additional measures to cool yourself.,
Rest with your legs elevated above your head.,
Seek immediate medical treatment.",How to Treat Heat Cramps2," If other symptoms develop along with your cramp, then you may have passed from simple heat cramping to heat exhaustion before your symptoms arose. You are likely experiencing heat exhaustion if your symptoms also include:Weakness
Headache
Dizziness or fainting
Nausea and/or vomiting
Elevated heart rate
Cool, moist skin
Heavy sweating

, Heat-related conditions result from your body failing to control its core temperature through usual means of sweating and evaporation. Take your temperature to see how elevated your temperature has gotten. A temperature that is elevated above normal but below 104°F (40°C) signifies heat exhaustion.If your temperature is 104°F (40°C) or above, then this indicates heat stroke, which is a medical emergency, and you should seek immediate medical assistance.Other signs of heat stroke include confusion, fainting, excessive sweating, or red, hot, dry skin., It is important to get out of the heat and to begin taking measures to cool your body temperature to prevent heat exhaustion from developing into heat stroke. Get out of the sun and heat and preferably into an air-conditioned space., As with a heat cramp, your body needs additional fluids and electrolytes already lost to sweating. Drink sports drinks, electrolyte replacement drinks (such as Pedialyte), or water mixed with half a teaspoon of salt per quart.Your body will continue trying to sweat as a means to drive down your core temperature. If you skip providing the fluids and salts that your body needs to produce sweat, you can create complications resulting in heat stroke.

, Even lightweight cotton will still trap some heat. Remove as much clothing as you can. Ensure that anything you’re still wearing is lightweight and loose enough to prevent binding against your skin., You don’t need to rely on sweating alone. Some additional measure you can take to help lower your core body temperature include:Taking a cool bath or shower
Misting yourself with cool water and sitting in front of a fan or in an air conditioned room
Soaking towels in cool water and placing them on your skin
Placing icepacks on your armpits and the back of your neck

, Fainting from a heat-related illness (heat syncope) is due to blood vessel dilation that reduces blood flow to your head. To help prevent fainting, rest with your legs elevated above your head to keep blood flowing., Heat exhaustion can quickly develop into heat stroke, so you should monitor your condition closely and know when to seek immediate medical care if necessary. Seek care if:Your symptoms do not subside after an hour
You can’t replace fluids and electrolytes due to nausea and vomiting
Your temperature ever exceeds 104°F (40°C)
You develop confusion, delirium, or have a seizure
You experience rapid breathing and a racing pulse well after you’ve ceased the physical activity

Eat fruits and veggies.,
Carry a reusable water bottle.,
Pack a cooler.,
Use a “water bladder.” If you are going hiking, fishing, cycling, or doing any outdoor activity where your hands will be occupied, using a “water bladder” can be an excellent way to stay hydrated.,
Wear lightweight, breathable clothes.",How to Stay Hydrated During the Summer2," Fruits and veggies are filled with water, and eating plenty of them helps you stay effectively hydrated. Prepare for a big day out in the sun by eating plenty of produce beforehand. Eat a nice big salad with strawberries and tomatoes, or snack on watermelon, celery, and grapes., Studies have shown that people who carry around reusable water bottles end up consuming more fluids each day. Make it easy for yourself to stay hydrated by tossing one of these bottles in your bag and taking sips all day long.Look for a stainless-steel water bottle to avoid any plastic contaminants.
A second option is to look for a plastic bottle that is BPA-free.
Avoid reusing disposable water bottles, if possible, as they are difficult to clean properly, which may result in bacteria growth. There is also concern about chemicals from these plastics leeching into your water.

, If you plan to spend a day out in the sun, prepare for hydration by packing a cooler. Bring along healthy hydrating snacks — like cantaloupe or pineapple slices — and cold drinks — like coconut water, fruit juice, and water. If you have the tools to stay hydrated, you’ll be much more like to use them., A water bladder is a device that holds water (usually 70–100 ounces) in a carrying case on your back. A long straw rests on your shoulder, and you can pop it in your mouth and drink water with ease.Water bladders and carrying cases can be purchased at most sporting goods and camping supply stores.
Ensure you read the instructions on the care and cleaning of these supplies as there are special instructions as well.

, Excessive sweating can lead to dehydration, so wearing the right clothes can help you stay healthy, hydrated, and cool. Anytime you’ll be in the heat, opt for lightweight, breathable materials, like cotton or synthetic fibers. Choosing light colors can help you stay comfortable and cool as well."

Set a reminder on your phone to drink water every hour.,
Take a drink after using the restroom.,
Drink water after each alcoholic beverage.,
Monitor your urine.,
Don’t wait until you feel thirsty.",How to Stay Hydrated During the Summer3," With all the fun of summer, it can be easy to forget to drink water. Remind yourself to take a sip by setting a reminder on your phone. An hourly “ping” can remind you to regularly drink a glass of water, and help keep you hydrated throughout your day., Another trick is to think “one out, one in.” Every time you use the restroom (which your body will naturally remind you to do), replenish what you lost with a big glass of water.This method will only work to maintain hydration. If you are already dehydrated, you will not use the restroom often enough for this method to work.
A well-hydrated person should use the restroom every one to one-and-a-half hours.

, Avoiding alcohol altogether is an effective way to maintain your hydration. If you are going to drink, however, it is crucial to compensate with extra water. Aim to go “one for one,” consuming a glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you put down. This will keep you healthy, keep you awake, and best of all, reduce your chances of a hangover.Consuming alcohol in the summer heat can be dangerous or even deadly. Do so only with extreme caution.
Be sure to also eat when drinking alcohol. Eating slows the absorption of alcohol but does not prevent one from becoming drunk. Moderation is the best answer when it comes to alcohol.

, The simplest way to tell if you are hydrated is to take a look at your pee. If it is clear to faintly yellow, then you are on the right track. If your urine is medium to dark yellow, it is evident that you need to increase hydration immediately. You can check your urine throughout the day to tell how you’re doing with hydration. Anytime the color seems dark, grab some water and take a drink., Particularly in the summer, dehydration can happen fast. Don’t wait until you feel physically thirsty — be proactive about your hydration by drinking water, and taking other steps, throughout the day.As we age, our receptors in our brains that tell us we are thirsty decrease in effectiveness, so by the time one feels the thirst urge, it is often after dehydration has set in. Avoid this by being proactive and consuming water throughout the day.

Determine the product’s concentration of hydrogen peroxide.,
Remove any clothing soaked with hydrogen peroxide.,
Flush the area with cool water for at least 15 minutes.,
Wash the area gently and apply an ointment or gel.,
Contact a doctor if you experience unusual symptoms within 24 hours.",How to Treat a Hydrogen Peroxide Burn1," Knowing the strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution will help you decide the best course of treatment, whether the burn affects the skin, eye, or digestive system. The container’s label will note its contents’ concentration.Most household hydrogen peroxide solutions are about 3% hydrogen peroxide and 97% water. These can cause minor irritation to the skin, eyes, or digestive system, stinging, and/or whitening of the skin, but can almost always be treated by simply flushing the area with cool water.
Products that bleach hair can contain between 6 and 10% hydrogen peroxide, and can be more harmful than standard household solutions.
Industrial solutions contain between 35 and 90% hydrogen peroxide. These can cause chemical burns that require immediate emergency care. You may notice blistering on the skin. Call emergency services immediately to treat exposures to industrial hydrogen peroxide.;
, Free the burned or irritated area from contaminated clothing as soon as possible, especially when exposed to higher concentrations. Take off any clothes, jewelry, or other accessories that might have been splashed or soaked. Place the clothing in plastic bags if the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 10% or higher., Hold the affected area under cool running water to rinse away the solution and ease pain. Flushing under a faucet will effectively treat small patches of skin exposed to household concentrations. Take a cool shower to flush larger patches of contaminated skin or areas exposed to a higher concentration., Chemical burns that result from hydrogen peroxide exposure can be treated like thermal burns.Continue to flush with cool water until pain starts to subside, use a mild soap to gently wash the area, and apply an antibacterial ointment.Avoid scrubbing or breaking any small blisters that develop.
Consider applying an aloe vera gel to ease discomfort.

, Within a day of exposure, look for signs including worsening redness, irritation, and pus or discharge from the burn. Seek a follow-up examination if you experience any of these symptoms.Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, contact the medical professional who treated your wound, or visit a local clinic for a follow-up examination.

Call 911 or emergency services.,
Give an accurate location.,
Stay close to the victim when you call.",How to Save the Life of a Person Suffering Heat Stroke1," Time is of the essence if heat stroke is involved. If you're not alone, one person can begin first aid while the other calls. If you are alone, then once you know that help is on its way, you can concentrate on using the various cooling techniques listed to aid the heat stroke victim — but make sure you call for help first.;
, Take care to provide clear and accurate directions to your location (or an accurate address) when you call emergency services. This should be the first piece of information you give. Even though time is crucial, stay calm. Speak slowly. Be sure the operator understand clearly where you are.

, You may be asked to provide additional information about the heat stroke victim's condition. This might require speaking to the victim, or observing symptoms at close range and relating them to the operator.


If the victim's physical condition is deteriorating rapidly, you will need to be in position to recognize this so that you can make the call quick and tend immediately to the victim.
The operator may be able to guide you in how to best help the victim while you await help.

Monitor any exposed skin.,
Be aware that frostbite can easily go unnoticed by a victim.,
Do not ignore a persistent itching or burning sensation.,
Recognize the initial signs of frostbite.,
Take note of “frostnip.” Frostnip, which refers to a whitening and initial numbing of the skin, is visually identifiable and precedes dangerous levels of frostbite.Frostnip usually occurs on the ears, nose, cheeks, fingers, and toes.",How to Recognize Frostbite1," The first signs of frostbite will be evident on your skin, likely in the form of an uncomfortable or painful redness.Watch out for signs of whitening or grayish-yellow skin, areas of skin that do not register your touch, or feel unusually firm or waxy.
In more severe cases, skin may become blue, mottled, or splotchy.;
, Accordingly, keep an eye on any of your own or others’ exposed skin when outdoors in cold weather.Many people will try to ""tough out"" frostbite symptoms as they initially do not seem serious.
Periodically check in with any companions every 10 to 20 minutes both visually and verbally.

, While these sensations may seem innocuous, they are actually a sign of oncoming frostbite.Be aware of any physical sensation out of the ordinary.


In particular, watch out for a gentle prickling that progresses into numbness as well. Again, this likely indicates oncoming frostbite.
A ‘flushing’ feeling and the rushing of blood into an extremity indicates that your body is trying to fight the cold, but is starting to fail to keep your extremities sufficiently warm.

, There are several signs that warn you of an oncoming case of frostbite before any serious repercussion has occurred. Superficial frostbite may lead to skin damage while severe frostbite can potentially permanently damage nerves and tissues beneath the skin.Recognizing frostbite as early as possible will help you prevent frostbite from reaching the point where it leaves a victim permanently injured.
In particular, watch for the development of redness on the skin, and skin that feels cold to the touch or is irritated.

,
Though not dangerous, frostnip does indicate that a person’s skin and tissues are starting to be affected by the weather, and that the person should return to a warmer environment soon.

Remove your contact lenses.,
Flush your eyes with cool water for at least 15 minutes.,
Test your vision and look for corneal damage.,
Consult a doctor immediately.",How to Treat a Hydrogen Peroxide Burn2," If you wear contact lenses and can easily remove them, do so immediately. Once they’re out, begin flushing your eyes. If you have trouble taking your lenses out, get help from someone you trust nearby or a responding medical professional., Rinse your hands well to ensure they’re free of hydrogen peroxide solution. Cup them under running cool water and continuously flush your eyes for 15 to 20 minutes. Try taking a cool shower to flush your eyes if you have difficulty doing so with a faucet and sink.You can also try flushing your eyes with a .9 % saline solution. If you have a bottle of saline solution on hand, check its label to find out its concentration., Once your eyes have recovered from the water or saline flush your eyes, make sure your vision isn’t impaired in any way. Seek medical attention if you experience any unusual blurriness or obstructions in your visual field. Have someone check your eyes for surface abrasions or deformities, and seek emergency care if you show these or any other signs of damage., If your eyes were exposed to hydrogen peroxide at any concentration, you should see a doctor as soon as possible.If you were exposed to a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide, you should contact emergency services immediately as it can rapidly cause cornea burns. If you experience changes in your vision or have signs of abrasion or damage, have someone take you to an emergency room. Follow up with an appointment with your ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, if you have one."

Ensure the victim is breathing and has a pulse.,
Call emergency services.,
Drink a glass of water or milk.,
Avoid inducing vomiting or using activated charcoal.",How to Treat a Hydrogen Peroxide Burn3," Ingesting a large amount or high concentration of hydrogen peroxide can cause difficulty breathing. If a victim loses consciousness and exhibits shallow breathing, a weak pulse, or no breathing or pulse, you (or someone CPR certified) should administer CPR and call emergency services immediately.Even if the victim can breathe and CPR isn’t required, emergency personnel may still offer a respiratory mask to someone who’s ingested hydrogen peroxide, especially at higher concentrations.

, You’ll require emergency assistance if the victim has ingested large amounts of household hydrogen peroxide or a high concentration solution. You can call emergency services or your local poison control center. If you live in the United States, call poison control at 1-800-222-1222.Be prepared to describe the victim’s age, weight, and condition. Tell the emergency operator the name of the product ingested and solution strength. Let them know the time and amount that they swallowed.

, Drinking 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of water or milk may effectively treat ingestion of a small amount of household hydrogen peroxide. For cases involving larger amounts or higher concentrations, you should still drink water or milk, but be sure to contact emergency services as soon as possible.Try gargling repeatedly with cool water if your mouth is the only affected area.

, While hydrogen peroxide can cause vomiting, you should not induce it if the victim is not vomiting already. You should also avoid using activated charcoal, as it will have no effect on ingested hydrogen peroxide.If your case is severe enough for hospitalization, medical professionals will administer an endoscopy to examine your digestive tract. Activated charcoal will interfere with this examination.

Watch for physical signs of heat stroke.,
Ask the victim questions if she can speak.,
Look for symptoms of confusion, disorientation and agitation.,
Place your hand on the victim’s skin to see if the skin is dry and hot.,
Take the victim’s pulse and check for a rapid rate.",How to Save the Life of a Person Suffering Heat Stroke2," You may be able to diagnose heat stroke by watching someone's behavior and body closely. Signs of heat stroke may include:


A red face
Stumbling or falling
Rapid breathing or panting

, You should ask the victim questions to determine whether she is exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke. Questions to ask include:


Do you feel dizzy?
Do you have a headache?
Are you experiencing nausea?

, When the body's core temperature rises, the body shows it. And when the body overheats, the brain, which operates in a narrow temperature range, begins to fail.Heat stroke can affect the behavior of its victim. Some of its symptoms are subtle.

, Body temperature can rise to 106°F (41.1°C) or higher in a heat stroke victim and it can happen fast — within ten to fifteen minutes. The skin of a heat stroke victim might appear to be flushed or red. It might also be dry because the victim has stopped sweating. Orally, temperature can be above 103°F (39.4°C)., This can be done by placing your index finger above the radial artery, located on the palm side of the wrist and just under the thumb.As body heat rises, surface blood vessels enlarge and the pulse rate rises, which puts a strain on the heart and circulatory system.Heart rates can rise to up to 180 beats per minute."
"
Move the person to a cool place.,
Place ice bags over as much of the body as possible.,
Use water.,
Look for any method to cool the person down.",How to Save the Life of a Person Suffering Heat Stroke3," If possible, a cool house and an air-conditioned room would be ideal. A house would also include the materials, such as a tub, shower and/or ice, necessary for other methods of treatment.


Move the person into the shade if an indoor facility is not available. The main objective is to cool the person down as effectively and quickly as possible.The less time a person is undergoing heat stroke, the better the chances of diminishing damage., Places on the body where large blood vessels are close to the skin surface should be targeted. This includes the neck, armpits and groin area.Again, the faster the body temperature is reduced the better.

, Immerse the victim in a tub of cold water if you have access to one. Cold water dissipates heat from the body 20 to 30 times faster than air at the same temperature.Place the victim in a cool shower if the victim is able to stand safely.
Use a spray bottle to mist the heat stroke victim's skin. As the water evaporates it will cool the skin.Soak a sheet or two in cold water. Cover the victim with the cold-water soaked sheets.Wetting clothing with tepid water may also be helpful.

, Rely on common sense. Try loosening or removing clothing, fanning the victim or even cooling the victim with a garden hose. Remember, you're working with the body's cooling system. The system has failed and you're giving it a boost any way that you can, with the goal of lowering the core temperature of the heat stroke victim.

Watch carefully for signs of worsening frostbite.,
Treat frostbite as quickly as you can.,
Rewarm the area carefully.,
Rewarm a frostbitten area via immersion in warm water.Use water that is warm to the touch, as close as possible to 40.5°C (104.9°F).,
Know what not to do when you recognize a case of frostbite.,
Monitor frostbite victims for hypothermia.,
Know that a burning sensation, as well as swelling may continue.",How to Recognize Frostbite2," Superficial frostbite can be indicated by the transition of reddened skin to white, pale skin. Though the skin may still feel soft, ice crystals are starting to form within the skin itself.You may notice blisters forming on the skin as the frostbite worsens.


Counterintuitively, skin may begin to feel warm. This is actually a very serious sign that the victim is beginning to suffer from a dangerous case of frostbite.
Be extremely wary of any progression beyond superficial frostbite, as these may indicate that permanent damage has begun.
Loss of the sensation of pain or discomfort is an extremely serious development.
Blackened skin and hardened tissue indicate permanent damage of the affected skin and likely some of the tissue beneath it.

, The wikiHow article on How to Treat Frostbite provides similar details on determining the severity of a case of frostbite, including more specific steps on how to safely rewarm a frostbitten area and how to go about seeking professional treatment.


Get the frostbite victim out of the cold.
Ideally, get to a hospital where professional medical care can be given to a frostbite victim.

, Do not allow a potentially frostbitten area to be warmed, only to be exposed to cold weather again.Cycling between temperatures can greatly damage your skin, nerves, and tissues.


The safest way to reheat frostbitten fingers, if still outside, is with body heat. For instance, place frostbitten fingers in your armpits, if doing so does not expose more of your skin to the cold.
If it is possible to rewarm a frostbitten area without risking that the area is again exposed to cold, do so with warm water.
When possible, unfreeze a frostbitten area as quickly as possible, as the longer an area suffers from frostbite, the more permanent damage will occur.,


Provide analgesics to a frostbite victim. These include ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin.
If you are forced to delay thawing or rewarming of a frostbitten area, clean, dry, and protect the area, ideally in a sterile compress., As you determine whether or not a case of frostbite is present, there are certain precautions you can take to reduce potential damage to any frostbitten areas.,Do not use any artificial source of heat (such as a heating pad or lamp, a stove or fireplace, or radiator) to warm an area of the body that may be affected by frostbite. Numb, frostbitten areas can easily be burned.
Do not walk on frostbitten toes or feet. Unless absolutely necessary to get out of the cold, do not risk further damage to frostbitten tissue in your feet by moving around.Do not touch the frostbitten area. Massaging an area affected by frostbite may cause more damage.
Do not rub snow on the area. While someone suffering from frostbite might be inclined to diminish discomfort by rubbing snow on the area, do not allow it, as further exposure to frozen temperature will cause further damage.
Do not pop any blisters that appear on a frostbitten area, as this will expose the injury to infection.

, Since hypothermia is another medically dangerous condition that can result from exposure, look for signs of hypothermia in anyone who is experiencing frostbite.Quickly seek emergency medical assistance if you feel someone may be suffering from hypothermia.
Signs and symptoms of hypothermia include intense shivering, slurred speech, and drowsiness or loss of coordination., Even weeks after exposure, a victim may still exhibit signs of frostbite. Black, scabby crust may develop following exposure.
Blistering, even after re-warming of the affected area may also appear after it seems you may have recovered.
If these symptoms develop, do not assume they will go away. Seek professional medical attention.

Prepare yourself for cold weather.,
Act right and stay aware.,
Dress appropriately in cold weather.,
Be aware of risk factors that may increase the likelihood of frostbite.",How to Recognize Frostbite3," Preventative action is by far the most effective way to avoid injuries from frostbite. Educate yourself about unfamiliar environments before you spend time in them, and ensure that you are properly supplied when spending time outdoors. Frostbite can occur within minutes of exposure to temperatures below freezing, and can even occur in temperatures above freezing in strong winds, wet conditions, or at high altitudes.
Prep your home and car with cold-weather survival gear, including warm clothing.

, Your own behavior and attention to your surroundings will greatly help you avoid frostbite.Do not smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine in extremely cold weather, as these increase the likelihood of exposure-related injuries.
Do not hold body parts in one position for an extended period of time.
Recognize that hands and feet account for 90% of frostbite injuries. Dress and monitor accordingly, making sure skin is covered and your boots and gloves/mittens are sufficient.
Keep your head covered, as well as your ears, at all times during cold weather. 30% of your body heat is lost through your head!
Stay dry. Wet clothes will greatly increase the speed of heat loss.
Do not go outside in cold weather immediately after a bath or shower. Be sure that skin and hair are fully dry before going out.

, Aside from the cold itself, be sure to protect yourself from both wind and moisture. Wear warm clothing, particularly fleece, polypropylene, and wool, and be sure to wear multiple layers when exposed to cold temperatures, especially for extended periods of time., For your first layer, wear clothing that will pull moisture away from the skin. Thermal underwear and base layers, cotton socks, and glove liners are all smart options.
Avoid restrictive clothing that may cut off or slow blood circulation.
In especially cold weather, wear two pairs of socks.
For a second layer, wear loose clothing to help maintain body temperature. The looseness of this layer helps trap pockets of air that can provide insulation to your body. Choose clothing that resists retaining moisture. Heavy pants and sweatshirts are the ideal options.
The third, exterior layer should be tightly woven and moisture-resistance to repel the elements. Jackets, hats, scarves, mittens, and boots should all be worn in cold weather.
Mittens are a better option than gloves, as they decrease the surface area of your covering that is exposed to the cold. If you will need to remove your mittens for dexterity, wear gloves underneath.
Bring extra clothing with you when you know you’ll be outdoors for a good amount of time, especially on hikes or in other environments away from heated shelters. If your clothing gets wet, make sure you change into something dry.

, Knowing who is at greater risk will help you recognize frostbite before it leads to a serious injury. Factors that increase the risk of exposure-related injuries such as frostbite include:Youth and old age. Monitor the young and old with particular attention.
Intoxication. Drunkenness and cold weather should not be mixed.
Exhaustion, hunger, malnutrition, and dehydration.
Homelessness, or any lack of consistent access to safe shelter.
Other severe injuries, including damaged skin.
A previous experience with frostbite.
Depression. Some mental health issues can contribute to increased risk, as those who are despondent or less in tune with their bodies may be less likely to self-monitor their temperature and comfort.
Cardiovascular or peripheral vascular disease or poor circulation. Anyone with medical conditions that affect the regular operation of blood vessels and the vascular system, in general, may be at greater risk.
Similarly, those with diabetes or hypothyroidism, and those taking beta-blockers should also take particular care in cold weather.

Recognize heat stroke signs.,
Drink a minimum of 60-80 oz or 2 liters of fluids daily.,
Stay out of the hottest parts of the day.,
Become acclimated to the hot weather.,
Discourage exercising in heavy clothing.,
Talk to the coach or athletic director.,
Get a physical.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke in Teen Athletes1," One of the best things you can do is help educate your teen about heat stroke signs and symptoms. That way, if they're away from you or other adults, they can identify the symptoms of heat stroke.Tell them about these signs:


Headache
Racing heart rate
Rapid breathing
Nausea and vomiting
Flushed or red skin
Mental confusion or altered state of mind
Body temperature above 104 F or 40 C
Impaired judgement or inappropriate behavior
Seizures
Delirium
Hallucinations
Ataxia (trouble balancing while walking)
Dysarthria (trouble speaking appropriately)
A doctor will diagnose heat stroke if your body is over 104 degrees Fahrenheit and if you have central nervous system abnormalities following environmental heat exposure.;
, To prevent heatstroke in teen athletes, encourage them to stay hydrated throughout the day, as well as in the days before athletic activity. This is one of the best prevention methods.


Adequate hydration is essential. If your body has enough fluids, it's able to sweat enough to help keep your body cool.Tell your teen to not only drink during their sports practice or event, but before and after as well. If they go into an activity already dehydrated from not drinking, they're at higher risk of heatstroke.
In general, they should be aiming for about 64 oz (about 2 liters) or about 8 glasses of hydrating fluids during the day. However, during the hot summer months when they're active, they may need 80 oz (2 1/2 liters) or more.
Also, remind them that only clear, hydrating fluids count towards this goal. Beverages like water, sparkling water, and flavored water are OK. Coffee and tea, which are diuretics, do not count towards fluid count.

, It's important to remind teens that there are better times during the day to exercise or practice. Although you may not have full control of when their practices or events are, you can advise them to stay out of the sun during mid day.There are certain times during the day when the sun and temperature is the highest and hottest. It's during this time that you have the highest risk for getting heat stroke.
It's typically recommended to stay indoors or stay in the shade between 11 am - 3 pm. This is when the sun is the strongest.
Remind your teen that if they need to be active, to aim for an early morning practice session or something later in the evening. This is when it's the coolest and safest time to be active.

, If you and your teen know that they will have practices or events coming up in the hot weather, plan to help your teen become acclimated before jumping straight into activities.If your teen hasn't been overly active or hasn't been active outdoors in warmer weather, they could be at risk for heatstroke. A sudden change to hot weather is difficult for your teen's body to adjust to.
Take note of your teen's activity calendar and plan to get them outdoors and active before the start of their sporting season.
It can take several weeks for your teen's body to get acclimated to the warmer weather. This is why it's important to plan in advance.

, Some teen sports encourage the practice of wearing heavier clothing during exercise and practice. Although this may be appropriate for inside athletics, this should be discouraged for hot weather activities.Some teen sports, like wrestling, encourage teens to wear heavier clothes like sweatpants, sweatshirts and even body suits to help them lose water weight and get in shape.
This should always be strongly discouraged in teens that are practicing outdoors in the summer heat. This is an extremely dangerous practice.
Tell your teen that they should be wearing light, loose fitting clothing, such as cotton, instead. This is safer for them.

, To help hit the point home, talk to your teen's athletic director or coach. They can help provide guidance to your teen, but also give you information about when practice is.


When your teen signs up for a sport, make sure to get to know the coach. Ask when practices are, what time the events or games are and where they're held.
Also ask the coach about emergency plans or medical treatments that are available to the teens.
If the practices and games are held outside during the hot points during the day, ask the coach what they do to help keep the teen's hydrated and safe.
Also ask the coach what type of advice is taught to the teens about staying safe and healthy during practice. You can piggy back off of some of this advice as well.

, If this is not already required of your teen, take them to their primary care or pediatrician before the start of their sports season. Make sure they get a clearance to participate in the sport during hot weather.


Many sports teams and extracurricular sports require that teens get a physical clearance from their doctor.
When you go, bring up the fact that many practices and events are held outdoors in the heat. Ask the doctor whether they have any concerns regarding your teen exercising outdoors.
In addition, review the signs of heat stroke or heat exhaustion so your teen can get some education by the doctor.

Take the individual's pulse and determine if it's rapid or slower.,
Take the body's core temperature with a rectal thermometer.",How to Recognize and Assess Hypothermia," Oftentimes this is one of the first signs of hypothermia, and it will progressively get worse to the point of convulsions. Shivering subsides once severe hypothermia sets in.;
,, Those with mild hypothermia may not be able to tie a shoe or zip up a coat. However, the lack of coordination can progress until the victim is unable to move without falling down.


Joints and muscles may also stiffen as hypothermia sets in, making any movement difficult and sometimes painful.

, If a person removes clothing in frigid temperatures, it is a clear sign of hypothermia.

, In severe cases of hypothermia, an individual will often lose consciousness.

,, Frost nip will set in first, giving the skin a red hue. The skin will turn more blue and purple as frost nip turns into frostbite.

,, As hypothermia first takes a hold, a person's pulse will be faster. More severe cases can decrease respiration, making the pulse slower. Breathing will also be shallow.

,

A core temperature of 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit to 93.2 (36 to 34 degrees Celsius) indicates mild hypothermia; 93.2 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (or 34 to 30 degrees Celsius) indicates moderate hypothermia; and a core temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit or below (or less than 30 degrees Celsius) is considered severe.

Wear full-length layers.,
Protect your face.,
Wear eye protection.",How to Prevent Wind Burn1," Even if you are dressing for an indoor occasion that might not require a full-length ensemble, make sure you have full-length layers for those times you will be outdoors. Wear a jacket that comes down to the wrists at the sleeves and up to the base of the neck, and make sure pants come down to the ankles.Help fill in gaps in coverage by wearing long wool socks at the feet, gloves on your hands, and a scarf around your neck. Expose as little of your skin as possible to the cold.
If you are wearing a dress and worry about windburn while in transit, consider wearing fleece-lined or wool tights, which can be integrated into your outfit or removed easily at your venue.
If you have an occasion where you need or wish to wear shorts indoors, bring a separate pair of pants to change into for those times when you will have to be outside.;
, Ears are especially susceptible to windburn, so it is important to keep them covered. Use earmuffs or a hat with a brim or flaps long enough to cover your ears. You may also consider a warm headband, such as a fleece-lined headband, as an alternative to keep your ears and your forehead warm.If you are going to be out in the cold for long periods of time, it may be worth investing in a full-face cover such as a ski hood or balaclava, that covers everything except the eyes.
Full face covers can be purchased easily online or through most sporting goods stores.

, The skin around the eyes is especially thin and sensitive, so it is important to offer them a shield from the elements. Wear sunglasses when you are out during the day, and consider non-prescription lenses or goggles when you are at night.Sport style sunglasses are particularly useful as they have wide lenses that curve slightly around the side of the face, offering extra protection. These can be found at most sporting goods stores.

Provide immediate care.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke," If you notice that temperatures have been reaching 90°Fahrenheit (32.2°Celsius), check weather reports on the local news, cable weather channels, or internet weather sites. Look for alerts about heat advisories and excessive heat warnings. A heat advisory will be issued if forecasts predict that a temperature of at least 100°F (37.8°C) will last for more than 2 hours, and an excessive heat warning is issued if temperatures exceeding 105°F (40.6°C) are forecast to last for at least 2 hours.Australian residents can look out for a Heat Watch (temperatures forecast to be above 36°C for more than 3 days) and a Heat Warning (40° or higher forecast for at least 3 days).;
, In the case of any kind of national heat alert, make every effort to stay indoors if you have air conditioning.Draw all blinds and curtains to keep out the heat of the sun.Turn on ceiling fans to redistribute the cool air from the air conditioner more efficiently., If you don’t have air conditioning, try to spend the late morning and afternoon hours in public buildings that do, such as libraries, malls, community centers, and grocery stores.If these places are far from your residence, and you don’t drive, ask a friend, neighbor, or relative to drive you.


If you don’t have air conditioning, and can’t get to an air conditioned public building, stay on the lowest floor in your residence, out of the sun. If you begin to feel overheated, take a cold bath or shower., Whether you’re at home or in a public building, be sure to drink more water than you normally do, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Room temperature water is fine, since ice-cold water can bring on stomach cramps.And be sure to avoid alcoholic beverages as well during a heat wave, since these can reduce the body’s ability to cool itself.Seniors should make sure they're getting at least eight 8-ounce (0.24 liters) glasses of water throughout the day.Adult women need at least nine 8-ounce glasses (2.13 liters) per day, and adult men should drink a little more than twelve-and-a-half 8-ounce glasses (3 liters) daily. , If you know of any relatives, friends, or neighbors who do not have air conditioning, give them a call or go to see them during a national heat alert. Make sure that their air conditioning system is working properly. If you are seeing about an elderly person, make sure they can access transportation to a public building or shelter, or offer to give them a ride to these places or to your home., If you must leave your residence on a day when there is a national heat alert, try to avoid going out between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., which are generally the hottest hours of the day.Do all you can to postpone any errands or meetings that can wait for a few days until the heat alert is no longer in effect.

, If you will be driving, open all the car doors for five minutes before starting the car, to allow for ventilation. Then turn on the air conditioning for a few minutes before getting in the vehicle and driving.


Do not drive without air conditioning during a national heat alert.
Try to park in a shaded area at your destination and when you return home.

, To shield yourself from the sun, wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing made of cotton or linen. Cover as much exposed skin as possible with pants and long sleeves.Apply high-spf (30-60) sunblock to any exposed skin areas, including the face and neck, and wear a wide-brimmed hat., Drink two to four glasses, or 2 cups (0.5 L) to 4 cups (0.9 L)) of cool fluids each hour if you’re exercising outdoors or working indoors when outdoor temperatures are higher than 90°C (32.2°C).This will prevent dehydration and allow your body to cool itself naturally by sweating.


Be careful to avoid exercising outdoors in the event of a national heat alert, or generally if outdoor temperatures are higher than 98°F (36.67°C).

, In no case is it safe to leave a child in the car, especially during warmer weather. The inside of a vehicle can overheat to deadly temperatures (110°F / 43.3°C), even when outside temperatures are mildly warm (60°F / 15.6°C).And opening windows slightly doesn’t help, since the vehicle still overheats quickly with a little ventilation.


To help you remember to take your child with you when leaving the vehicle, leave something next the the child that you will need to have with you, such as a cell phone, purse, shopping bag, or hat., Heat exhaustion is a type of heat stress that can lead to heat stroke. Once you notice signs of heat exhaustion, stop any activity and get yourself or the ailing person to an air conditioned building immediately. This precaution can prevent the life-threatening condition of heat stroke from coming on.


Symptoms of heat exhaustion include vomiting and nausea, excessive sweating, low blood pressure, moist and cool skin, a weak pulse, fatigue and weakness, blurred vision, strong thirst, and rapid breathing.

, Once you notice the signs of heat exhaustion, and after finding a cool indoor area, you should give yourself or the ailing person cool water to drink, take off or loosen any excess clothing, fan yourself or the ailing person, and spray the skin with cool water.If these symptoms continue, go to an emergency medical center or call local emergency services., In some cases, heat stroke can come on quickly without giving any indication of heat exhaustion.This is a life-threatening condition, so if you detect the signs of heat stroke in yourself or another, call or ask someone else to call an ambulance immediately.


Symptoms of heat stroke include dry, hot, red skin (because the body has stopped sweating); a temperature above 104°F (40°C); weakness, confusion, irritability, or strange behavior; a rapid pulse; dizziness or headache; convulsions; and loss of consciousness., If signs of heat stroke are present, and you are alone, call for an ambulance immediately, and then do your best to get to a cool and shaded area—preferably to an air conditioned building— while waiting for the emergency services. If you are in a wilderness area, away from facilities, sit in the shade of a tree or underneath a rock outcropping. If you are with an ailing person, do the same for them.


Ask someone for (or give yourself or the ailing person) sips of cool water as long as you or they are conscious.Remove/loosen all outer layers of clothing and shoes and socks.
Cool off yourself, have someone else cool you off, or cool down the other person by sponging or spraying the skin with cool water.Place ice packs underneath the armpits and on the back of the neck."

Purchase the right type of athletic clothing.,
Purchase a reusable water bottle.,
Use sunscreen.,
Keep a stock of electrolyte beverages.,
Provide shade.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke in Teen Athletes2," When your teen starts their warm-weather sport, make sure that they have enough athletic clothing. In addition, make sure this clothing is conducive to staying safe in the heat.


Since heavy weight clothing could increase their risk of heat stroke, you need to make sure you purchase them more light weight and light colored clothing.
Light colored clothing helps reflect sunlight and keep your body cooler compared to darker colors.Also choose fabrics that are light weight and are designed to wick sweat away from their body. There are many specialty fabrics that are designed specifically for high intensity sports in warm weather.
Take your teen to a fitness equipment store or specialty clothing store and stock up on the appropriate types of clothing for them.

, Although many sports teams do provide the teen athletes with water and other beverages, make sure your teen is prepared with their own resources.


Go with your teen to purchase a reusable water bottle for them. They can choose a water bottle that they like and won't mind carrying along with them.
You might want to get one for them to carry to class so they can get hydrated during the day. In addition, consider getting a second one that they can toss in their gym bag and have with them during practice or events.
Remind your teen to fill up their water bottle on a regular basis during the day and before practice.

, If your teen athlete has a lot of practices and sporting events outside, also give them sunscreen. You may be surprised, but sunscreen is part of a great defense to heat stroke.If your teen were to get sunburned while practicing outdoors, this sunburn affects their body's ability to cool itself. Your teen's skin is not able to remove heat through sweat as effectively when it's damaged, so it's not as good at cooling off.
Make sure you purchase a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15.
In addition, remind your teen to apply their sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out side. They'll need to reapply every two hours or sooner (if they're sweating continuously).

, When your teen is sweating outdoors, it's not only fluids that they're losing. Sweat also consists of electrolytes which need to be replaced in order to hydrate effectively.Sports drinks are common ""go-to"" beverages for many teen athletes. Some, not all, are a great idea so your teen can replace all the electrolytes that they've lost through sweating during their practice.
Look for sports drinks that have added electrolytes. Sodium, magnesium, potassium and some carbohydrates should be listed in the ingredient label. However, beverages that have overly high levels of added sugar or caffeine are not acceptable.
It's a good idea to dilute a sports drink by half with water; your teen will still replace necessary electrolytes, but the sugar content of the drink itself will also be closer to your teen's blood's natural sugar content.
Stock up on these beverages at home so your teen can grab one on their way out to school or practice.

, Another way to help your teen stay cool is by providing some shade. Help them take a break and get out of the sun's hot rays during their practice or events.


If you can, go with your teen to practice. Or, let them bring some of these items with them.
You can try bringing a tent or a large beach umbrella to set up. They can take a water break or rest in the shade.
In addition, you can give them a wide brimmed hat or umbrella for a convenient way to get their head and face in the shade.

Go to the ER or urgent care immediately.,
Get inside and use a fan.,
Remove as much clothing as possible.,
Rehydrate.",How to Prevent Heat Stroke in Teen Athletes3," If your teen is experiencing any of the symptoms of heat stroke after being out in the sun, you need to get them help as soon as possible.


If your teen is experiencing any of the following symptoms, bring them to the ER: headache, racing heart rate, rapid breathing, nausea and vomiting, flushed or red skin, mental confusion or altered state of mind, or has a body temperature above 104 F or 40 C.
The quicker that you treat someone with heatstroke, the better their prognosis is. Even if your child has one symptom of heatstroke, you need to act immediately.
If you are with your teen, get them inside to a cool place and then to the ER or an urgent care center.
If your teen isn't with you, you need to tell them to ask for help or to call 911 if they cannot get themselves help.

, While you or your teen is waiting for help to arrive, you need to get your teen cooled down as best as possible. The first step is bringing your teen inside.Find an inside area where there is air conditioning. This could be inside of a building or inside of a car that has been idling with the AC on already.
In addition, see if you can find a fan. Fanning your teen helps keep their body temperature cool.
Apply ice packs to the teen's neck, underarms, and groin.

, In addition to getting your teen indoors, it's also a good idea to remove their clothing. This is another way to get their body temperature lower.If your teen is showing signs of heatstroke, don't worry about embarrassing them by removing their clothes. This will get their body temperature lower and allow them to cool quicker inside in front of the fan.
Remove as many of their clothes as possible. However, keep their undergarments on.
Once clothes are removed, you can spray them down with cool, but not freezing cold, water. You can get them in the tub, use a hose or pour water on them.

, If your teen is just beginning to experience signs of heatstroke, it's important to encourage them to drink hydrating fluids. Stop whatever your teen is doing immediately, and go to a cool place. Next, encourage a lot of hydration. This can help their body function enough to cool itself down.Go for hydrating beverages like cold water, sparkling water or an electrolyte drink.
Do not give them sugary drinks like juice or soda and definitely do not allow them to have alcohol.
Only encourage your teen to drink if they're conscious and able to drink by themselves.

Visit your doctor.",How to Prevent Heat Rash1," Tight-fitting clothing can irritate your skin. Wear loose, smooth, and light clothing to help prevent skin irritation and heat rash.Smooth textured clothing such as cotton or merino wool can keep your skin from getting irritated and can prevent excess sweating that may cause heat rash.;
, No matter what time of year, try and not wear too much clothing. Wearing clothing appropriate to the weather can keep you from sweating and developing heat rash.In the summer, wear soft and lightweight clothing. Cotton is a good option that will allow your skin to breathe.Layer your clothing in winter. If you get too hot or start to sweat, this can make it easier to remove items of clothing without getting too cold. Merino wool is a good option for winter that can keep you warm and dry., Heat and moisture can irritate skin and promote condition that lead to heat rash. Dry your skin thoroughly with a towel or air-dry after bathing, showering, or swimming to help prevent heat rash.Consider allowing your skin to air dry after bathing, which is less irritating than toweling off.Make sure to avoid using hot water and use a non-drying soap to help prevent heat rash and irritation.The water can still be warm — it just shouldn't be piping hot.

, Maintaining your skin’s natural hydration can help prevent dryness and heat rash. You can help keep skin hydrated by different means including moisturizing, avoiding temperature extremes, and using a humidifier.Apply moisturizer to your skin once a day. The best time to apply is after a shower or bath while your skin is barely damp.Use unscented and uncolored moisturizers that do not contain petroleum mineral oil, which can block pores., Hot weather and sun exposure can cause heat rash. Seeking out shade, staying inside in air-conditioning, or avoiding the sun may help prevent miliaria.If you notice that you’re sweating profusely in the heat, make sure to get to a cooler location to minimize your risk of getting heat rash., Increased air circulation can help to keep skin cool and dry and keep your general environment from getting too hot. Use a fan or even an air conditioner to keep air cool and circulating consistently., Sleep in a bedroom that is comfortable, cool, and well ventilated. By controlling factors such as the temperature and darkness, having comfortable bedding, and keeping air circulating, you may help prevent heat rash.Set temperature in bedroom to between 60-75 degrees for optimal sleeping conditions.Use a fan to keep air circulating or open a window., See your doctor if you're so uncomfortable that heat rash disrupts your sleep or ability to function daily, your skin is painful, self-care and home remedies haven’t worked, or you suspect your skin is infected. This can help prevent further issues and may alleviate your pain.If you have any pus draining from your heat rash, see your doctor.If you have a fever or chills, see your doctor."

Use occlusive moisturizers before going out.,
Use hydrating moisturizers when coming back.,
Avoid stripping natural moisture.",How to Prevent Wind Burn2," Occlusive products work to block the cold, dry air from taking the moisture out of your skin. Look for body lotions, facial creams, and lip balms that contain a combination of nourishing ingredients, such as aloe or cocoa butter, and occlusive ingredients, such as jojoba oil, shea butter, or beeswax.Petroleum jelly also provides a durable barrier against the wind and the cold, and can be used in thin layers to protect areas such as the lips, the skin under the eyes, or fingertips during cold-weather runs, skiing, or other outdoor activities.
If you are looking to undertake an intense or extended activity outdoors in cold weather such as cross-country skiing or running a marathon, consider purchasing a specialty anti-frostbite product, which may be available from sporting goods stores or a dermatologist.

, Once you are done in the cold, look for a hydrating and nourishing product to help your skin recover some of its lost moisture. Body oils and specially-formulated facial oils often work well for this purpose, as well as water-based lotions and moisturizers.Those with sensitive skin or who are prone to acne may want to avoid oil-based products and instead opt for rich water-based creams.
Consult with a dermatologist before introducing an oil to sensitive skin.
Be sure to care for your lips, as well. The skin in this area is extra thin and sensitive, so be sure to use a hydrating lip balm each time you come in from a cold, dry environment.

, Windburn attacks the skin’s natural moisture, so it is important to not do anything that may further strip this moisture away. Opt for taking warm showers instead of steaming hot ones, as this can help prevent dehydration of the skin, and avoid products with drying agents such as retinal and salicylic acid.If you must do something that will lessen the nature moisture of the skin, make sure to replace lost hydration by drinking water regularly and using a lotion or body butter to protect the skin.
It is also advisable to avoid having stripping treatments such as facial peels or microdermabrasion done a week or less before you will be spending extended periods of time outside in the cold.

"
"
Use a humidifier.,
Drink water.,
Minimize exposure.",How to Prevent Wind Burn3," A humidifier works on both the inside and the outside, allowing your skin to stay hydrated by introducing atmospheric moisture to dry air. Humidifiers help not only with preventing windburn, but also with treating winter conditions such as sore throats and coughs.Humidifiers are generally either warm or cool mist. Choosing between the two is a matter of personal preference, and you may find that different humidifiers better suit different needs.A warm mist humidifier, for example, may be useful while sleeping, while a cold mist humidifier might make more sense at a desk or an office where temperature is controlled but atmospheric moisture is not.
Humidifiers can easily be purchased at home goods stores, departments stores, or online.

, Carry a water bottle around and set reminders for yourself to help you remember to get two to three liters of water per day. Water helps to replenish your body’s moisture, and is fundamental in both the prevention of and recovery from windburn.It is recommended that the average adult man get three liters of water a day, and that the average adult woman get 2.2 liters a day.

, Take a look at weather forecasts before you go out. If the weather is expected to have significant wind gusts or temperatures below freezing, plan to minimize your time outside.If temperatures are projected to get below zero Fahrenheit (-17.7 Celsius), try to avoid going out at all when possible.

Take fever-reducing medications.",How to Drop Your Core Temperature1," Drinking plenty of cool fluids, up to 2 to 3 liters (0.5 to 0.8 US gal) at a time, is a good way to lower your core temperature quickly and safely.Drinking adequate amounts of water can prevent dehydration, which is important in hot environments and during physically-demanding activities.Sugary drinks and popsicles are not as good as pure water, because sugary drinks are not adequately absorbed by the body and can lead to further dehydration.;
, Studies suggest that ingesting crushed ice can be an effective way to quickly and easily cool the body. Crushed ice will also help keep the body hydrated., Doctors generally agree that cooling the skin is the most effective method of lowering the body's temperature, especially when the person is at risk of heat stroke. Taking a cold shower or soaking in an ice bath can be particularly effective at cooling the skin quickly, particularly in high-humidity environments in which the body is no longer able to adequately sweat.Allow cold water to run over the scalp, as this is the site of a confluence of blood vessels. Cooling the scalp can quickly cool the rest of the body., Certain areas of the body emit more sweat to aid in cooling down your core temperature. These areas, called hot spots, include the neck, armpits, back, and groin. Positioning ice packs on these crucial areas can help cool you down and lower your core temperature., Experts suggest that air conditioning is one of the biggest factors in preventing heat stroke and heat-related deaths.If you do not have an air conditioner in your home, try staying with a friend or relative during hot or humid spells, or contact your local health department to find an air-conditioned shelter near you., Whenever a liquid, in this case sweat, evaporates off the body, the hottest molecules of liquid evaporate the quickest. Since the air temperature is generally cooler than your skin's temperature, sitting in the direct path of a fan’s air while sweating can help drop your body's temperature.If you are not sweating enough to cool your body down due to age or health problems, you can try misting your body with cool water while sitting in front of a fan. Just fill up a spray bottle from the faucet and mist your body as needed while the fan blows in front of you., Antipyretic (temperature reducing) medications are a safe and easy way to lower your body temperature in case of a fever. These medications work by inhibiting your body's production of cyclooxygenase and lowering your body's levels of prostaglandin E2. Without the help of an antipyretic, these substances cause the cells in the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates temperature) to fire at a rapid rate, increasing the body’s temperature.Examples of these medications include acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen.Aspirin is not recommended for children and teenagers suffering from viral illnesses (including the flu or chickenpox), as it can lead to the development of Reye's Syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease that damages the brain and liver.The dosage of these medications varies depending on your age. Check the recommended dosage on the label and do not exceed the recommended daily dosage. Consult with your physician for proper dosages and recommendations on over-the-counter medications.

Identifying the symptoms of heat rash can help you effectively treat and prevent it.You may have clear, fluid filled blisters that affect only the top layer of your skin.You may have fluid sacs on your skin that contain pus.The blisters may penetrate deeply into your skin.You may have intense itching and your skin may be swollen., A cool bath can soothe heat rash and help decrease inflammation. You may want to consider adding a colloidal oatmeal preparation to help further soothe your skin.Sprinkle water with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal, all of which can help calm your skin., Applying a calamine lotion or non-prescription anti-itch cream can relieve heat rash, itching, and inflammation. You can purchase anti-itch cream at grocery and drug stores both in-store and online.A nonprescription anti-itch, or hydrocortisone, cream, can help relieve itching. Make sure to purchase a cream with at least 1% hydrocortisone.
Apply the cream once a day after your bath to the affected area., If you have a heat rash, rub anhydrous lanolin cream into your skin. This may help prevent your skin ducts from blocking and may keep new lesions from forming.Rub in the cream after bathing.
You can get anhydrous lanolin at most pharmacies.

, The itching and inflammation from heat rash can come from histamine in your blood. Cold packs or compresses can help relieve itching and inflammation associated with heat rash by constricting blood flow and cooling the skin.You can place a cold compress on your rashes intermittently for 10 to 15 minutes, once every two hours or as needed., Try not scratching as much as possible. Scratching can irritate the rash, or cause other problems, including a skin infection."
"
Avoid extreme or strenuous activities.,
Wear light colored and loose-fitting clothes to reduce heat retention.,
Avoid eating spicy and fatty foods.",How to Drop Your Core Temperature2," If you engage in strenuous and vigorous activities, especially during hot or humid weather, your body will heat up due to the expense of energy and physical exertion.Try exercising in less physically demanding ways, such as walking or cycling. If you insist on maintaining your usual level of workout intensity, be sure to take frequent breaks and avoid over-exerting yourself.Swimming can also be a good way to naturally lower your body temperature while exercising, because you will be submerged in cool water., It's important that your clothing allows air to circulate over your skin to cool you off, but you also want to be sure that your skin is covered to prevent additional sun exposure.Light-colored clothing reflects the sun's light rather than absorbing it, thereby lowering the level of heat in the body. Avoid wearing dark colored and thick clothes, as these clothes are known to attract and trap heat., Hot and spicy foods can increase your metabolism, acting like stimulants to elevate your body temperature.The compound found in chili peppers, capsaicin, naturally raises your body's temperature.Food with a high fat content can lead to more heat being trapped in the body by increased levels of fat stored in the cells. This is because fat is responsible for storing heat in the body and making the body warmer."

Loose-fitting clothes allow air circulation around your body. Lightweight clothes will retain less heat.


Conversely, having your shirt off can actually increase your odds of heat exhaustion. Without a shirt you are exposed to more sun. A sweaty shirt can also act as a cooling device.;
, Use sunscreen when you go outdoors. Try to cover your face with a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. Sunburn prevents your body from cooling down efficiently.Sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher is best for warm weather., Even if you do not feel thirsty, keep drinking sips of water throughout the day. This will keep your body hydrated and help you to continue producing enough sweat to cool down your body.OSHA recommends you drink water once every 15 minutes., These can act as diuretics, which move fluids out of the body too quickly. They can quickly dehydrate you, putting you at risk of heat exhaustion.Sugary drinks, like sodas, slow down the absorption of water into your system.Overly cold drinks can cause stomach cramps, which can also be a problem when exercising in warm weather., Air conditioning can significantly reduce the risk of heat stroke; if you don’t have any consider going to a public place that does, like a shopping mall or library. Avoid places like the inside of a car, where temperatures can become particularly extreme.Never leave children or dogs in your car for any period of time, even a very short one.

, This will give you time to drink and rest. Your body will start to cool down a little each time you rest and hydrate. You will be less likely to become overheated this way.

, The hottest times of the day are between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. When possible go outside before or after this time frame."

These include high blood pressure and heart medications, allergy medications, tranquilizers, antipsychotics, and particularly diuretics. Some illegal drugs, like cocaine and amphetamines, have similar effects. Ask your doctor if any drugs you have been prescribed increase your chances of heat exhaustion., Obesity makes it more difficult to regulate body temperature. Your body will retain more heat putting you at greater risk of heat stroke., The heat index factors in both temperature and humidity. It might take your body a couple of weeks to adjust to a higher heat index than you are accustomed to. If you have recently relocated to a place with a much higher temperature or humidity, take some time to adjust before spending much time outside.Humidity increase the likelihood of heat exhaustion as much as the actual temperature. High humidity prevents your sweat from evaporating, so that your body has more difficulty cooling itself., You are especially susceptible to heat exhaustion after you have already experienced it. Wait a week before spending extended periods exercising in warm weather."
"
Rest in a cool location.,
Drink cool liquids.,
Run cool water over yourself.,
Loosen or remove clothing.,
Know the signs of heat stroke and seek emergency medical attention.",How to Prevent Heat Exhaustion3," When you suspect that you are experiencing heat exhaustion, you should move to an air-conditioned location. If that is not possible, find shade. Rest on your back. Elevate your legs above your heart., Water or sports drinks — below room temperature — will help to cool down your body.Other types of liquids, like alcohol, might make the situation worse.

, Take a cool shower or bath. Wrap towels soaked in cool water over your body, If possible remove clothing altogether. If not, loosen up the clothing so that you can get additional air circulation around your body., Heat exhaustion can progress into heat stroke, which can be potentially fatal. Seek medical attention immediately if:Your skin feels hot or dry but you aren’t sweating.
Your body temperature is over 103°F (39.4°C).
You are confused or lose consciousness. (Often others will notice confusion or strange behavior before you do.)
You experience frequent vomiting.
You have shortness of breath or any trouble breathing.

Evaluate the type of heat exhaustion.",How to Deal With Heat Exhaustion," Do whatever you can to cool the person suffering from heat exhaustion. If possible, get the person suffering from heat exhaustion to shade or an air conditioned building. If those are not available, get the person suffering from heat exhaustion in front of a fan.Keep the person with heat stroke in a cool environment while they hydrate and allow their body temperature to regulate. This may mean several hours to a full day indoor or in a cool area.;
, With heat exhaustion, the person’s temperature may only be slightly elevated, if at all. However, it is important to monitor the person’s temperature since a very high temperature (over 104 degrees Fahrenheit) can indicate heat stroke.To lower the person’s temperature, try applying a cool compress to the back of the neck and wrists. Use a towel soaked in cool water or wrap an ice cube in a paper towel and apply it to the skin.
Try not to apply ice directly to skin, as the skin may be sunburned and this may cause damage to the tissue., If the person suffering is wearing tight-fitting clothing, loosen it, and remove any excess layers. If certain articles of clothing are necessary, loosen them as much as possible to allow airflow through the clothes.Do not remove any clothes that are necessary to protect the person from exposure. Sunburns and blistering will only make heat exhaustion worse. Avoid removing protective layers unless absolutely necessary

, Lay down the person suffering from heat exhaustion and elevate their legs and feet slightly above the level of the heart. If the person reports feeling dizzy or disoriented, decrease the elevation incrementally until they feel comfortable.Use props such as pillows, an ottoman, or towels to help support the legs and feet.

, Heat exhaustion and dehydration are closely linked. Slowly and consistently drink water to replenish their fluids and keep hydrated.Drinking cool water, if available, may help with the overall cooling process.
If you suspect salt depletion, which may be recognized by nausea and vomiting, you may want to provide the person with sports drinks to help replenish their salts while keeping them hydrated.Avoid any alcoholic or caffeinated beverages, as this may lead to further dehydration.

, Soak a cloth or sponge in cool water and rub it over the body, especially the head. Alternatively, you can fill a spray bottle with cool water and spray the person suffering with it. Sweat helps the body to cool as it evaporates, and applying moisture to the skin can perform the same function.


If there is access to a shower or bathtub, soaking in cool water may also help the overall cooling process.

, If you even suspect you are dealing with heat stroke, immediately call emergency medical services (911). If the symptoms seem minor, you may want to call the person’s general practitioner. However, if symptoms include loss of consciousness, vomiting, or dizziness such that the person cannot stand, emergency services need to be contacted.


Let the medical professional with whom you speak know what symptoms the person with heat stroke exhibits, and inform the medical team of what type of treatment is being administered.
Ask them, “Is there anything else we need to do to manage the condition until this person can get to you?”
If you are on the phone with emergency services and an ambulance is being dispatched to you, stay on the phone until the ambulance arrives, and update the medical professional regarding any changes in condition and actions taken.

, If the person with heat exhaustion has become unconscious, if they are showing symptoms of heat stroke, or if they have a fever at or above 104° F (40° C), call an ambulance or take measures to get them to a hospital immediately. Administer first aid as necessary, but make it a priority to get the person medical attention as soon as possible.Carefully monitor heartrate and breathing if the person is unconscious. If either stop, it may be necessary to perform CPR.

, For any individual who suffered from heat exhaustion but did not need emergency care, follow up as soon as possible with a doctor. Go to an urgent care center or make an emergency appointment with a general practitioner to have them look for signs of complications due to heat exhaustion.It is important to be seen by a doctor as soon as possible after recognizing symptoms of heat exhaustion. Do not wait multiple days for an appointment with a general practitioner. If a regular doctor cannot see the person immediately, it is best to go to urgent care.

, A person who ended up in the hospital or in urgent care with symptoms of heat exhaustion should make a follow up appointment with their regular doctor a few days after initial medical treatment to ensure that the body has adjusted back to normal. Let the doctor know what symptoms were experienced, and what treatment was administered as first aid, as well as by a medical professional.


Ask the doctor, “Is there anything else I need to do to properly treat this issue?”

, Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are two closely related syndromes, and if left untreated one can easily lead to the other. However, the symptoms of each are different, and both require a different set of treatments. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include:


Confusion or disorientation
Fatigue
Heavy sweating
Pale or flushed skin
Rapid heart beat
Headache or dizziness
Fainting

, Before any first aid is administered for heat exhaustion, you should check to see if things have progressed to the level of heat stroke, which requires a different first aid approach. Heat stroke has symptoms including:


Red skin
Dry skin with no sweating
A body temperature of above 104° F (40° C).

, Heat exhaustion may be caused by either water depletion or salt depletion. Look at the symptoms to understand what type of heat exhaustion you are treating and relay this information to a medical professional as soon as possible.Water depletion leads to symptoms such as excessive thirst, muscle weakness, headache, and fainting.
Salt depletion leads to symptoms including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and heat cramps.

Remove the wrap's peel paper and lightly adhere the wrap.,
Adhere firmly once you have positioned the wrap.,
Wear the wrap for up to 8 hours.,
Monitor your skin.,
Determine if you need a heat wrap.,
Make sure you purchase the correct heat wrap.,
Try using heat wraps during the day first.",How to Activate Thermacare Heat Wraps," The chemical ingredients in Thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate. Once exposed to air, the wrap should immediately begin heating, reaching its maximum temperature in about half an hour. Attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly.


Do not microwave the wrap, or attempt to speed up the warming by heating it in any other fashion. Doing so may ruin the wrap and create a fire hazard.
If the wrap hasn't warmed up after 30 minutes, it may have been previously exposed to air and deactivated. Throw it away and open a new one.;
, Dirt, moisture, lotions or cosmetic products will prevent the wrap from adhering securely and may result in the wrap coming loose and becoming ineffective., If you are over 55 or are especially sensitive to heat, you should apply the wrap over a piece of light clothing, such as an undergarment. Laying a light cloth over the area you will be applying the heat wrap before attaching it is another option., Thermacare heat wraps have visible heat cells on their interior and exterior surfaces. The darker pads are on the side of the wrap intended to come into contact with the skin. Make sure these darker cells are facing your skin as you attach the pads., Do not press the adhesive tabs firmly onto your skin until you are sure you have placed the wrap where you want it to remain. Here are specific guidelines for each type of wrap:For the lower back and hip, center the pad over the location of the pain with the slightly extended ""tab"" section of the heating pad pointing down.
For the neck, wrist or shoulder, simply center the pad over the location of the pain and wrap the straps as if applying an adhesive bandage.
For the knee and elbow, bend the joint and place the opening in the wrap over the end of your knee or elbow before attaching the adhesive strips around the back of the joint.
Menstrual wraps do not apply directly to the skin but, rather, to the inner side of an undergarment. Adhere the wrap to the garment where it will cover the target area, then put on the garment.

, Rub the adhesive tabs into your skin until they are firmly attached. This will ensure that the wrap remains in place while you are using it., Thermacare wraps are designed to be worn under clothing, and should come loose during normal physical activity. Eventually, the active chemical ingredients in the wrap will run out, and the wrap will begin to cool. Once it has cooled, a heat wrap will no longer be effective. Do not try to reheat the wrap in the microwave, or by any other means.You can dispose of depleted heat wraps in your normal household waste.

, You should check under the wrap every couple of hours to make sure you are not experiencing redness or irritation. If you experience prolonged redness, irritation, or increased pain you should stop using the heat wrap right away, and talk to your doctor if the symptoms do not dissipate.If the irritation is only mild, you can instead try wearing a light layer of cloth underneath the wrap.

, Heat wraps are useful for temporarily relieving soreness from overuse of muscles, pain from strain to joints in your back, arms and legs, and cramping associated with menstruation. Heat therapy can be soothing, but will not help your body heal injuries. You should talk to a doctor about treatment options if you are injured, or if your pain is severe.Because a Thermacare wrap requires clean, dry skin to attach to, they cannot be used over an area where a therapeutic cream or ointment is applied. Doing so will prevent the wrap from adhering properly.

, Not all varieties of heat pad are suitable for application to all parts of the body. Thermacare offers several varieties of heat wrap, each suitable for a different part of the body. The varieties currently available are:Lower back and hip
Knee and elbow
Neck, wrist and shoulder
Menstrual, for the lower abdomen
Multi-purpose, for use on any location on the back, arms or legs.

, This will allow you to monitor your response to the heat wrap and watch out for irritation or discomfort. Once you confirmed that the wraps are comfortable for your use, you can consider wearing them during sleep."

Notice if your cat is cold and shivering.,
Look for symptoms on your cat’s extremities.,
Watch for skin discoloration.",How to Diagnose and Treat Frostbite in Cats1," If your cat is playing outside and starts whining, shivering or behaving anxiously, it is a sign of hypothermia and possible frostbite. Hypothermia often occurs alongside frostbite and is a life threatening condition, so you should familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypothermia.

If you notice any shivering or discomfort, move your cat to a warm, indoor environment.;
, Once your cat has been taken to a warm environment, you may notice symptoms of frostbite on their nose, tail, paws, scrotum or other sensitive areas with less fur. Symptoms may take a few days to appear, so keep an eye on your cat for at least a week after the prolonged exposure to cold or wind. Look for the following symptoms:

Pain and swelling
Discoloration of the skin
Blisters on the feet
Peeling of your cat’s skin
Skin ulcers
Brittle skin, when touched
Pain when your cat is touched
Swelling
Black or deadened skin

, Once your cat has warmed up, the blood flow should start to return to your cat’s extremities, resulting in red skin. If the skin turns gray, blue or black instead of red, it is a sign of more severe frostbite. In this case, your veterinarian may have to remove the impacted tissue."

Take your cat to a warm environment.,
Apply warm, moist heat to your cat’s skin.,
Watch for signs of improved circulation.,
Apply aloe vera to your cat’s skin.,
Keep your cat warm on the way to the veterinarian.",How to Diagnose and Treat Frostbite in Cats2," Bring your cat indoors to a cozy room, away from any drafts or doorways. Cover your cat in a warm blanket., You can immerse your cat in warm bath for fifteen to thirty minutes, but make sure the water is not hot. You should use a temperature that would be comfortable to a baby, such as 104 to 108 Fahrenheit (40-42 Celsius). If you put your hand in the water, it should feel warm and pleasant, not steaming hot. After a maximum of half an hour, take your cat out of the bath and gently pat it dry.As an alternative, if you do not have a bath, you could apply a warm, moist towel to your cat’s skin.
Avoid the use of dry heat, such as a heating pad or hair dryer.Avoid rubbing your cat’s skin while it is in the bath or when drying it.

, As your cat warms up, their blood flow should start to return to the extremities. You should see their skin turn red. However, if it starts to turn dark or black, it is a sign of severe frostbite. In this case, you should get your cat to a veterinarian as soon as possible., Put some aloe vera cream or salve on the affected areas, such as the tail, paws and nose. The aloe vera should help reduce the irritation and improve the healing process, Wrap your cat in a nice warm towel, which you can heat up in the dryer. Put it in the car after it has been warmed up. Then, drive it to the veterinarian.Avoid giving your cat any pain relievers that have not been prescribed by your veterinarian.

Keep an eye on your cat following treatment.",How to Diagnose and Treat Frostbite in Cats3," If your cat has experienced severe frostbite, you may want to ask your veterinarian about medication to help your cat cope with the pain. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for the dose and duration of the prescribed medication.“Is there a medication that could help my cat deal with the pain?”

, If your cat’s skin has turned black, surgery may be needed to remove the affected tissue. If the frostbite is severe on the paws or tail, amputation may be needed. Antibiotics may be used to reduce infection. Ask your veterinarian about the most appropriate treatment option.“What is the least invasive way of treating the frostbite?”
“What treatment option will ensure the best quality of life for my cat?”
“What will be done to manage the pain during surgery?”

, You should watch to make sure your cat isn’t licking and scratching the affected tissue, which could make it much worse. To prevent this scenario, it may be wise to use a collar on your cat that restricts access to the affected tissue."

Begin warming up the affected area.,
Take pain medication if necessary.,
Rewarm the frostbitten area by submerging it in warm water.,
Do not use dry heat such as heaters, fireplaces or heating pads.These heat sources are too difficult to control and will not supply the sort of gradual heat needed to treat frostbite.,
Pay attention to the frostbitten areas.,
Prevent further damage.,

Talk to your doctor about aftercare.,
Protect the area from further cold.",How to Treat Frostbite," Frostnip is not the same as frostbite, but can precede it. Ice crystals form on the surface of the skin, rather than within the tissue as in frostbite. The blood vessels in your skin severely constrict, causing paleness or reddened areas.You may feel numbness, pain, or prickling or tingling of the area. However, the skin should respond normally to pressure without serious numbness and should retain its normal texture. Symptoms resolve with rewarming.Frostnip may affect children more quickly than adults. Frostnip usually affects extremities such as the ears, nose, fingers, toes, and cheeks.Frostnip signals that weather conditions are sufficient to cause frostbite with further exposure.;
, Although it may not feel superficial, superficial frostbite is so named because the damage can be reversed with treatment. This condition is more serious than frostnip, and can be recognized by numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin with red blotches, aching or throbbing, and slightly hardened or swollen skin.There is less possibility of tissue loss with superficial frostbite. Some people with superficial frostbite may develop blisters with clear fluid within 24 hours. These are usually located at the ends or tips of the area affected and do not lead to tissue loss., Severe frostbite is the most dangerous form of frostbite. In cases of severe frostbite the skin looks pale and will feel waxy and unusually firm, and there is a loss of feeling/numbness of the affected area. In some cases, severely frostbitten tissue may have blisters on the skin that may have blood in them, or signs of gangrene (gray/black dead skin).The most severe form of frostbite extends into the muscle and bone and can lead to death of the skin and tissues. The risk of tissue loss is high with this form., If you are able to get to a hospital or emergency department within two hours, you should not try to treat frostbite yourself. If you are unable to get out of the cold, do not try rewarming the area if it is in danger of refreezing. The freeze-thaw-freeze-thaw cycle causes more damage to your tissue than allowing it to simply remain frozen.If you are more than two hours away from medical treatment, you can begin treatment yourself. All three conditions -- frostnip, superficial frostbite, and severe frostbite -- have the same basic procedure for “field treatment” (away from a hospital)., As soon as you notice the frostbitten areas on your body (most commonly on the fingers, toes, ears, and nose), you should take steps to warm them up. Tuck fingers/hands into your armpits, and hold dry gloved hands over your face, toes, or other areas of the body to add heat. If you have any on, remove your wet clothes as these will prevent your temperature from rising., If you’re suffering superficial to severe frostbite, the rewarming process may be painful. To prevent further suffering on your part, take an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) pain reliever such as ibuprofen. However, do not take aspirin, as it may keep your body from healing effectively.Follow the bottle instructions for dosage amounts.

, Fill a basin or bowl with water at a temperature between 104-107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (40-42 degrees Celsius). Water at a temperature of 104.9 (40.5 degrees Celsius) is considered ideal.Do not use temperatures above these, as this could burn the skin and cause blisters. If it is available, add antibacterial soap to the water to help prevent infection. Submerge the affected area for 15-30 minutes.If you do not have a thermometer handy, test the water by placing an uninjured area such as a hand or elbow in the water. It should feel very warm, but still tolerable.If the water is painfully hot, cool the water a little bit.If possible, use circulating water rather than still.A whirlpool bath is ideal, but even using running water would work.
Do not allow the frozen area to touch the sides of the bowl or vessel. This could cause damage to the skin.Do not rewarm the area for less than 15-30 minutes. As the area thaws, you may experience severe pain. However, it is important to continue rewarming the area until it is fully thawed. If you stop the rewarming process too early you could cause further damage.For severe frostbite, you may need to rewarm the area for up to an hour., They can also cause burns.Remember that the frostbitten area will be numb, and you will be unable to gauge the temperature. Dry heat sources cannot be accurately monitored., As your skin begins to rewarm itself, you should feel tingling and burning sensations. The frostbitten area should turn pink or red, often blotchy, and regain a regular texture/feeling.Your skin should not swell or blister; these are signals of further damage that should be treated immediately by a doctor. Additionally, if your skin does not change at all after several minutes in warm water, there may be significant damage that your doctor needs to treat.Take photos of the affected area if possible. This will help your doctor track the progress of the frostbite and determine whether it is improving with treatment., Continue to seek medical attention, but in the process keep from worsening your frostbite. Don’t rub or chafe the frostbitten skin, avoid too much movement, and don’t allow the area to be affected by extreme cold again.Allow the rewarmed areas to air-dry or gently blot them dry with a clean towel, but do not rub them.Do not bandage the area yourself. There is no evidence that supports bandaging a frostbitten area before getting proper medical treatment, and bandaging may interfere with your mobility.Do not massage the frostbitten area. This can cause further tissue damage.Elevate the area to help reduce swelling., Depending on the severity of your frostbite, the treatment you receive from your doctor may vary. Hydrotherapy is most common, but in extreme cases surgery is provided.If you suffered from severe frostbite, your doctor may be limited to amputation as a treatment option, but this decision is only made 1-3 months after the initial exposure, once the full extent of tissue damage is clear.Your doctor will ensure that proper rewarming has taken place and assess any “non-viable tissue,” or tissue that was unable to be healed. When your treatments are done and you are ready to be released from the hospital or emergency department, the doctor will bandage the damaged area and provide specific instructions for what precautions you should take as you recover. This will vary, depending on the severity of your frostbite.
If you have severe frostbite, your doctor may recommend transferring you to a burn unit for treatment.You will need to follow up with your doctor within 1-2 days after leaving the hospital or emergency department if you have moderate or severe frostbite.Extremely severe conditions will require more follow-up at 10 days and 2-3 weeks., Because your skin was damaged by the frostbite, it is at risk of further damage as you begin to heal. You will probably also experience some pain and inflammation as you heal.Get plenty of rest, and talk to your doctor about the following:


Applying aloe vera. Studies suggest that applying pure aloe vera cream to the affected areas may help prevent further skin damage and increase tissue healing.Managing blisters. Your skin will likely blister as you recover. Do not pop or break blisters that appear. Ask your doctor how to handle them until they break on their own.
Managing pain. Your doctor will likely prescribe ibuprofen to help manage pain and inflammation. Take it as directed.Preventing infection. Especially in severe cases, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics.It is important to take the full course of antibiotics exactly as prescribed.
Getting around. If your frostbite affected your feet or toes, you should avoid walking on them as you heal. Walking on frostbitten areas can cause further damage. Ask your doctor about a wheelchair or other options.

, To assure your full recovery and prevent further damage, you need to protect the affected area from further cold exposure for 6-12 months.


To prevent future incidents of frostbite, limit your time outdoors in very cold weather, especially if it is windy or wet.

Call emergency services.,
Avoid medications.,
Cool the person down.,
Replenish fluids and electrolytes.,
Help the person stay calm.,
Lay the person down.",How to Treat Sunstroke1," Depending on the symptoms and the person, you may wish to call your primary care physician or 911. Pay close attention to symptoms. Prolonged heatstroke damages the brain, causing anxiety, confusion, seizures, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, hallucinations, coordination problems, unconsciousness, and restlessness. Sunstroke can also affect the heart, kidneys, and muscles.It’s better to be safe than sorry. Call emergency services if you observe any of the following symptoms:


Signs of shock (ex. bluish lips and fingernails, confusion)
Loss of consciousness
A temperature over 102F (38.9C)
Rapid breathing and/or pulse
Weak heartbeat, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and dark urine
In some cases, they may be collapsed, agitated or even in cardiac arrest, so take care and start CPR if necessary
Seizures. If the person is having seizures, clear the area for the patient’s safety. If you can, place a pillow under his head so it does not bang on the ground during the convulsions.If milder symptoms persist for an extended time (longer than an hour), make the call.;
, Our first instinct is to take medicine when we don't feel good. If someone is suffering from sunstroke, certain medications will only make the situation worse. Don’t use medications for fever like aspirin or acetaminophen. These can be harmful during a heatstroke because they may increase bleeding, which can be a very serious issue with blistered sunburns. Medications for a fever work well on someone with an infection, not on someone with heatstroke.Don’t give the person anything by mouth if he is vomiting or unconscious. Anything that enters the person’s mouth could become a choking hazard., While you wait for emergency services, get the person to a shady, cool (preferably air-conditioned) area. Remove all clothing and get the person into a cool bath, shower, stream, or pond if possible. Avoid very cold temperatures. The same goes for using ice, which may also mask the signs of a slow heartbeat and cardiac arrest.Do not do this if the person is unconscious. You can put a cool, wet rag on the back of the neck, on the groin, and/or under the armpits. If you can, mist and fan the person to promote evaporative cooling.Either mist the person with cool water or place a wet sheet over their body before fanning them; this will cause evaporative cooling, which is faster than simply wetting the person.


Help the person remove any extra clothing (hat, shoes, socks) to aid in the cooling process.
Do not rub the person’s body with alcohol. This is an old wives' tale. Alcohol cools the body too quickly, which can result in a dangerous temperature fluctuation. Rub the person’s body with cool water, never alcohol. , Have the person sip either Gatorade or salty water (1tsp salt per qt water) to counteract both dehydration and the loss of salts through sweating. Don’t allow him to drink quickly, which can induce shock. If you don't have any salt or Gatorade, plain water will help also.Alternatively, you can administer salt tablets. Doing so can help balance electrolytes. Follow the instructions on the bottle., When the patient stays calm, the patient can help.Minimize their agitation by having them breath deeply. Have them focus on other things besides the sunstroke. Anxiety will only make their blood pump faster, raising their temperature a little more. Read How to Calm Yourself During an Anxiety Attack for more pointers about how to help them calm themselves.


Massage the person's muscles. Massage gently. Your goal is to increase the circulation in the muscles.Muscle cramps are one of the early symptoms of sunstroke. Usually the calf areas are most affected., One of the most prominent effects of sunstroke is fainting. Protect against fainting by laying the person down.


If the person does faint, turn him onto his left side with his right leg bent for stabilization. This position is called the recovery position.Check the person's mouth for vomit, so they do not choke.The left side is the best side for blood flow because our hearts are on that side."
"
Know who is at risk.,
Pay attention to the weather.,
Stay out of direct sunlight.,
Drink water to stay hydrated.,
Avoid alcoholic drinks outdoors on hot days.",How to Treat Sunstroke2," The elderly, workers in hot environments, obese, diabetics, those with kidney, heart, or circulation problems, and babies are at high risk. Those that have inactive or inefficient sweat glands are particularly susceptible to sunstroke. Avoid activities that force your body to retain heat, especially when it is hot outside like exercising, over-bundling your baby, or being out in the heat for too long without water.


Certain medications also put people at greater risk. These include beta blockers, diuretics, and some medicines used to treat depression, psychosis, or ADHD. , If the heat index is above 90 degree fahrenheit or close to it, be cautious. Avoid taking babies and elderly people out into the heat.


Be aware of the heat island effect. The heat island effect happens when the rural areas are cooler than the city areas. Those in the crowded city usually have increased temperatures ranging from 1.8 - 5.4 degrees fahrenheit higher than in rural areas. At nighttime, the difference can be up to 22 degrees fahrenheit. It can happen in communities because of air pollution, greenhouse gases, water quality, air conditioning costs and energy consumption.Wear light clothing appropriate for the weather.

, Take frequent breaks and find shady areas if working outside. Use sunscreen to avoid sunburn. Always wear a hat when out in the sun, especially if you are susceptible to sunstroke.


One of the most unfortunate causes of sunstroke is sitting in a hot car. Do not sit in a hot car. And do not leave children alone in the car, even for a few minutes.
If you decide to exercise, avoid the peak sun hours from 11:00am to 3:00 pm., Watch your urine color, it should stay a light yellowish color.


Don’t drink caffeine. This will tell the body to become stimulated when what it needs to do is calm down. Though black coffee is 95% water, the effect of caffeine on the body is harmful when the person has signs of sunstroke. The heart will beat harder and faster., Alcohol can interfere with body temperature by constricting your blood vessels, making it harder for blood to flow to keep you warm."

",How to Prevent Frostbite," Take time to look at the weather forecast and decide what you need to wear today. Preventing frostbite is all about being as prepared as possible. If you're going to be outside all day, whether you're hiking or standing in line for concert tickets, frostbite is a real possibility.;
, Winter weather can be very unpredictable. While you might be well-equipped for a the afternoon high, you should also think ahead about the night's low, just in case you get delayed.

, Exposure to wet snow and cold winds increases the chance that you could end up with frostbite.

, People who spend a lot of time outside have developed a sort of system for dressing for winter weather. No matter how warm your winter coat is, it's not going to be as effective as an outfit composed of more than one layer. A good winter weather getup includes the following basics:

, This is a type of synthetic fabric that keeps your skin from staying damp.

, Wool is a good choice. Never wear cotton, since it doesn't dry fast enough and doesn't provide good insulation.

, Your winter coat, a rain jacket, or a combination of the two should be on top to protect you from the elements.

, Make sure there’s not an area where cold air is hitting your skin. The place where your pants and shirt meet, your wrists, ankles and neck are all susceptible to frostbite. Even those these aren't the most common places to get frostbite, you should take every precaution just in case.

,,,, These are the parts that most often end up frost-bitten. They're the outer parts of your body that don't benefit from your warm layers. That means you have to take extra care to clothe these parts of your body properly so they stay as warm as possible.

,, You might want to get a ski mask.

,, If you anticipate getting wet, wear waterproof boots.

, Children are more susceptible to frostbite, since they're not as aware when of the warning signs. A child might lose a mitten and end up with numb fingers without giving it a moment's notice. Bring your children inside often, especially in very cold temperatures, to make sure they stay safe.

, Frostbite can start to occur very quickly at low temperatures or when there are high winds or precipitation. If the weather conditions change, it's important to seek shelter as soon as possible.

, Wet clothing against the skin increases the risk of frostbite. Keep clothes dry, especially socks and gloves or mittens. Bring extras or go inside to dry them off if they become wet.

, This is especially important when you’re in very cold temperatures.Look at your skin, press it to feel how firm it is, and wiggle your fingers and toes. Early signs of frostbite include:, It involves painful sensations and red skin that responds normally to pressure.

,, See if there's numbness and white or grayish-yellow skin that feels waxy and unusually firm. Dizziness, confusion and fever may also be present.

, If you have any of the early signs of frostbite, go inside and start getting warm. Take off wet clothes and change into dry ones or use a warm blanket to warm up. Have a warm drink like tea, hot chocolate or just warm water to start bringing your body temperature back up.

, The affected area will be susceptible to further damage if you go outside. Don't risk it just because you want to get back to skiing or hiking.

,, Fill a bowl or pot with warm water and completely submerge the affected area. Do not use hot water, as it will heat the skin too quickly and damage the tissue. Soak the area for 30 to 40 minutes.

, The person with frostbite may not be able to sense the temperature accurately.

, As the tissue begins to warm, it's common to feel severe pain.

, Handling the tissue roughly could result in a lot of damage Warm water should be the only warming mechanism you use to restore the body part to the correct temperature. Avoid doing the following:

,,, Frostnip may be treatable at home without need for further assistance, but anything beyond that could cause long-term damage. If you experience these symptoms, it’s important to get medical attention:,,,,,"
"
Brace yourself.,
Keep as calm as possible.,
Focus your energy on getting out immediately.,
Get horizontal and kick your legs.,
Roll your body across the ice once you're out.,
Retrace your footsteps back to safety.,
Take off wet clothes.,
Get warmed up.",How to Survive a Fall Through Ice," Once you have the sickening realization that you're falling through the ice and into the cold water, you need to brace yourself and consciously stop your reflex to gasp and breathe in if your head gets submerged. The shock of being in freezing water should not be underestimated, as it causes immediate changes to your breathing and heart rate.


Once in the cold water, your body's cold shock response, called the ""torso reflex,""will make you want to gasp for air and hyperventilate because your heart rate accelerates rapidly, but you must avoid doing so, especially if you're underwater.This initial shock typically wears off in one to three minutes as your body slightly acclimatizes to the cold.
Although the initial cold shock passes, you're still in grave danger of quickly developing hypothermia, which means your body loses heat faster than it produces it. Just a 4-degree drop in body temperature can trigger hypothermia.;
, The physical pain of being submerged in freezing water combined with all the physiological changes in response to ""cold shock"" (increased heart and breathing rates, high blood pressure, adrenaline release) can easily lead to panic.However, remaining calm and controlling your breathing allows you to think better and develop a plan to get out of the water. You don't have a lot of time, but likely more time than a panicky mind perceives.


Hypothermia occurs as your body temperature passes below 95°F (35°C), but it takes some time to get there and depends on many factors.Keeping your head above water and as much of your body as possible out of the water will buy you more time.
Depending on multiple factors such as physical conditioning, the amount of body fat, type and layering of clothing, ambient temperature, and wind chill, it can take between 10 to 45 minutes to develop hypothermia and lose consciousness in cold water.
Remove any heavy objects or clothing that are weighing you down, such as a backpack, fanny pack or skis. This will reduce your risk of drowning.

, Once you have calmed down and your head is above the water, you must focus your energy on getting out as quickly as possible rather than treading water and waiting for help. Remaining in the water can shorten your survival time by 50%Orientate yourself and focus on getting back to where you fell in, as the edges are probably sturdy enough to support you getting out.


If underwater, always look for contrasting color. When the ice is covered with snow, the hole will appear darker; ice without snow will make the hole look lighter.
In most cases, neuromuscular cooling or ""swim failure"" is a bigger and more immediate concern than hypothermia.In essence, most people will have between three and five minutes before the cold water incapacitates their muscles and coordination, making it very difficult or impossible to swim and kick their legs.
If you are with other people, yell loudly to let them know you've fallen in. They may not be willing or able to help you, but at least they won't abandon you and might be able to make an emergency call from their cellphone.

, Once you're orientated and decide where you're going to exit the water, quickly swim towards it and grab onto the edge of the ice. Get as much of your upper body as possible out of the water. Grab onto the top of the ice and use your forearms and elbows to prop yourself up. Then position your lower body horizontally and kick your legs as forcefully as possible in hopes of propelling yourself out of the water and onto the ice — much like seals in the arctic do.Once you've lifted your upper body on to the edge of the ice, wait a few seconds to let your clothes drain as much water as possible. It will reduce your weight and make it easier for you to actually propel yourself out of the water.
If you're unable to get out of the water after about 10 minutes, then you're almost certainly not going to get out by your own efforts as swim failure and hypothermia will be upon you — but don't panic at this stage either.
If you can't get out by yourself, conserve your energy (and heat) by moving as little as possible and wait for rescue. Cross your legs to conserve heat and try to keep your arms out of the water, as your body loses heat 32 times faster in cold water than in cold air., Once you've propelled yourself out of the cold water, then resist the urge to stand up and run for the shore because you may fall in again. Instead, remain spread out on the ice (so that your weight is distributed across a larger area) and slowly roll your body toward thicker ice or hard ground.At the very least, roll away from the hole in the ice by several feet before attempting to stand up.
If you can, trace your tracks back to shore or hard ground — it held your weight previously, so it'll likely hold your weight again.
Remember that you should always stay off ice that's only 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick or less, especially during warmer days when the ice is thawing.At least 4 inches (10.2 cm) of ice thickness is needed for ice fishing, walking or cross country skiing, whereas at least 5 – 6 inches is needed to support a snowmobile or ATV.

, Once you're out of the water, only part of your struggle for survival is complete, because hypothermia is likely fast advancing within your body. As such, once on safe footing, quickly retrace your footsteps or path back to shore and/or your vehicle or cabin so you can get warmed up. Your leg muscles will likely not want to cooperate due to the cold shock, so you may have to crawl or drag yourself.


Ask for immediate assistance if there are people nearby. They may not have any survival or emergency medical knowledge, but they can at least help you get to a safe place and maybe call for additional help.
Initial signs and symptoms of hypothermia include shivering, dizziness, hyperventilation, increased heart rate, slight confusion, difficulty speaking, clumsiness and moderate fatigue.Signs of severe hypothermia include more advanced confusion, poor decision making, lack of coordination, violent shivering (or none at all), slurred speech or incoherent mumbling, weak pulse, shallow breathing and progressive loss of consciousness., It may seem counterintuitive during the moment, but taking off wet clothes is the fastest way to increase your core body temperature –– assuming you have dry clothes or a source of heat available.An external source of heat can't penetrate wet clothing and warm you up, so remove them quickly and wrap yourself in dry clothes and/or blankets.

Find an area sheltered from the wind or elements before removing clothing, preferably a dwelling or a vehicle. If not, then stand behind some trees, rocks or a snow drift to protect yourself from the additional chill of the wind.
If you are only in the early stages of hypothermia and still feel like you have some excess energy, do some push-ups or basic calisthenics after removing your clothes in attempts to warm up and improve blood flow.

, Once you've removed your wet clothes, you need to find dry replacements and a source of heat quickly. With advanced hypothermia, you may not be shivering any longer or feel very cold. Many patients report feeling numb. If you didn't bring a change of clothes, then ask others for extra clothes, jackets or blankets. Make sure to cover your head and insulate your body and feet from the cold ground. Sleeping bags, wool blankets or space blankets will help you to conserve body heat and rewarm your body.If you don't have a dwelling or vehicle to get warm in, you'll have to make a fire. Make sure you're out of your wet clothing and into something dry before collecting wood and making a fire. Get people to help if they're nearby.
Once you are in front of a heat source (fireplace, heat vents in a vehicle, campfire) bring your knees to your chest and keep your legs tight together to conserve your body heat. If you are with other people, huddle together in a tight circle facing each other in order to share body heat.Drink a warm, sweet, non-caffeinated beverage. The mug will warm your hands and the liquid will warm your insides.
If you are using heating pads or hot water bottles, place them near major arteries such as near the groin, armpits or shoulders. Always place a barrier between the heat source and your skins to prevent any burns.Extreme heat can damage your skin or trigger irregular heartbeats and a heart attack. Remember, you are trying to slowly and safely increase your core body temperature, and this can take a few hours.

Do not run out onto the ice.,
Call for help.,
Tell the victim to remain calm.,
Tell the victim how to escape.",How to Rescue Someone Who Has Fallen Through Ice1," Would-be rescuers frequently become victims when they fall through the ice as well. You should avoid approaching the hole in the ice unless the victim is unconscious or in imminent danger of slipping into the water and drowning, either from weakness or an inability to swim. If you do have to approach the hole as a last resort, then you should still not run or walk, but crawl, to minimize the impact of the weight.;
, Dial your country's emergency number (Call the Emergency Services), or your local emergency dispatcher to have trained rescuers/paramedics sent to the scene. However, you should do this very quickly, and not leave the victim at any cost. If you waste time calling for help instead of helping the victim, the consequences will be dire., If the victim just fell in and remains conscious, he or she can most likely get out without physical assistance. Tell the victim to keep calm. Reassure the person that you know what to do and that you will come to them if necessary. Let them know, truthfully, that as long as they stay afloat, they have plenty of time. They'll experience a ""cold shock"" for the first 1-3 minutes, during which they'll hyperventilate, so the important thing is for the person to keep their head above water.


Encourage the victim to control his breathing to stay calm. They will most likely be hyperventilating. Advise them to take deep, slow breaths through pursed lips.

, Tell the person to swim to the edge of the ice and use his elbows to lift himself partially out of the water. Have him go to the edge of the ice where he was coming from, since it held his weight up until that point, whereas the ice around the other edges might be weak. The weight of their wet clothes will probably make it impossible for them to lift themselves up out of the water––the main objective is for them to just get a grip on the edge of the ice, so don't let them waste energy trying to pull themselves out.


If he has any keys or sharp objects to use as picks, especially ice picks, encourage him to use them to get a grip on the ice.
Instruct the victim to kick his legs and to try to get as horizontal as possible while using his upper body to drag himself out. They should kick their legs as they would if they were swimming and come out of the hole in a horizontal position, with his belly on the ice. Leaning on his arms too much to lift his body or he'll be more likely to break the ice with his weight.Once the victim is out of the water, he should roll away from the hole to minimize the impact of his weight on the ice.

"
"
Throw a long object toward the victim.,
Throw the victim a sled if you don't have a long object.,
Row toward the victim if you don't have any objects.,
Form a human chain if it's necessary.,
Pull the victim out.",How to Rescue Someone Who Has Fallen Through Ice2," If the victim cannot get out on his own and help has not arrived, you should throw a long object that the victim can hold on to, such as a pole, a rope, a tree limp, or even a long scarf. Connecting yourself with the drowning person with a long object will keep you out of harm's way. Once the object reaches the victim, he should wrap it around himself as much as he can.To increase the chances of a safe ice rescue, you should be prepared with rope and other long items if you plan on going onto the ice.
Get a rope, extension cord, hockey stick, or any other sort of strong line that you can find.
Since the victim's cold hands may not be able to grip the line, tie a loop (not a slip knot—preferably a bowline knot) at the end of the rope and tell them to put their arms through the loop and then bend their arms to touch their shoulders so that the rope is inside the bend of their elbows. Alternatively, they can put the loop over their head and slide it down under their arms.

, A sled, a life preserver tied to a rope, or any object for the victim to grab onto will be more helpful than nothing., If you happen to have a light boat that you can push across the ice ahead of you, you should push it to the edge of the hole, get into it, and then pull the victim over the bow, making sure that it doesn't capsize. Attaching rope to the boat so the boat can more easily be brought to the shore by other rescuers isn't a bad idea if there's some rope nearby., If you don't have any rescue devices but you're with multiple people, then you may need to make a human chain to rescue the individual. To do this, you'll need to have the rescuers lie on the ice as closely as they can, forming a chain by holding on to the ankles of the person in front of him. The person at the front of the chain, who is closest to the victim, should grab the victim by his hands and should pull him flat onto the ice while the person at the end of the chain pulls the chain back.Though the human chain is not ideal, it's far better than having one person trying to help the victim who is in danger of falling in because he has no back-up. If the person in the front of the chain also falls in, he'll have the support of the person holding onto his ankles.

, Stay low, stay off the thin ice, and pull hard. If you have helpers, have them use their strength to assist with pulling and with staying away from the thin ice. Whether you're pulling the person as the lead in a human chain or you're pulling him up with the help of a rope, the victim should be dragged across the ice instead of being lifted and carried.


Remain at a safe distance from the weak ice, and keep a strong grip on the rope or object. If you must approach, always spread your weight as much as possible.
At a minimum, if you don't have any objects to throw, crawl on your belly––never walk. Another easy way to move with your weight spread out is to lay down with your hands above your head and roll on the ice.
If you do pull the victim out with a rope or another long object, make sure that you're pulling the victim toward you, and not the other way around.

"
"
Perform CPR if necessary.,
Warm the victim.,
Get the victim medical attention as soon as possible.,
Avoid future falls by always checking the thickness of the ice around you.",How to Rescue Someone Who Has Fallen Through Ice3," If the victim has stopped breathing or has no pulse, either from drowning or from sudden cardiac arrest, perform CPR on the victim if you know how. Do not attempt it if you don't know how to do it, but keep yelling for help if help has not come yet to maximize your chances of finding someone who knows how to do CPR. Even if the person appears to be dead, do not give up. Icy water can lower body temperature and slow down body functions, and just because the person isn't moving or responding doesn't mean he isn't alive and in need of help., If the victim is breathing and conscious, bring him or her inside or somewhere warm. He may need to be treated for shock as soon as possible. Remove wet clothes and immerse the person in lukewarm water that's no warmer than 90° Fahrenheit, 32° Celsius at first; gradually warm the water up later. Immersing a victim of hypothermia in water that is too warm can cause dangerous heart rhythms. If warm water is not immediately available, wrap the person in blankets.Though you may think that giving the person something warm to eat or drink will help him, you should not give any food or drink to a person who is still in shock and unable to eat or drink.

, Even if the victim feels fine, he or she should still be examined by a medical professional. Though you have rescued the victim from the ice, you're not out of the woods quite yet. The repercussions of falling through ice, even for a few minutes, can be deadly. The person may be suffering from frostbite or a number of other complications., If you want to prevent future falls through the ice, you should always know the thickness of the ice where you'll be fishing, walking, snowboarding, or doing whatever it is you do on the ice. You can check the thickness of the ice by using an ice chisel, ice auger, cordless drill, or tape measure, and by calling the local bait shop or lakeside resort to ask about the ice conditions in the area. Here are the appropriate thicknesses for each activity:2"" (5 cm) or less: Stay off the ice. The ice is too thin and won't support your weight.
4"" (10 cm): appropriate for ice fishing or other on-foot activities.
5"" (12.5 cm): okay for a snowmobile or ATV.
8"" - 12"" (20.5 - 30.5 cm): okay for a car or a small pickup.
12"" - 15"": (20.5 - 38 cm) appropriate for a medium-sized truck.

You can keep one kit to cover most possible emergencies. You just need to get together a few household essentials and put them in a secure place in case you should need them. You should have enough supplies to last 72 hours. Make sure your kit includes the following:A gallon of water a day per person (more for nursing mothers, children, and sick people)Non-perishable, easy-to-prepare food, such as salt-free crackers, whole grain cereals, and canned goods -- include a can openerAny medications you need
Sanitary and personal hygiene itemsInfant formula and diapersPet foodA torch or flashlight
A first aid kit
A cell phone
Extra batteriesMoist towelettes, toilet paper, and garbage bags for personal sanitation;
, It’s sensible to think about how you will get in touch with your family if you are separated. One good way to ensure you can get in touch is to write out a contact card for each person with lists of phone numbers and addresses.


A contact card is a card where phone numbers are written down and stored somewhere other than your cell phone. A laminated sheet of paper or index card will keep ink from running if it gets wet.
If there is high traffic on a phone network, text messages (SMS) are more likely to get through than a call.

, If you are in an area that experiences frequent periods of extreme heat, or if you just want to learn some useful skills, you can take a first aid class. Find one in your local area and sign up. Remember that some require payment. Many of the skills you will learn can prove helpful in a heat wave., Extreme heat can cause health problems for anybody, but there are groups of people for whom it will be more dangerous than others. Young children, older or elderly adults, and sick or overweight people will be at the highest risk of suffering illness due to extreme heat and humidity. People who work outside and athletes may also be at increased risk of heat-related illnesses.If you have somebody in your family who matches any of these descriptions, prioritize helping them.
Make sure they understand the dangers of extreme heat.
Don't forget pets! If you have a dog or cat, it can be affected by the heat too.

, It’s pretty straightforward, but if you want to be prepared for a heat wave, you need to know if there’s one coming and what the predicted temperatures are.Keep up to date with your local weather news, especially if you are in an area that where extreme heat is more common.


Sometimes, the power may go out. A hand-cranked or battery-powered radio will help you track the weather forecast.

, If you live in an area that is heavily asphalted or covered in concrete, the effects of a heat wave can be increased. Asphalt and concrete store heat longer and gradually release this heat during the night, producing higher night-time temperatures. This is known as the ""urban heat island effect"".Large cities can be 1.8-5.4F (1-3C) degrees hotter than their surroundings. At night, this difference can be up to 22F (12C) degrees.
Stagnant atmospheric conditions and poor air quality (smog, pollution) also exacerbate a heat wave.

, if you don't have central air-conditioning. Preparing your home for a heat wave involves a number of relatively small tasks that can help you to keep cool air in and hot air out. If you have window air-conditioners, start by making sure they are installed well. If there are gaps around the sides, insulate them.You can get insulating foam panels or spray foam from a home improvement store.You should also make sure the air-conditioning vents and ducts are well insulated.
It’s a good idea to repair or replace a faulty air-conditioner before you need to., One relatively quick thing you can do to help keep your house as cool as possible is to make some reflectors to fit your window panes. Use a reflective material such as tin foil or aluminium foil and wrap it around some cardboard. The foil will reflect the sun rather than absorb it.Put the reflectors between the glass and the window coverings.
You might want to do this just for one or two rooms where you will spend a lot of time.

, Even with the reflectors, it is a good idea to cover the windows which receive a lot of sun with drapes, shades, awnings, or louvers. Closing the drapes on the inside will make a difference, but outdoor awnings and louvers can reduce the heat that enters a home by up to 80 percent.You can also find heat and light blocking drapes from many department and home improvement stores. These can help keep the room cool.

, You can consider keeping your storm windows up all year round. During a heat wave they will help to keep the heat out of your house, just as they help to keep the heat in, and cold out during the winter.They are another layer of insulation between you and the heat outside.


Keeping your home as well insulated as possible will help you to stay cool.

, A lot of the health problems that can develop during a heat wave are associated with dehydration, so it’s crucial to make sure you drink plenty of water or a sports drink with electrolytes. Even if you don't feel thirsty, keep taking regular sips. Avoid drinks with a lot of caffeine such as coffee and tea, and severely limit your intake of alcohol.When it is very hot outside, it's recommended that you drink about 4 cups of water per hour.Don't gulp this all at once, though, or you may experience some discomfort.
There are some instances when you should consult a doctor before increasing the amount of liquids you drink:

If you have epilepsy, or heart, liver, or kidney disease.
If you are on a fluid-restricted diet or have a problem with fluid retention., It’s important to make sure you keep eating, but you should adapt your eating habits to the temperature. Eating is an effective method to control your body temperature. Eat well-balanced and light meals regularly, rather than two or three enormous plates of food.Large meals take more work to digest which will cause your body temperature to increase.


Foods that are rich in protein, such as meats and nuts, will increase metabolic heat.Fresh fruit, salads, healthy snacks, and vegetables are good choices.
If you're sweating a lot, replace lost salts and minerals as well as water. A handful of salted nuts or pretzels can be a good choice, or drink a sports beverage containing electrolytes or fruit juice.
Don’t take salt tablets unless directed to by your doctor., Keeping out of the sun is the best way to reduce your exposure to the heat. You should identify the coolest room in your house and try to spend as much time there as you can.If your house has more than one story, or you live in a multi-story building, stay on the lowest floor out of the sunshine.Taking cool showers and splashing yourself with cool water is excellent way to lower your body temperature., If your home is air-conditioned you will really feel the benefit. If not, you might consider spending the warmest part of the day (or even night) in public buildings such as libraries, schools, movie theatres, shopping malls, and other community facilities. Many of these are specially opened by public authorities during a heat wave, so check for extended hours.


There are even local cooling centers open in some places to help people cool down. Contact your local power company or do an internet search to find one near you.
If you don’t have air-conditioning, even turning on a fan will help to circulate the air a little.

, Indoors and out, it is important to remove any heavy clothing and to wear as little as modesty and laws permit. Wear loose-fitting, lightweight, and lightly colored clothing.Natural fabrics such as linen, cotton, and hemp are good choices. Avoid wearing polyester and flannel, as these fabrics will hold in sweat, causing you to stew in the humid air.


If you go outside be sure to use at least a 30 SPF sunscreen to avoid sunburn. Protect your head and face with a ventilated, wide-brimmed hat. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes.Consider wearing clothing made of synthetic sports fabrics that are designed to wick away perspiration.
Avoid dark colors, as these absorb the heat.Wear long-sleeved, lightweight clothing when you will be outside to protect yourself from the sun., Avoid strenuous work or exercise as much as possible. This is especially important during the warmest part of the day, typically 11am to 3pm.If you do have to work outside, use a buddy system so you are not alone. Take frequent breaks and stay hydrated.Pay close attention to how you feel.


If your heart is pounding and you're short of breath, stop immediately. Go into a cool environment to rest and drink plenty of fluids.
Do not push yourself if you feel like you're becoming overheated. If the heat index is greater than 103F (39.5C), ask about rescheduling nonessential activities for a time when it is not so hot., It’s important to look after others as well as yourself, especially if there are people around you who could be particularly vulnerable to heat-related problems, or may be less able to look after themselves.If you know that a neighbour lives alone and is at risk of health problems from heat (especially where they do not have air conditioning), try to contact family members to come and help.


If that is not possible, your local emergency services might be able to help.
You can ease the burden just by helping someone stay cool and hydrated.
Helping someone reach an air-conditioned place will be beneficial.

, Don’t even do this for a brief periods of time. The temperature inside the vehicle can rise to 120ºF (49ºC) or more within minutes, which is hot enough to kill someone very quickly.Keep an eye on pets as well as family members. Make sure they have enough water and shade.


If you have accidentally locked your child or pet in the car, contact emergency services immediately.


, Keep a close eye on all members of your family and others close to you. Be vigilant and explain to them the importance of taking steps to minimize the effects of heat during a heat wave. One indicator of illness is heat cramps, which are painful spasms in the muscles of the arms, legs, and abdomen. This is most common in people who are dehydrated, sweat a lot, or are not acclimatized to the heat. People who are exercising in heat may also experience heat cramps.Risk factors for heat-related illnesses include strenuous exercise (such as that done by outdoor athletes), lack of acclimatization, poor physical fitness, obesity, and dehydration.

, Heat exhaustion is a serious condition and should be treated as soon as possible. There are a number of symptoms to look out for:Cool, clammy skin with ""goose bumps""
Heavy sweating
Fatigue
Light-headedness or dizziness

Problems with physical coordination
Muscle cramps
Headache
Nausea

, Take the person to a cool, shaded place, preferably indoors in air-conditioning. Give the person cool water or a sports drink to drink. Remove excess clothing.If possible, have the person take a cool shower or apply cool towels to the skin to help cool off.The person should start to feel better in about half an hour and experience no long-term effects.
Without this treatment the person could develop heatstroke, which is much more serious.If the person shows no signs of improvement after 30 minutes, contact the doctor or emergency services, as the heat exhaustion may be progressing to heatstroke., Heatstroke occurs when body temperature becomes dangerously high and, no longer able to cool itself, the body begins to overheat. It is a much more serious condition than heat exhaustion, so it’s important to know the signs and know what to do. Call emergency services if you see the following signs, or if a person has been suffering from heat exhaustion for more than 30 minutes:High fever (104F/40C)
Severe headache
Light-headedness or dizziness
Disorientation or confusion
Irrational behavior
Irritability or emotional instability
Nausea or vomiting
Muscle weakness and cramps
Flushed or red skin
Lack of sweating, dry skin
Rapid heartbeat
Rapid, shallow breathing
Seizures

, If a person near you has symptoms of heatstroke, the first thing you should do is call emergency services. While you wait for the ambulance, you can take the following steps:Move the person to a cool, shaded area
Remove unnecessary clothing
Increasing ventilation by using a fan or opening windows
Giving the person water to drink, but not medication
Shower or immerse their body with cool, but not cold, water that is 59-64°F (15-18°C)
Cover the body with cool, damp sheets or towelsApply ice packs to the groin, armpits, neck, and back

, If you have a cat or dog, it can also be prone to heat exhaustion or even heat stroke. Watch your pet to make sure that it isn't overheating.If you notice that your dog is panting excessively, give it fresh water right away and move it to a cool, shady place.
Drooling is another warning sign of overheating.
Feel your pet's body. If it is breathing more rapidly than usual, or if the heart rate is faster than usual, take your pet indoors right away.
Animals with flat faces, such as pugs and Persian cats, have more trouble breathing and may be more susceptible to overheating.
Paw pads can burn in extreme heat. Use booties or apply a product to your pet's feet to keep them from getting burned on asphalt. If you must walk your pet, try to keep it in grassy areas rather than on roads or sidewalks, which are very hot.
Always keep a supply of fresh water outdoors for your pet, and provide plenty of water indoors as well.

Apply a protective film to windows.,
Adjust your position relative to nearby windows.,
Use sunscreen in sunny indoor areas.,
Purchase a QTemp.",How to Protect Yourself from UV Radiation Indoors1," Ordinary glass blocks ""short wave"" UVB light, but only blocks 50% or less of the more common ""long wave"" UVA light.Add a UV-protective film to any windows that are not specially built to block UV light. This is especially important for windows near areas where you spend a lot of time, at home, at work, or in the car. The film blocks up to 99.9% of all UV radiation. You can install it yourself or hire professionals to do so.You can purchase UV-protective film at home improvement stores or online.
Note that vehicle windshields are UV resistant, but that side and rear windows are often not. Especially if you spend a lot of time in your vehicle during the day, add a UV protective film to these windows as well.;
, People who spend extensive periods of time near an open or unprotected window will experience more rapid aging of the skin on that side of their face. If you like to keep your window open, consider sitting a bit further away, and changing your location relative to the window from time to time., If you know you are exposed to sunlight despite being indoors, it may be worth wearing sunscreen. If you do, make sure you’re wearing broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher.Broad spectrum sunscreen, which is necessary to block both major types of harmful UV radiation, includes some combination of the following ingredients: avobenzone (Parsol 1789), ecamsule, oxybenzone, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide.
Alternatively, you can use a moisturizer for UV protection indoors, as long as it has broad spectrum protection and an SPF of at least 15.

, A QTemp is a small, battery-powered device that reports the amount of UV radiation in your location. It can be used to alert you when an area is especially high in UV radiation, and prompt you to take the necessary steps to protect yourself with broad spectrum sunscreen in those areas.The QTemp device works both indoors and outdoors.

Use tanning beds infrequently, if ever.,
Apply sunscreen to your hands at the nail salon.,
Use skin protection for occupational exposure.,
Don’t sit too close to fluorescent lighting.,
Shield yourself from tungsten halogen lamps.",How to Protect Yourself from UV Radiation Indoors2," While using a tanning bed is not recommended, you can likely do so a few times a year (less than once a month) without adverse effects upon your health. However, more frequent use places you at greater risk of developing skin cancer, in addition to other harmful effects of UV radiation.In short, tanning beds should not be considered a safe way to tan.
If you do occasionally use a tanning bed, wear eye protection designed to be used in this scenario.
For a safer option, use a sun-free tanning lotion.

, The lamps used at nail salons to dry your nails use UV rays to do so. While the amount of radiation and risk of harm is low, it’s worth applying a broad spectrum sunscreen with at least 15 SPF to the back of your hands before getting your nails done., Various industrial and commercial manufacturing equipment requires the use of machinery that exposes the user to UV radiation. Arc welding is a common example, and can cause considerable damage to both your skin and your eyes.In short, if you work with or near UV lamps or other equipment that emit UV radiation, always follow the protocols established by law to prevent injury. These will include wearing both skin protection and eye protection.

, Fluorescent light bulbs, which are commonly used in various indoor environments, emit small amount of UV radiation. While this radiation does not usually cause significant risk, it’s important not to spend time within a foot (30cm) of the bulbs for more than an hour.Though blacklight bulbs do rely on UV light, they do not emit enough radiation to be considered a threat.

, These types of lamps are becoming more popular for a range of different indoor uses. They emit enough UV radiation to cause injury at short distances. Filters will greatly diminish this risk.Note that light bulbs that emit a harmful amount of UV radiation will be labeled with a cautionary warning.

Equip your eyeglasses with UV resistant lenses.,
Wear sunglasses more frequently.,
Wear proper eye protection wherever occupational sources of UV radiation are used.",How to Protect Yourself from UV Radiation Indoors3," If you wear eyeglasses, use lenses that help protect your eyes against UV radiation. While most lenses do so to some degree, some require an added treatment for 100% protection. Next time you get new glasses, ask your optometrist about the best option for UV protection.Note that UV resistant contacts can help, but cannot fully protect your eyes from UV radiation.

, Whenever you are exposed to sunlight for extended periods of time, even while indoors, it's worth wearing sunglasses. The quality of the sunglasses matters substantially. They should meet ANSI UV requirements, meaning that they block at least 99% of UV rays. They may also be labeled “UV absorption up to 400 nm.”If there is not a label regarding UV protection, or if the label says “cosmetic,” the UV protection the sunglasses offer will be partial at best.
Note that the darkness of the lenses does not correspond with the sunglasses ability to deflect UV rays.

, Industry and commercial use of machinery that produces UV radiation can quickly and significantly damage your eyesight. For this reason, businesses and unions have strong, specific regulations about the required protection to use in these environments. Follow these regulations at all times.In particular, goggles (usually built into a face shield) should be used whenever you’re welding.
Whatever the eye wear used at your place of work, it should fit snugly to your face, with no gaps through which UV radiation might reach your eyes.
Protective equipment for these types of uses should be designed specifically for this use. Do not use anything else for this purpose.

Add one liter of clean drinking water.,
Stir well and drink.",How to Make an Oral Rehydration Salts Drink (ORS)1," Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before preparing the drink. Make sure you have a clean pitcher or bottle ready., To make your own ORS solution, you’ll need:


table salt (such as Kosher salt, iodized salt or sea salt)
clean water
granulated or powdered sugar

, Add a half-teaspoon of table salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar into a clean container. You can use granulated or powdered sugar.


If you don't have a teaspoon to measure, you can use a fistful scoop of sugar and a three-finger pinch of salt. But, this is not accurate and is not recommended., If you cannot measure out a liter, add 5 cups of water (each cup is about 200 ml). Only use clean water. The water can be bottled water or recently boiled and cooled water.


Be sure to only use water. Milk, soup, fruit juice or soft drinks cannot be used since they will make the ORS ineffective.Don't add any extra sugar.

, Use a spoon or whisk to mix the ORS powder into the water. After a minute or so of vigorous stirring, the solution should be completely dissolved. Now, it is ready to drink.ORS solution can be refrigerated for 24 hours. Do not store it any longer.

Ask your doctor if you need to take ORS drinks.,
Understand how ORS drinks can prevent severe dehydration.,
Learn how to take ORS drinks.,
Know when to see a doctor if you're suffering from diarrhea.",How to Make an Oral Rehydration Salts Drink (ORS)2," If you have severe diarrhea or vomiting, your body will lose fluids, which can lead to dehydration. If so, you'll notice increased thirst, dry mouth, sleepiness, less frequent urination, dark yellow urine, headache, dry skin, and dizziness. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor. You'll probably be told to start taking ORS drinks if the symptoms aren't severe.


Left untreated, dehydration can become severe. Severe dehydration symptoms include: very dry mouth and skin, very dark yellow or brown urine, loss of skin elasticity, lowered pulse rate, sunken eyes, seizure, generalized body weakness, and even coma. If you or the person you’re caring for show severe dehydration symptoms, get emergency help.

, ORS drinks are designed to replace lost salt content and improve absorption of water by the body. At the first signs of dehydration, you should take ORS. This mainly helps by re-hydrating the body. It is easier to prevent dehydration early on by drinking ORS drinks than to cure it.


Severe dehydration will require hospitalization and intravenous fluid administration. But, if caught early, ORS drinks can be prepared at home to treat mild dehydration.

, Sip ORS drinks throughout the day. You can drink it along with eating meals. If you vomit, take a break from drinking ORS. Wait 10 minutes, then drink the solution again. If you're nursing and treating a baby, you must continue breastfeeding while treating with ORS. You can keep using ORS until diarrhea has stopped. The following tells you how much ORS you must give to:Babies and toddlers: 0.5 liter of ORS drink every 24 hours
Children (2 to 9 years old): 1 liter of ORS drink every 24 hours
Children (more than 10 years old) and adults: 3 liters (0.79 US gal) of ORS drink every 24 hours

, Symptoms should start to disappear a few hours after drinking the ORS solution. You should start urinating more and the urine will start to look light yellow or almost clear. If symptoms do not improve, or if any of the following symptoms begin, get immediate medical help:presence of blood in diarrhea or black, tarry stools
persistent vomiting
high fever
very dehydrated (feeling dizzy, lethargic, sunken eyes, no urination in the past 12 hours)

Administer CPR if necessary.If the person is unconscious or has no pulse, administer CPR.,
Seek immediate medical attention no matter what.Get the individual to a health facility as soon as possible.",How to Prevent Hypothermia," Whether you're an adventurer planning a backpacking trip or you're just planning to spend a pleasant day outside, take time to look at the weather report and decide how to prepare for your time outdoors. Remember that there's a risk of getting hypothermia even in temperatures that seem relatively warm, since wind and wet weather can cause the body temperature to drop.;
, If you're going to be spending the night outside, find out how cold you can expect it to get, and make sure you pack the appropriate clothing and a sleeping bag that will protect you from cold temperatures.


There are sleeping bags that are designed for cooler temperatures — make sure your sleeping bag is adequate for the conditions.

, Sometimes things don't go as planned, and you find yourself outside long after you thought you'd be home. Even if you're just going on a day hike, err on the side of safety and bring along a pack with extra layers, a flashlight, and your cell phone in case you need help. Make sure to sign your name in the trail logbook if there is one, so that park rangers know you're still on the trail and will come looking for you when the park closes.


If you plan to be out of the range of cellphone coverage, consider bringing a personal locator beacon that can call for help via a satellite network in case of an emergency.Make sure you tell at least two other people where you will be and what time you expect to return.

, Layering is a very effective way to protect your body from hypothermia. Don't expect just one layer of clothing to be enough protection from cold air. Wear several layers, and bring along extras just in case you need more.The groin, armpits, head, neck, and sides of chest need extra protection. These lose heat more quickly than other parts of the body.
Layer your socks and gloves as well, to protect your hands and feet from frostbite.
Bring backup layers in case your clothes get wet. If you're packing for an expedition, pack your backup layers in a waterproof plastic bag to keep them dry in case you need them.

, Outdoor enthusiasts have found that a certain combination of fabrics provides the best protection from the cold.Layer One: Wear wicking fabric next to your skin. Wicking fabric is designed to keep moisture away from your skin as you sweat, so your body stays dry. Get a long-sleeved undershirt and long johns made from this type of polyester.
Layer Two: Wear wool or another warm fabric over the base layer. Wool is the best choice for cold weather, since it breathes but provides excellent insulation and is extremely warm.
Layer Three: Wear a waterproof or a windproof layer on top. Determine what type of weather you might encounter and put on one more layer to protect yourself. You might need a windbreaker or rain gear to keep your other layers from getting wet.

, Cotton breathes too much and isn't warm enough to keep you safe from hypothermia. When it gets wet, it can actually leave you worse off, since it's slow to dry and holds moisture against your body. Experts know that cotton is the worst fabric to wear in the cold.Leave your jeans and flannels at home and reach for more effective fabrics to keep you safe in the outdoors.

, Moisture is your worst enemy when it comes to protecting yourself from hypothermia. Avoid tromping through wet areas unless you're wearing waterproof shoes and waterproof covers for the bottom of your legs to keep your feet and legs dry. If you're worried about hypothermia, try not to overexert yourself and work up a sweat, since even the moisture you produce while sweating can be dangerous when the temperature drops and your body gets cold again.Note that if you will be home in a few hours, it is okay to work up a sweat. This can increase your metabolism and help you to keep warm in the short-term. The problem is in the long-term (such as if you are staying in the outdoors overnight), because when you stop working so hard your sweat will turn cold and actually drop your body temperature.

, If it starts to rain and you have the chance to avoid getting wet, take shelter where you can. Stay inside until the downfall is over if at all possible.After a storm or rainfall, change out of wet clothing and into dry clothing right away. Sometimes it's impossible to avoid getting wet, but that means you need to get dry as soon as possible. Hopefully you brought some backup clothes you can put on to keep dry.

, Wind can be as dangerous as rain in cold weather, since it blows cold air through your clothes and brings down your body temperature faster than still air. This is especially dangerous if you're also damp from sweat or rain. A good windbreaker will help, but high winds can still penetrate your layers.If things start to get gusty, take shelter, even if it's just in a stand of tall trees. See if you can wait out the windy weather and keep walking when the air is more still.
If you want to keep moving, try staying close to the trees or mountainside so that you don't have wind blowing you from both directions.

, If you feel you are at risk of hypothermia, it's important to turn around right away.


Don’t let your drive to reach the top of the mountain make you keep going if you’re wet and cold. Don’t ignore shivering and other early signs of hypothermia.

, If you believe that you or someone you know has hypothermia, take action right away instead of waiting. Look for the following symptoms of hypothermia:Moderate hypothermia:

Shivering
Dizziness
Hunger
Nausea
Faster breathing
Trouble speaking
Slight confusion
Lack of coordination
Fatigue
Increased heart rate


Severe hypothermia:

Shivering — though as hypothermia worsens, shivering stops
Clumsiness or lack of coordination
Slurred speech or mumbling
Confusion and poor decision-making, such as trying to remove warm clothes
Drowsiness or very low energy
Lack of concern about one's condition
Progressive loss of consciousness
Weak pulse
Slow, shallow breathing


Hypothermia in infants:

Bright red skin
Low energy
A weak cry



, Helping the person's body temperature warm to a safe level is the most important step in treating hypothermia. Do whatever it takes to warm the person up, including the following:


Get to a warm place. If you don't have access to a heated facility, go to a sheltered spot to wait for help. Make sure it's out of the wind and rain.
Remove wet clothing.Take off wet clothes and wrap the person in dry, warm fabrics or clothing. Note that no clothing (or underwear only) is preferable to keeping on wet clothing of any sort. If you or another person in the group has dry clothing they can lend to the person who is cold and potentially hypothermic, now is the time to offer it.
Give the person warm beverages. Warm (not hot) tea, soup or even water will help. Note that keeping the beverages warm and not hot is key as you don't want to shock their body with the profound difference in temperature. Do not give the person alcohol, since this will actually drop the person's core body temperature, despite popular belief.Place external heat on the person's body, particularly in the areas of their groin, under their armpits, or on their abdomen (as these areas take up heat the fastest). Hot water bottles or chemical heating pads can do the trick.As a last resort, you can do skin-to-skin contact between you or a group member and the person suffering of hypothermia. This is generally not the most efficient way to re-heat someone, but if for some reason they are the only cold person it can work as a last resort until further help arrives. Make sure you have called for emergency medical help by this point., If you aren't familiar with how to administer CPR properly, find someone else who is certified to do so and call emergency services.


Once you regain the person's pulse and breathing and CPR is no longer necessary, continue making sure the person is warm and comfortable until help arrives.If you are unable to regain their pulse and/or breathing, continue with CPR until medical help arrives. In you are in a remote location, with no assistance arriving, the general rule is to stop CPR after 30 minutes with no response to the efforts., You may call emergency services if you can't reach a hospital. Even if the person warms up and seems fine, it's important to get him or her to a doctor. Hypothermia can cause complications that aren't immediately apparent. The person may also have frostbite or other issues caused by cold exposure. Get medical attention as soon as possible.

In your documentation, include specific such as the nature of the incident, the employees/people involved, when the incident occurred, and the consequences. Even if the report is not placed in employee's file, proper documentation necessary to have objective, unemotional assessments of the employee's behavior.;
, Evaluating their behavior will help you to gather evidence and document their behavior for use in implementing a disciplinary plan. When reviewing behavior, ask yourself several questions:


Observations should be factual, not subjective. For example, don't use a term like ""rude behavior"", use ""x"" yelled, cursed, interrupted, walked away, etc.
""Aggressive"" is another subjective term that is not useful in an assessment.
Finally, the manager probably doesn't know whether the employee has a personal problem or not until after the meeting.

, Employees should be corrected or disciplined when they break policy or fail to reach production standards, not because of attitude or style. Document the specific policy violated and how exactly the employee's actions violated it.

, After you’ve evaluated the behavior and have decided to proceed, you’ll begin by documenting and logging their behavior. Logging the behavior will provide you with evidence to present to higher management and to the employee if your disciplinary plan is questioned. Make sure to:


Include times and dates.
Include locations.
Include a detailed description of each incident and who reported/witnessed it. , The first step you’ll have to take will be to schedule a meeting with the employee in question. This will provide you with the opportunity to troubleshoot issues with your subordinate and to determine if there is a larger problem going on.


Approach your employee in person and tell them you need to speak to them.
Avoid specifics. Don't say ""I need to talk to you because your behavior is horrible lately.""
Speak calmly and clearly, leaving no doubt that the meeting is not optional.
Avoid informing your employee where others can hear you.
If for some reason you feel uncomfortable or threatened by the person in question, this is a different matter. In this case, the meeting should be handled by human resources., After you've called a meeting with the employee, it will be time for you to voice your concerns. Make sure you do so properly. When talking with your subordinate:


Detail the circumstances that caused the complaint without making a judgement and ask employee to confirm or explain the instance.
Confirm that the actions violate company policy and that employee is aware of the violation.
Be specific about what the problem is and how they should correct it., After you've voiced your concerns, you will need to allow your employee to explain himself or herself. This is an important part, as you really need both sides of the story before making any decisions or moving further through the disciplinary process.


Make sure to listen to what the employee has to say before passing judgment.
Never assume the employee is a bad person. This will cloud your judgment of the incident.
Do not pry into personal problems. If your employee starts to explain personal problems and suggests they are the root of their problem, hear them out, but do not pry.
If you think your employee has explained himself or herself well enough, you can tell them, ""I understand the situation now. I appreciate your information. If the circumstance arises again, please call me before it becomes a problem.""

, If the employee doesn't have a justifiable reason for his action, changes and disciplinary action are necessary. Use the following process to resolve the problem:


Make sure that the employee takes responsibility for his or her mistake and understands that their actions were unacceptable.
Ask that the employee assure you that they are willing to change their behavior.
Give them a detailed explanation of the standard of behavior expected from this point on.
Finally, list consequences if the employee commits another violation of company policy.

, Contact the HR department if your company is large enough to have one. It may be tempting to ask other employees for input, but involving other people besides the perpetrator, the complainants, and the supervisor can make a mountain out of mole hill through gossip.


Consult the individual’s employment records for information about previous problems with supervisors.
If the person worked under another supervisor at your company, contact that supervisor.
Do not divulge specific behavior to previous supervisors. Simply indicate that you are experiencing a problem with them and inquiry if they had the same experience., After you’ve formally documented and evaluated the insubordinate employee’s behavior, you should review company policy for specifics about the employee disciplinary policy. This is important, because without reviewing company disciplinary policy, you won’t know the exact steps you need to take to discipline the employee. Make sure to:


Look at the employee manual (issued to each new employee) and review the employee disciplinary process as outlined in the manual. Reviewing the policy outlined in the employee manual or handbook will verify that the employee should know how discipline is dealt out.
Consult your direct supervisor and let them know that you are about to begin disciplinary action.
Consider your actions very carefully before proceeding, as an uncalled for disciplinary plan can open the company up to litigation and you to scrutiny from management., Your company’s human resource department is designed to provide employees and management with support and guidance. As a result, you should be in constant contact with HR through the disciplinary process.


Depending on your company’s policy, an HR representative may need to be present at all formal steps of the disciplinary process.
Depending on your company’s policy, the disciplinary process may need to be implemented through HR.
If your company does not have a Human Resources Professional, you may want to discuss a plan of action with your immediate supervisor or a Human Resources Consultant., Based on your documentation, evaluation, and company guidelines, you should establish a plan of disciplinary action. Most company employee manuals use a version of a progressive disciplinary plan for addressing employee behavior or performance issues. Typical disciplinary plans include the following:


Verbal discussion and warning.
Written warning (up to three occurrences, depending on supervisor’s discretion).
Termination., After you’ve established a plan of action, you need to implement it. Implementations will begin with the first steps outlined in your plan.


If this is the first time the employee has been disciplined, you may start with a verbal discussion and warning. The purpose of a verbal warning is to let the employee know that they are doing something that is not acceptable in the workplace. It's also an opportunity to resolve the situation.
If this is the second time the employee has been disciplined, you will move on to a formal and written warning letter. In the warning letter, provide a short review of the past discussion and verbal warning. Then, clearly state the specific behavior or action leading to the written warning along with the date it occurred.
If this is the third time (or more) the employee has been disciplined, you may move toward termination. If the employee's behavior has not improved after two (or more) warnings, termination should be considered."
"
Make a clear and concise statement.,
Give your employer at least two weeks.,
Avoid stating your reasons behind quitting.This is especially true if your reasons are somewhat volatile in nature, but even if you are leaving the company on peaceful terms, you should still avoid stating those terms in your official notice.,
Be both formal and friendly.,
Set a positive tone.,
Thank your employer.,
Let your employer know that you intend to finish any major projects.,
Offer your post-resignation support.,
Close on a complimentary note.,
Write a letter, not an e-mail.,
Type the date in the upper left corner.,
Consider including an inside address.,
Address your employer directly in the salutation.,
Write the body of your notice.,
Use a warm closing.,
Type and sign your name.,
Take your two weeks notice directly to your boss.,
Submit copies to anyone else who may need one.,
Work hard and tie up loose ends.",How to Write a Two Weeks Notice," The first line of your two weeks notice should clearly state that you are resigning from your position at the end of a two week period. Do not use wording that could suggest you would be willing to stay longer or change your mind with the right counteroffer.Good example: ""This letter serves as an official notice of my resignation from as , effective on .""
Good example: ""I hereby resign as at , effective , two weeks from .
Bad example: ""I would like to quit from my position as . Please let me know what time frame would be most convenient for you.""
Bad example: ""If all goes as I expect, I intend to resign from my position with the company two weeks from now.""

, Nowadays, many employees are not contractually required to submit a resignation two weeks in advance, but doing so is still considered to be a professional courtesy.


If you quit sooner than two weeks, future or prospective employers may wonder if you would do the same to them.
If your company is currently entering an especially busy period, you may want to consider giving a “four weeks notice” instead of only giving two.
Senior executives and other employees further up the food chain should consider giving more than two weeks, as well. As a general rule, provide an amount of time equal to the amount of vacation time allotted to your position. For instance, if your position grants you three weeks of vacation, give a ""three weeks notice"" instead.

,


You should, however, state these reasons if directly asked to include them.
You should also prepare a reason to share when your supervisors and co-workers inevitably ask why you plan to quit. This reason does not need to be included in your official letter, but it is still practical to have when asked in person.

, The overall tone of your two weeks notice should be professional, but not so professional that you come across as being cold or stiff. Typically, you should write the letter using the friendliest tone you have used with your employer in the past.


If communications with your boss have always followed a rigid, professional structure, then continue that tone into your two weeks notice. On the other hand, if you communicate with your boss in a more personal manner, do not be afraid to take a more personal tone. A personal tone can be appropriate as long as it is not casual and sloppy.
Good example: “I am very thankful for the experience and growth working for you has afforded me.”
Bad example: “I formally state, for the record, that I continue to maintain high regard for ABC Company and hold no ill intent toward any employer or employee at the company.”
Bad example: “Thanks 4 everything!”

, This letter will be the last document in your personnel folder, so it needs to leave a good impression. Even if you hate the job you are quitting and want nothing to do with anyone at the company ever again, you still need to leave the bridge intact instead of burning it down.


If a future prospective employer calls your former employer, hearing that you left a positive two weeks notice will make you look good. It is also beneficial in case the employee at your old company responsible for pulling your file knows nothing else about you.
Never trash anyone at the company or criticize the way the company is run in your two weeks notice.

, Include a line or two thanking your employer for providing the opportunities and experiences you received by working for the company. Each job contributes something to a person's life, even if the cons largely outweigh the pros.


If your working experience was mostly positive, make sure that your gratitude shows. Write something along the lines of, “I cannot even begin to thank you enough for the past three years. I have learned more than I ever expected and appreciate your generosity and patience.""
If your working experience was mostly negative, offer a general token of gratitude. Try something along the lines of, “I would also like to thank you for providing me with the experience I received over the past three years of employment.”

, As a final act of responsibility and loyalty, you should note any pending projects or current projects that could collapse without your assistance and pledge that you will finish those projects instead of leaving the company in a lurch.


Ongoing projects and minor projects that can be handled easily by someone else can be excluded from this.
This leaves your employer with a good impression, thereby making it more likely that he or she will be willing to provide a good recommendation to another employer in the future when asked.

, As the company transitions into a different work flow after you leave, there are bound to be a few rocky patches. In your two weeks notice, offer to help the company make the transition even after your employment with them ends.


Provide a phone number and/or e-mail address that the company can use to contact you if any questions come up.

, Even if you already thanked your employer earlier in the notice, it is a wise idea to close the body of your letter by restating your gratitude.


Example: “I will always be thankful to you and the staff of ABC company for all that you have done for me.""

, When submitting your two weeks notice, you should write it as an actual typed and printed letter rather than an e-mail. This letter should be handed over to your boss in person.


While writing an e-mail may seem easier and quicker, it is generally considered less professional and will usually be frowned upon.
Do not mail your two weeks notice through the postal system or through your office mail system. Doing so may cause a delay, and by the time your employer gets your notice, your two weeks may already be halfway finished.

, Per standard rules for writing a formal letter, you should type the date in month-day-year format in the upper left corner of the page. The month should be spelled out, but the day and year should be in numerical format.


Example: June 26, 2013
Note that you do not usually need to include a return address above the date since your address would be the same as your employer's address. You can, however, use company letterhead with the address on it if you choose to.

, If you are using company letterhead, you may opt to skip the inside recipient's address, as well, since this is a letter sent from within a single company. Including the address is a good idea, however, since it allows you to address the letter specifically to your boss.


Include your employer's personal title and full name on the first line.
Write the street address on the following line and the city, state, and zip code on the line after that.
Skip a line in between the date and the inside address. Skip another line in between the inside address and the salutation that follows it. The address itself should be single-spaced, though.

, Your letter should open with “Dear (boss's name),” and you should never use a vague or general salutation like “To Whom It May Concern.”


You should also address your boss in the same way you usually do, even if that method is fairly casual. For instance, if you are on a first name basis with your boss, write “Dear Jennifer.” If you are only on a professional, last name basis with your boss, stick with “Dear Ms. Smith.”

, Skip a line after your salutation before you begin writing the body of your letter according to the guidelines provided in this article.


Each body paragraph should be single-spaced, but there should be a blank line in between each separate paragraph. None of the paragraphs need to be indented, either.
Keep your letter down to a single page at maximum.

, In order to maintain a friendly, positive tone, you need to offer a closing that seems a little warmer and more sincere than the usually “Regards,” “Thanks,” or “Sincerely.”


A few examples of possible closings include:

Warmest possible regards
Best wishes for your continued success
Warmest thanks for everything through now
With sincerest gratitude and warmest wishes



, Type your full name four lines below your closing and sign your name in between the closing and the type name.

, The most professional move to make is to hand your two weeks notice to your boss first and in person.You will usually need to schedule a meeting, but if you work at a small company and are on close terms with your boss, you might be able to drop by his or her office unannounced.
Close the door behind you as you enter to keep the conversation private.
Hand your boss your two weeks notice and explain, as you hand it over, what the letter is.
Your boss will likely want to discuss the situation with you. Even if your letter already answers the questions posed to you, answer each question completely.
Thank your boss as you leave the office and shake hands.

, This can vary by company, but usually, the Human Resources department will need a copy as well as any other supervisors you work under.


Co-workers, mentors, team members, and clients should be told in person about your resignation. They do not need an official copy of your two weeks notice.

, If you offered to finish up any major projects before leaving when you wrote your letter, you need to follow through and finish those projects.


Even if you did not make any promises, you cannot slack off during your final two weeks of employment. The transition will be difficult for everyone, and it is your professional duty to make that transition as smooth as possible for the employer you are leaving.
On the other hand, if you suspect that your company is treating you unfairly because you announced your resignation, do not let them take advantage of you or drive you crazy with inhumane amounts of extra work.

Sign the letter.",How to Write a Leave of Absence Letter," When requesting a leave of absence from your employer, it is important to give an early warning. Giving an early warning may, of course, not be possible in certain circumstances, such as the unexpected loss of a loved one. However, if giving an early warning is possible (e.g. the leave you are seeking is several weeks or months away), then try to write the letter as early as possible so that your employer and team members at work can plan accordingly.A good way of giving an early warning may be to discuss the proposed leave of absence with your boss before delivering your leave of absence letter. This way your first sentence can refer to your previous discussion and the letter does not come to your boss as a surprise.;
, State the exact dates that you plan to be away. Try not to be vague about the amount of time that you need to be away. In some cases, it may not be possible to be specific about dates, but being specific about dates will help your employer and colleagues plan ahead about how they will handle your work in your absence. Therefore, if at all possible, try to be as specific as you can in your letter about the dates that you plan to spend away from work.

, Be as transparent as you possibly can about why you need time off. That does not mean you should reveal every minor detail about why you need to be away. In many cases, your employer may not have a right to know certain details about your personal life. However, being as transparent and honest as you can with your employer about why you need time off will minimize the possibility of conflicts with management., Your letter should state that you are aware of your responsibilities and understand that before you leave, you would like to discuss how your work would be taken care of in your absence. You may include in your letter details about how you think your work will be taken care of (e.g. by leaving detailed notes for your team members on current projects that will be due during your absence, leaving contact information so that team members can reach you in an emergency)., Know that you are legally entitled to certain types of absences. It is important to differentiate between those absences that you are entitled to and those absences that may only be granted at the employer’s discretion.


In the United States, you are entitled, for example, to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for the birth and care of a baby or for the adoption of a child under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Determine if you meet the eligibility requirements under the Act. These requirements include that you have worked for your employer for at least 12 months prior to the start of your leave and have worked at least 1250 hours in that 12 month period. Your employer must also employ at least 50 employees at your place of work or at a location within 75 miles of that location, and your employer must be a ""covered employer"" under the terms of the Act.If you are writing a letter requesting an absence to which you are legally entitled, you can phrase the request accordingly. You can write, for example, “As we both know, I have the legal right to take this time off. I am hoping to take time off between (enter dates). How can we see to it that productivity continues?”Moreover, asking your employer how productivity can be maintained shows a concern for your employer’s well-being and can enhance your standing at your workplace.If you are asking for time off that is not contractually owed to you, adjust your tone to be apologetic for the inconvenience and promise to make up the lost time to the best of your abilities.
Let your boss know if you have any accrued vacation time or sick days.
Including this information in the letter will also make things clearer for the chain of command in the Human Resources department if your boss chooses to deny your request and you have to appeal the decision.

, Although your boss will likely have final say on this, try to give helpful suggestions on which of your coworkers you think would be best suited to cover various aspects of your job in your absence. Try not to put all the burden on one person’s shoulders, however, as that would be unfair to that particular colleague.

, Whatever the circumstances, it is important that you request a leave of absence politely. You should, in other words, request rather than demand an absence, even if you are legally entitled to it. Asking nicely can minimize confrontation with management., Students seeking a leave of absence from their university are generally required to fill out a form. Download a leave of absence form provided by your university department on its website. These forms should also be available at your departmental office.

, The form will ask such information as your name, university ID number, university and permanent addresses, and degree program.The form will likely ask your citizenship or visa status. Leaves of absences can have visa implications for international students. This is so because if you are an international student, you have been granted a visa in order to study. If you withdraw from your studies for an extended period of time, you may be asked to return to your home country and may have to re-apply for a visa in order to return. Find out what the visa implications might be of a leave of absence if you are an international student studying on a student visa. These policies may vary by country and are set by the relevant department of state.
At U.S. universities, the form will also ask you if you are receiving federal financial aid. If you are a student in the U.S. receiving federal financial aid, you are generally required to attend university in order to receive financial aid. A leave of absence may affect your federal aid eligibility, so it is important to contact your financial aid office and speak to a financial aid advisor for advice on how best to proceed with your leave of absence request.

, The leave of absence request should generally be accompanied by supporting documents that your university will need in order to approve your request. If you are requesting military leave, you will have to attach your military orders. If you are requesting leave for medical reasons, you will have to attach a letter written by your doctor or health-care provider. If, however, you are requesting leave for personal reasons, you will have to write a leave of absence letter explaining the circumstances and reasons for your request., If your absence request is for personal reasons, it is important to be as transparent as possible with your department, so that your department can determine if your particular situation qualifies you for leave.

, You might, for example, be a research student requesting leave to complete your research project away from your campus at a remote location. Advanced PhD students are normally entitled to such leaves. They must, however, discuss their plans with their faculty advisors before the leave is granted, so that the advisor can certify to the department that you (the student) are likely to meet your research goals. Specify in your leave of absence letter any work that you intend to complete while away.

, It may seem unnecessary to include your own address if you work in the same building as your employer, but doing so will ensure that the letter is returned to the correct address should the Post Office fail to deliver it, and your Human Resources department will find it easier to file your letter if your address is written on it.

, Often, writers date the letter when they begin it, but if you work on the letter over the course of several days, remember to change the date to the day the letter is completed and signed.

, Include the name of the specific addressee, including their personal title (e.g. Dr. Rogers, Prof. Smith).

, Even if you know your boss well, address her formally, with her professional or personal title followed by her last name.

, A popular formal style is the block style,which follows the following conventions:


Paragraphs should be single spaced.
Lines should be left-aligned.
Instead of indenting to begin a paragraph, all lines should begin on the left margin.
Leave a blank line to indicate paragraph breaks.
An example of the block style is available here.

,


Leave a blank line between the previous body paragraph and the ""Sincerely.""
Leave four blank lines between the ""Sincerely"" and your type-written name.

, Once you have printed the letter, sign your name in ink in the space provided by the four blank lines.

The notice will include the reason or reasons your claim was denied, as well as information on how long you have to appeal that determination and the process for doing so.Take note of the deadline for filing an appeal, and don't delay in requesting one. Depending on the state in which you filed your claim, you may have anywhere from 10 to 30 days from the date on your determination notice.;
, An appeal request form may have been included with your notice, or you can simply write a letter to the address listed on the notice.


If your notice doesn't include a form, type or write legibly a letter indicating that you want to appeal the determination. It doesn't need to be lengthy – you can simply write ""I want a hearing to appeal the denial of my claim for unemployment benefits."" Include your name, address, and phone number, as well as your Social Security number or any other account or file number listed on your determination notice.Sign and date your letter, and make at least one copy of it for your records before you mail it. Your determination notice may list a specific address to use to request an appeal; otherwise, you typically can use the address from which the determination notice was sent., After your appeal request is processed, you typically will receive written confirmation and a scheduled date and time for your hearing.


If you know you won't be able to attend the hearing on the date scheduled, send a written request for the hearing to be postponed. You should make this request as soon as possible – there typically is a deadline after which you cannot request the hearing be rescheduled unless there is an emergency., An experienced employment lawyer can help guide you through the appeals process.


The laws and administrative regulations that govern unemployment benefits can be extremely complex and confusing. An attorney who specializes in this area of law may be your greatest asset, particularly if the circumstances surrounding your termination are in dispute.
Keep in mind that your former employer most likely has a lawyer – if not a whole team of lawyers – working on its side to prove you're not eligible for benefits.
Attorneys who represent workers at unemployment hearings understand that their clients have just lost their jobs and may be under tremendous financial stress. Many of these attorneys have sliding-fee scales based on your ability to pay.
You also may be eligible for free or reduced-fee services from your local legal aid office, or from law school clinics. A nationwide directory of free legal aid services is available at http://www.lawhelp.org/find-help.

, Don't stop filing a claim each week just because you were denied, even though you probably will continue to receive denials.


If you win your appeal, your back benefits will only cover the weeks in which you were otherwise eligible and filed a claim for benefits., You must find legal justification for your argument that the state was incorrect in denying you unemployment benefits.


Keep in mind that whether you quit or were fired typically determines who has the burden of proving your eligibility (or ineligibility) for benefits.This hinges on who has control of the primary information – if you quit, you're the one who best knows your reasons for quitting; similarly, if your boss fired you, he or she is the one with the information.
Generally, you are eligible for unemployment benefits if you lost your job through no fault of your own. In some cases this means you may be eligible for unemployment benefits even if you quit your job. However, if you quit you must show that you would have suffered some sort of harm or injury if you had stayed.The judge will look at the reasons you quit using what the law calls a ""reasonable person"" standard. Essentially, you're entitled to unemployment benefits if any reasonable person standing in your shoes would have made the same decision.Reasonable causes for quitting may include harassment or discrimination, a substantial reduction in hours, or working conditions that are so unsafe or unsanitary that they present an immediate risk to your health. Your state's statute or regulations may include specific reasons that are recognized as reasonable causes.If you were fired, you're not entitled to unemployment benefits if your employer fired you for good cause.Typically, this means you were fired because of some misconduct on your part. However, even if you violated a written policy of your employer, you may still be able to convince the judge you're entitled to benefits if you can prove that you violated the policy for a good reason.
Written policies are key for your former employer – he or she must be able to show the judge that you knew about the rule and broke it anyway. If the rules weren't presented to you in writing before the events took place that led to your termination, your former employer can't prove to the judge that you had any knowledge of the rule or that what you were doing was wrong and could lead to termination.
You also may be eligible for unemployment benefits even if you were terminated for good cause, if the judge decides that your conduct was so minor it didn't rise to the level of termination, or if it was an unintentional mistake on your part., You can use any documents you have, such as performance reviews or emails from your boss, to back up your argument.


Your employee handbook also may support the fact that you are eligible for benefits.For example, suppose you were fired for not showing up to work on time. If the employee handbook states all employees must receive two warning notices before they are terminated for tardiness, and you only received one notice, both the warning notice you received and the employee handbook would be evidence supporting your eligibility, because they would show that your employer didn't follow its own policy in terminating your employment.

, In some states, you must send whatever documents you plan to introduce in the hearing to the judge and your former employer before the hearing date.


If you aren't required to submit your evidence, make sure you have at least two copies of any documents you plan to reference in the hearing – one for your former employer and one for the judge.Typically if your hearing will be conducted over the telephone, you must send in any documents you plan to reference so everyone will have the documents to look at while you talk about them. Your former employer must submit any documents it plans to use as well., Write detailed notes to reference at the hearing so you can keep your statements organized.


Creating an outline will allow you to stay focused during the hearing and make sure you tell the judge everything he or she needs to know. Keep in mind that although you can appeal the judge's decision if he denies your claim, you probably won't be allowed to introduce new facts or evidence in that second appeal.If you quit, think about all your reasons for doing so, and how they fit into the law. If your reasons for quitting fall within one of the exceptions to the general rule that employees who quit work voluntarily are not eligible for unemployment reasons, think about how you can prove those reasons. Generally you need more than just your word.Organize your evidence according to the points of your argument that it supports.
You also might consider practicing your speech to the judge in front of friends or family members.They can tell you if something doesn't make sense or if one of your points is confusing.

, Former co-workers with first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of your termination may be able to testify on your behalf.


Since often the evidence at the hearing amounts to little more than your word against your boss's, a former co-worker who can corroborate your side of the story can be the difference between winning and losing your case.If your former co-workers are still employed by the company that let you go, they may be unwilling to take your side against the company. Some states allow you to subpoena witnesses, which requires them to appear.Check with the unemployment office to find out if you have the ability to do this, and what your deadline is for requesting subpoenas be issued.

, While you're preparing for your hearing, conduct yourself as if you were already getting benefits.


Read the requirements for maintaining benefits. Typically you're required to apply for a certain number of jobs per week, and to be able and available to start work.Keep a detailed record of the places where you've applied to work, the position to which you applied, and any other relevant details such as the date you applied, the date you followed up, and whether an interview was scheduled.Treat your search for work as though it's your job.

, Your hearing may be held in a physical location, or it may take place over the telephone.


You must show up at your hearing if you want to win your case. If you appealed and you don't show up, the appeal will be dismissed and you may not have another opportunity to file an appeal.On the other hand, if your former employer doesn't show up, the judge typically will still hold the hearing, but the odds are in your favor. If you were fired, your former employer must prove that you were fired for just cause – and it can't meet that burden if it's not there. However, if you quit, you still have the burden of proving to the judge that you quit for work-related reasons recognized by your state's law, regardless of whether your employer is there.If your hearing is in a physical location, such as the unemployment office, try to arrive a few minutes before the time your hearing is scheduled so you have an opportunity to organize your documents and prepare for the hearing. Dress in clean, professional clothing and treat the staff in the office with respect and courtesy.If your hearing is over the phone, prepare the documents you'll need before the time you're scheduled to call in, and make sure your phone is adequately charged. Set yourself up in a quiet room where you won't be interrupted and there won't be a lot of background noise. Once the call starts, stay in one place rather than pacing around – you want to avoid the possibility that your phone will lose signal.
The judge typically will begin the hearing by explaining the process of the hearing and the rules of conduct that will be observed during the hearing.Pay close attention and make sure you understand the rules. If the judge says anything that you don't understand, you can ask for clarification, but wait until the judge asks if there are any questions – don't interrupt.
After the judge's introduction, both you and your former employer will be sworn in. Anything you say during the hearing is said under oath, and must be the truth to the best of your knowledge.If you're asked a question and you don't know the answer, you can ask for the question to be clarified or restated, or you can simply say you don't know – but don't simply make something up for the sake of having an answer.

, Whether you present your case before or after your former employer may depend on whether you quit your job or were fired.At the hearing, you will have an opportunity to tell the judge your side of the story.Speak clearly, and stick to the facts as you make your presentation. You can use your notes to stay on track. Try to remain calm and avoid emotional outbursts or personal attacks on your supervisors or other company representatives.
If you have witnesses, you may call them and ask them questions. Keep in mind that your former employer also will have the opportunity to question them once you've finished.After you've made your statement and presented your evidence to the judge, your former employer will have an opportunity to ask you questions based on anything you said or introduced., The judge will ask questions to determine your eligibility for benefits.


You can ask the judge for clarification if you don't understand what he or she asked, or if you want to understand more about why a certain question was asked. However, don't try to argue with the judge, and remember that you are under oath – avoid making untrue statements or inventing excuses for your behavior, as this can only hurt your case.The judge may ask you questions about your job search. Have your records handy so you can describe the efforts you've made in detail.You also should be prepared to answer questions about your work history, your education, your employment with the company, and the events leading up to your termination. To the extent possible, try to present yourself as an honest, hard-working employee.

, Your former employer will have an opportunity to discuss the reasons you should be denied benefits.


Don't argue or interrupt during this testimony. Remain calm, and make a note of anything your former employer says if you disagree with it or want to ask them further questions about it.If your former employer calls any witnesses, you also can ask them questions. Pay attention to both the questions asked and the way the witness answers them. Take notes regarding anything you wish to bring up in your cross-examination.When your former employer finishes giving his or her statement and presenting evidence, you will have the opportunity to cross-examine him or her. This means you can ask questions related to anything your former employer brought up.Try to avoid taking an argumentative or accusatory tone.
Keep in mind that you don't have to cross-examine your former employer, or any of his or her witnesses, if you don't want to do so. If you feel uncomfortable or are worried you'll lose your cool, it's okay to pass.If you do decide to cross-examine your former employer or other witnesses, avoid asking questions to which you don't know the answer.
If your former employer said something you know is a lie, try to find documentary evidence to confront him or her. For example, if your former employer states you were fired for violating a company policy, and the company policy was never included in your employee handbook, you can present your employee handbook to your former employer and ask her to point to the policy in that handbook. She will be forced to admit the policy was never written down, at which point she'll have difficulty proving that you knew about the policy.

, The judge makes his ruling soon after the hearing and written notice will be sent to you.


If the judge rules against you, the notice typically will tell you what you must do to appeal that ruling. As with your initial appeal, you only have a brief period of time to appeal the decision – usually a week or so. Keep in mind that if the judge rules in your favor, your employer also has the right to appeal the decision."

Decide whether it's an issue worth sharing.,
Avoid discussing personal problems that are not related to work.,
Ask for a leave of absence if necessary.,
Discuss any issues hurting your work relationship or environment.",How to Share a Personal Problem With Your Boss1," It's natural to want to vent, but work is not the place for this. Don't share simply because you are having a hard time personally. Sharing personal information should be reserved for when the problem is going to affect your work. Sometimes this sort of sharing can even help build better work relationships. Some examples of things appropriate to share include:Pregnancy.
An illness that will affect your ability to work.
A family problem involving children, parents, or spouse, that might affect your work schedule or ability to work.
If it's something you're not comfortable talking about, like a health issue, be vague but offer verification for your problem from a doctor.;
, This can change how your boss looks at you and make for an awkward relationship moving forward. Also, remember that your boss is your employer and not your friend.

Leave problems with partners or significant others at home.
Don't talk about financial problems.
Don't talk about parenting problems, like a kid who keeps getting in trouble with the law.
Troubles with your car or house.

, If your problems are of a serious medical nature (whether physical or emotional), you could discuss temporary disability or a temporary leave of absence if your company allows for it. Sometimes, it is better to ask for leave than it is to tell your boss your entire life story and all your assorted dramas.


Find out if working from home is a possible temporary solution.
Know your rights. According to the Family and Medical Leave Act, a variety of experiences like a sick spouse, child-birth, and illness entitle you to a period of unpaid, job protected leave., Sometimes your work place or personal problem can be due to something happening at work. There can be tension and misunderstandings, or outright inappropriate behavior that is hurting your relationship. Some issues can include:


Your boss being mean or rude to you.
Someone in the workplace making unwanted physical contact.
Unfair work expectations that are causing emotional problems.
If your company has an HR department, you can discuss with them issues that might make you nervous to discuss with boss.

Limit yourself to 30 minutes of conversation.,
Anticipate a possible response.",How to Share a Personal Problem With Your Boss2," Timing can be sensitive in issues like this. You don't want to let it fester and linger, particularly if it's a looming problem. However, you also don't want to just bust into your boss's office first thing in the morning to pour your heart out. Choose a time when you know your boss will be less busy and when they are sure to be alone.


Choose a time when you think your boss might be a in good and talkative mood. It's tough to really know what sort of mood they are in. But, an obvious time to avoid would be with deadlines looming and a stack of pile work on their desk., You don't want to have this talk at the water cooler, or on the way into the building in the morning. Do it in your boss's office and not your cubicle where other people may hear it. Even better, try to get out of the office completely. Choose a neutral location like a coffee shop, or a small diner down the road.This can help you avoid office gossip and keep things professional at a public lunch meeting. Being in public also might stop you from gushing or crying if the impulse strikes you.When possible, always do a talk like this in person. Don't do it over e-mail or over the phone, even if this makes you feel more comfortable.

, Since the talk may be hard and full of emotion, you don't want to find yourself stumbling for words. Know what you're going to say before you go into the meeting.Treat it like a work presentation. Rehearse what you're going to say, and prepare for possible responses and questions.
Give them ideas for how to make the problem better. Don't make your boss be the only one that has to come up with a solution on the spot. Show your boss that you've thought about the issue hard and you've already brainstormed potential solutions.
Know your objective. If you need time off, make sure this is clear in your talk. If you are just giving your boss a heads up for your performance issues, make this clear as well without making it sound like an excuse.

, When you make the decision to share a personal problem with your boss, you need to be sure that you refrain from causing a scene or displaying unnecessary emotions. Word travels fast around an office, so if you want to keep your private issues private, you need to be calm when discussing the problem.


Talk slowly and breathe deeply. Try to not feel embarrassed and be confident about you're saying.

, It is perfectly okay to express yourself and your problems, but you don't need to put the boss in the unfortunate position of advising you about what to do in a personal matter. Remember, this person is your boss, not your closest friend. Keep your professionalism in check.

, Keep a close eye on your watch and be sure to stop yourself short if you get close to the 30-minute mark. You don't need to express the history of your life. Just express the issues you're confronting.


Be honest and brief with the talk. Ask if they need anymore information about what you're talking about.
After talking, let the matter rest. After discussing your problem with the boss, you should not discuss it again for a while. Give yourself and your employer time to digest the matter. Do not expect an immediate response, unless you need one. If you need to know an answer, kindly follow up in a couple days and ask if they've given it any thought.

, It's tough to know exactly how your boss will respond, but it is helpful to prepare for likely outcomes, both negative or positive.


If your boss acts calloused toward your problem, prepare how you'll react. You do not want to say something you might regret or act in a way that threatens your job stability. In this situation it may be best to tell your boss you understand their reaction and walk away until you can come back a well-thought out response. You can reiterate the sort of help you were looking for at a later time when both you and your boss have had time to think about it.
Don't turn it into an argument. If you feel yourself getting emotional, you may say something you regret. If your boss responds in a combative way, try to quell the situation and walk away until cooler heads can prevail.
Don't be too set on an expected response. If you go in thinking your boss will immediately offer you time off or try to accommodate your problem, you may react in a way that affects your future relationship. Understand that you're having a conversation and it may take some time for both sides to fully understand one another.

Recognize the different types of complicated coworkers.,
Use humor.,
Confront your coworker in private.,
Choose your battles carefully.",How to Deal With Difficult People in the Workplace1," There are a range of difficult people you can encounter in your workplace. Examples of difficult coworkers include one that is hostile, the constant complainer, the staller, the know-it all and the overly agreeable coworker.The hostile coworker may appear angry or often express a feeling of being wronged. The best way to deal with this type of coworker is to not meet anger with anger. He or she often just needs to be heard and appreciated to alleviate some of their discomfort.
A coworker who constantly complains can add undue stress to the entire work environment. When you meet these people, actively listening to their concerns and then offer to help them solve the problem.
The staller is that coworker who often puts off making a commitment or taking action for fear of being wrong or upsetting others. The best way to deal with the staller is to get to the root of the fear and figure out what information is needed to make the choice or to take action.
A know-it-all can come in two forms, someone who truly knows his stuff, but makes sure everyone else knows he’s the “expert.” Then, there is the one that just thinks she knows it all in order to assert an opinion about everything. For the true experts, taking the time to ask questions gives them a chance to flex their power and will usually help them to tone down their overall negative attitude towards others. Those coworkers who don’t know as much as they think they do will usually tone it down if they are quietly confronted one-on-one with the true level of their knowledge.
Overly agreeable coworkers can become an issue at work because they will often agree with whatever is said in the moment, but later on voice their true feelings or just not follow through with commitments. Making sure this coworker knows they are a valued part of the team, regardless of their opinions will help them gain confidence.;
, Defusing any uncomfortable situation with humor can be a very good defense mechanism. Sometimes, the best way to deal with an uncomfortable situation is to use appropriate humor or even make a joke at your own expense to redirect the focus of the moment.When using humor you need to make sure it is appropriate humor, avoid anything that could be hurtful or taunting in nature.
Humor is a great way to separate the negative behavior from the person, even if you don’t agree with the behavior you still like and can laugh with the person.

, While it is not reasonable to confront a coworker who may become violent, you may be able to directly address issues by confronting other types of difficult coworkers in private.


Pulling the know-it-all who really doesn’t know that much aside and having a friendly conversation can reshape the working relationship without embarrassing him in front of others. Effective confronting is done in a private and respectful way.For example, you might say “Excuse me, Robbie. I realize you might have a lot of knowledge about the subject we are discussing, but can we keep out fact-sharing on a need-to-know basis? Or, it may be good if you could send us a summary of all you know about the topic and let us review it on our own time”.

, Watch out for difficult people on your job. Often, the best way of dealing with them is to avoid them altogether if possible. However, if for any reason, you find it is not possible to do so, you need to assess your situation and your options taking into account your priorities at the time.


For example, you have a colleague who is a control freak but the job is absolutely essential to you then, you may have to find other ways of dealing with him/her while you buy time looking for another job or to change in your circumstances.
Picking your battles will help you to avoid unneeded stress and to not take the problems of your coworkers on as your own."
"
Take care of yourself.,
Maintain a supportive network.,
Develop a relationship with the human resources department.",How to Deal With Difficult People in the Workplace2," Be conscious of the negative impact that a difficult coworker can have on you. Ultimately, it's your responsibility to look after yourself and not give in to his or her tactics.


Taking the step to separate the behavior from the person in the office can help you focus on the stress of the behavior and how to deal with it. You can’t take the behavior personally because it often isn’t about you, but rather something going on with your coworker., Spending time with positive people who reaffirm your personal values and support you can be helpful when you work with difficult people. Have someone with whom you can talk both in and out of work to help vent your frustrations. Give yourself time and a safe space to calm down from conflict.


Following a 24-hour rule when it comes to dealing with conflict can be helpful. This means not reacting in the moment but instead giving yourself time to step away and get support as needed., There are some circumstances where you need to involve human resources or your management staff. This would include threats of violence or anything that is creating a hostile work environment. Many human resources teams have special employees to deal directly with employee relations and can address your concerns in a professional and serious manner.

Know your rights against harassment.,
Understand how your workplace handles tense employee relationships.,
Request a reassignment.,
Go to a superior when things get out of hand.",How to Deal With Difficult People in the Workplace3," You have basic rights to be safe and free of harassment at work. If things get to the extreme there are legal routes to take to end a hostile work environment., As mentioned above, getting to know how the human resources team works can help in extreme cases.


Most work places will have written policies for human resources that include a formal grievance or complaint process.

, This can be as simple as moving your desk away from the person you have a problem with or changing departments to avoid working with them. If the problem escalates you may want to consider getting a new job or taking the issue to your boss.

, An important part of this step is to make sure you are following the natural chain of command and don’t overstep your immediate supervisor unless they are the person you have an issue with.


Harassment on the job can lower performance so most bosses are willing to proactively address problems.Approach your boss with clear details of the problem. For instance, you might start off by saying “I am having a problem with…” then explain what you have done to try to resolve the issue before having to come to your boss.

Identify signs of bullying.,
Speak up.,
Talk to the affected co-worker.,
Have a private discussion with the bully.,
Offer your co-worker advice.",How to Stop a Coworker Putting Down Another Coworker1," If you suspect that a co-worker is being bullied, you may want to start paying attention to see if there are other instances of bullying that are occurring. In addition to insults and putting down others, workplace bullying might include:

Consistently ignoring certain people in common spaces or during meetings
Excluding certain people from work social events
Spreading lies or rumors about a person
Refusing to help others when requested;
, Whenever you hear a co-worker putting another co-worker down, stand up for them. Make it clear to the bully that you have your co-worker’s back. Your co-worker’s bully may back down if you call out their behavior. Still, remember that you are in a work environment, so be professional and polite.Say something like, “I love Julie’s sweater today. There's no need to be so negative.”

, Before you take action, you should speak to the affected co-worker to see how they feel about the situation. Get their perspective on the issue. Keep in mind that while you may consider this behavior bullying, the affected co-worker may just take it as a joke or they may not care. Ask them if they want help, and respect their wishes if they do not want you to get involved.

You might say, ""Hey, I've noticed that Angela has been pretty hard on you lately. Is everything ok?""

, After you witness a co-worker putting another co-worker down, you can confront the bully in a private setting. Step into their office or cubby and have a face-to-face conversation. Again, be polite and professional.


Try saying, “I heard you talking about Tom’s work today in a way that sounded condescending. From my perspective, he is the best IT person we have. How about we keep the language in the office more positive rather than negative?”
Keep your body language open and positive - hold your ground with a tall stance. Don't roll your eyes, cross your arms, or enter the other person's personal space.

, Your co-worker may need support in order to stand up to their bully. They may think that they are exaggerating the situation or being overly sensitive. Let your co-worker know that you see the bullying and that you do not think it is appropriate. Advise them to stand up for themselves or to report the bullying to a supervisor or HR. Your advice might be the support that they need to stand up to the bully.


Tell your co-worker, “I heard Matt putting you down during our meeting yesterday. I definitely thought that it was unprofessional. Have you talked to him about it?”

"
"
Talk to other coworkers about the situation.,
Discuss the situation with your supervisor.,
Stand up to the bullying together.",How to Stop a Coworker Putting Down Another Coworker2," Make them aware of their co-worker’s negative behavior and have them keep watch. If the bullying continues to happen there will be more people aware and willing to stand up for the victim. This will also give the victim more support. Be careful to keep the tone positive and focused on supporting the victim. Creating a resentful tone toward the person bullying will only make matters worse.

, Privately discuss your co-worker’s bullying with your supervisor. The supervisor may have a discussion with the bully to try to put an end to the bullying. It is also good for the supervisor to understand any situations that might be hindering your coworker’s performance.Say something like “May I speak with you privately? I need to talk to you about an uncomfortable situation that is happening in the office.”
The supervisor may not want to get involved and ask that you speak with someone at HR.
The supervisor may request that your co-worker who is the victim bring this to their attention.
Your supervisor may ask you to report as a witness to the bullying, should your co-worker file a complaint.

, Make an agreement with your other co-workers that when one person stands up to the bullying, another will chime in. This way, multiple people are standing up for the victim each time. This will let the bully know that it putting down their co-workers will not be tolerated.


It is not uncommon for a bully to start undermining the work of several people, so standing up for each other will improve everyone’s moral.

"
"
Document everything.,
Give the co-worker a verbal warning.,
Take the matter to HR.",How to Stop a Coworker Putting Down Another Coworker3," Before you report any workplace bullying that is happening, you should have clear documentation of the bullying. Be sure to include dates, times, people present, and the action or words that were said.For example, if the comment makes you or your co-worker uncomfortable, you might report an incident where one co-worker is shouting at another “This work is trash! Start over, and try not to mess it up again.”

, Before you report any bullying to HR it is important to give the co-worker who is bullying a verbal warning. After you tell the bully to stop their behavior, make sure that you document when and where you talked to your co-worker. This may stop their behavior and not require you to proceed further.Say something like “You have to stop putting Linda down. She works hard, and it makes things awkward for everyone when you put her down. If you keep it up, I’m going to say something to HR.”

, Take a look at your employee handbook and gain an understanding of the procedures. Be sure to take your documentation and evidence into the meeting with your HR representative. Explain how this behavior is impacting you, your co-workers, and your workplace.If others have noticed the bullying, encourage them to back you up and report the issue to HR as well.

Review the information submitted by the employee.,
Get a copy of the FMLA certification form.,
Send the FMLA certification form to the employee's doctor.,
Contact the doctor's office to authenticate the certification.,
Require periodic updates.",How to Verify a Doctor's Certification of Disability for an Employee1," If an employee requests time off under the FMLA for their disability, they must provide written information certifying the disability and their inability to work as a result if you request it.In some cases, particularly if the condition that required the employee to miss work occurred without warning, the employee may only give you notice that they are taking FMLA time by phone.
However, the employee is required to provide you with written information supporting their request within 15 days of your request.
The information you receive from the employee may include the diagnosis of a disability and the period of incapacity that requires the employee to take time off work.
Keep in mind that the employee doesn't have to be rendered completely incapable – merely unable to complete basic job functions even with reasonable accommodation.
You also have the right to identify the employee's healthcare provider and determine whether they are qualified to make the diagnosis or provide the medical opinion that they have.;
, The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) provides a certification form that includes all information necessary to certify an employee's disability for FMLA purposes.You can get a copy of the form easily by downloading the PDF from the DOL's website. Then you can print it up and give it to the employee, or send it directly to the employee's healthcare provider.
Keep in mind that federal medical privacy laws limit the amount and type of information you can get from the employee's doctor about that employee's disability.
Using the form is the easiest way to ensure that you're getting all the information you have the right to have under the FMLA without violating your employee's privacy.

, You can send the FMLA form directly to the employee's healthcare provider who treats them for the disability claimed. You also have the option of giving the form to the employee and having them give it to their doctor.To make it easier to verify the doctor's certification, you typically want to send the form directly to their office rather than going through your employee.
Even if the employee takes the form to their doctor, you also can request that the doctor's office send the completed form directly to you.
While you cannot communicate directly with the doctor about the employee's disability, they can complete this form with the employee's consent.

, While health privacy laws prevent you from communicating with an employee's doctor directly to discuss their disability, you can seek clarification or contact the doctor's office to verify that the form is not a fraud.This is particularly important if the doctor's certification came from the employee. You have no way of knowing if the form was actually completed and signed by the doctor, or was forged by the employee.
Be sure you're following the federal privacy regulations that govern the disclosure of confidential medical information. You may want to consult an attorney if you're unsure of your rights in this area.
For example, you may want to verify that the signature is legitimate, or seek guidance on how to read a physician's illegible handwriting.
Generally, you need to speak to someone in the benefits or human resources department of the doctor's office or healthcare facility. A staff member can then speak to the doctor directly if needed.

, If the employee has requested an indefinite period of leave, you have the right under the FMLA to request the employee to provide updates on their condition from the healthcare provider who is treating them.You can't ask for these updates, however, if the employee provides a specific end-date with their leave request, and does not ask to have the leave extended beyond that amount originally granted.
You only have the right under FMLA to ask for additional certification if no specific end-date was identified in the employee's original leave request.
You also may require periodic testing or examinations after the employee returns to work, if their disability has ongoing consequences or continues to affect their ability to do their job.
This is particularly true for employees, such as firefighters or police officers, whose disability also may impact the public safety.
Whatever monitoring or exams you require must be job-related and a matter of business necessity, whether to provide accommodation or protect other employees or members of the public.

Send the employee to another doctor.,
Receive the second doctor's opinion.,
Consider getting a third opinion.,
Evaluate the employee's FMLA request.",How to Verify a Doctor's Certification of Disability for an Employee2," If you disagree or have significant problems with the conclusions reached by the employee's treating physician, you do have the right to require the employee to see another healthcare professional of your choosing.ADA regulations also provides a procedure for confirming an employee's diagnosis or requesting additional medical certification.
However, the procedures for requesting a second or third opinion relate solely to an employee's disability-related FMLA request.
If you want a second opinion of the employee's certification or need to take the time off they've requested, you must pay any associated medical bills.
For example, suppose the employee's medical certification comes from a general practitioner who you don't believe is qualified to diagnose that condition.
You want the employee to visit a specialist in that particular condition to assess the time off the employee needs, or whether a particular treatment regimen is necessary.
You can require the employee to visit the specialist, but you must pay for this examination and treatment.

, Once the employee is examined by the doctor you chose, the doctor will submit their opinion regarding the employee's disability and the necessity of their FMLA request.You have an advantage in verifying the doctor's certification when you require a second opinion, because you get to choose the doctor. You can choose someone you trust and respect.
You can use the FMLA form available on the DOL's website to get medical certification from this second healthcare provider.
If the second doctor agrees with the first, you generally must comply with the employee's FMLA request. If you still have problems with the request and are reluctant to grant it, you may want to speak to an experienced FMLA attorney.
Make sure any attorney with whom you speak has experience representing employers who have denied FMLA requests. They will be best suited to identify problems with the employee's documentation of their disability for purposes of the FMLA.

, If the doctor you chose disagreed with the first doctor's assessment, you can't simply choose that doctor's opinion over the other. A third opinion serves as a tie-breaker to determine which opinion can be relied upon.Just as you paid for the second opinion, you also must pay for the third. You can request the third doctor complete the same FMLA certification form.
Unlike the second opinion, both you and your employee must agree on the doctor chosen for the third opinion.
Keep in mind that whichever opinion the third doctor agrees with is the one that is controlling in regard to the employee's FMLA request.
You do not have the right to continue seeking fourth, or fifth, or further medical opinions – even if you pay for them.

, If the second doctor's opinion substantially agrees with the first opinion, you cannot delay in granting the employee's FMLA request. Even when you've sought a third opinion, you still need to avoid delays in making a decision on the employee's request.Generally, you must provide the employee with written notice that they are eligible for FMLA leave within five days of their request.
You can use this notice to request certification, or to notify the employee that certification provided was incomplete or insufficient to justify their request.
After medical certification that complies with FMLA requirements is complete, you must make your decision regarding the employee's request as soon as possible.
If you plan to deny the employee's request, make sure you've hired an attorney who supports and is ready to stand by your decision. Expect the employee to file a complaint against you with the DOL.

Evaluate the initial documentation provided.,
Allow the employee to provide the missing information.,
Require the employee to go to a different doctor.,
Make accommodations for the employee's disability.",How to Verify a Doctor's Certification of Disability for an Employee3," If an employee requests reasonable accommodation of their disability under the ADA, you are within your rights to require the employee to submit written documentation of their disability.You also have the right to ask disability-related questions or require the employee to see a qualified healthcare provider if you receive information from someone else.
For example, if one of the employee's co-workers tells you that the employee has a disability, you have the right to ask that employee.
Keep in mind that the information you receive must be reliable and cause you to have a reasonable belief that the employee has a disability that requires reasonable accommodation.
If the information or documentation comes directly from the employee, it must include sufficient information to trigger ADA requirements. In particular, the diagnosis and necessary accommodations must be confirmed by a qualified medical professional.
This isn't an issue if you're ready to provide the necessary accommodations anyway. But if the employee demands accommodations that would be cumbersome or expensive to your business, you do have the right to require more information.

, If the initial documentation supplied by the employee is insufficient, you must provide the employee with a written explanation as to what was missing from the initial documentation, and give them time to get that information to you.This may mean asking the employee to get a medical examination, or to visit a specialist to have their condition evaluated.
You also may require the employee to get additional information from their doctor, such as proof that their treating physician is qualified to diagnose the disability or provide an opinion on necessary accommodations.
At this point, you aren't responsible for footing the bill for the employee's examinations or evaluations. You aren't asking for supplemental information. You're only asking for the amount of information to which you're entitled under the ADA.

, The ADA does not prevent you from sending the employee to another doctor or to a specialist to evaluate the employee's condition and provide an opinion on the employee's disability.Keep in mind that if you require the employee to get a second opinion, you typically have to pay for this examination or evaluation.
Be prepared to explain to the employee why you are requiring them to take this additional step to certify their disability.
Seeking a second opinion shouldn't be abused. However, it can be helpful when you aren't satisfied with the outcome of any attempt to verify the original doctor's certification given to you by the employee.

, Once you've received sufficient documentation of the employee's disability and the accommodations that will enable the employee to successfully perform the requirements of their job, you have a duty under the ADA to make those accommodations.The ADA only requires you to make reasonable accommodations. If the accommodation the employee needs, as certified by healthcare professionals whose opinions you've verified, are excessively disruptive or expensive, you may be able to refuse to provide them.
If you plan to refuse a request for accommodation, you may want to consider hiring an employer defense attorney.
Expect the employee to file an administrative charge or lawsuit against you for failing to accommodate their disability.

Don’t be hard on yourself.",How to Tell Your Boss You've Made a Major Mistake," Take the time to figure out the potential fallout of your mistake. This will not only get you closer to fixing it, but it also shows your boss that you really care about your work.Things to consider when looking at the possible fallout would include whether the mistake puts others in physical danger so it is truly an emergency or other situations that need to be addressed immediately to avoid potential crisis situations. Giving a patient the wrong meds is an example of something that needs immediate attention because the window to avoid possible life-threatening danger is small.
Another possible form of fallout from a mistake can be bad press or a negative reaction to the company based on the mistake. This might happen if an email went out to the full database instead of just one person about a sensitive matter. Be aware that this type of mistake can mean many more people having to deal with the problem and even some sort of formal corporate statement about the error.;
, Be clear that the situation needs immediate attention. Make sure to give your boss a heads up, if there is something that needs to be done immediately to stop further damage.


Get your boss' attention by saying something like ""Excuse me, sir. I need to talk to you about an urgent matter. Can I speak with you in private?""
Stay calm and make sure your boss understands your need for an immediate conversation. This is not the time to get upset since your first focus is anything that needs to be fixed sooner rather than later. Also, telling your boss early enough so that he or she hears it from you first will help to rebuild trust for the future., Now, that you've got his or her attention, your boss needs to know more. Explain what happened, who may be hurt by the mistake and action that needs to take place in the moment if there is anything that can fix it right away. This is not the time to place blame or give excuses, focus on fixing the situation first.


Admit that you made a mistake by getting straight to the point. Say something like ""I made a mistake. I accidentally emailed the entire client list.""

, Refrain from assigning blame. It may be tempting to include anyone else whose oversight contributed to the problem. Don’t. Throwing others under the bus to make yourself look better won’t win any favors with your superiors.


The most effective way to take responsibility is to, firstly, admit the mistake and then apologize. Be sincere without making excuses. Be humble and to the point. “I know you were counting on me, I’m very sorry I let you down. I will do whatever is necessary to rectify the situation.”
Getting defensive by trying to blame someone else will almost always end up with a bad reaction from your boss and probably the person you threw under the bus. Nothing positive will come out of this type of behavior.
It is sometimes a knee-jerk reaction to try to cover up a situation, but again being honest and to the point is a much better choice. You do not want to add lying to the list of mistakes. If it was an honest mistake, stand firm that honesty is the best way to go forward., You might handle the situation with the utmost of professionalism, but there still may be a negative outcome. Depending on the scale of your mistake, you might receive a warning, be placed on probation, or even terminated.Regardless of the consequences, handling them with a professional attitude will only help you in the long run. Even if you are terminated, you do not need to make the situation worse by reacting negatively or even violently.
Keep in mind any negative reaction is only going to make the situation worse. Getting fired from one job can harm your future chances of employment, if you act out in a way that leads to the involvement of police or lawyers.

, It’s your mistake and your responsibility. Therefore, you should also be wholly involved in resolving the issue. While taking the lead on fixing things would be the best case scenario, keep in mind that your boss may not allow this. Be flexible and agreeable if the boss wants you to work with others or is skeptical about you handling it alone.


Stay positive even if you are getting negative feedback from around you. There was a mistake made and co-workers may comment about it, but your focus should be on making things right, not the drama around the office., Ask your boss for direction and do as you are told. This is a time to show you can take a bad situation and make it better—it may not be the most appropriate time to try to wing it.Taking criticism may be a part of this process. Remain open to suggestions and show your team you are truly sorry for what happened. Work to not only fix the current problem, but also to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

, In order to rebuild your boss’s trust and rectify the problem, you must strive to go above and beyond what’s required. Be genuine in any offer you make. It is going to take time and effort to fix the mistake, depending how big of a mistake was made. Since you were the reason it happened, it makes sense that you would have to devote extra resources to seeing the problem resolved.Take the time to thank anyone else affected by the mistake who is now part of the solution. These people are having to do extra work to correct an error you made. Be sure to show that you respect and appreciate their efforts.

, This is a positive step for anyone who has a boss that now is under fire for the mistake. This in a small way shows you are willing to take responsibility and make those tough phone calls., Use your past mistakes as teaching moments for the future. Show your boss your ability to improve by documenting the mistake and any insights you learned as a result. This is helpful for you in terms of preventing similar errors to come, and also helps demonstrate progress when you come up for evaluation at work.Many times an error paves the way for innovation. Share an idea with your boss about a way you intend on changing your approach, so these types of errors don’t happen again. Any major changes will usually require agreement from your boss. However, brainstorming new approaches at least shows initiative.

, Take special care to manage your tasks. This way, you have the time to focus on completing them one at time so you are not risking making needless mistakes.


Take this mistake as a chance to look at other things you may need to change about your work habits. You might need to clean up your desk to avoid losing important papers or find a better way to manage emails to avoid using the wrong email list., Getting clarification can save you time in the long run since you won’t need to re-do things later. Don’t feel like you are bothering someone by asking for help. If you are polite and considerate in your requests, others are likely to enjoy offering a helping hand. Pay attention and learn from those around you.


Ask for specific and hands-on instruction so you can figure out what you were missing before and move on. Often, it is one step you have missed in the process or something small that makes a big difference.
Show your appreciation for the help and be sure to implement the strategies you’ve learned. Actually putting new skills into play shows that you have gratitude and makes others more likely to help if you should need to ask again.

, If you feel like you never have enough time in the day while at work, imagine how much worse it could be if you need to fix another big mess. Start a to-do list and learn to manage your time better so you are not rushing through tasks and overlooking important steps.

, Beating yourself up can actually make the problem worse. Everyone makes mistakes—even your boss, at some point. Practice self-forgiveness and be sure that you learned from the issue so that it doesn’t happen again."

Appreciate the positive aspects of working for a perfectionist boss.",How to Work for a Perfectionist Boss," When a perfectionist boss makes demands of you that you know are impossible to accomplish, assert yourself without sounding argumentative or disrespectful. For example, when your boss doubles your workload without extending your time frame, you could say something like, ""I can complete the extra work, but I will have to delegate the other job to someone else if you want both jobs completed at the same time."";
, It can be difficult to decide whether to take a stand when your overly picky boss is critical of your work or to let it go. When faced with this dilemma, it is important to remember that your reputation at work is at stake. In order to keep a positive relationship with your boss, only bring up criticisms that are overly unreasonable or unwarranted.Ask your boss to meet with you to discuss the problem. Be clear about what is bothering you, yet maintain a polite and professional manner.

, Your boss has likely been operating with the same nitpicky approach for a long time, and it has likely worked because employees are usually hesitant to question or disagree with their supervisor. But, it’s perfectly okay to agree to disagree with your superiors as long as you have something valuable to bring to the table.


You may earn your boss’s respect by consistently standing up for yourself and for the quality of your work. After all, if your boss hired you for your skills, they ought to value your input and know-how when it comes to your job., Creating and maintaining a little emotional distance will help prevent a negative situation from escalating. Always try to stay cool, calm and collected when faced with the drama that your perfectionist boss may create.


By remaining professional at all times, and not letting yourself get riled up or defensive, your boss may realize that their tactics are not going to work on you., Perfectionism often causes procrastination, as a fear of making mistakes can freeze the decision-making process. Asking your boss for specific deadlines not only brings an awareness of time constraints to your boss, but also provides you with a more concrete definition of your assigned responsibilities so that you can avoid disagreements down the line.


If your boss routinely expects you to turnaround a spectacular product but doesn’t allow enough time to work on it, you need to first release your frustration, then have a candid conversation with them about it. Perhaps it’s possible that your boss doesn’t have a clear idea what is required of you to complete the work, and a conversation with them will help clear the air and set more realistic expectations for the future.If you run into unforeseen obstacles that will prevent you from meeting your deadline, meet with your boss and come prepared with plenty of potential solutions to the problem. Your boss will appreciate your effort to provide a resolution to the unmet deadline rather than just presenting another problem for them to solve. This proactive approach will also help reassure your boss that you have just as much at stake as they do to make sure projects are completed on time., If your boss gives you an assignment with an unrealistic deadline, explain that the work can’t be done to an acceptable standard in the allotted time. Your boss will likely appreciate your dedication to producing high-quality work, and will be more willing to emphasize a higher priority on one aspect of the project over another.Once you have decided which parts of a project to concentrate on first, reiterate the decision by creating a spreadsheet that you can share with your boss so that you are both on the same page.

, Many times you may think you understand your assignment, when your boss may have an entirely different idea about what the project entails. By asking questions, you can clarify what is being requested of you, and the conversation may give your boss the opportunity to give you more specific instructions so that you don’t start off down the wrong path and have to start all over again.Asking questions about a project also gives you an opportunity to exhibit your enthusiasm for your job, and to make suggestions regarding the way a project is handled.
One of the most powerful questions an employee can ask is, “What if...?” Your ability to speculate shows that you are looking ahead and anticipating any issues that may arise., Don’t wait for an assignment to come your way; impress your perfectionist boss by anticipating their requests ahead of time. If you’ve worked for your boss long enough, you are likely to have a good sense of what is expected of you and your work products. If you can beat your boss to the punch and deliver an outstanding result without having them micromanage you, you will both be better off., Perfectionists can get stuck on analyzing of all the small parts that make up the whole, and this can slow your productivity. Consider every aspect of a project and think ahead to identify every detail that might need extra attention. That way, you can head off issues before your perfectionist boss notices them.Keep track of details by using checklists to manage your daily tasks. These days, there are so many distractions in the form of emails, instant messages popping up, and text messages beeping, it can be difficult to concentrate on the task at hand. Checklists can help you stay on task and make sure that you haven’t forgotten to do something important.

, In order to avoid a miscommunication of what your boss expects versus what your understanding of an assignment is, keep your perfectionist boss up to date at all times. That way, your boss won’t have to come to you for an update, and you can make sure that you are on the right track.Your progress reports can take the form of a daily email, a brief in-person meeting, or a phone call.

, Keep attendance records, client referrals, positive reviews, customer recommendations and any other proof of your value as an employee. In the case that a demanding boss unjustifiably questions your dedication or aptitude, you can defend your position with tangible evidence of your hard work.

, Adopt a strategy to “manage up” your boss by assuming a similar style of communication. If you write long drawn-out emails, and your perfectionist boss replies with a one-word sentence, it can be incredibly frustrating. Instead, try only including the most important information in your emails in the form of bullet points, so that you can get your point across more efficiently and succinctly., Your boss is a perfectionist because they have a high set of standards for their work as well as yours. If your standards are set lower than those of your boss, you are setting yourself up for frustration and stress, because your work will never be deemed good enough. The trick is to always be one step ahead of your boss in terms of the quality of your work.When you are assigned a new project, take a look at what is expected as the deliverable, then figure out if there are ways that you could take the project from acceptable to outstanding. Your boss will come to trust that your standards are on par with their own, and will hopefully take a step back from micromanaging you.

, Arrive on time, all the time. Whether it be the start of the day, a return from lunch or break, a meeting or a business party, make it a point to be on time or early. Make sure that you tend to personal business on your own personal time, not while you’re on the clock. Also, respect the company dress code, and always try to keep a neat and professional appearance.

, A demanding boss is likely a motivated, high energy type individual. Therefore, asserting yourself as an enthusiastic go-getter can help you stand out amongst your coworkers and gain favor in your boss's eyes.A good way to increase your level of enthusiasm is to dwell on the aspects of your job that you enjoy, and to focus on those first. Find a project that speaks to your passions, and let it become your showpiece. Your boss will notice your enthusiasm, and will be more likely to assign you similar projects in the future.

, A perfectionist or demanding boss likely suffers from insecurity. Verbally acknowledging your boss's strengths can work for you, in that increasing your boss's self-esteem may also help your boss learn to be more accepting of others. Communication is key: reassure your boss on a regular basis that your projects are coming right along on schedule.

, You may have to work harder and be more conscientious to work for a boss who aims for perfection, but you can also learn a lot about self-discipline, reliability, maintaining high standards and paying attention to detail."

Prepare yourself.,
Practice.,
Make sure you use the best car for what you need.,
Buy the perfect chauffeur vehicle.,
Prepare the car.,
Tailor your greeting to the person you are talking to.,
During the drive, pass from the front of the car, open the door gently, get in as a gentleman (don't fall into the seat like a brick falls from the sky), start the engine, close the door gently, put your seat belt on, and drive off nicely and gently.,
Arrive at your destination.",How to Chauffeur," Make sure your hygiene is ""Perfect"". Put on a nice suit, shave, and use some perfume if you're a woman.;
, Take a lot of time practicing tasks such as parking a big car in a tight car park or parking spot, gently accelerating/turning and braking the ""chauffeur"" car. Get familiar with the car you will be using.

, Below are some examples:


If you chauffeur your kids or friends around everyday, you probably don't need any special transportation vehicle; your daily family car will fit the deal.
If you chauffeur your wife/girlfriend/mother for the weekend in short distances, your daily family car will fit the deal perfectly once more.
If you are going on a longer trip and you have a car that belongs to the ""touring"" car category, such as BMW 5/7 series, an Audi A6/A8, or a Mercedes E/S class, or this type of vehicle, prefer this one because they have a more comfortable ride. They offer a good variety of equipment whether it is for safety, comfort or entertainment.

, If you are planning to buy another car to be the chauffeur car, look at your needs and the available budget first.


For a low to medium budget there is lots of cars out there that are very comfortable, safe, and built to ""eat"" kilometers/miles. Search brands that have a long history record on luxury cruisers, because these companies know how to build very good cruisers.
If you have a medium to high budget, consider cars such as BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, Mercedes S Class, Lexus LS Series, etc.
If you have a budget that is higher than the average high budget, consider a GT (Gran Turismo), or category cars such as the Aston Martin Rapide, Aston Martin DB9, Bentley Continental Flying Spur, Bentley Mulsanne, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, Ferrari FF, etc. Remember there are thousands of good condition used luxury or hyper-luxury cars that are the bargains of the century.

, The car that is used should always be as clean as possible, fully filled up with gas, and well maintained so that it won't break down or do strange noises during the drive. It's also important to do the regular checks such as fluid level, tyre pressure, and other everyday maintenance.

, A typical greeting (as you would always greet them) is okay. If you will also have somebody in the car who is a stranger for you or someone much older than you, make a gentleman greeting and open the door for him. If you chauffeur someone with high reputation (you will probably be a chauffeur for a living in this option) greet them again as a gentleman and open the door for him.

, Try to drive at the speed of the traffic flow and avoid constant overtaking. Be sure to stop gently and also drive off gently. When overtaking. Try not to accelerate too hard or floor it because high speeds could scare some passengers.


A V8 is good entry level engine, as it has good low end and medium end torque, so you don't have to downshift or accelerate too hard. The V12 engine is the boss in these cars because it has a lot of torque, so you almost don't need to downshift. You just have to press a bit more on the accelerator. V12 engines also are extremely smooth and quiet in the way they deliver both power and torque. If you are chauffeuring your family and friends, you can show them what your V8 Charger or Bi-Turbo V12 S600 can do, but avoid doing that when you are transporting a stranger. You can accelerate a bit more quickly from time to time and, if you see that he/she likes it, then it's okay if you drive a bit faster, especially if it is going to make the ride a bit more exciting. However, you should still always obey traffic laws and never break the speed limit.

, If you transfer your family/friends stop as close to your destination as possible, let them get off the car so you don't have to carry them with you while searching for an empty parking spot. If an elderly passenger or a passenger with special needs requires assistance, provide it. If you have an important passenger (minister, star, singer etc) in the car, stop, turn on the hazard lights, and open the door for them. Then find a place to park the car.

Stay calm.,
Decide to ignore the comment.,
Call him out on his remark tactfully.,
Question why the statement was made.,
Ask him to repeat himself.,
Write it down.,
Consider whether the comments are harassment.,
Don’t sacrifice your health or self-esteem.",How to Tactfully Handle a Racist Boss1," Becoming visibly upset as a result of your boss’s racist words or behaviors will usually make the situation worse. If you’re the target of the racist remark, you might feel like lashing back. If you’re not the direct target, you might have a desire to defend whoever was the intended target. But if you’re looking for a way to handle the situation tactfully, you’ll need to calm down first.Take a deep breath, and count to 10 before saying anything.
If you still feel like you’re unable to calm down, make an excuse and walk away from your boss if you can.;
, If this is the first time you’ve ever heard you boss make a racist comment, it might be easiest to simply ignore it. Change the topic to a work-related concern. For example, following the offensive remark, you can simply look at your boss with a blank expression, pause, and then resume talking about the job.There’s a chance he’ll get the message that his humor or comment wasn’t appreciated without your having to say so.
Try to remember that it’s not your responsibility to educate your workplace about racism. Your primary goal is to get your boss to stop making racist comments around you.

, If your boss persists in saying racist things around you, you may need to be more overt about your disapproval. You can do this tactfully, as long as you’re able to keep your cool. When your boss says the offensive thing, look at him blankly, and say something like, “Wow.” Or, even, “Wow, that was racist.”Don’t follow your statement with an explanation about how the statement was racist. Instead, redirect the conversation immediately back to a work topic.
Make sure your attention is directed towards the remark rather than the person. Your boss is more likely to respond positively if told that his statement was racist than being told, “Wow, it sounds like you’re racist.”

, Asking your boss, “Why did you say that (racist thing)?” may result in his recognition that his statement was inappropriate. Or, it might reveal a misunderstanding of your own. If your boss reiterates the statement with additional racist clarification, you’ll have a better understanding of the situation.Asking your boss to explain why he made the statement also allows you time to gather your thoughts and calm yourself.
If there are other people present, you’ll have more witnesses.

, Asking him to repeat the racist remark highlights the fact that he said it in the first place, and may make him feel ashamed without any overt accusations on your part. Repeat the process as often as you need to, so that you’re making it clear that you’re refusing to engage in racist conversation.For example, after your boss says the racist thing, pretend that you didn’t hear him. Say, “Excuse me?”
If he repeats it, you can pretend not to understand. “”I’m sorry, I don’t get it.”
Eventually he’ll get the message that either you’re asking him to explicitly explain his racist comment, or that he should move on in the conversation.

, Even if this is the first time you’ve ever heard your boss use a racist statement, you’ll want to keep track. Write down exactly what was said, who was present, where you were, and the time and date. Be specific.Written documentation will be required if you ever decide to take your concerns about a racist boss to your company’s human resource office or consult a lawyer.
Make sure to keep your written notes in a place where others won’t find them at work.

, Racial jokes and comments can constitute a hostile work environment if they occur enough to affect a person’s employment. If these comments and jokes are pervasive enough that they interfere with an employee’s ability to do her job, then this is an act of illegal job discrimination.Harassment can be difficult to prove. The primary considerations are whether or not the comments were unwelcome, and the extent of the severity of the racist words or actions.
Realize that racist comments constitute harassment, even if you aren’t of the race being referred to negatively. As long as you make it clear the comments are unwelcome, and the comments or actions continue to impede your ability to do your job, then it’s a hostile work environment.

, Practice healthy self-compassion. When you leave work, prioritize activities that make you feel good about yourself. Finding meaningful and fulfilling activities will help keep you on an even keel, despite your racist boss.


Talking to close friends, a counselor, or a religious mentor about your difficulties at work may help relieve your stress.
If you have an exercise routine, keep it up. Exercise can help relieve your tension and stress. If you don’t have a current exercise practice, consider starting one.

Recognize racist actions at work.,
Ask your boss about his behavior.,
Offer suggestion statements.,
Know that certain actions are worse than others.",How to Tactfully Handle a Racist Boss2," If your boss is racist, you may notice that he’s treating people of color unfairly. These actions might be direct (such as refusing someone employment because “he wouldn’t fit in”) or indirect (such as insisting that employees have English as their native language.)Remember that the workplace may have a genuine reason for the hiring policy.
The racist action may or may not be directed towards you for your work to be affected.

, If you or someone else you feel is qualified has been repeatedly passed over for a promotion, ask your boss what you might do differently. For example, ask, “I was surprised that I wasn’t considered for that position, since it seems to fit my skills and experience. I’m interested in knowing what I might do to advance in the company.”Don’t ask in a confrontational manner that will put your boss in a defensive position.
Remember that it’s possible your boss doesn’t recognize his own racism. If you’re able to make your observations tactfully, he may realize what he’s doing and change his behavior.

, Rather than accusing your boss of being a racist, you might try offering suggestions for better management. For example, instead of saying, “If you’re not considering that man for a job here, you’re acting just like a racist,” you might consider saying, “I think it would help if we tried to cultivate a more diverse workforce.”A statement format is both assertive and deferential.
Try to explain why you’d like to see changes, so that you’re focusing on making positive change rather than blaming your boss for his actions.

, Certain incidents can result in immediate action. For example, physical threats based on race, hanging a noose in an African American employee's locker or work space, or using ""the n-word"" constitute harassment based on a single incident.If this kind of behavior occurs in your workplace, you should report it immediately.
Make sure to document this action. Write down exactly what took place, including the time, date, location and anyone else who observed it.

"
Get advice.,
Review the company’s harassment policy.,
Know the law.,
Keep a written record of incidents.,
Determine if it’s worth reporting your boss.",How to Tactfully Handle a Racist Boss3," If your boss’s racist remarks start to affect your job performance, you’ll need to find someone to talk to. Chances are there are others in your workplace who’ve had similar experiences with your boss. Ask them how they’re handling his racism and what (if anything) they may be doing about it.Make sure to do this discreetly. It’s a good idea to meet up after work for drinks or coffee when you have this conversation.
Once your company is aware of the incident, it’s legally obligated to investigate. If you’re not ready for a full investigation yet, you may wish to wait before speaking with your human resources department.

, Although it’s not required by federal laws, most employers have developed harassment policies regarding workplace behavior. The policy should provide a clear definition of prohibited conduct, and information about who to contact within the company if you have questions or complaints.It’s in the company’s best interest to develop such a policy, because not having one can make it much harder to prove that employees were aware of nondiscriminatory practices.
Small businesses may not have a policy in place, and may not have clear guidelines regarding who to contact with concerns. In this case, you may wish to consult with a lawyer.

, Many different actions are illegal if they are both unwelcome and either severe or pervasive. That means that if you’ve made it (tactfully) clear that you don’t care for your boss’s racist remarks, and they continue, he’s engaging in illegal workplace discrimination.This can include:


Verbal comments about clothing, personal behaviors or individual people’s bodies; race-based jokes; passing along racist texts or emails to employees.
Physical contact, including unwelcome touching of an employee’s body, hair, or clothing.
Non-verbal conduct, including derogatory gestures, and facial expressions that have racial intent.
Visual displays, including images, drawings, screensavers, posters, pictures, or any visual display of items understood to have racial significance.

, As mentioned earlier, keeping careful records of any racist incidents at your workplace will provide the basis for any potential of legal action. Write down exactly what was said or done, including any possible witnesses; document the time, date, and location.You may wish to ask other coworkers to keep their own written records to support your documentation.
Be as clear and objective as possible. For the purposes of this written record, don’t engage in any name-calling, speculation, emotional processing, etc.
Keep this record at home or in your car, rather that at your workplace.

, If you’ve told your boss tactfully that his racist behavior isn’t appreciated and it persists, it might be time to take a more direct approach. If this is a job that you really love and want to keep, it will be worth your while to try to affect a change in the racist environment of your job. If you’re not invested in keeping the job, then consider taking steps to find another employer.


Once you report your boss’s behavior to the company, the company is required to initiate an investigation into your complaint.
The company will not divulge your name; however, it may not be difficult to determine from whom the complaint is coming. Be aware that your boss may be aware of the complaint.
Even though retaliation is illegal, there’s a chance that you may suffer as a result of reporting your boss.

Make it clear that the behavior is unwelcome.,
Report the harassment to your workplace.,
Keep written records of all harassment.,
Report your boss to the EEOC.,
File a lawsuit.",How to Tactfully Handle a Racist Boss4," The first requirement for determining harassment in the workplace is that the behavior is unwelcome by the victim. Make sure you’ve told your boss that his behavior or remarks offend you.If everyone’s laughing at the racist jokes, don’t join in. You need to avoid sending any mixed signals regarding the racial behavior.
This communication can occur either verbally or in writing.

, Depending on your company’s structure, you might report the behavior to your boss’s supervisor, to the human resources department, or someone else within the company whose position it is to prevent harassment from occurring. You should report the harassment in writing, and make sure to keep a dated copy of your written complaint in a safe place.Once your employer knows of the harassment, the company is legally obligated to investigate your complaint.
If there’s a specific process for complaints required by your workplace, you should follow the process directives as precisely as possible.

, If you’ve decided to file a formal complaint regarding your boss’s racist comments or behaviors, it’s imperative that you keep a detailed written record of each incident that may support your complaint. Keep a notebook in a safe place, where no one from your workplace might accidentally read it.For each incident, record exactly what was said or done, who was present, the time, date, and location of the incident.
If you can, ask coworkers to keep records of their own which can collaborate your own report.

, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the federal agency responsible for enforcing the laws prohibiting racial bias and discrimination. Each state has its own process for reporting acts of racial harassment or discrimination. Such acts are illegal in all states, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the exact mechanism or reporting will vary.Your state may have a state administrative agency, such as the Missouri Commission on Human Rights (MCHR) or the Nevada Equal Rights Commission (NERC). The state agency exists to cooperate with the EEOC.
You must file your suit within a limited number days of the discrimination or harassment. The exact number varies by state, but in general it’s important to know that the sooner you report the discrimination, the more effective your case will be.
You may wish to consult with an attorney, but it’s not required. You are entitled to go forward with a claim against your boss without a lawyer.
The state commission may be able to successfully resolve your complaint.

, If the state commission doesn’t successfully resolve your complaint, then you’re entitled to pursue your claim through the legal system. You’re required to first attempt resolution through the EEOC before taking legal action.Your process with the EEOC will result in your receipt of either “Dismissal and Notice of Rights” or “Notice of Right to Sue” (Form 161).
You have 90 calendar days from that date of this receipt to take legal action. This deadline is called “the statute of limitation.” If you haven’t filed your lawsuit with the courts by this date, you may be able to pursue your case.
A lawyer may be helpful to you in navigating the legal system.

Even if you haven't had any problems before, when your skin is warm and you're sweating, you may have an increased sensitivity.Switch to detergents and fabric softeners designed for sensitive skin, or that contain no dyes or perfumes. Typically you can find these wherever you normally shop for laundry supplies at the same price as the detergent and fabric softener you usually buy.
Wash your workout clothes in hot water to eliminate any residual irritants left over from previous washings.
If you try this and notice no difference in how much your legs itch, that doesn't necessary mean your old detergent or fabric softener wasn't to blame. The problem also could be a combination of several different causes.;
, Even the softest cotton can irritate your skin once it gets sweaty. Wearing synthetic fabrics that wick sweat away from your body may help stop your legs from itching when you run.You also may be wearing too much clothing. If you're too warm, your skin may respond by itching. When you dress to workout, keep in mind that your body will be several degrees warmer when your heart rate goes up.
If you're running outside and it's cold, wear light layers that you can easily remove after you've warmed up.
You also should be on the lookout for tags or seams. Something you don't even notice normally may be irritating your legs once the skin becomes warm and slightly inflamed from exertion. This is especially important if you're wearing running tights or more form-fitting long pants.
If you're wearing shorts and your bare skin is itching, you can mark this (as well as a potential reaction to detergent or fabric softener) off your list.

, Especially in winter, the air is drier, which makes your skin drier. Particularly if you shower more than once a day, your dry skin may become irritated once you start sweating.This is true regardless of whether you're wearing long pants or shorts when you run, although long pants or running tights may make the itching worse.
Use a moisturizing, non-greasy lotion after your shower. You may want to reapply it about a half hour before you go for your run, if several hours pass between your shower and your exercise session.
Look for an active moisturizer over a more cosmetic, scented body lotion. The latter will often run when you get sweaty, which can make your legs sticky and even itchier than before.

, If you usually shave your legs, you'll need to maintain the habit if you want to stop your legs from itching when you run. Particularly if you're wearing long pants or running tights, the fabric may be rubbing against stubble, irritating your skin.If you've never shaved your legs (or if your legs are itching when you're wearing shorts), this probably isn't the reason your legs are itching. However, running tights or form-fitting running pants can still rub against your leg hair and cause itching, even if you've never shaved before in your life.
Make sure you're adequately moisturizing your legs and using a specially formulated shave gel or lotion when you shave to protect against razor burn.
Once you shave, if that solves your problem, you have to keep with it. Even day-old stubble can cause the itching to start again.

, In many cases, runners report their legs itch if they stop running for months or even weeks and then start up again, or if they are just beginning a running regimen after living a relatively sedentary lifestyle.While medical and fitness experts aren't entirely sure why, your legs may itch when your body is unaccustomed to that level of physical activity. This may be because you have poor circulation in your legs.If you are also experiencing pain along with the itching in your legs, then see a doctor as soon as possible.
If you have recently started (or restarted) running, keep at it for a few weeks and see if the itching subsides. During that time, you can attempt to eliminate any other potential causes through trial and error.
After you've been running for about a month, look at the possibility of a medical condition if your legs are still itching when you run.

, If you normally run outside and your legs start itching, it's worth hitting a treadmill and trying to run inside to see if your legs still itch. This can eliminate the possibility that you're responding to something in the environment.If your legs don't itch when you run on a treadmill, the itching may be a result of an allergic reaction to pollen in the air or other environmental triggers. It also could be a result of the air temperature and humidity, or general air quality outside.
On the other hand, if your legs continue to itch even when you run on a treadmill in a climate-controlled environment, you have at least eliminated environmental causes as the sole reason for your itching. Keep in mind they still may play a part.

, Showering too frequently, for too long, or using very hot water may dry out your skin and cause itching.If you shower more than once per day, try cutting down to just one shower per day, such as after you get back from a run. Keep the water at a warm, but not hot temperature. This simple change may help to prevent dry skin and reduce itchiness during your runs.


If you swim frequently, then the exposure to chlorine may also be a cause of dry skin. Take a shower after swimming to rinse the chlorine off your body.

Take a non-drowsy antihistamine.,
Stay hydrated.,
Check for welts or rashes.,
Consult your physician.",How to Stop Your Legs from Itching when You Run2," When your body is injured or stressed, it releases additional histamine to the affected area. This increases blood flow to that area and assists with healing. However, it also can trigger an itching sensation.You may find relief with an over-the-counter antihistamine drug. The brand doesn't particularly matter, but you may want to try more than one as you may find one is more effective for you than others. Keep in mind that some antihistamines, such as Benadryl, may cause drowsiness, and this may be unsafe for running since you need to be alert.Never take more than the recommended dose or more than one antihistamine at a time, as it could cause drowsiness and other side effects. Take your antihistamine about a half hour before you plan to go for your run.
If you find that over-the-counter antihistamines reduce, but don't eliminate, your itching, you may want to talk to your doctor about getting a stronger drug in prescription form.

, You lose a lot of moisture through your breath, as well as through sweating. Particularly in the drier air of winter, your itching may be a result of dehydration because you're not drinking enough water.Being dehydrated may contribute to your body's production of histamine, which could be the cause of your itching – especially if you don't have this problem during the warmer months or when you're running indoors on a treadmill.
In cold weather, you may not feel much like drinking water. You don't necessarily want ice water (which will have a cooling effect on your body), but you do want to drink a glass of water 30 to 45 minutes before you go out running, and another when you're done with your run.
If feasible, you also want to have a water bottle with you so you can drink water during your run – especially if you're running on a treadmill or going a long distance.

, If your itching is accompanied by redness, hives, or lesions, you may have exercise-induced urticaria. This is an allergic reaction triggered by exercise and typically controllable with medication.If you have a history of breaking out in hives in response to stress or anxiety, you may be more likely to have this condition.
Talk to your physician or to an allergy specialist if you believe you have exercise-induced urticaria. As this is a relatively uncommon condition, you may have to talk to several professionals before you get the help you need.

, If your itching persists for more than four to six weeks and does not respond to over-the-counter antihistamines, or is accompanied by other symptoms, you may have a more serious medical condition.Gather information before your appointment, so you're prepared to answer your doctor's questions. You may want to measure your heart rate after 10 minutes or so of running, and take note of normal conditions when you go on a run.
Be sure to tell your doctor of any acute causes, such as dry skin or a reaction to your detergent or fabric softener, that you believe you've eliminated.
Keep in mind that finding relief for your symptoms still may involve a bit of trial and error as your doctor finds the right prescription or other treatment that will work for you.

Stop exercising immediately if you notice lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.,
Relax and stabilize your breathing.,
Keep a diary of your episodes.,
List your symptoms.,
Get tested for allergies.,
Work with your doctor.",How to Stop Your Legs from Itching when You Run3," Generalized itching, especially on your legs, may be a sign of a more serious disorder known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The disorder is rare, but can be fatal. If you stop exercising after the onset of symptoms, in most cases you should be able to recover without requiring immediate medical attention.However, you should still see a doctor for diagnosis and treatment if you suspect that you might have this condition.


Symptoms to watch for include lightheadedness, sudden loss of muscle control, a tightness or constricted feeling in your throat, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.
Your symptoms may be relatively mild, to the point you can comfortably ignore them and continue your exercise. If they increase in severity, however, you should stop running. With mild symptoms, it's possible they will improve if you slow down and take a break, and you may be able to resume your run without any problems.

, If symptoms require you to stop running, move to a protected area and set upright. Practice deep breathing and relax your muscles. In time, you should start to feel better.Breathe in slowly through your nose, exhaling through your mouth. When your breathing feels regular, try to drink some water. Keep in mind symptoms may continue for hours after they began.
If your symptoms seem to get worse even after you've stopped exercise, seek emergency medical attention immediately.
Don't continue to run if you manage to stabilize and your symptoms seem to go away. You might try walking, but if you start running again so soon after an episode, the symptoms could quickly return with increased severity.

, Your doctor will need to know everything possible about your episodes, including everything you do in the hours leading up to your run. The more information your doctor has, the better able they will be to identify potential causes of your reaction.Document where you run, the time of day, the weather (if you're running outside), and how long you had been running when you noticed the first symptom. Take your pulse, if possible, or at least make an attempt to estimate your heart rate or the intensity of your exercise.
Take an inventory of household products and toiletries you commonly use, as well as everything you consumed before your run. Even if you've already eliminated possible allergies to these things, your doctor still may want this information.
If you've recently changed soaps, detergents, or other products in an attempt to stop the itching, write this down as well, along with whether you noticed any relief after the change.
Include details about what you were wearing on your run, and whether your skin felt unusually warm before the symptoms started.

, Understanding the symptoms you have is important for your doctor to figure out how to treat your reaction. Write down everything as soon as possible after it happens, even things you think aren't really symptoms or aren't significant.Symptoms can vary greatly, which not only means that many people remain unaware of their condition, but also that doctors lack the information to diagnose them properly.
Generalized itching, particularly when accompanied by welts or hives, can be more common. A tightness in your throat and difficulty breathing or swallowing is a common symptom of anaphylaxis, but it may not be a symptom you have.
Other symptoms include nausea, low blood pressure, sudden loss of muscle strength or motor control, fainting, lightheadedness, and headaches.

, Exercise-induced anaphylaxis may be caused by a mild allergy you have to something else. This could include an allergy to shellfish, wheat, or any number of other food or drug products.Your allergy may be so mild that you don't even realize you have it until you start exercising shortly after exposure to the antigen. Your increased temperature and heart rate as a result of exercise causes you to have an exaggerated reaction.
However, you won't know if this is the cause unless you get tested for these common allergies.
If allergy tests reveal the cause, you have a simple way to stop your legs from itching when you run – avoid exposure to whatever triggers an allergic reaction.
Prescription antihistamines also may help you, but you'll need to talk to your doctor about which drugs are safe for chronic use.

, Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a rare but serious condition, and episodes can be difficult to predict. If your doctor diagnoses you with this condition, you'll need to make arrangements so you can continue to run without endangering your life or well-being.Your doctor will teach you about preventative measures you can take to avoid another episode, and may instruct you to wear a med-alert bracelet. You also may need to carry an epinephrine auto-injector with you when you run in case you need to thwart an episode.
If you are diagnosed with exercise-induced anaphylaxis, you should avoid exercising alone, even if your symptoms are controlled or you go for a long period of time without experiencing any symptoms.
Keep in mind this doesn't mean you can never run again. Part of the nature of exercise-induced anaphylaxis (if that is your ultimate diagnosis) is that it comes and goes. You may have no symptoms for months or even years, and then suddenly have another episode.

Identify what you don’t like about them.,
Reflect on your personal history.,
Assess whether you possess the personality traits that you dislike.,
Avoid taking it too personally.,
Set reasonable expectations for your working relationship.,
Use relaxation techniques.",How to Work with Someone You Dislike1," Take a few minutes to reflect on the specific traits that annoy you. Perhaps they have an annoying voice, tend to be disorganized, obnoxious, or speak with an overly aggressive tone. Once you have an idea of the specific traits that annoy you, it will be easier to figure out a way to address the situation., Considering the traits that you find disagreeable in them, think about whether you have been annoyed by these traits or characteristics in previous relationships. By connecting your disagreeable experience of them to your personal history, you will be better prepared to manage your relationship with them.


For example, if they use an aggressive tone of voice that reminds you of a family member, remind yourself that it isn’t necessarily this particular individual that annoys you. Rather, it is the experience of being addressed with an aggressive tone of voice.
If they tend to arrive to meetings in a haphazard or disorderly fashion that annoys you, consider whether this behavior reminds you of other individuals you have had trouble with in the past. Remind yourself that it is the behavior that annoys you and that the individual may have other redeeming qualities.Also, keep in mind that we all have triggers. Certain things the person says and does may trigger you and cause you to react in a negative way. Try to become more aware of your triggers.

, If you are annoyed by a personality trait in a colleague or other working relationship, consider whether you have this or a similar trait. If this is the case, you may dislike the individual because they remind you of similar flaws in yourself.If the individual is disorganized and always arrives late to meetings, consider whether your dislike of this behavior relates to any of your own experiences of being disorganized or late.
If the individual speaks with an aggressive or mean tone of voice, consider whether your dislike for them relates to any personal experiences with anger or aggression.

, Remember that their behavior towards you may have nothing to do with you at all. If they are behaving poorly towards you or others at the workplace, this may be the result of any number of factors that have nothing to do with you such as their family, upbringing, or schooling., Consider what expectations you have in your working relationship with this individual and whether these expectations are realistic. You may have expectations that are based on prior experiences of working with someone else in a similar role. If you think your expectations are too high, adjust them so they are more realistic.If your expectations are based on what you want your ideal colleague to be able to accomplish instead of the actual skillset of your colleague, you may have to adjust your expectations.
If your former colleague was highly responsive on email and your new colleague tends to be slow, you may have to adjust your expectations and anticipate a longer response time.

, If you find it hard to avoid reacting negatively to the person you dislike at work, you might benefit from using relaxation techniques. Try meditating for five minutes at the beginning of your work day or taking deep breaths when things get hard.For example, try taking three deep, slow breaths when you feel anxious or stressed out in a meeting with the person you dislike. By using relaxation techniques, you can diffuse feelings of anger, anxiety, or stress that may arise in response to the person you dislike at work.


You can use a meditation application such as Calm or Headspace. These medication apps allow you to design short meditation sessions and give you mediation instruction. You can download them on your smart phone and use them at home or at work."

Set boundaries.,
Use email and skype instead of face-to-face meetings.,
Engage other colleagues to help you deal with them.",How to Work with Someone You Dislike2," It is important to set personal boundaries with the person you dislike at work. Setting boundaries may include not discussing personal or family matters in the workplace, not sharing a personal cell phone number, and limiting the number of projects you work on together. By setting clear boundaries, you will know you only have to deal with the individual you dislike in certain situations at work and only in relation to work related matters.Avoid giving them your personal cell phone number.
Tell them you are only comfortable talking about work related matters and that personal topics are off limits.
If they ask you for your personal cell phone number, you could say: “Sorry, I actually prefer to use my work number. You can call me there and I’ll answer as soon as I can. You can also contact me on email. Hope you understand.”
If they invite you to the bar after work, you might say: “Sorry, I have a prior engagement this evening. I also like to keep my work life separate from my personal time. Hope you can understand.”

, If you have a choice between a face-to-face and a skype meeting with the person you dislike, choose the skype meeting. Meetings on skype tend to be a little more perfunctory and it can be easier to avoid small talk. Alternately, see if you can cut down on meetings and get more coordination done via email., If you have to interact with the individual you dislike in order to get a project done, see if any work friends are willing to help you out. Although you may dislike them, you may have a friend at work who has a better working relationship with them. If this is the case, they may be able to help you by taking on the brunt of the work that needs to be done with the individual you dislike.

Separate yourself from them in time and space.,
Work remotely.,
Schedule days and times when you can work away from them.,
Eat lunch at a different location.,
Avoid participating in extracurricular activities with them.",How to Work with Someone You Dislike3," If you have a flexible office space that allows you to work in more than one room or location, work in spaces that are far away from them. If you have some control over your work schedule, try to get shifts that do not coincide with their shifts. Find ways of working that limit the time and space you share at work., Although it might be difficult to work remotely all the time, you may be able to arrange working remotely every once in a while. Ask your boss if it is possible to work remotely on a particular day of the week or once a month. You can look forward to working remotely, since you won’t have to deal with the person you dislike in any face-to-face situations., If you are working with them on a number of projects, try to schedule meetings so that you have some time every week when you don’t have to interact with them.You might try moving a few meetings so that you have one day a week when you don’t have to interact with them at all.

, If you know where they eat lunch every day, you may as well avoid this location. If there is only one lunch room, try taking a walk at lunch time or driving to a nearby restaurant. This will cut down on the time you have to spend with the individual you dislike., Limit the time you spend with them outside of the workplace. You can find out if they are going to work parties, workshops, or other events and plan accordingly. If there are options that allow you to attend the event without seeing them, such as the same workshop offered on different days, take advantage of those options.If you are forced to attend the same event, prepare yourself in advance by doing some relaxation activities such as deep breathing or meditation.

Call a friend.,
Avoid gossip.,
Tell them your needs.,
Offer constructive feedback.,
Greet them.,
Forgive them.,
Discuss the difficulties over coffee.",How to Work with Someone You Dislike4," If you are experiencing a difficult working relationship, call a close friend or family member to vent. Your friend may be able to offer some perspective on your experience. It will also help to get the experience off your chest., You should avoid chatting about the person you dislike behind their back. If you gossip about them, you may end up gaining a reputation as someone who is judgmental or mean. If you feel a desire to have your opinion about this individual confirmed by others, talk to friends or family members who have no relationship to your workplace., If you find yourself frustrated because the person you dislike is not meeting your basic needs at the workplace, try telling them in a direct and constructive tone. They may not know how to meet your expectations, so give them some directions:


If they have an annoying trait such as a loud or obnoxious voice, you might try saying: “It would really help me if you were able to use a calm tone of voice in the meeting this week. Sometimes you have a loud voice and I find it a bit unnecessary, so if you can just tone it down a bit, it would really help me. Thanks so much.”
If they have an annoying problem with staying on time, you might try telling them: “I really need to get home on time today. If you don’t mind, can we start the meeting on time this week so I can get home to my family. We have an important evening that I do not want to miss.”

, It may be the case that the individual you dislike is exhibiting poor behavior because they have never had constructive feedback about it. If you give them good, constructive feedback, they may be able to adjust their behavior in a positive way.If they have a tendency to interrupt you and others at meetings, you might try saying: “I’ve noticed you have a tendency to interrupt myself and others at our weekly meetings. I know you don’t mean to do this. However, it makes it difficult for people to finish what they are saying and can disrupt our conversations. It would be really great if you could work on your listening skills and try not to disrupt myself or others at our meetings.”

, Try to create friendly atmosphere in your interactions with them. When they come into the office in the morning, greet them with a friendly “Hello” or “Good morning!” When they leave the workplace in the evening, remember to say “Good evening, see you tomorrow!”, If you have disliked them for a long time because of their behavior in the past, you may find it useful to forgive them. Although you may or may not feel they are deserving of forgiveness, it can be a real burden on you if you hold onto your anger or otherwise avoid forgiving them. Find a moment to forgive them or, at the very least, forgive them in private.Take them aside after a meeting and tell them you forgive them.
If you feel unable to forgive them, try practicing in front of a mirror.

, Tell them you want to grab a coffee and ask when they are free. At your coffee meeting, tell them you feel there has been some tension in your working relationship and that you want to talk about it.If it is an old relationship, try saying: “I know things have been difficult in the past, but let’s try to put that aside for the time being and really focus on getting this project right. I think we could try staying on schedule more often and really attending to client needs. What are some things you think might help?”
If it is a new working relationship, you might try telling them: “I feel we have gotten off on the wrong foot. Can we try things a little differently from here on in? I think it would be help if we avoided talking over one another and really listened to each other’s perspectives on everything.”

Focus on maintaining a wide grip on these exercises and using your full range of motion. Be sure to breathe properly through these exercises and keep your back as straight as possible, except when doing supermans where the goal is to arch your back.
When exercising your back, proper form is imperative to prevent injury. You may want to have a personal trainer or experienced weight trainer evaluate your form.

, You don't have to go to a gym to strengthen your shoulder muscles.You can also use weights at home.


If you are at a gym, or have a weight bench at home, you can do military presses with the bar or with dumbbells. Stand holding the bar at your shoulders, using an overhand grip, or hold the dumbbells at your shoulders and then extend your arms overhead.
Raise the bar or dumbbells over your head and then lower the weight to your shoulders. Do two or three sets of this exercise.
For arm raises, stand holding your arms at your sides, with or without dumbbells. Raise each arm each arm straight in front of you. Raise the dumbbell to shoulder height, then lower to your side. Do two or three sets of this exercise as well. You should feel the burn in your shoulders.
Check your breathing, and make sure you raise and lower the weights in a controlled way, moving at roughly the same speed.
You can also do slow arm circles with dumbbells in your hands to work all of your muscles at once. Try standing on one leg as well for a balance challenge.

, If you're working out with free weights or hand weights, these basic lifts target your chest and triceps muscles.To do a bench press, lay on your back on a weight bench with the bar over your chest. You also can do similar exercises using hand weights and laying on the floor. Bend your elbows and rest the dumbbells over your shoulders as a starting position.
To perform a fly, start with the dumbbells resting on your chest as you lie on your back. Push the dumbbells up and away from your body towards the ceiling and then slowly lower your arms out to your sides. Don't let your elbows go lower than your torso, at least when you are first learning this exercise. Then, contract your chest muscles and push the dumbbells back up so your hands meet, with your arms fully extended above your chest. Repeat.
Your movement should be controlled. Lift and lower the weight with the same speed – don't simply drop the weight after you've lifted it.
Pay attention to your breathing. You should exhale as you lift and inhale as you lower the weights. Don't tense up or hold your breath while doing these exercises.
Do two or three sets of each exercise, making sure to warm up by doing arm circles, shoulder circles, or jogging in place for a few minutes.

, Ideally, you want to strength train for 15 to 20 minutes a day two or three days per week. Focus on different muscle groups each day, making sure that you work out all your major muscle groups.For example, you might plan on two lower body days with ab/core work and one upper body day.
Make sure you plan a day of rest in between each of your strength training sessions. You may want to do light cardio such as walking on your off days so that you stay active.
One good thing about strength training is that if you are diligent, you may notice positive results in only a few weeks. The results will motivate you to keep going.
However you schedule your strength training, make sure you do it consistently. Switching up the days or times you exercise can impact your recovery process, which could slow your results.

, If you already have an exercise routine, you can build strength training into it by incorporating resistance bands or weights into the various moves in your routine.For example, the band can be anchored under your foot, or around a door knob, or over a closet railing or coat hook, or even tied around your legs. There are a multitude of exercises you can perform using resistance bands or therabands. Hold the band in place by putting part of it under your foot. Then, hold either end of the band in your hands, pulling it tight.

, Doing simple weight-lifting exercises such as curls and lifts will strengthen your muscles. Do a higher number of repetitions with lighter weights to avoid bulking up., If you find weight lifting intimidating, you can still add a strength training component to your workout routine. These weights wrap around your wrists or ankles to add resistance to bodyweight exercises.However, don’t wear these weights for too long. Wear them for a specific number of reps or for up to a minute at a time. Otherwise, you will put too much stress on your joints.


You can purchase wrist and ankle weights at most discount stores or at any sporting goods store.
If you're not looking to make a significant investment, look for used equipment at a thrift store or online auction site.
Try to find weights that will allow you to gradually increase the weight, so you can step up your resistance over time as you build muscle strength.

, A personal trainer or other expert can provide you with important tips to make sure your strength training routine will be effective. They also can check your form to make sure you're doing the exercises properly to achieve your desired result.It isn't necessary to hire a personal trainer to work out with you every day – you can hire someone for a single session to go over your routine with you and give you pointers.
If you have a local YMCA near you, they may offer low-cost sessions with a personal trainer that can help you assess your goals and build an effective strength-training regimen.
You also may benefit from using an exercise video or reading books about strength training for middle-aged women.
However, if you're getting your advice from a video or a book, keep in mind that this information is not personal to you and may not necessarily apply to your body or your situation.

, Even if you are trying to lose weight, you can't build muscle if your body thinks it's starving. Eating at least once every two or three hours maintains the right nutrition level necessary to build healthy muscle.Ideally you should attempt five or six smaller meals. However, if you can't work that into your schedule, have your three regular meals along with three or four healthy snacks.
Stock up on fruits and vegetables you can snack on, as well as healthy nuts such as almonds.
Try to eat at least 20 minutes before you plan to exercise, and then have a snack again about 20 minutes after your workout is finished.
For example, you might have a protein bar 20 minutes before your workout and a cup of yogurt 20 minutes after.

, Protein is essential to build muscle. If you're working on strength training, particularly as a middle-aged woman, you won't realize significant results unless you're eating enough protein.Include a balance of protein from different types of foods so you don't get tired of eating the same thing every day.
For example, eggs are a good way to get protein at breakfast. Dairy foods such as yogurt make good snacks. For lunch or dinner, you can add some protein with a chicken or turkey sandwich.
If you're a vegetarian or vegan, make sure you eat plenty of beans, legumes, whole grains, seeds, nuts, and soy products. Vegetables such as broccoli and spinach also are sources of protein.

, Fruits and vegetables have nutrients your body needs – many of which you can't get from any other source.Getting nutrition from food, rather than simply taking supplements, is the best way for your body to absorb and process the nutrients you need.
Fruits and vegetables also can fill you up so you don't feel hungry soon after you've eaten, despite the fact that they are low in calories.
Limit or avoid simple carbohydrates like pasta, rice, and bread. Low-carb diets can help with weight loss.

, Processed foods contain chemicals that your body doesn't recognize as food. Eating too many processed foods can result in weight gain that diminishes your strength-training results.Check the ingredient labels of any prepared food you eat and look for sugars. You'll often find it added to foods you'd least suspect.
Eating fresh, rather than frozen or pre-packaged foods, is the best way to avoid unnecessary preservatives and overly processed food items.
Check sugar content carefully on any protein or granola bars you get for snacks as well. Some of these products are advertised as healthy or low in fat, but still contain significant amounts of sugar.

, You don't need fancy sports drinks if you're doing a basic strength training routine. However, you do need to make sure that you're drinking plenty of water, and that you're drinking it throughout the day – not just when you exercise.Generally, you want to drink between 8 and 10 glasses of water. If you have a glass of water every time you eat, and you're eating six times a day, you've already fulfilled most of your quota right there.
Avoid sodas and other drinks – even ""diet"" versions – as they can supply you with too much sugar and cause weight gain. Soft drinks also can dehydrate you, making you more thirsty than you were to start with.
If you have trouble drinking water, you might consider adding lemon or other natural flavors to make it more palatable.
Gradually decrease the flavoring until you can drink plain water with no problem.

, Failure to warm up for at least five to ten minutes before you begin a strength training routine can result in muscle or tendon tears.Your warm up routine should always include exercises that warm up your core.

, If you're using weight-lifting equipment or machines, whether in a gym or at home, make sure everything is in proper working order before you begin your routine. You also want to inspect the area around the equipment for safety hazards.Move the equipment and make sure it is functioning as it is supposed to, without any loose screws or uneven movement.
Wipe up any puddles or slick spots that could cause you to lose your footing or grip.
Pay attention to your own clothing as well. Make sure you're not wearing anything that could impede your movement or interfere with your exercises.
Tie your shoelaces in double knots and confirm that the soles of your shoes won't get hung up on anything or cause you to slip while you're exercising.

, One of the main causes of injury during strength training is poor form while working out. If you cannot do an exercise using the proper form and technique, you should try something else instead.A personal trainer can be your best source to check your form and make adjustments if you're doing anything incorrectly.
If you don't have anyone to check your form for you, try to complete your exercises in front of a mirror so you can watch yourself. Find a picture or video of someone doing the exercise correctly, and compare yourself to them.

, If one muscle group is stronger and more developed than another, you can cause significant strain to the weaker group – particularly when you are doing exercises or activities that work your whole body.This sort of muscle imbalance also puts undue stress and strain on your joints, which can lead to significant injury.
If you've divided your strength training over the course of several days, don't skip a day if it will result in uneven development of different muscle groups.

, You should never take on more weight or resistance than you can handle. Make sure you can do an entire set of a given exercise completely and with good form before you contemplate adding weight.It often is more beneficial to increase the number of repetitions you're doing rather than increasing the weight.
When you increase weight or resistance, you may want to decrease the number of repetitions you do – at least at first – until you get used to the added weight.

Review what actions constitute unfair labor practices under the NLRA.,
Talk to your union representative.,
Call an NLRB information officer.,
Gather witnesses and evidence.,
Get a copy of Form NLRB-501.,
Fill out your form.,
Make copies of everything before you submit.,
Have your charge served on your employer.,
Take your form to your local NLRB office.,
Talk to the NLRB investigating agent.,
Provide additional details of the incident.,
Work towards a settlement.,
Wait for the decision of the regional director.",How to Report an Employer to the Labor Board," Even if you view an action taken by your employer as unfair, it may not fall within the NLRB's jurisdiction.


Unfair labor practices generally relate to employer interference with your right as an employee to organize with other employees and discuss work-related issues.One way it does this is by prohibiting employers from making rules regarding communication among employees about the union that differ from the rules for other communication about anything else.For example, suppose you have an employee bulletin board in the break room where employees can post fliers and signs about things they think would interest their co-workers. If your employer allows fliers about yard sales or lost dogs, it can't forbid signs about unions or employee organizing.
Employers also cannot refuse to engage in good-faith collective bargaining with employees, or discriminate against employees on the basis of their union membership.If your employer has committed an unfair labor practice under the NLRA, you can only enforce your rights by filing a charge with the NLRB – you cannot file a private lawsuit.;
, In some cases your union representative may be able to help you alleviate the issue in a quicker and more efficient way.


The charge process with the NLRB can take months or even years to conclude, and in the meantime, your employer may continue to violate your rights.If the problem isn't widespread throughout the company, your union representative may be able to negotiate and settle the issue with your employer more quickly.Keep in mind that you only have six months after the date of the incident to file a charge with the NLRB. This deadline won't be extended because you're taking other action to attempt to resolve the dispute., An information officer can provide insight into the charge process and answer any questions you may have.


The information officer can listen to your report of the incident and let you know whether it actually constitutes an unfair labor practice, which potentially saves you a lot of time and wasted effort if it turns out the action isn't covered by the NLRA.Information officers also can walk you through the steps to filing a charge and help you make sure your charge form is filled out and filed correctly., Before you file your charge, talk to co-workers and find out if anyone else is willing to support you.


Although you don't have to include any of this information on your initial charge form, it's a good idea to get the information together ahead of time.
You also want to get a good sense of whether anyone will stand with you and make a statement in support of your charge. If you can't find co-workers who are willing to support you as witnesses, you'll have a much more difficult time persuading the NLRB to act in your favor.

, The NLRB uses a standardized form for employees filing unfair labor practice charges against their employers.You can download the form from the NLRB website and fill it out on your computer, or you can get a paper copy of the form at your nearest NLRB office.You can locate a regional office using the NLRB's map, available at https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/regional-offices, or by calling 1-866-667-NLRB., Your initial charge form should include basic information about you and your employer with a brief description of the incident that forms the basis of your charge.Provide the date of the incident and a brief description of what happened. Your description should only be a sentence or two – you aren't expected to provide extensive detail about the incident in your charge form, or a comprehensive list of the evidence or witnesses you've lined up in support of your charge.Include your name and contact information. Although a summary of the charge will be published on the NLRB website once your form is accepted, your name and contact information will not appear.If you're filing your charge as an individual, you should include your own name and contact information. However, if you're filing on behalf of a union, you may want to use the union's name and official contact information., You will need at least one copy to serve on your employer and another for your own records.


Review the information you entered carefully and make sure all your answers are complete and accurate before you sign it. Double-check addresses, dates, and names.
When you sign your charge, you are declaring that you have read it and that the statements in it are true. If you intentionally make a false statement on the form, you may be subject to fines, imprisonment, or both., NLRB rules require you to have your charge served on your employer so it has notice that a charge has been filed against it.It is illegal for your employer to fire you because you filed a charge with the NLRB.Some regional offices have your charge served on your employer for you. The information agent will be able to tell you if the office will take care of this or whether you must do it yourself.

, You can either file your charge online or take it to the NLRB field office in person.


If you file your form online, it will be forwarded to the regional office that has jurisdiction over your employer.Although additional documents aren't required, you can submit any evidence you have in support of your charge along with your form.When you file online, you'll receive an email confirming receipt of the charge and assigning an Inquiry number. Make note of the number, because you'll have to include it on any supporting documents you later upload to the NLRB's online system., An agent will contact you to find out details about the incident that formed the basis of your charge.


The investigating agent has the responsibility of reviewing the incident that serves as the basis of your charge and determining whether it constitutes an unfair labor practice under the NLRA.You can generally expect to be contacted within a few weeks after your charge is filed. If you haven't already submitted any evidence or documentation that supports your charge, the investigating agent will ask you to do so.

, The investigating agent should know everything you know about the incident, including any documents you have or names and contact information of co-workers who witnessed the incident.


As the agent investigates your charge, he or she will take testimony from you and named witnesses and compile written affidavits. Make sure you get a copy of your affidavit for your own records.If the agent determines your employer has not violated the NLRA, you will be asked to withdraw your charge. If you refuse to do so, the NLRB will dismiss it.

, If the agent finds enough evidence to support your charge, he or she will mediate between you and your employer in an attempt to reach a settlement of the issue.The regional director will only file a complaint in federal court if you and your employer are unable to reach a settlement of your claim.Depending on the subject matter of your charge, the regional director may ask the federal district court to issue an injunction ordering the employer to take certain actions, such as reinstating employees who were wrongfully terminated., After the investigation is complete, the regional director will decide whether to file a complaint against your employer.


Typically a decision will be made within 7 to 12 weeks of the date you file your charge, although it may take longer if your charge is more complex.If a complaint is filed, the case will go for a hearing before an administrative law judge. At this point, the NLRB becomes your representative throughout the hearing and any settlement negotiations that transpire after the complaint is filed.Keep in mind that the NLRA does not grant the NLRB authority to assess penalties against employers for violating the act. It can, however, seek remedies designed to make you whole, such as back pay or reinstatement if your employment was terminated for acts the NLRA protects."

Determine your goal.,
Learn how to read a Weightlifting tempo.,
Choose a good tempo for your goal.",How to Utilize Weight Lifting Tempo," If you want to build your muscles as big as possible then you want to focus mainly on longer tempos. If you want to be a strong, and fast athlete then you want to focus on shorter tempos.;
, This is an example - 1/0/1/0. The first 1 means that the weight is lowered in 1 second. The first zero means that there is no pause at the bottom. The second 1 means that the weight is lifted in 1 second, and the last 0 means there is no pause at the top.

, If you're a beginner looking to build big muscles then use a 3/0/1/0 tempo. If you're a beginner looking to build speed and strength, use a 1/0/1/0 tempo. After a while you may be using an even longer tempo for building muscle such as 4/1/4/1. And when you're really fast, you may be lifting weights and bringing them back down in less than a second.

, Sets are the number of times you will complete your reps. Sets can either contain multiple exercises, or you can complete multiple sets of the same exercise before moving on to another exercise.For example, you may decide to do three sets of 15 reps of three to five inner thigh exercises. Alternately, you may complete three sets of 15 reps of wide squats before moving on to three sets of 15 reps of plank jacks.
Generally, doing three to five sets is good, depending on your fitness level and number of reps.

, Part of working your inner thighs at home is figuring out how often you will work them. Three to four days each week of inner thigh exercises is a good number of workouts. However, spot training won’t get you results. Combine these exercises with cardio, strength training, and healthy eating for the best results.You shouldn’t work the same muscles every day, so place at least one rest day between your workouts.

, Start by moving your feet wide so that you are standing slightly wider than shoulder-width. Your toes should be slightly pointed out. Lower yourself down into a squat position. Hold for a second, and then stand back up.Make sure to keep your knees over or behind your feet. Don’t let your knees push past your toes.

, Get into a wide squat stance, with your feet wider than shoulder-width. Lower down towards your left side, bending your left leg and straightening your right leg. The toes on your right foot should be pointed straight up, towards the ceiling. Extend your arms straight out in front of you.Come back to start and repeat the same movement on the other side.
Make sure your knee stays behind your toes and doesn’t push forward over them.

, Hold on to a sturdy chair, countertop, or other surface. Your feet should be around hip-width apart with your toes straight ahead. Put a medium sized soft ball, towel, or pillow between your thighs. Place your other hand on your hip and lift your heels. Balance yourself on the balls of your feet.Lower yourself by bending your knees and moving down about an inch like you were sliding down a wall. Squeeze the ball with your inner thighs. Your body should stay straight, with your shoulders over your hips and ankles.
Staying on the balls of your feet, raise your hips and straighten your legs as you bring your free hand over your head. You should still be squeezing the ball.
Lower again to repeat. Complete your reps on one side before switching and doing the same number of reps.

, Get in a wide squat position. Raise up onto the ball of one of your feet, keeping the other flat. Bend the knees a few inches. This is your starting position for the pulse. Drop your butt down only a few inches, then quickly raise the few inches. Continuously pulse up and down for your number of reps.After you are finished with that side, straighten your leg, then raise the opposite foot.
You can also pulse for a set amount of time, like 30 seconds, instead of reps.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean your weight onto one side and lift the other foot off the ground. Step your foot diagonally behind you. Bend both knees as your lower yourself down. Push through the hell to stand back up, kicking your leg to the side.Complete your number of reps on one leg before switching legs.

, Lie down onto your back with your knees bent. Place your feet flat on the floor. Place a medium-sized rubber ball or folded beach towel between your knees. Squeeze your inner thighs together against the ball and hold for at least 30 seconds.Relax your thighs for around 10 seconds.

, Start with your feet shoulder-width apart. Jump and spread your feet wider with your arms overhead, like the first movement of a traditional jumping jack. Then, jump and bring your legs back in, crossing them and landing in a scissor jack.Your right leg should be crossed over in front, the foot around your left hip, and your left leg should be crossed over in the back, with the foot under the right hip.
Your arms should be crossed in front of your hips.
Jump again out to the wide stance with your arms above your head. Then, jump and crisscross your legs again, switching which leg is in the front and back.

, Lower yourself onto your hands and feet into a plank position. Make sure your shoulders are over your wrists and your back is straight. Keeping yourself stable, jump your legs out as wide as possible. Then, squeeze as you jump them back together.If you have a slick surface, you can place towels, paper plates, or gliding discs under your feet and slide your legs wide and squeeze them back together instead of jumping.

, Lie on your back with your legs held straight up. Flex your feet, place your heels together, and turn your toes so our feet make a V shape. Lower and bend your knees, pushing your legs outwards and keeping your feet together.Squeeze your inner thighs as you straighten your legs.

, Lay on your right side on a yoga mat. Keep your back straight, bend your arm, and place your upper body weight on the bent arm. Bend your left knee and bring it over your right leg so that the foot is perpendicular to your straight right leg. Straighten your back and raise your neck. Flex your abdominal muscles.Exhale and raise your right leg up and straight as far as it will go. Stop if your hips start to move or your back starts to curve. Hold the leg at the top for 1 second.
Inhale and lower the leg slowly.
Complete all the reps on one leg before switching sides.

, Lie down on your back with your legs flat on the floor. Raise both legs a few inches off the floor. Then, raise one leg higher, then lower it as you raise the other leg, making a scissoring motion. Do this 10 times.Then, scissor your legs sideways by crisscrossing your legs. Make sure a different leg crosses over the top each time. Do this for 10 reps.

, Lie on your side with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Fold the arm closest to the floor and lay your head on it. Press your feet together as you lift your top leg, opening your legs like a clamshell. Squeeze your inner thighs are you lower your leg.Complete all the reps on one side before switching sides.

Pace yourself.,
Push yourself.,
Work out regularly.,
Work as much of your body as you can.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Work Out1," People are as varied as grains of sand on the beach, but no matter what your current level of physical health, one maxim remains true: don't overexert your body on a regular basis. Whether you run triathlons or are just now starting to take a daily walk, the fact is that if you injure your muscles through overexertion, you'll have to take a break from exercising those muscles while they heal.;
, Though at first glance this seems to contradict the above point, the truth is, exercise won't do you very much good if you don't continue to test and push your boundaries. The trick is to do it safely and in a controlled manner. If you ran two miles yesterday and felt worn out later, don't try to run five miles today. Instead, find a level of exertion that leaves you feeling worked and a bit stiff the next day, and then try to slightly add on to the intensity of that level every couple of weeks.

, The more often you can find time for exercise, the better, generally speaking. Authorities recommend exercise seven days a week, but even three days a week is better than one. Whatever time you can set aside, do so.

, The more parts of your body receive exercise, the more you'll notice exercises' positive effects on your weight, muscle tone, mood, stress levels, sleeping patterns, and overall sense of well-being. As always, any exercise is good exercise, but some is better than others. Lifting free weights, for example, works more muscle groups than using targeted weightlifting machines. Try to mix in some exercise for every part of your body, if you can.

, Maintaining the energy you need to exercise starts with getting enough sleep, and eating a balanced diet. You don't have to overhaul every aspect of your life just to start exercising, but if you want to feel energized, you'll need to at least make sure you get some good sleep every night and enough nutrients to not run your body ragged.


For example, your body processes lean proteins into energy better than fats, and it gets more benefits out of the vitamins in vegetables than in pills, since they're easier to break down and contain more complex compounds.

Spend time on cardio exercise.,
Lift weights on a schedule.,
Work your core.,
Work your hips and legs.,
Work your arms and shoulders.",How to Work Out2," Cardiovascular or “cardio” exercise is arguably the best single type of exercise in terms of how well it reduces your chances of dying young, since it works your lungs and heart above all else. The most basic types of cardio exercise are walking, jogging, and running, but many other types of exercise have a cardio component as well, including swimming, martial arts, and biking.


Try to work at vigorous cardiovascular exercise for 30 minutes or more every day. If you can't manage 30 minutes, fifteen minutes is still better than nothing. Less than fifteen minutes has little effect on your health.
A cardio exercise machine, such as a treadmill or exercise bike, may be used in lieu of actually jogging or biking, if needed.

, As opposed to cardio exercise, weightlifting (also called resistance training) works the muscles in your body, such as those in your arms, legs, chest, and abdomen. Proper weightlifting is done by finding your maximum lift for a given exercise, then repeating a lift at about 80% of that weight to help build strength. Because you're asking a lot of your muscles whenever you lift weights, most experts agree that it's best to alternate your lifting, doing any particular lift no more than 4 days out of the week.


You can choose to do all your lifting on a given day, and skip it entirely the next, or you can focus on one area of your body one day and the other the next.

, Your core is your torso, particularly your lower back and stomach. This is the foundation of strength elsewhere in your body, so it should be a top priority in any fitness regimen that includes weight training. Standing lifts, such as clean lifts and overhead presses, will work your core, as will sit-up exercises and many others.


Your core is more than just your abs. Combine sit-ups, push-ups, planks, and other such simple exercises into a comprehensive core routine to work your entire torso for the best results.

, Next to your core, your legs are the pillars of your strength. Strong legs give you more stability and safety when doing other kinds of lifts, too.


Learn to do a back squat. This basic bar exercise is a great way to work many muscles in your body at once. It particularly works your hips and legs, but is also good for your core strength.

Start in a weight frame with the rack set at about chest level, and a bar with weights resting in the rack and across your shoulders, behind your head.
Look straight ahead and grip the bar firmly, with your hands farther apart than your shoulders.
Take one step back to remove the weight bar from the rack. With your feet flat and shoulder-width apart, take a deep breath and hold it as you rest the weight on your shoulders and bend your knees, lowering the bar smoothly.
Squat so that your knees and toes roughly line up, with the weight coming down onto your heels. Maintain a straight back and bend at the hips instead. Pause briefly at the bottom of the squat.
Push off through your heels and drive the weight back upward, exhaling as you do so. Return the bar to the rack.



, Though strong arms don't support strength elsewhere in the body, they're still useful and important to develop.


Learn to do a bench press. This is a classic upper torso and arm exercise that's great for building upper-body strength. You'll start by reclining back on a weight bench, with the weight bar in a rack above your head.

Lift the bar off the rack and center it over your upper chest, arms outstretched.
Take a deep breath, hold it, and smoothly lower the bar to your chest.
Pause just long enough to change direction, then exhale and smoothly lift the bar away from your chest until your elbows almost lock.
Pause for a second, then carefully return the bar to the rack.

Understand the differences.,

Learn a few basic poses.,
Try the Bridge pose.,
Give the Downward Dog position a try.",How to Work Out3," Yoga isn't bad for your cardiovascular system by any means, but the exercise it offers is endurance training, not cardio exercise per se. That being said, yoga styles can vary widely between types. The general format of any yoga is to learn a position and attempt to master it while holding it for a sustained period of time. Most of the basic forms are the same across all types of yoga, but the specifics and more advanced forms are often different.

, Though yoga can be practiced in private, no amount of reading online or watching videos can take the place of a good instructor. He or she will teach you all the nuances of proper form, and give you important feedback on what your mistakes are so that you can fix them early on.

, Yoga doesn't require anywhere near the level of equipment that weight training does, but there are still some useful items you'll want to have:


A yoga mat is a thin, soft mat that unrolls so that you can hold poses on it without sullying yourself on the floor (and vice versa). Most classes require that you use a yoga mat.
Yoga clothes can be anything that's comfortable, lightweight, and either flexible or loose enough to allow you to reach positions without being restricted by your clothing. Many people wear special yoga pants and a tank top, but you could also wear such things as bike shorts or well-fit jogging pants.
The yoga block is a small rectangular block designed to provide extra support for those still learning positions that are difficult for them. Most people find a yoga block useful for at least some of their positions. Yoga blocks may become unnecessary for advanced practitioners, but they're generally a wise investment.

, The following few steps describe some of the simplest and most common poses in yoga. Of course, nothing beats an actual yoga teacher, but if you want to get some idea of what the exercise feels like, try these out at home first. Be sure not to strain or injure yourself. The first pose is the Mountain pose, a standing pose.


Stand straight, tall, and evenly balanced on both feet, with your arms at your sides and your feet close together.
Take a deep breath and lift your hands from your sides, keeping the palms facing each other, until they're all the way overhead. Reach upwards with your fingertips and hold.

, This pose can put some strain on your lower back if you aren't careful, so practice it gently.


Lie back on your mat and scoot so that your knees are lifted over your heels. Your lower legs should be straight up and down from knee to heel. Your butt and upper legs will naturally lift off the ground.
Clasp your hands together under your lower back and push off of your flat arms, raising your hips until your thighs are roughly parallel with the floor.

If you're nervous about straining your back, you can put a few pillows or a yoga block underneath your tailbone for support.


Push your chest towards your chin, lifting the rest of your back except your shoulder blades off the mat. Hold the pose for one minute or so.

, This face-down position is a good general position, working many different parts of your body at once.


Go down on all fours like a toddler, with your hands below your shoulders and your knees below your hips, lower legs trailing behind on the ground.
Walk your hands out a few inches past your shoulders, and press into the mat with outstretched fingers.
Curl your feet onto the floor as you push your hips up towards the ceiling slowly. With your feet about hip-width apart, keep lifting until your knees are only slightly bent, so that your body forms a triangle. Hold the position for 3 breaths.

Learn the benefits.,
Choose a sport.,
Find a way to join a team.,
Learn the rules of the game.,
Show up for everything.",How to Work Out4," Sports are obviously good for you, but more specifically speaking, most team sports are good for your cardiovascular health, since they require running or sprinting on a regular basis. Team sports are also good for hand-eye coordination. In many cases, when you join a league (even a casual league), you will find resources available for you and your teammates to do some weightlifting, as well.

, Not all team sports are equal in terms of health benefits. At the top of the heap are sports like soccer, basketball, and hockey, that require most players to stay in motion constantly. Less common sports such as crew (rowing on a team), racquetball, and doubles tennis are also excellent in this regard. Below that are sports like baseball, curling, and cricket. Though these sports are very physical and still provide great exercise, they provide it in smaller segments, with downtime in between.


Given that all sports are good for you, it's probably best to choose one you personally enjoy over one that seems to be healthier.

, If you're in school, this is easy: even outside of varsity sports, there are often intramural leagues, casual games during lunch, or after-school programs available. As a working adult, the task of finding a team can be a bit more daunting. Check local fitness centers, such as your neighborhood YMCA, and ask about what leagues they offer or know about.


You'll usually have to sign up in advance to join an adult sports league before the season begins. Have more sports or other exercises in mind for when the season ends.

, Referees and umpires are usually on hand to settle disputes, but it's still to your advantage to brush up on the rules of your chosen sport, even if you've played it recently. WikiHow is a great source for abbreviated rules of many popular team sports.

, Like any form of exercise, you'll get the most out of playing a sport if you keep at it regularly. In addition to practice sessions and games, try to find a partner or a group to exercise with on off days. This will help you get in even better shape while building bonds with your teammates.

Warm up.",How to Tone Your Body with Towels1," Preparing your muscles for exercise is vital to injury prevention, especially with sliding exercises that require stabilization. Go for a run outside, jump rope, or do jumping jacks (at least 40 repetitions). Dynamic stretches, such as high kicks, high knees, and butt kicks also aid in stretching out your muscles.

Learn the benefits.,
Learn about the different styles.,
Find a trainer.,
Stay focused on exercise.",How to Work Out5," Martial arts, which first became popular in the United States after World War 2, come in a staggering array of styles, with origins in nearly any country you can think of, each with a different set of standards, moves, and principles to master. However, nearly all of them rank among the best exercise you can get in terms of calorie burning.


Many martial arts, like wrestling and karate, provide an intense whole body workout; others, such as judo (the sporting form of jujitsu) and aikido, are less intense and should be supplemented with other types of exercise.
No matter which you choose, if you can handle extra exercise, it will provide benefits. This is why boxers, for example, also train with aerobic exercise and weightlifting, rather than just footwork and punching.

, There are practically as many types of martial art as there are other sports combined. All of them provide a good workout, so learn a bit more about the ones that sound interesting to you by doing research and visiting classes. Most instructors don't mind letting you sit in on a class; some even offer a free class to new students.


In east Asia, martial arts can be roughly divided between “internal” and “external,” or “soft” and “hard” martial arts. Internal arts, such as ba gua, favor circular motions and techniques that redirect force; external arts like karate favor angular motion and the direct application of force.
Europe is the birthplace of modern wrestling, kickboxing, and fencing, but also of a number of other, lesser-known martial arts, such as pankration (a Greek art) and bataireacht (Irish stick fighting).
Brazil is known for a groundwork-heavy variation of traditional Japanese jujitsu, called Brazilian jujitsu, that has become very popular in recent years due to its effectiveness in cage fighting and general self-defense. Brazil is also the home of capoeira, a flashy mix of dance and martial arts that relies on acrobatic body movements.
India, Russia, Israel, Indonesia, the Philippines, and many other countries also have their own unique martial arts to offer.

, Martial arts are almost exclusively taught in classes, because they require complex and precise physical movements that take a lot of repetition and practice to master. You might find yourself thinking you want to get into a relatively exotic fighting art, like the Malaysian art of tomoi, but then discover that there are no tomoi teachers in your area. It's important to find a martial art you can practice locally.


Check your local listings online or in the yellow pages for teachers offering classes in the styles you'd like to try.
Ask around local colleges or community colleges to find out about community education programs they might offer.
Again, test the waters before you commit. Don't pay for more than one session up front, and see if you can sit in on a class for free first. Paying for a month of lessons before you know what you're in for is a bad idea.

, Different martial arts emphasize different things. Modern military martial art forms, such as Israeli Krav Maga, emphasize quick, crippling or lethal moves at close range, whereas older styles may focus on using weapons such as staves and swords that aren't commonly seen anymore. Still others, such as boxing, wrestling, and judo, are almost entirely centered on sporting competition. Whatever the case with your chosen art, remember: you're there to work out first and foremost. Try to settle on a martial art that provides you with a good, vigorous workout, and offers enough training sessions for you to get regular exercise.

Focus on the lowering portion of the exercise.,
Do eccentric overload training once per week.,
Maximize the eccentric load.,
Use a controlled eccentric phase of one to three seconds.",How to Use Eccentric Training1," To do eccentric overload training, you need to focus your efforts on the lowering part of each of your exercises. By focusing on the eccentric or lowering part of the exercise, you can build more muscle, strength, connective tissue and flexibility.You need to lower the weight in a controlled rhythm.If you are doing a bench press, focus on the lowering of the bar to your chest.
If you are doing squats, focus on the part where you move your body into the starting position.
If you are doing bicep curls, focus on the lowering of the weight away from your body.;
, Accentuated eccentric or eccentric overload training involves pushing yourself in both the concentric and eccentric phases of weight training, but with slightly more emphasis on the eccentric phase.Since it takes a long time to recover from this type of training, you should only do it once per week., In order to see any benefits from eccentric training, you need to use more weight during the eccentric (lowering) phase than in the concentric (lifting) phase. There are three main ways of increasing your weight load during the eccentric phase:Lift a weight with two limbs and then lower it with one limb.
Ask your weight lifting partner to press down on the weight during the lowering phase.
Use lifting aids such as eccentric hooks that you attach to the weight prior to lowering., When you are lowering the barbell after a bicep curl or other exercise, you should take no longer than three seconds. Your muscles will not grow as much if you use longer eccentric phases during your weight training.Faster eccentric contractions are associated with more muscle building potential."

Do a band-assisted nordic.",How to Use Eccentric Training2," Cable exercises allow for a more natural range of motion. They are excellent for eccentric training because they involve a great range of motion, which helps pack on muscle.Focus on the eccentric phase of cable exercises. Try integrating the following four cable exercises into your eccentric routine:Standing cable chest press.
Standing cable pull-throughs.
Low-to-high chops.
Single-arm, single-leg row.

, Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart on the ground in front of you. Put your feet at hip width apart on the ground behind you. Keep your whole body straight.Slowly lower yourself to the ground. It should take you ten seconds to reach the ground. Then, push yourself up with a burst of energy. The concentric phase should be one second.Try two sets of ten eccentric pushups.

, Get into starting position, with your feet slightly wider than hip width apart. Slowly, lower your knees towards the ground for a count of ten seconds. Then, push yourself back up towards the starting position. The concentric phase should last one second.Perform two sets of ten squats.

, Hold the barbell with your palms facing down. Bend your knees and move your whole torso slightly forward. Keep your back straight. Breathe out and lift the barbell towards you.The lifting phase should last one second. Then, lower the barbell for a count of five., Kneel on the ground. Secure your ankles and engage your core. Let your arms fall to your sides and look straight ahead.Breathe in and then gradually lower yourself to the ground. Keep your core engaged and your torso straight.Finally, press yourself back up to the starting position.Ask a partner to hold your ankles for the duration of the exercise.If you are training alone, you should find a low bar or railing. Place your ankles underneath the bar, so that you will be supported during the exercise.
If you can’t find a partner or a bar at the gym, you could use barbells. Place your ankles underneath the barbells. You will need heavier weights of at least thirty-five pounds.

, You may want to try the band-assisted nordic, especially if you are having a hard time lowering yourself slowly during the last stages of the eccentric movement. To get the benefits of the full range of motion, tie a band to a piece of weight lifting equipment behind you. Hold it with your hands as you perform the nordic lift.The resistance from the band will allow you to lower yourself slowly and receive the benefits of the full range of eccentric motion.

Warm up prior to eccentric training.,
Do dynamic stretching prior to training.,
Begin with fewer repetitions.,
Maintain correct exercise form.",How to Use Eccentric Training3," It is very important to do a warm up routine prior to eccentric training, since you will be challenging your body in a new way. Do a warm up activity for five to ten minutes prior to your exercise routine.You should warm up at a a low level of intensity that allows you to easily have a conversation with a friend while doing the activity. You could try one of the following warm ups:Jog on a treadmill or outside.
Ride a bike for ten minutes.
Use the rowing machine for ten minutes.

, After warming up, you should do some dynamic stretching to maintain range of motion and prevent injury. Dynamic stretching involves continuously moving through a stretch, rather than holding a stretch. Try some of the following stretches:Make arm circles in both directions.
Touch your toes and then reach up to the ceiling.
Kick your legs.

, Since eccentric training often involves a long recovery period, you should start out by doing fewer repetitions of your usual exercises.As you build up strength and muscle mass, you can build up your repetitions.

, Maintaining proper form is important for preventing injury and properly targeting muscles during strength training.It is especially important to maintain correct form when doing eccentric training. If you are not sure how to do an exercise, you should consult with a physical trainer or kinesiologist.

Equate muscle movement to muscle tone.,
Work against time.,
Start with a whole-body exercise.,
Arrange for a body fitness test performed by a personal trainer.,
Get minimum recommended activity levels.,
Increase your workouts to four or five days per week.",How to Tone Your Muscles1," Muscle atrophy, or the decrease in muscle tone, is usually due to inactivity of muscle groups. Prolonged sitting and resting can cause significant atrophy in as little as one week.Muscle groups that are required for resistance to gravity atrophy more slowly than those that are built up through exercise. Significant studies have been performed with astronauts losing tone thanks to decreased gravity.;
, Some age-related atrophy begins at age 20. This means you will need to work a little harder as you age to keep the muscle you already have.

, Trade in walking, cycling or rowing for swimming, elliptical machines, yoga or a cardio burn class. A whole body workout will improve allover muscle tone more than one that only targets your upper or lower body.


Unlike fat burning, which can’t be targeted to one area of the body, muscles can be selectively built and toned.

, Your trainer can perform a complete body assessment to find out how much muscle tone you have, and which areas or your body you need to target.

, Adults should be doing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise throughout the week and strength training at least twice per week to develop healthy muscle tone., A recent study found that “chronic” or frequent exercise prevented muscle loss and preserved lean muscle mass in adults.Again, muscle tone is linked to high activity levels.

"

Aim to do strength training two to three times per week with a day of rest in between.,

Give preference to dynamic, compound exercises over single motions.,
Sign up for a personal training session to tailor a 30-minute weight training session.,
Incorporate body weight exercises into the workout.,
Stretch after each weight training session.",How to Tone Your Muscles2," Keep this up consistently to improve tone in your muscles. Extra muscle tone and strength will also help to burn excess fat.

, (2.2g) weights. Your aim is to reach muscle fatigue, where you can’t do another rep, after two sets of 10 repetitions. Add or subtract weight in order to reach this goal.


Elderly men and women should start with two to three lb. (0.9 to 1.4kg) weights.
Strength training to muscle fatigue will not build bulky muscles. Instead, it will strengthen your muscles and improve resting tone.

, For example, a squat can require you to use of your legs, hips, buttocks, abs and arms, while bicep curls only work your arms. The more muscle groups you use, the better., You can also go on YouTube and view the correct form for each of the following exercises: squats, lunges, tricep dips, chest -flys, rows, bicep curls and tricep kickbacks.Opt to do them with small free weights or do the equivalent on weight machines.

, Include at least planks and push-ups.


To do a plank, get on your hands and knees. Move your feet back so you are balanced between your prone feet and hands. Ensure there is a straight line between your ankles and head. Contract your stomach muscles deeply and hold the position for 30 seconds to one minute. If you can’t hold for 30 seconds, work in 15-second increments.
To do pushups, get on your hands and knees. Move your feet back into a plank position. Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the ground. Move slowly and deliberately with your abs contracted the whole time. Do two sets of 10 repetitions.
With either exercise, you can modify into a knee-plank, where you rest your knees on the ground and lift your ankles up. Create a straight line between knees and head.
To decrease the weight on your wrists, grasp a hexagonal dumbbell under each hand.
To decrease the weight on your shoulders, rest your upper body on your forearms, instead of your palms.

, Give your body 24 to 48 hours to rest and recover.

"
"
Start with planks.,
Work on improving your posture.,
Do twisting exercises.,
Add resistance gradually.,
Try push-ups on an unstable surface.",How to Strength Train As a Runner1," A strong core will help you hold your form together even as your muscles are fatigued, which can be critical to preventing injury. This is particularly important toward the end of your run, when your legs are beginning to tire.To do planks, get on all fours on the floor, then raise up onto your toes and hands, keeping your body in a straight line. Hold this position for about a minute, then release, repeating three to five times.
If a full plank is too difficult for you to hold and maintain deep breathing throughout, you can modify by starting on your knees and elbows or forearms. If you're on your knees, your feet should be off the floor.
You can increase the difficulty of the plank by placing your hands or forearms on an unstable surface, such as a balance ball.;
, Your posture is one of the most important factors in perfecting your running form. If you routinely sit or stand with poor posture, that carries over into your running and can negatively affect the efficiency of your stride.Use the vertical compression test to check your posture. While standing, get a friend to stand behind you and press their hands down evenly on your shoulders. Your posture needs work if this vertical compression causes your spine to arch or buckle.
Another way to test your posture is to try the ""chair of death."" This test assesses whether your glutes are being properly activated. All you have to do is stand in front of a chair with your knees against the seat. Your feet should be under the chair, your arms straight out in front of you. Squat, and try to keep your knees from pushing into the chair. If they do push into the chair, that means you aren't using your glutes properly.Single-leg balances are a good way to work towards improving your posture. Strengthening your core and back muscles also will help improve your posture.

, Twisting exercises work the muscles in the sides of the torso. When they are strong, these muscles help stabilize the spine, hips and rib cage.A balance ball works well for twisting exercises and provides a greater challenge for your core because you have to maintain your balance while simultaneously performing the exercise.
One good twisting exercise with the balance ball is the Russian ball twist. Set the ball in front of a bench and get into a plank position with your hands on the bench and the ball under your feet. Lift your right foot off the ball and pull your knee in and upwards, across your body. Pay attention to your back and correct any arching or curving. Put your right foot back on the ball and do the same pull with your left foot. Do three sets of 10 to 14 repetitions, with each leg pull counting as a single repetition.

, When you begin core strength-training exercises, your own body weight may provide enough resistance – particularly if you've never done any strength training before. Over time, you'll need more resistance to continue building muscular strength.Adding too much weight at once can overly strain your muscles, leading to soreness or injury. Add weight incrementally, and stay at one weight for several sessions before adding more weight.
For example, if you're doing strength-training exercises using three-pound dumbbells, you might want to up your resistance after a month and work out with five-pound dumbbells.
Don't use a weight that's too heavy for you to complete all necessary repetitions of an exercise with proper form. If you find yourself straining or slumping, drop down to a lower weight.

, You have increased body awareness if you're in an unstable position, because you constantly have to make balance corrections. The unstable surface engages and strengthens your core, since you're using your core muscles to keep you stable.Put your hands on a balance ball, in slings, or simply place a pair of dumbbells on the floor in front of you and grip them as you do regular push-ups. Keep your feet on the floor as you would for regular push-ups.
Keep your thumbs pointed forward. This will keep your shoulder blades aligned down your back with your shoulders rotated outward, which will also improve your posture by keeping you from hunching.

Build explosive strength with squat jumps and box jumps.,
Improve balance and stability with an exercise ball.,
Increase your repetitions.,
Train in intervals.,
Get adequate rest between sets.",How to Strength Train As a Runner2," Whether you're a long-distance or short-distance runner, you want speed and power off the starting line. Jumping exercises, known as plyometric exercises, build fast-twitch muscle strength to give you greater explosive power.To do squat jumps, start out by doing a regular squat. After squatting down, instead of rising back up normally, explode upwards from the deepest point of your squat. Focus on landing as softly as possible. Do as many repetitions as you can with proper form in 30 seconds or a minute.
For box jumps, you'll need a box, step, or other stable platform. Jump on the box, then step back down gently rather than jumping back down. Do as many of these as you can do with proper form in 30 seconds or a minute. You can increase the difficulty by jumping from a further distance, or by using a higher box or step.

, Exercise or stability balls are great tools for increasing your muscle endurance while also working in a balance element. Requiring you to maintain balance while performing any exercise means that you're engaging your core as well as any other muscles.Building core strength will improve your endurance.


For example, one exercise that is good for improving balance and stability along with building strength in your glutes and hamstrings is the stability ball leg curl. Lie on your back, arms flat by your sides, with your feet and lower calves resting on the stability ball. Contract your glutes to raise your hips, rolling the ball toward you with your heels. Stop when your body is in a straight line from your shoulders to your knees, then roll the ball back in a slow, controlled way as you extend your legs straight again. Do three to five sets of 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, If you don't want to build bulky muscles, you should do a lot of repetitions at a very low weight. As the exercise becomes easier, add repetitions rather than weight.Doing high repetitions with a low weight increases your muscle endurance, which is what you need to increase your distance running and the length of time you can run.

, If one of your motivations for strength training is to run faster, high-intensity intervals are an efficient way to build muscle endurance and explosive power. Set your intervals by length of time rather than number of repetitions of any given exercise.Intersperse intervals of cardio and plyometric, or jumping, exercises with static strength-training exercises such as lifting weights.
Alternate muscle groups worked in each exercise to avoid fatigue. For example, if you do an exercise that targets your upper body, follow it up with an exercise that targets your lower body. This gives the muscle groups you just worked a little extra time to recover.

, If you are lifting moderate weight and doing sets with 10 – 15 reps, you only need to rest about 45 – 60 seconds between sets. If you are lifting heavy weights, doing about six to eight reps, then you can rest up to two minutes between sets.


This may seem foreign for distance runners, but muscle endurance and cardiovascular endurance are two different things that use different energy systems. Allowing for full recovery gives the skeletal muscle fibers time to repair. It is the micro tearing and then repairing process that makes your muscles stronger.
To reach full recovery, it isn't necessary that you sit or stand completely still. Have sips of water during the rest period, and walk or jog lightly.

"
"
Focus on compound exercises.,
Build hip strength and stability with lunges.,
Use dumbbells for bench presses.,
Include barbell squats.,
Do one-legged rows, curls, and presses.",How to Strength Train As a Runner3," Exercises that work several muscle groups at the same time make your time in the weight room more efficient, so you can spend more time running and less time in the gym.For example, if you're doing a lower body exercise, such as squats, you can turn it into a compound exercise by adding a dumbbell press to work your arms, back, and shoulders.
Using a stability ball or other fitness tools that require you to maintain balance will add a core component to any exercise.

, Lunges build strength in your quadriceps, hip flexors, and glutes, important muscle groups for runners. Hold dumbbells to add resistance to this exercise.Step out into the lunge position holding your dumbbells at your sides, arms straight. Lower your hips, bending your back leg. Keep your knee straight over your ankle and your spine neutral. As you lower, don't let your back knee touch the ground. Rise back to the starting position and repeat 10 to 15 times. Then switch sides.
You also can do this exercise while holding the dumbbells up at your shoulders to add an upper body component to this exercise. To compound this exercise, do the lunge and then lift or press the dumbbells from the squat position, then return to the starting position.

, When you think about a bench press, you probably think about using a barbell with massive weights attached to either side. But using dumbbells instead makes this a much more flexible exercise that can improve upper body strength and stability.Start in a seated position with the dumbbells in your lap. Slowly lean back until your back is resting on the bench or stability ball. Lift the dumbbells towards your shoulders, palms facing each other.
Extend your arms forward and away from your body. Slowly lower the dumbbells back towards your shoulders. Repeat.
You can raise and lower both at the same time, or you can alternate arms (something you couldn't do if you were using a regular bar).

, Barbell squats increase your lower body strength as well as getting your upper body to work in tandem with your lower body. This can improve any imbalance you have in strength between your upper and lower body.Place the weight on the barbell and hold it over your shoulders, behind your neck. Make sure to keep your spine neutral and avoid crunching your neck. You may want to practice by holding a dowel down your back to make sure your back is in proper position.
When you squat, take care that your knees don't push out over your feet. Your knees and shins should stay aligned vertically as you hinge from your hips and contract your glutes to initiate the squatting motion.
Do one to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions of this exercise.

, Doing standard weight-lifting exercises while balancing on one leg helps build back and hip strength and stability, which over time will greatly increase the economy of your running stride.Use a dumbbell in one hand for these exercises, so you can hold a bench or bar to help balance. Extend one leg straight out behind you and find your balance on the other leg before you begin the movement.
Bend over so that your body forms a capital ""T"" shape. Your back should be neutral, shoulders dropped down your back, so there is a straight line from your shoulders to the heel of your back foot. Be careful not to hunch over — your back and extended leg should be parallel to the floor.
Begin with your arms extended towards the floor, then lift your elbows up towards your rib cage. Hold the contraction and then slowly lower the dumbbells.
Do one set of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise, then switch and do the same set while balancing on the other leg.

Keep going with your lift in cycle and do variations of your non-cycles lifts that do not stress the back.,
Modify your set/rep schemes.,
Take OTC pain medication and vow to make changes in your routine.,
Sleep on your back and sides.,
Question your motives, goals and training methodology for the quality of your life, and your health, if you are persistently pursuing a personal record and with acute, lower back pain.,
In daily life, use good form when reaching down.,
When stretching avoid the standing, forward bend stretch.,
Consume enough protein and consume them at every meal.,
Practice excellent form in your lifting.",How to Work Around Lower Back Pain in Pursuing a Personal Record," As long as the interval between sessions, of the lift that is in cycle, do not exceed three weeks you can still progress. Rest is the most important factor in dealing with lower back pain and the other main factors are workload, choice of exercises in your routine and form.;
, An example of a strength lift, not in cycle, is doing pull-ups or pull downs instead of bent over rows. An example, of an auxiliary exercise change, is to do recumbent cycling instead of cycling.

, Minimize warm ups set and reps for your lift in cycle and lifts not cycled.


If your set rep scheme is set 1 10 reps, set 2 10 reps, and set 3 (your top set) 10 reps, reduce your workload by doing just 5 reps for set 1 and 3 reps for set 2. All that matters is your top set, your personal record is for your top set and not your warm up sets.
If you do legwork exercises like running or agility drills, merely reduce the total time you spend on them. When in a few weeks, your are thru with your cycle, resume your normal routine of running and everything else.
Increase your poundage or reps in smaller amounts for your cycled lift. Improvise with smaller weights beside plates. Weight plates go as low as 1.25# making the weight jump 2.5#, so with improvised weights the advantage is to make the weight increases below 2.5# by using weight plates cut in half, wrist weights, fishing lead taped one, short pieces of chain etc. If using a fixed weight, repeat workouts with the same weight or do a partial, last rep.

, Check the long term effects of these medications. Do not rely on these drugs in the long term, unless you are an elite athlete or have factored in the risk/ reward of them.

, If getting a back massage, have it done sitting and as upright as possible. Virtually all positions where you are bent forward (or facing down) at the waist standing, sitting or lying results in back tension. If you are on a massage chair and leaning on the chair, the benefit from the massage might be cancelled by the back tension of leaning forward. Sitting, in a slightly reclined position, in a whirlpool bath is a better option.

, Have a balanced life and physical routine (strength, speed, agility, endurance, active rest and flexibility).

, Reach down by bending you legs and hips. Do not bend over only at the hips.

, Do stretching exercises that do not stress or cause pain to your back

, The muscles of the lower back require a long recovery time to grow - be patient. Having enough rest, is far more important than meticulously watching your protein intake. Investigate the negative effects of excessive protein intake.

, When your form degenerates, and it is not correctable, it should mark the end of your cycle. Read about the causes of disc herniation. Your lower back pain should be from long periods of stress and not from using incorrect form. See your internist and get referred to a specialist if you have spinal pain.

Finish wrapping your knee.,
Make sure it isn't too snug.,
Decide if you need to wrap your knee.,
Use a wrap as a preventative measure.,
Avoid using knee wraps on serious injuries.,
See a doctor.",How to Wrap Your Knee," You need to have the right materials to wrap your knee. You need to buy a knee wrap, also called a compression bandage. These can be bought at any general store or pharmacy. The most popular brand is ACE, but you can also find other brands to buy as well. You also need something to hold the bandage on with. Most bandages come with elastic clasps with metal hooks, but in case your bandage doesn't, you can tuck the bandage into itself.


You can also buy self-sticking bandages, which use adhesive on their surface to stay snug. Others have velcro along the edge of the wrap. Choose whichever one you think is best for your situation.
You can also buy different sizes of bandages as well. Buy the size that you feel will fit your knee best.;
, When wrapping your knee, you need to make sure you are in the correct position. First, have a seat in an open area where you have plenty of room to move around. Next, extend your right leg out in front of you. There should be plenty of extension in your leg, but it should also be relaxed, with just a bit of passive comfortable flexing in your knee.


Make sure there is enough room to move your arms around your leg. This will ensure that you have room to work on your knee., When you start, hold the bandage in your hand. Make sure it starts out rolled up. This will make it easier as you wrap it around your knee. Position your hand with the wrap in it about two inches below your knee joint. Take the loose end of the bandage and place it just under the joint with your hand. Hold it there with that hand while your other hand moves the bandage around your knee. Wrap it all the way around once until the wrap comes around to meet the loose end. Pull it snug to secure it.









Make sure to wrap over the end you started with and put a twist (or two, so that the roll returns to its original position) in the bandage directly above the end to hold it in place.
Hold the roll so that the flat side without the roll bundle is against your leg. It will be annoying to wrap it the other way. If you're not sure which way is correct, unroll the bandage on a table. If it unravels, that's the right way. If not, turn it over.
The wrap should be level as you start to go around your knee., As you move the wrap around your knee, keep it just snug and work your way up your leg from below the joint. Work your way around the joint, leaving about one finger breadth of space between the bandage and your kneecap. Continue until you have completely wrapped your knee joint. Add one more twist of the bandage at the topSecure the end with whatever fastener the bandage has, such as velcro, adhesive, or fasteners.









If you want to cover your knee cap with the bandage, loosen the tightness of the bandage around the kneecap to avoid excessive pressure on the joint. The strength of the wrap should be snug above and below the kneecap.The wrap should extend from approximately two inches below the joint and two inches above the joint. The joint itself is about one and a half inches, so the total area of your leg that should be wrapped is approximately five to six inches.
If you don't have any sort of fasteners, you can tuck the last few inches of the bandages under the twists.

, You need to be careful with the amount of pressure you wrap your knee with. The bandage should be snug but not too snug. To check how snug it is, place your index finger underneath the bandage. You should be able to fit your index finger in between the wrap and your skin. The bandage should feel supportive because it provides additional stability, not as if it might cut off your circulation.









If it is too tight and you can't fit your finger in between the bandage and your leg, rewrap your leg with a looser hold.
Even if you can get a finger under the wrap, check for signs of circulation loss. If the bandage is leaving an indent or mark in your skin, loosen it. If your toes or lower leg start to go numb, it also needs to be loosened.Repeat the procedure on the opposite leg if needed, following the same method.

, There are multiple reasons to wear a knee wrap. Many people who exercise will wrap their knees as a means of giving their knees a bit of additional support while they exercise. Some people do it if they have had a partial tear in a ligament and are seeking some external support. Weight lifters will also wrap their knees prior to doing squats to give the joint some additional stability.


If you have or think you have sustained an injury, make sure your see your doctor before performing any strenuous activity.

, Knee wraps are not generally used to treat a severe injury or condition. Knee wraps are used for the prevention of injury or knee issues. They provide a bit more stability and external support to the joint of your knee when it is put under extreme stress.


The only kind of treatments a knee wrap is used for are first degree sprains of the knee. This can only be diagnosed by a healthcare provider.
If you sustain any injury, see your orthopedic surgeon. The risk of getting injured again or misdiagnosing can cause serious damage.

, There are many instances where a wrap is not needed. If you have an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear or any other ligament tear, do not treat it with a knee wrap unless explicitly instructed by your orthopedic surgeon. It would also not be appropriate to simply wrap your knee with a medial or lateral meniscus tear.


If a knee wrap helps an injury and your surgeon sees no problem with using this method while you wait for an upcoming surgical repair, then you can use it.
Never use this as a means to stabilize a grossly unstable joint for purposes for recreation.

, If you feel that, despite wrapping your knee, you have been injured, see your physician right away. Only the doctor can diagnose exactly what is wrong with your knee. The doctor may advise you to wrap your knee injury if it is a grade I injury for purposes of stabilization only.


If your wish to start or resume physical activity, seek medical attention first to see if your injury has healed. "

Spray the gym’s mat before and after use.
Wear comfortable clothing that allows movement.;
, Keep your back flat on the ground, and keep your torso straight. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor.








Be sure that your back is flat against the floor. There should be no space between your back and the floor.

, Rest your fingers at the tips of your ears. Avoid positioning that could lead to yanking the head, such as resting your head in your hands. Your elbows should be flat out to the side.

, Make sure to keep your shoulders even., Make sure your head and shoulders are slightly elevated. Imagine that you are trying to touch your right elbow to your right hip. Keep your lower back and hips stationary on the floor.








Keep your elbows pointing straight out to the sides. Don’t bring them too close to your head.

, Do not lower your head or shoulders. You should be in the same position as a standard crunch.








Use your abs to lift your shoulder blades off the ground, taking care not to pull your shoulders toward your ears or tuck your chin toward your chest.Only lower your head and shoulders if you are starting to feel too uncomfortable. Readjust and begin again. Don’t overdo it if you are too uncomfortable.

, Perform exactly the same movement as you did on the right side. The only difference should be the side you’re moving towards.







, Keep your abs tightened and crunch from side to side. Treat each side as a separate repetition and set. Make sure to do an even number of crunches on each side., Repeat until you've completed three sets. When you can do 10 to 15 reps with ease, increase the number of reps up to 20 or 25. In order to effectively build your muscles, each set should bring you to temporary muscle failure.








Gradually repeat the number of repetitions over time. Don’t increase the number of repetitions until the number you are currently doing feels easy.

, In order to start seeing and feeling results, aim to do three sets two to four days a week for eight weeks. For faster results, combine this exercise with various other abdominal workouts.


Always give yourself a day of rest between abdominal workouts. This allows damaged muscle fibers to heal before you work them again.

, If you want to intensify your workout, hold weights while doing your crunches. You can use hand weights or weight plates. Two to five pounds is recommended if you do not lift weights often.Hold the weights close to your chest.

, To make this exercise more challenging, do not keep your feet flat on the floor. Instead, raise your bent knees to table-top — it should look as though you are resting your calves on a table."

If you push too hard and too fast, ignore underlying health conditions, or fail to give your heart a proper workout, you may end up doing more harm than good.Consult your physician about your current risk factors for heart disease and an overall assessment of your heart health. From there, you can work together to develop an appropriate exercise regimen for strengthening your heart and, in the process, hopefully reducing your risk for cardiovascular issues.;
, Unlike other muscles, you heart is always working. However, long stretches of sedentary behavior like sitting provide no impetus for your heart to grow stronger. Even standing instead of sitting, or pacing around instead of standing still, will make your heart work a bit harder. Replacing a sedentary lifestyle with a more active one can help strengthen your heart and reduce your risk of heart disease by half at the same time.Even just thirty minutes of mild to moderate physical activity per day can benefit your heart health. One thirty-minute walk or three ten-minute walks each evening are enough for most people to gain some benefits.

, In addition to getting up and moving around more often, you should focus on getting two and a half hours of moderate exercise per week in order to strengthen your heart muscle. Alternatively, and depending on your fitness level and your doctor’s advice, 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week will achieve the same results.To achieve moderate exercise, your heart and breathing rates should increase, but you should not be so winded that you are unable to carry on a conversation. For many people, activities like brisk walking, dancing, raking leaves or gardening, or playing with children or pushing a stroller constitute moderate exercise.Divide your workout into time intervals that work for you. Exercise in intervals of ten minutes or more at a time, depending on your schedule. Don't skip exercise just because you can't perform for 30 minutes or more continuously.
With vigorous exercise, you will be breathing hard enough that it will be difficult to carry on a conversation. In either case, work with your doctor to determine the right level of exercise for your heart.

, There are no weight-training exercises that specifically benefit your heart, because it is a unique muscle with a distinctive function. However, regular strength training will give your heart a workout and improve your overall fitness level, which in turn makes it easier for your heart to function properly.To build and maintain muscle and benefit your heart muscle, aim for two to three strength training sessions per week. Depending upon your fitness level, these sessions may or may not involve the use of weights. Once again, consult with your physician about the type of strength training that is right for you. Pushing too hard or using improper technique could end up hurting your heart.

, Excessive amounts of saturated fat, sodium, and sugar constrict or clog up blood vessels and make your heart work harder in the wrong way, by creating an inefficient or even damaged cardiovascular system. On the other hand, heart healthy foods can support proper, efficient heart function and facilitate the strengthening of your cardiovascular system.Whole vegetables and fruits contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber that can help prevent plaque development in blood vessels. The fiber in whole grain foods is likewise beneficial in this regard.
Lean proteins like chicken, fish, beans, and lowfat yogurt offer important nutrients without excessive saturated fat. Some lean proteins also provide omega-3 fatty acids, which in basic terms help lubricate your blood vessels and keep your cardiovascular system running smoothly.
The most recent version of the official U.S. dietary guidelines was released in January 2016, and it focuses on making adjustments to your individual “eating pattern” to include a wider variety of healthy food choices. The guide also includes sample U.S.-style, Mediterranean-style, and vegetarian-style eating patterns for inspiration, and recommended daily amounts of various foods based on age, sex, and activity level., A growing body of evidence indicates that moderate alcohol consumption can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, perhaps by as much as one-third. Going beyond the recommended limits for moderate consumption, however, negates this benefit, and excessive alcohol consumption opens you up to a host of possible health problems, heart-related and otherwise.One to two standard-size alcoholic beverages per day (up to 14 per week) is considered ""moderate,"" and seems to produce the greatest cardiovascular benefit. Averaging 15 or more drink units per week begins to negate this benefit, and consuming 21 or more units weekly (or more than four in any single day) is generally considered excessive and thus harmful.
One drink unit is in about half a pint of normal-strength beer, two thirds of a small glass of wine, or one small pub measure of spirits., The average adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep nightly, yet many fail to reach that average. The heart, like every other part of the body, needs a regular period of relative rest to recharge for the following day. Sufficient restful sleep enables your heart and body to be revitalized, and also can reduce stress levels and blood pressure.If you wake up in the morning without the aid of an alarm and feel refreshed, that is a good sign that you are getting enough sleep.
Studies have indicated that people that get between 7-9 hours of sleep per night have less calcium deposits in their arteries (which impede blood flow) than those who get either less or more than this recommended amount of sleep.How to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease addresses the need for adequate sleep, along with providing useful information on a range of topics like exercise, diet, smoking cessation, and stress reduction.

, In addition to getting an assessment of your current heart health and recommendations for strengthening it, discuss your concerns about and risks for developing cardiovascular disease with your physician. Along with lifestyle changes, talk about whether certain medications may be right for you. If you do decide to take medications, take them as prescribed and report any side effects.For instance, your doctor might prescribe statins to reduce bad cholesterol, beta blockers to reduce blood pressure and heart rate, or calcium channel blockers that relax arterial walls. Or, you may be prescribed a daily low-dose aspirin, which thins the blood and thus makes blockages less likely.Modern medicines can do wonders, but in the end it is up to you to make the necessary lifestyle changes to strengthen your heart and reduce your risk of cardiovascular troubles.

, Making your heart work harder through proper exercise is beneficial and strengthens the muscle. Making it work harder because of narrowed or blocked arteries creates inefficient functioning and greatly increases your risk of ailments like heart attacks and strokes. Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and/or blood sugar are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but they can be improved with diet, exercise, and medication.LDL or “bad” cholesterol sticks to arterial walls and reduces blood flow, while HDL or ""good"" cholesterol helps keep clean arteries clear. LDL cholesterol levels can be lowered by a combination of reducing intake of saturated and trans-fats, exercising more, and possibly taking cholesterol-lowering medications like statins under the care of a physician.
High blood pressure refers to an increase in the force of blood pressing on arterial walls, which can cause damage that makes arteries more susceptible to blockage. A blood pressure reading of 120/80 (systolic/diastolic) is considered normal, while a systolic reading of at least 140 or a diastolic reading of at least 90 usually indicates the need for remedial action via diet, exercise, and possibly medication.
Elevated blood sugar levels, even before reaching the point of a diabetes diagnosis, can also damage arteries and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Here again, diet, exercise, and (if prescribed) medication are the keys to reducing blood sugar levels.

, Chemical compounds in tobacco contribute to atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries), while the carbon monoxide in smoke replaces some of the oxygen in your blood. These changes increase the heart’s exertion while making it more inefficient, and also make arteries more susceptible to blockage.No amount of exposure to smoking or other tobacco products is safe, and quitting can be a very difficult process. Thankfully, even longtime smokers gain health benefits almost immediately after stopping. Five years after quitting, former smokers have about the same risk of cardiovascular disease as comparable non-smokers.
Take a look at How to Quit Smoking if you want some good ideas on how to quit.

, Carrying excess body weight is essentially a gateway to many of the risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Being overweight can make your heart work harder in order to function normally, which is not the type of workout that strengthens the heart muscle. Excess weight in the midsection seems particularly conducive to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.While it is far from a perfect measure of an individual’s weight status or possible need for weight reduction, your Body Mass Index (BMI) can serve as a useful guide. A BMI of over 25 is typically associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Consult with your doctor regarding your ideal BMI range and your target weight loss goal (if needed).

How to Lose Weight the Healthy Way provides a wide range of advice on shedding pounds smartly.

, Living with excess stress can negatively impact your sleep patterns and increase your blood pressure, both of which can be damaging to your cardiovascular health. The first step toward reducing stress levels is identifying your stressors; from there, you can utilize the “Four A’s” of stress reduction — avoid, alter, adapt, and accept — to develop effective ways of managing your stress.Avoid: Reduce your exposure to sources of stress. You can avoid stress in many different ways, such as leaving earlier to avoid traffic, declining additional work or responsibilities, or changing who you spend your time around.
Alter: Attempt to reduce the severity of a stressor by changing the source. This could be done by changing your own behavior or communicating with others about theirs. For example, you could ask your partner to cook dinner one night if always cooking stresses you out. You can also try to reduce the amount of time you're exposed to stressors; for example, if you are really bothered by a certain neighbor, tell yourself you'll only go to the neighborhood barbecue for an hour.Adapt: Change your expectations and standards to better match your reality. Identify negative thoughts when they start, and try to replace them with positive thoughts or images to improve your mood and motivation. Attempt to place activities and events in perspective to identify what is important to you in the long run and what is not. For example, if you're late to work, remind yourself that it's just one day and you were only five minutes late, rather than feeling guilty about it for the whole day.
Accept: In some cases you will have to accept a source of stress and not be able to significantly alter it. In these cases, it may help to be open with others regarding your feelings and identify positive things in your life to avoid focusing on the negative. Take these sources of stress as learning opportunities where you can learn to cope with stress well.If you need help managing stress, seek assistance from your doctor and/or a mental health professional. It can benefit your emotional and physical health, and help your heart in particular.

Land in a squat position.,
Repeat for a timed interval.,
Add weight for a challenge.",How to Do Sumo Squat Jumps1," If you've ever seen a sumo wrestler in action, you'll understand the sort of stance you need for sumo squat jumps. Your feet should be wide apart, further than shoulder width. Point your toes out slightly., For a basic sumo squat, you want to bend your knees to lower your body, pushing your hips back. Make sure your back is straight and your core is engaged. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor.Ideally, you want to lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor. If you can't go this low, go as low as you can with good form.
Make sure your knees aren't pushing forward over your toes and you're not hunching over.

, Once you've mastered the sumo squat, you're ready to add the jump. Lower into a sumo squat. As you raise up from the squat position, propel yourself upward with explosive force., When you come back down from your jump, focus on landing in the perfect sumo squat position with your shins perpendicular to the floor. It may take some practice for you to get your landing right so that you can complete this exercise with good form., Once you've got a handle on the correct for and can successfully land several sumo squat jumps in a row, set a timer for 20 to 30 seconds and try to do as many sumo squat jumps as you can with good form in that interval.Focus on quality over quantity. It's better to do fewer sumo squat jumps with perfect form than to do many of them very quickly, but with sloppy form or without going through the full range of motion for the exercise.

, If you're able to do sumo squat jumps with good form for a full interval, grab a dumbbell or medicine ball to add some resistance to the exercise and increase the difficulty of this exercise.Start with smaller weights and gradually work your way up to heavier ones.

Try squat box jumps.,
Keep your core engaged with Bulgarian split squats.,
Tone your leg muscles with a plié squat.,
Improve your balance with pistol squats.,
Balance and stretch with figure-four squats.",How to Do Sumo Squat Jumps2," Most people have a dominant leg, and it typically gets more work than your non-dominant leg. Doing single-leg squats starting with your non-dominant leg can help even your legs out.Muscle imbalances can lead to injury over time if not corrected. When doing single-leg squats, you can lean against a wall if you have difficulty balancing.

, Squat box jumps can be dangerous if not done with proper form. Make sure you use a relatively low box, and practice to get your form down correctly before you add this exercise to your regular routine.To do squat box jumps, lower into a regular squat. Instead of standing, jump onto the box from the squat position. Focus on maintaining your squat position throughout the jump. Step back to start and repeat.
Make sure both feet are landing squarely on the box, otherwise you might end up banging your shins on the edge.

, If you have a step or a stool, Bulgarian split squats provide a good lower body exercise that also engages your core to stabilize your body.Set the stool behind you so that you can rest the toes of one foot on it from a standing position with your knees slightly bent.
Place your hands behind your head, elbows extended out to the sides. Lower yourself into a squat, allowing your back leg to bend. Make sure the knee of your front leg stays over your ankle and your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise back up. Do 10 to 15 repetitions, then switch sides.

, If you've ever admired the lean legs of a ballet dancer, you might enjoy the plié squat, which borrows a position from ballet to help tone your hips and thighs.Stand in a wide stance with your toes turned out, and place your hands on your hips. Bend your knees out over your toes, lowering your body into a squat. When your thighs are parallel to the floor, raise your heels so that you're standing on your toes. Raise and lower your heels 10 times.
Return to a standing position to complete one repetition. Do five repetitions of this exercise.

, The pistol squat is an extremely difficult squat variation, but if you're relatively fit and looking for a challenge, the pistol squat could be an effective full-body exercise for you.From standing, extend your left leg out in front of you with your knee straight. Reach your arms out straight over your left leg to help you balance.
Lower into a deep squat with your right leg, going as low as you can without your left leg touching the floor. Press back up to stand to complete one repetition.
Try to work up to 10 repetitions on each leg. Make sure you do the same number of repetitions on each leg to prevent muscle imbalances.

, The figure-four squat gives your hips a good stretch as well as helping you improve your balance when standing on one leg. If the balance is too difficult, you can lean against a wall.Squat down slightly and lift your right leg, bending your knee. Cross your right leg over your left so that your ankle is resting just above your knee.
Lower down into a full squat so that your left thigh is parallel with the ground. Hold the squat for a few seconds, then release and do the other side.

Add some yoga with chair pose.,
Include lunges and leg lifts.,
Build strong calves with calf raises.,
Get explosive power with box jumps.,
Improve flexibility with a stretching routine.",How to Do Sumo Squat Jumps3," Chair pose is similar to a squat, and can help tone your thigh muscles as well as giving you some stamina. Because much of yoga centers around breathing, stand and breathe deeply, taking a few seconds to connect with your breath before you start.Press your feet together and push your hips back as though you are sitting in a chair. Lower yourself as far as you comfortably can, ideally until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor with your knees directly over your ankles, not pushed out over your toes.
Extend your arms straight overhead and hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, breathing deeply. You can also press your palms together in front of your chest.

, Lunges and leg lifts are basic lower body exercises that have a place in any workout routine designed to build lower body strength. These exercises can be done slowly, as static exercises, or quickly as a lower-impact interval.If you're doing lunges or leg lifts as part of a routine with plyometric exercises, you may want to do them more slowly and use them as a lower-intensity rest period following a high-intensity plyometric exercise such as sumo squat jumps.
Lunges also can be used as an effective warm-up interval before you do an interval of sumo squat jumps.

, Calf raises are a very simple exercise that you can do at home. All you need is a box, set of stairs, or other elevated surface. Begin the exercise by standing with the balls of your feet on the elevated surface and your heels over the edge.Keeping your back straight and your shoulders rolled back, push with the ball of your foot to lift your body onto your toes, lifting your heels as high as you can.
As you lower, make sure your body is straight as you lower your heels as low as you can. Repeat for a 30-second interval.
Make sure you're not rocking your body or pulsing as you raise or lower your heels. The movement should be smooth and controlled. If you need help keeping your body straight, hold onto a rail or the back of a chair for balance.

, Box jumps are a basic plyometric exercise you'll find in almost any plyometric exercise routine. The size or height of the box isn't important, as long as you can jump onto it from the ground.The point of box jumps is not speed, but power. Stand a few feet away from the box with your feet in a wide stance, a little more than shoulder-width apart. Lower into a semi-squat, then immediately propel your body up and forward onto the box. Step back down and repeat. Don't jump off the box – step carefully down.
You also can do lateral jumps, where you're standing to the side of the box and jumping to the side.
Focus on landing softly on the top of the box. This can take some practice, but you want to control your movement so the jump has as little thudding impact as possible.

, Close out your workout with a stretching routine that will loosen up and relax your muscles. Always stretch at the end of your workout, not the beginning.A comprehensive stretching routine can help reduce your risk of injuries and also lower the amount of recovery time your body needs.
Focus on stretching the muscles you've worked during your routine. Do static stretches, in which you move your muscle until you feel a stretch and then hold the stretch for 20 or 30 seconds.
For example, if you've done sumo squat jumps you might want to stretch your quads. Stand and bend one knee to bring your foot behind your buttocks. Grab your foot with your hand and press on the top of your foot until you feel a stretch in your quad. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then release and do the other leg.

Warm up your wrists and hands.,
Check your hand position.,
Avoid flaring your elbows out.,
Engage your core.",How to Prevent Wrist Pain During Pushups1," You may have done a general warm-up before you started exercising, but if you plan to do push-ups, you should also warm up your wrists and hands, particularly if your wrists hurt during push-ups.To warm up your wrists and hands and build flexible strength in your wrists, hold out one hand and spread your fingers.
One at a time starting with your thumb, rotate each digit a few times clockwise, then a few times counter-clockwise. Think of drawing circles with that digit. Focus on not moving any of your other fingers as you do this.
If you can't draw circles with one finger without a finger near it moving, that indicates a weakness in your hand and wrist muscles that you should work on over time. Keep going with one hand, doing your best to have only the working digit moving. Then move on to the other hand.
After completing this simple warm-up, your wrists and hands should feel warm, loose, and more invigorated than they were before you started.;
, Placing your hands too wide, or too far out in front of you, can put additional pressure on your wrist. Turning your hands inward or outward also puts your wrists at an awkward angle that can lead to unnecessary strain.While in the position you normally are for push-ups, stop and look at your hands. They should be facing forward, with all parts of your hand and fingers firmly on the ground.
If your palm is cupped or you're lifting your fingers, this puts all the pressure on the heel of your hand, which can cause wrist pain.
Make sure your wrists are directly under your shoulders when your arms are fully extended, not forward or back. It can be helpful to have someone else observe your form to make sure your hands are in proper position, so they can help you adjust if necessary.

, As a beginner, you may have done push-ups by flaring your elbows out to the sides of your body rather than keeping them close and bending them back against your body.While you may have done this because it made it easier to do push-ups when you were just starting out, continuing to use this technique can lead to excessive strain on your wrists. Flaring out your elbows also can lead to elbow or shoulder injuries over time if not corrected.
When you do push-ups, your elbows should bend back, close against your sides, at about a 45-degree angle.
If you're unsure about your elbow position, do a few push-ups and have someone observe you and watch your elbows. They typically will be able to get a better perspective than you can.
Practice the correct technique by pushing off from a wall while standing. This way you'll have a better understanding of how it feels for your elbows to be bending correctly.

, Push-ups are not just an upper-body exercise. If you're doing push-ups using only your upper body strength without engaging your core, you're putting extra pressure on your wrists, which can lead to wrist pain.When you do push-ups, you're not engaging your core correctly if any part of your body is moving later than another part – for example, if your hips are sagging or if your lower body raises after your upper body does.
If you notice your back swaying, or an arch in your lower back, you may need to do additional exercises to build more strength in your core before you continue doing push-ups, so that you can do them correctly without causing undue pressure on your wrists.
Doing planks rather than push-ups can help you build core strength. You may want to start with half-planks, in which you come down to your forearms rather than your hands, which limits the pressure on your wrists.

, Instead of resting on the balls of your feet, bend and rest on your knees (the feet will be pointing up in this position). This will make the push-up easier since you're lifting slightly less weight. This position is also the option given to women in some physical fitness tests where they have to do push-ups.








, Instead of putting your palms on the floor make a fist and put knuckles on the floor, or spread your fingers and raise yourself using only the fingertips. This will decrease the surface area of your support and make the stabilizer muscles work harder to keep you from toppling.








, Put your hands on a ball that is large enough to accommodate both your hands (basketball, bowling ball, soccer ball). This will also introduce instability to the exercise and give your upper body stabilizer muscles a sweat. Most people find this much harder to pull off than doing push-ups on the knuckles or finger tips.








, This is the same as the classic push up but instead of pushing yourself up steadily, push with enough force so that you can actually ""lift"" yourself in the air and have enough hang-time to clap once in mid-air before coming down.








, You will have to spread your legs and lean more towards the top of the single arm to maintain your balance. This can actually turn out to be a balancing challenge; there are people who have the upper body strength to pull it off but can't do it simply because they can't balance the body on top of the arm.








, It has been previously mentioned that keeping your elbows tucked to the sides during the push-up will work more of your triceps. Another way to do this is by placing your hands further down the body. Place your hands to the sides of the ribcage instead of under our shoulders, the further down the line, the more triceps you'll utilize during the push-up. However, there is a physical limitation to how far you can go since an average wrist will not bend more than 90 degrees in any direction.

Hit your lower ab region with a variety of exercises.,
Do leg lifts.,
Do hanging leg raises.,

Do an ab V hold.,
Maintain a balanced core routine.,
Have a lean, healthy diet.,
Do cardio exercise.,
Drink lots of water.,
Consider resistance training.,
Raise your overall activity level.,
Be consistent and patient.",How to Get a V Cut," The rectus abdominis (your ""six pack"" muscle) stretches from the bottom of your chest down to your pelvis.Though many work out the upper and middle portions of this muscle with sit-ups and crunches, for a strong, defined V cut, it's best to include workouts that hit the lower abs as well. A varied lower ab routine, in addition to building strength and definition in the region, can build overall core strength and reduce the risk of back pain. Below are some examples of lower ab exercises that can help you work on that V cut., This exercise builds lower ab strength by forcing your abdominal muscles to raise your hips and legs off of the ground in a vertical column. To do this exercise:









Begin by lying flat on your back. You can use a mat for comfort. Put your palms face-down at your sides.
Lift your legs off of the ground so that they are pointing straight up towards the ceiling. Your body should form an ""L"".
Concentrating on using your lower ab muscles, gently lift your hips off the floor, keeping your legs straight. Hold for a second, then lower your hips back to the floor. Use smooth, controlled movements - don't bounce or jerk.
Repeat. Do this exercise until you feel the telltale ""burn"", or for 4 sets of 15 reps.
To increase the intensity of this exercise, keep your arms off of the floor. You can hold them up above the ground or raise them above your head.

, This powerful exercise requires you to suspend yourself from a chin-up bar. In addition to building your lower abs, this exercise will, as a side benefit, increase your grip strength. To do this exercise:









Hang beneath a chin-up bar or another sturdy horizontal bar. Use a medium-wide grip. Your body should point straight towards the ground, with your hips very slightly rolled back.
Raise your legs, knees bent, until your thighs make a 90-degree (L-shaped) angle with your torso. Hold this shape for a second, then gently lower your legs back to their starting position.

Avoid twisting, jerking, or swinging your feet for this exercise. Improper form can cause pain or even injury.


Repeat the exercise until you feel the burn, or for about 3-4 sets of 10-20 reps.
Variations on this exercise exist. To make the exercise easier, you can use a specially-designed vertical bench which includes pads to rest your arms on. For an added challenge, you can want to keep your legs straight as you raise them or even add a weight between your feet. However, use caution when making this exercise more difficult - too much weight too fast carries the risk of a hernia., These fairly simple lower ab exercises are a great addition to any ab workout. To do this exercise;









Begin by lying on your back with your legs raised in a ""tabletop"" position - your legs raised with knees bent. In other words, your thighs should form a 90 degree angle with the ground and your shins should form a 90 degree angle with your thighs.
Spread your arms wide with your palms touching the ground. This provides a wide base to help you balance.
Keeping your upper back still, use your lower abs to lift your hips off the floor. Your knees should come towards your chest.
Hold this position for a second, then lower your hips back towards the ground gently.
Repeat until you feel the burn, or for several sets of 12-20 reps.
This exercise can be made more difficult by holding a small dumbbell between your feet. However, as always, use caution when performing ab exercises with extra weight to avoid injury.

, The ab V hold requires you to balance in a position that requires lower abdominal strength to maintain and to hold this position. The longer you do the ab V hold, the greater the burn you'll feel. To do this exercise:









Begin by laying flat on your back.
With both hands at your side, gently and carefully raise both your legs and your torso about 45 degrees off the floor. Your body should form a ""V"" with your hips touching the floor. Keep your legs straight and maintain strong, balanced posture.
Brace your ab muscles and uses your arms for balance. Some people find it easier to balance if they extend their arms parallel to the floor, pointing in the direction of their legs. However, if you do this, don't use your arms to support your legs at all.
Hold this position. Hold this position until you feel the burn, usually about 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Repeat as needed.

, Though your V cut mostly depends on your level of body fat, your genetics, and your lower ab strength, it's a very wise idea to practice a comprehensive core routine. Not only will this give your midsection a ""rounded out"" appearance, rather than a lopsided or uneven one, it'll improve your overall strength, comfort, and health. Core strength is frequently correlated with relief from back painand other common maladies. So, before you pursue your V cut with dogged determination, be sure to plan on working out the rest of your core as well. Below are a few exercises you might consider:










Side crunches. These easy exercises modify the basic crunch so that it hits both your obliques and your central ab muscles.

Bridges. These exercises are great for strengthening the lower back without straining it. A great choice for people with lower back pain.

Lunges. Don't forget that your hips and legs are part of your core! Lunges are body weight exercises, that, in addition to strengthening your thighs, glutes, hips, and back, can improve your sense of balance.

Yoga poses. Yoga is a highly effective, yet relaxing way to improve your core strength. It also has numerous side-benefits, including increased flexibility and balance.

, Even the strongest, most well-developed ab muscles are invisible if they're buried under fat - most heavyweight power lifters, for instance, have tremendously strong cores, but can appear fat because of their relatively high level of body fat. If you have abdominal fat around your midsection, cutting your level of body fat is an absolute necessity if you're interested in getting a V cut, and one of the best ways to do so is with a weight-loss diet. Eat fewer calories than you burn each day, while making sure to get all of the nutrients your body needs to thrive, and you will lose weight at a healthy, controlled pace.


There are countless weight-loss diets offered both online and in print. Some are healthy and sensible, others are amateurish and unrealistic, and still others are unhealthy. Most good weight-loss diets will recommend a diet based on some combination of the following advice:Eat few sugary, fatty foods. Eliminate desserts from your diet, except for rare indulgences.
Eat lean, filling protein. Chicken breasts are a great choice, as are certain types of fish and leaner cuts of red meat. Low-fat dairy, nuts, and seeds are also good choices.
Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. These nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods are essential for maintaining your body's health.
Eat sensible amounts of carbohydrates. Whenever possible, opt for healthier, more-filling whole-wheat varieties of bread and nutritious starch products.


Your weight-loss diet shouldn't be based on starvation or purging. Everyone needs to eat to a certain degree each day. Depriving your body of the food it needs will leave you tired and irritable and dull your senses. You'll be less able to perform the muscle-building exercises you'll need to build your V cut muscles and you may even experience muscle loss. In truly severe cases, you can even seriously endanger your health.

, Cardio is a great way to burn calories (and, paired with a healthy diet, fat). Cardio also has a variety of other health benefits - making cardio exercise part of your routine can lower your heart rate, improve blood flow, increase your daily energy level, and simply make you feel better.A wide variety of cardio exercises require little in the way of special equipment or financial investment - for instance, jogging, running, walking, swimming, hiking, and cycling are enjoyed by millions of people all over the world every day. Your body is a furnace - light the fire and you'll see results.









Running is one of the simplest, yet most intense and effective forms of cardio exercise. Balance running at high rates with jogging and walking to boost your metabolism. Rest at least a day between hard runs, but try to do some minor exercise on days off - for example, walk for half an hour.

, Drinking water has been thought for years to aid in, or even facilitate, weight loss.More importantly, however, is its vital importance to nearly all bodily functions. Since you have (hopefully) started cardio exercise, you'll be losing much more water than usual through sweat, which you'll need to replace to keep yourself feeling alert, focused, and healthy. Many diets recommend at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of water per day.







, Certain studies have shown that cardio exercise, rather than resistance (strength-training) exercise, is the best choice for losing weight.However, some exercise aficionados swear by a combination of resistance training and cardio exercise, citing the fact that, while cardio alone can burn fat, building muscle through resistance training can raise your overall metabolism and thus increase the baseline caloric amount that you burn per day. If you're currently on a weight-loss diet, you're unlikely to build much muscle through resistance training. However, you will improve your form and, according to some sources, will greatly reduce the amount of muscle that you lose as you lose weight, instead losing fat almost exclusively.









If you do opt for resistance exercise, perform a healthy, balanced regimen of weightlifting and body weight-type exercises. Proceed slowly - never jump straight to high-weight exercises, or you risk serious injury.

, One of the single most effective ways to lose fat doesn't involve drastic dieting or time-consuming exercise, which can be especially difficult to work into your schedule if you find yourself constantly busy. Simply look for opportunities to increase your physical activity level every day. Almost anything you can do to stay active throughout the day will have a boosting effect on your metabolism, which, all other things being equal, can cause you to lose weight. Try to look for ways to increase your activity during these everyday tasks:









Daily commute/transportation. Rather than driving to work, consider walking, running, or biking. Investigate public transportation options, which will require you to walk to and from the stop.
Work. If your job requires you to sit at a desk all day, look for opportunities to get out of the chair. Consider investing in a standing or walking desk, or, if you can, just place your computer on top of a box or two to create a ""poor man's"" standing desk. Switching up your desk routine is also a great idea for preventing back pain.Home relaxation. Rather than relaxing on the couch in front of the TV at home, keep moving on an elliptical trainer or do some simple exercises (like jumping jacks or lunges) on the floor.

Try rolling your wrists.,
Distribute your weight to your fingertips.,
Elevate your upper body.,
Use dumbbells.",How to Prevent Wrist Pain During Pushups2," Wrist-rolling push-ups are easier on the wrists while simultaneously strengthening your wrists and forearms. With stronger wrists and forearms, you'll be able to do regular push-ups without wrist pain.Make a fist and start your push-up with your knuckles on the floor. Roll your fist forward, trying to touch the tip of your thumb to the floor. Your arms will be straight in that position.
When you roll back, reverse the same rolling motion but this time, try to get the base of your fist to the floor. Your elbow will bend, engaging your triceps, and you should feel a stretch in your wrists. To do a wrist-rolling push-up, simply continue this rolling back and forth for the same number of repetitions you had planned for push-ups.
You may want to start this push-up variation on all fours so that your body weight is more firmly supported. Gradually move your knees further and further back until you are able to do this variation in full push-up position on your toes.

, To do this push-up variation, when you get into push-up position you want to pretend as though you're trying to hold a basketball, pushing into the floor with your fingertips.Keep your palm flat, not cupped. You're simply distributing your weight away from your wrists, which won't put as much pressure on your wrists to hold your weight or absorb the force of your push-ups.
Be careful to keep your fingers flat as well, rather than curling them into the floor. Doing so can cause undue pressure to the finger joints.

, Changing the position in which you place your hands can help limit wrist pain during both push-ups and planks. Raising your upper body naturally lessens the percentage of your body weight that your hands and wrists are being made to support.For example, you can place your hands on a bench or a step that is raised a few inches over the ground. The rest of the movement is the same as with a normal push-up.
Take care that you are still observing good form. Your elbows should be bending back, close to your body, and your back should remain flat so that your entire body moves raises and lowers as one unit.

, Holding dumbbells as you do push-ups will keep your wrists straight, putting less pressure on them. The size or weight of the dumbbell doesn't matter, since it will be resting on the floor. You just want something large enough for you to comfortably grip and that weighs enough it won't easily move as you exercise.Set one dumbbell under each shoulder. When you come down into push-up position, wrap your fingers around the handles of the dumbbells with your palms facing each other.
If the handle of the dumbbell is burning your palms, wrap a small towel around them first to make them easier to grip.

Do finger or palm pulses.,
Release your wrists.,
Try the gorilla pose.,
Improve the range of motion in your wrists.,
Build strength in your hands and fingers.",How to Prevent Wrist Pain During Pushups3," Finger and palm pulses can help strengthen the muscles in your hands as well as your wrists. In addition to being used separately as a strengthening exercise, you also can use this as a warm-up for your hands, fingers, and forearms before doing push-ups.To do finger pulses, place your fingertips on the floor with your palms raised and pulse into them. You can do this while sitting or on all fours to support your weight – don't do this from push-up position. Feel the finger flexors stretch and release with each pulse. Work smoothly through these pulses for a dozen or so repetitions.
Palm pulses are similar to calf raises, in which you raise your heels, keeping your toes and the balls of your feet on the ground – except palm pulses are working your forearms. Strong forearms can help prevent wrist pain during push-ups.
To do palm pulses, your hands should be flat and firm on the floor, directly below your shoulders as though you're doing a regular push-up. You can do this from your knees to support your weight. Raise your palms while keeping your fingers and the base of your knuckles on the floor, then smoothly lower. Do 12 to 24 repetitions of this exercise.

, Wrist releases can be performed either standing or sitting, and will help stretch your wrists and the muscles in your hands, loosening your wrists so they are better able to handle the pressure put on them when you do push-ups.Extend your right arm straight out in front of you, palm toward the ceiling. Flex your right wrist down and back so that your palm is now facing forward in front of you and your fingers are pointing down toward the ground.
Spread your fingers, then use the fingers of your left hand to pull back on your thumb until you feel a stretch. Hold this position, breathing deeply and spreading your fingers. Your fingers may have a tendency to tense or curl up. Resist this tendency by continually focusing on keeping them spread out.
After a few breaths, release your thumb and move on to your pointer finger. Continue the same action for all fingers on your right hand, then lower your right arm and extend your left arm to do the same thing.

, There is a yoga pose that can help you stretch out and strengthen your wrists. The gorilla pose is a deep forward bend ending with your hands palm-up under the soles of your feet.Stand with your feet about hip-width apart. Fold forward from your hips, bending your knees as much as you need to so you can place your hands firmly on the ground.
Bend your wrists inward so that the backs of your hands are resting on the ground and your hands are palm up. Lift your toes and slide your hands under your feet. Your fingers should be pointing toward your heels.
As you breathe deeply, massage your wrist creases with your toes. Stay in this position for as long as 20 breaths before returning to stand.

, The muscles and tendons in your hands and forearms move your wrists and the joints in your fingers. Regularly doing range-of-motion exercises can help prevent wrist pain during push-ups. Do these exercises with one wrist at a time, making sure you switch and do the other.Use a rolled-up towel on the edge of a table for cushioning, and lay your forearm across the table so that your hand is hanging just off the edge. Slowly move your hand upward until you feel a stretch, hold the stretch for 5 to 10 seconds, then release to your starting position. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise, then turn your arm over so that your palm is facing up and do another 10 repetitions of the same exercise.
You can work on your wrist's supination and pronation by standing or sitting with your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle, so your palm is facing the ground. Rotate your forearm to turn your palm face-up, hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then rotate it back down. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise.
Ulnar and radial deviation is the sideways movement of your wrist. Using the rolled-up towel on the edge of a table again, rest your forearm across the table with your hand on its side, as though you are about to shake hands with someone. Move the hand up until you feel a stretch, hold it for 5 to 10 seconds, then lower it to the center. Then move your hand down until you feel a stretch. Hold that stretch also for 5 to 10 seconds before raising to center. That's one repetition. You should do 10 repetitions with each wrist.

, Doing strengthening exercises for the muscles and tendons in your hands and fingers allows them to support more of your body weight when you are in push-up position, putting less pressure on your wrists.Holding your hand up in front of you with fingers spread and your thumb pointed outward, move your thumb slowly across your palm. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then release back to the starting point. Do 10 repetitions of this exercise to work on your thumb's flexion and extension.
Hold one hand out and extend the fingers straight out, as though you are signing for someone to stop. Make a hook fist, holding it for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to a straight hand. Make a full fist, hold it for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to a straight hand. Finally, make a straight fist (the same as a full fist, except that your fingers are flat over your palm rather than curled in), hold it for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to a straight hand. Do 10 repetitions of the full set of exercises, then repeat with the other hand.

Keep the shoulder blades pulled down and back throughout the exercise. Whether you're standing or squatting, keep this position.
Make a double chin to prevent misalignment of the cervical spine. If it feels a little funny but not uncomfortable, you're doing it right.
The eyes should look straight ahead at all times to maintain balance and coordination.
The abdominal muscles should be flexed and braced inward.
The butt muscles should be squeezed together.;
, Pretend that you are closing a door behind you with your butt. Once you have stopped descending, bend the knees until you feel muscle resistance. Do not go past this point or squat to the point of pain.


A common mistake for beginners is that they bend only the knees. This is a dangerous habit to form since it allows the knees to go beyond the toes as you squat. Extra unnecessary force will then be loaded on the knees, exacerbating your pain.

, Proper breathing makes exercising easier on your muscles and keeps the oxygen flowing. It also prevents your blood pressure from suddenly spiking. When you're getting into your squat, make sure you're inhaling to prepare your body. When you're releasing from the squat, release your breath, too, relaxing your body.


You can count out loud as you stand straight as an alternative to help keep you mindful of your breathing.

, Forcing multiple repetitions, squatting to the point of pain, or pounding the body with hundreds of improper-form squats will most likely put you back on the injury shelf. Therefore, no gain is made and you're only prolonging true fitness. It is always better to train smart than hard.

, Good form is the key to protecting your body from injury. Some examples of bad squat habits an average Joe does are:The knees go past the toes as they descend. Doing so puts additional stress on the joints which is terrible for the knees. The squat exercise should be done with concerted effort from the hips, knees, and ankles. Simultaneous action of the three joints will prevent this bad habit from happening.

The back rounds while doing the squat. The natural arch of the lower back disappears midway through the squat. This means that you are pushing beyond the mobility of the lower back. Going beyond the lower back’s flexibility may result in a slipped disc.

The shoulders slouch during the exercise. The shoulder blades should be pulled backward and downward through the exercise. This allows the resistance to be equally loaded to the knees and not on the spine.

, The neglected half of training is rest and recovery. Allow one full day of rest before embarking on squats exercises again.


Rest stimulates muscle growth and keeps the muscles fresh for another training session, limiting the risk of injury. You're not slacking – you're thinking long-term.

, Always consult a physician first when experiencing knee pain prior to doing any form of exercise. You should always be medically cleared to embark on exercises. Your doctor will know which exercises are right for you.


Pain is a warning sign that the knee is not prepared for physical activity. Should pain commence at any point during the exercise, stop immediately and consult your doctor.

, Partial wall squats are perfect for those suffering from knee pain. It takes a partial load off the knee joints while training the hip, knee, and leg muscles. Here's how to do it:


Stand in front of a wall. The wall should be about 2 feet (0.6 m) behind you.
Lean back against the wall. The back of your head, shoulder blades, and butt must be in contact with the wall at all times.
Brace the abdomen while keeping the shoulder blades back and down.
Stop when the thighs are halfway from being parallel to the floor. This works the inner thigh muscles while preventing excessive load to the knees. Strong inner thigh muscles provide stability to the knee joint.
Return to starting position. Complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one minute rest in between.

, To challenge the body further, place a stability ball in between your back and the wall. To challenge your body best, squeeze a medicine ball or basketball or soccer ball in between your knees while performing the exercise.


Using additional aids varies your workout and puts different muscles to more work. This way you're working every part of your body in multiple ways, keeping them fresh, warmed up, and healthy.

, Bodyweight half squats provide fundamental strength and coordination training to the lower body. Here's how to do this variation:


Stand tall with feet hip-width apart.
Keep the shoulder blades down and back.
Make a double chin while looking straight.
Brace the abdomen and squeeze the glutes.
Squat by pushing the hips back and out before bending the knees.
Stop when the thighs are halfway from being parallel to the floor.
Return to starting position. Complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one minute rest in between.
For an additional challenge, place your hands behind your head for added resistance. For an even harder challenge, raise your hands up while keeping your shoulder blades down and back.

, Chair half squats ensure that each repetition is performed through the preferred range of motion without inducing knee pain. For this exercise, do the following motions:


Stand about 2 feet (0.6 m) away from a sturdy chair or box. The chair or box’s height should be at par with the mid thigh. A mid-thigh height allows a good range for training inner thigh muscles without excessive burden to the knee joint.
Stand tall with feet hip-width apart.
Squat by pushing the hips backward until the butt touches the edge of the chair or box.
Do not sit on the chair. Immediately return to starting position. Complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one minute rest in between.
To make this exercise harder, raise your hands in front of you at shoulder level. To make it even more challenging, close your eyes with your hands raised in front of you.

, This is done by holding a dumbbell or any other weight with your arms (like a water bottle if you don’t have a dumbbell). It's more of a full-body exercise than the normal squat. Here's how to do this one:Hold the weight close to your chest with both hands.
Stand in your squat position with your toes slightly pointed out.
Start pushing your hips downward while keeping your back straight, till your hips are parallel with your knees.
Push upwards again,returning to your original position. You can repeat this several times.

, This is quite similar to the isometric squat but with one major difference: your toes.


Stand with your back straight and feet a bit more than shoulder width apart.
Make your toes point out in a 45-degree angle. This is why this exercise is deemed a ""sumo"" squat. It puts a slight variation in what muscles are worked when compared to an isometric squat.
Squat by first pushing your hips down till your legs form a 90-degree angle, then return to your original position. Repeat this several times.

, This is especially useful if you can’t hold your knees outward. If you have a resistance band, you're ready. Here's how:


Put a resistance band around your thighs to give you something to push against to keep your knees out.
After placing the band, squat normally by pushing your hips down. You will feel the band resisting your movement and you will need to push to counteract that resistance.
Return back to your standing position. This can be repeated several times.

, This exercise (and the ones listed below) is a bit harder than the previous ones mentioned. If you've done those with zero knee pain, more difficult squats may be suitable for you. Here's how it done:


Stand on a medium resistance band, keeping your feet shoulder-width apart.
Hold the resistance band with your hands on your hips or on your shoulders. If you are going to put your hands on your shoulders, make sure to keep them in line with your shoulders and not widely opened.
Push your hips down till your thighs are parallel to the floor. You will feel that you are counteracting the resistance of the band.
Return up to your standing position and then do a leg raise to the side of your body, then return your foot to the floor.
You can repeat ten times for one leg, then switch to the other leg and repeat that leg ten times in addition.

, This is considered one of the most challenging exercises, as it tests your legs to adapt and accommodate the weight of your body alone and also tests your core and muscle stability. Here's how to do it:Stand on one leg with your back straight. Keep your eyes forward and your shoulders back.
Do the squat slowly, pushing your hips down in line with your knees without letting the raised leg touch the floor.
Return back to your original position while keeping your leg up. You can repeat this exercise as much as you can, then switch to the other leg and repeat.

, This is another challenging exercise – you should perform the previous exercises first before jumping into this one to make sure your knees can handle it. Here's how to do this type of squat:Place a chair behind you. You can start with a small bench that is not elevated too much from the floor to start with the easier version of this exercise. Keep in mind that the higher the bench you use, the more difficult the exercise will be.
Place your foot on the chair with your toes flat and facing the chair.
Stand with your back straight and steady, then start pushing your hips down until they are in line with your knees. Make sure that the toes of your straight leg are pointed forward.
Return to your standing position and repeat. You can repeat this exercise as many times as you can as long as it doesn’t bring you any sort of pain. Then switch your legs and repeat again.

If you feel any sort of tension around the back of your thighs or the quadriceps of your lifted leg on the chair, gently lean yourself forward while going down in your squat. Then straighten your trunk again while raising your hips up to return back to your original position.

, Depending on the severity of your soreness, stretching is a great way to relieve tightness through your abdominals. Do stretches that focus on your core muscles. If they cause you pain, stop and talk to a doctor.


Lay on your back with your arms and legs extended. Make your body as long as you can to feel the stretch.
Lean back over your chair. Lean back only until you feel the stretch. Be careful not to push too far.

, These classes are breathing and stretching intensive. They will help promote blood flow throughout the class and beyond. Make the instructor aware of your situation before class starts so that they can focus on core stretches.


Do the upward facing dog stretch. This common yoga pose starts with you laying on your stomach. From here, place your hands under your shoulders and push up until you feel the stretch. Look up toward the ceiling for a heightened affect.Do the locust pose. This yoga pose also requires you to lay on your stomach. Lay your arms next to your body and lift your head, and upper torso away from the floor. You want to be resting on your pelvis."

Lower your leg back down.,
Repeat with the opposite leg.",How to Work Your Abs While Standing1," Keep your feet together with one heel lifted. Keep your hands behind your head. Your back should be straight, with knees slightly bent.


It doesn’t matter which heel you lift. This is just the leg you will be picking up first.;
, If you are starting with the right leg, lift your knee up towards the left shoulder. The left knee should go towards the right shoulder.


Your knee should reach up to about the height of your hips. Any higher and you might fall over., Twist your torso so that your knee goes to your elbow.


Squeeze your abs tightly as you make this move. You want to make sure it emphasizes those muscles to get the most work. Observe caution while twisting your back. If something hurts in your back, reduce your range of motion and proceed slowly only if it feels safe.
Make sure your hands stay behind your head, which keeps your elbows pointed outwards.Don’t worry if you can’t reach without bending your back and possibly losing your balance. Your knee and elbow don’t need to touch. The important thing is that the knee and elbow are reaching towards the same point.

Take Ibuprofen.,
Take an Epsom salt bath.,
Ice your muscles.",How to Treat Sore Ab Muscles2," 200 mg of ibuprofen in the morning after breakfast. Be sure to talk to a doctor before doing this to be sure you don’t have any allergies. If ibuprofen isn’t available, acetaminophen will have the same affect. Both of these help relive sore muscles through their anti-inflammatory ingredients., Spend 30 minutes in a tub of hot water and Epsom salt. Epsom salt helps flushes the toxins out of your muscles. It also decreases muscles inflammation. While in the tub, rub your abdominal muscles firmly to help blood flow into your muscles. There is no evidence that Epsom salts flush toxins. However, many people report feeling better after Epsom salt baths.

, Icing helps reduce inflammation if used within the first 72 hours of workout or injury. It helps to reduce pain if applied for 10-minutes intervals. Do not ice directly before you plan on moving a lot—you’ll be prone to injury if you try to move too much when your muscles are cold.


Never apply ice directly to the skin and never apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time."

Hydrate well.,
Raise your legs.,
Re-fuel your body properly.",How to Treat Sore Ab Muscles3," Staying properly hydrated will help your muscles recover faster. Drink at least two bottles of water before you work out, and drink half an ounce of water per pound of body weight throughout the day. Avoid drinking tea and coffee because these will dehydrate you.

, Before doing anything that is ab intensive, you should avoid sitting or standing for too long. Take 5 minutes before your workout to put your legs up while you lay on your back. This will ensure blood flow to the upper portions of the body. The blood flow will help flush the muscles., Protein is a very important factor in muscle recovery. Be sure to eat a protein rich meal (about 20 grams) within 30 minutes of your workout. Protein bars and shakes are an easy way to get this amount of protein on the go.

For this exercise to work your abs, you'll need a weight or medicine ball. Hold it in your hands and reach it above your head.One variation to the position is to start with your feet together. If you do this, you’ll swing one leg out as you reach down.To get an image of what this exercise will look like, imagine you are splitting wood with a heavy axe.

, Bring the weight toward your right knee.This should be an explosive movement — imagine the weight is your axe and you're striking wood that is positioned in front of your right knee.


This movement will force you to twist your torso. Keep your abs tight as you rotate.Pivot the left foot and bend your knees slightly as you twist.Do not use the momentum from your arms to twist — this should be a controlled movement.Make sure your back stays straight and your arms are fully extended as you swing downwards.
If you started with your feet together, step out with your right foot., Resuming the starting position will work your back, glutes, and hamstrings — it's the downward motion that really blasts your abs.

, Do the same movement to the other side, bringing the weight or medicine ball down toward your left knee.

Do sit-ups.,
Add planks to your routine.,
Include back extensions to work out your lower back muscles.,
Do leg lifts to target both your lower back and abdominal muscles.,
Use the bird-dog exercise.",How to Work Out Your Abs1," Exercises such as sit-ups are a good place to start if you want to build core strength. They're simple for beginners and don't require you to join a gym or buy any fancy exercise equipment.For sit-ups, start on your back with your knees bent and your lower back against the floor. Cross your arms across your chest rather than putting your hands behind your head – this can put unnecessary strain on your neck.
When doing sit-ups, take care with your form and make sure you're doing the exercise correctly. Your effort should come from your core, not your shoulders or neck, which could cause injury.
If you don't have someone to work out with you and hold your feet while doing sit-ups, try tucking your toes under the couch or another low piece of furniture.;
, Planks are another basic exercise you can do to work out your abs. This exercise strengthens your core muscles so your back and pelvis are supported. Doing planks for a few minutes every day can improve your posture and decrease back pain.To do a traditional plank, lay on your stomach on the floor with your arms bent at the elbow so your hands are under your shoulders.
Raise up slowly so that your arms are extended and you're on your toes (or your knees, if you're a beginner) with your legs and back straight. Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds.
Do a side plank by raising up from a side position so that your weight is balanced on your elbow and the side of your foot. Your elbow should be on the floor directly under your shoulder, your forearm flat on the floor and palm flat.

, You don't want to work on your abs exclusively and neglect your back. Strong lower back muscles are crucial for overall core strength.Back extensions don't require any equipment. Simply lie on the floor face down with your arms parallel to your body.
Lift your chest off the floor, hold for between 5 and 10 seconds, then slowly back down.
You can increase the time you hold the position to increase the difficulty. Make sure you're able to release the hold in a controlled way.
You should lower yourself to the floor at the same rate of speed as you lifted, maintaining control the entire time rather than simply flopping down.

, Leg lifts are another basic exercise that doesn't require any special equipment – just a little floor space. When you do leg lifts, your back and abs work together.Lie on your back on the floor with your arms parallel beside you. Lift your legs about 12 inches off the ground.
Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds, then release.

, If you aren't ready to invest in exercise equipment such as resistance bands, the bird-dog exercise is a good option. This exercise adds variety without costing you any money.To do this exercise, get on the floor on your hands and knees with your back flat.
Slowly extend your left leg and your right arm at the same time.
Hold the position for 5 to 10 seconds, then return to the resting position.
Do the same thing with your right leg and left arm.

Pelvic tilts are a great way to strengthen your abdominal muscles without overworking them.Lie on your back with your knees bent.
Flatten your back against the floor, tighten your abdominal muscles, and bend your pelvis up slightly.
Hold for up to 10 seconds.
Repeat five times and work up to 10 to 20 repetitions.;
, As you build confidence in your post-pregnancy strength, crunches can be a good transition between pelvic tilts and the more difficult sit-ups.


Lie on your back, feet down, knees up and arms in front of your chest or hands lightly touching your temples.
Using only your abdominal muscles, raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees. As you lift, exhale.
Pause, and then lower yourself to your original position while inhaling, making sure to keep your head off the ground.
Repeat.

, Once you feel that crunches have become too easy, you are ready to graduate to sit ups.


Lie on your back, feet down, knees up and hands crossed over your chest.
Make sure your feet are secured under something firm, such as the lip of a couch or piece of furniture.
From a reclined position, sit all the way up, lifting your entire back off the floor. Maintain good posture and keep a straight back.
Lower yourself down.
Repeat.

Start with three sets of ten repetitions, increasing the amount of repetitions per set each workout.



, Because crunches and sit ups focus mostly on the outer layer of abdominal muscles, it is important to also train the interior muscles critical to posture and stability.


Lie on your stomach, with your forearms flat on the floor, creating a right angle at your hands.
Rise off the ground, lifting your chest and midsection off the ground. Your only points of contact with the ground should be your forearms and toes.
Maintain a straight back, neither allowing your rear to dip down, nor to stick into the air.
This position is also known as the plank, and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place. Hold this position for as long as possible.
Beginners should start with multiple sets of about 30 seconds.

, During pregnancy, it is easy to become sedentary due to the physical and mental burden placed on you. However, once you have achieved a solid base of abdominal strength, it is a great time to move on to full body fitness with a continued focus on the core. Try compound exercises that train your abs in conjunction with the rest of your body. Some of the best compound exercises for abs are ones that force your entire core to support your spine. Some exercises that do this are squats and deadlifts.

, In order to lose weight, you must expend more calories than you consume. When you have a caloric deficit, your body consumes energy stored in fat cells, reducing their size.Over time, this results in weight loss. Conversely, even if you are working out intensively, overeating and poor nutrition could still prevent you from toning up or losing any weight, due to the amount of calories you are taking in outnumbering the amount you are expending.

, It took nine months to gain the 25-35 pounds recommended by doctors during your pregnancy, and it will take about that long to lose it.Don't fall for the hype of instant weight loss plans, instead use moderate exercise and healthy eating to ensure that you are on the road to fitness.

, Wait at least until your six-week postpartum checkup before actively trying to slim down.If you are breastfeeding, it is recommended that you wait two months before actively dieting. You want to make sure you have the energy to care for your new baby, and if you begin dieting too quickly, it can stunt your recovery.


Losing weight at a healthy pace and waiting two months establishes a good milk supply for the baby.Breastfeeding can also help you lose weight.Milk production expends calories, and the act of breastfeeding itself also burns calories., Empty calories, including many types of sugars, simple carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats, contribute to weight gain. Although these may include some of your favorite comfort foods, steer clear of ice cream, soda, pastries, and most other desert items and processed foods in order maximize your chances of achieving a toned stomach.


If you crave sweets, consider swapping cake and ice cream for fruit and berries.Fruit is naturally sweet and has a variety of nutritional benefits, ranging from vitamin content to antioxidant support.
Avoid ""white"" products, such as white bread and white rice, that have been bleached and robbed of their nutritional benefit. Instead, opt for whole-grain bread, brown rice, quinoa, and unbleached oats.
Shop from the edges of the supermarket, instead of from the center. Since many un-processed fresh foods are kept refrigerated, or are regularly replenished, they are often stocked around the perimeter of the grocery store. By shopping from these areas, you will avoid the refined sugars and fats found in many packaged goods in the aisles., Diets high in vegetable protein and low in animal fats have been linked to weight loss, reduced risk of heart disease, and many other health benefits. Switching to a plant-based diet can help you slim down, as well as keep you healthy after your pregnancy.Go green. Leafy greens, such as kale, collards, spinach, and chard are full of healthy fiber, vitamins, and micronutrients.Eat fruit. Fruit can satisfy your sweet tooth, as well as provide a variety of underconsumed vitamins and nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and folate.Experiment with new recipes. Many regions around the world eat mostly vegetarian diets. Turn to some of these regions for exciting new dishes that are both delicious and nutritious., Especially after pregnancy, it is important to recognize that eating smaller portions can help increase weight loss. You are no longer eating ""for two"", and must adjust your diet to reflect this change.

, By eating large meals earlier in the day, the likelihood of overeating late at night decreases. Additionally, late at night you are more likely to eat unhealthy snack items high in sugar, fats, and simple carbohydrates.

, Eating breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism, allowing you to more effectively process food and preventing you from becoming extra hungry throughout the day. This reduces your chances of overeating, and negating any progress you may have made through exercise.

, Drinking water will not only help you remain hydrated and aid in your recovery from pregnancy, it will also allow you to more accurately determine whether or not you are actually hungry, or just craving food.Additionally, drinking cold water may burn more calories than drinking room temperature water, because of the energy expended to heat the water to body temperature.

, Although it may be hard to sleep the recommended eight hours per night with a newborn in the house, you should still try to get as much sleep as possible. Having a baby is hard work, and you need to allow your mind and body the appropriate amount of time to recover. Sleep allows the body to properly recover from exercise and gain the maximal benefits from a workout, as well as digest food effectively., Controlling your stress levels after pregnancy may seem like a daunting task, but is crucial to increased overall health. Excessive stress has also been shown to encourage storage of fat in the abdominal region, hampering your goal of a toned stomach. Low stress levels have been linked to overall weight loss, among a variety of other health benefits. Managing stress will allow you to focus on your exercise and diet goals, while making it easier to keep off fat., When you have a new baby, it can be difficult to effectively divide parenting duties and responsibilities. However, doing everything alone can lead you to neglect your own health. Enlist the help of your significant other, family, or a hired professional to share the burden of caring for your child. Divide duties such as diaper-changing, cooking, recreation, doctor's appointments, and the like between you and whoever is willing to help. This will allow you to get the time you need to focus on your physical and mental health., In addition to many other negative health effects, alcohol consumption can significantly chip away at any weight loss gains you make through dieting and working out. It is easy to forget how many calories can be consumed in alcoholic beverages, and drink away all your progress towards a toned stomach. In addition, alcohol stimulates your appetite, driving you to eat when you may otherwise not be hungry."

Range of motion should be limited in the beginning, but you still need clear space.For proper technique, start on the floor on your hands and knees. Use an exercise mat under your knees for comfort. Grip the ab roller with both hands, and prepare to roll.;
, Hold the bars on either side of the wheel, and move forward from your core. Roll your hands, arms, and torso forward until just before you feel like you can no longer pull yourself back up. Keep your abs tight, the hips stable, and the lower back muscles contracted.









Hold your form tight. Try not to let your bottom sag toward the ground. Do not let your back arch. Keep your head down, facing forward., The longer you hold the extended or ""rolled out"" pose, the more intensively you will target your abs. Begin with a few slow repetitions.

, After a few seconds, use your core muscles to roll the ab roller back toward your knees. Slowly pull yourself back, keeping the same careful pace the whole time. As you ""roll in,"" perform the mirror opposite of the ""roll out"" move that you used to stretch yourself out. Once you're back, you have completed one ""rep"" of a standard ab roller workout.








Make sure that you are using your abs to pull yourself back. You may also use your arms, your shoulders, and your lats. Try not to use your hips.Keep in mind that can tear your connective tissues in the shoulder and may even dislocate the shoulder if done improperly, so proceed gradually and with caution. If you experience any shoulder pain, reduce your range of motion and build up gradually.

, Keep your arms and back straight. Focus your attention on your abdominal muscles. The harder you flex your abs here, the stronger they will become.


Do not let your knees or your bottom sag toward the ground at any point. Imagine that there is a long, flat plank on your back, from your head to your tailbone. Try to conform your body position as truly as possible to this imaginary level.

, Unfold and contract your body gradually and carefully as you move through the exercise. Keep your arms even and straight so that the wheel doesn't spin out of control. Try to maintain the same slow, measured speed throughout the entirety of each rep. You'll get a better workout if you take it slowly.








, This technique may help you maintain a measured workout pace. To start, position yourself three feet away from a wall. Then, perform the ab roll as normal until your ab roller makes contact with the wall. This is your ""touch point"" – your signal that you have gone far enough on this rep. Roll back up to your hands and knees for the next rep.


It is especially important to roll slowly if you're going to be rolling toward a wall. Use this as a focusing point, to be more aware of the cadence of your roll.

, Build the ab roller into your weekly routine. For a basic regimen, aim to do a set three days of each week for five weeks. If you want faster results, then it is advisable to combine ab roller workouts with other abdominal workouts.


Stick to the sweet spot of three to eight reps per set to start, and progress up to three sets of 10 reps only once you have mastered your form and built strength.

, Some amateur exercise enthusiasts suggest using ab rollers in a standing position, but most people, especially beginners, do not have have muscle control for such. Always perform this exercise on your knees to make the most of the motion and to keep yourself safe., The standard rep calls for you to hold the fully-extended, ""rolled-out"" pose for 2-3 seconds before you roll back to your starting position. Experiment with holding the pose for longer – almost like the plank pose. Do not overextend yourself, though. Losing strength or reaching a failure point while extended could cause you to tear muscles and tendons, and may lead to permanent injury.

Switch to a side plank.",How to Strengthen Your Core1," In order to get the most out of your core-strengthening regimen, take a moment to find the transversus abdominis (your deepest core muscle). Once you've found it, you'll want to keep that muscle contracted and tight throughout the course of your workout.Force yourself to take a deep cough. You should feel a muscle in your abs contract, which is the transversus abdominis.
The transversus abdominis runs deep in your core and extends from your belly button to your rib cage.Now that you've found the transversus abdominis, practice flexing and tightening the muscle.
Engage your transversus abdominis every time you work on your core, no matter which routine or muscle group you're focusing on.;
, Segmental rotations (rotating your core along the spine) can help work a variety of core muscle groups with relatively little strain. Begin by lying flat on your back, then bend your knees and pull your feet as close to your buttocks as you can comfortably get them. Keep your shoulders pinned to the floor, and focus on only moving your lower body.








Tighten your abdominal muscles and slowly drop both knees towards the floor on one side. Only go as far as you comfortably can - you should feel a strong stretching sensation, but it should not hurt.
Hold the position for three breaths, then return to the starting position. Switch your knees to the other side, hold for three breaths, and repeat.

, The superman focuses on working your lower back's core muscles. Start out by lying flat on your stomach. Slide a rolled up towel or a small throw pillow under your hips to help support your back. If you'd like, you can also put a folded towel under your face to help support your head.








Tighten up your abdominal muscles and lift one arm at a time, holding each arm elevated in the air for three breaths. Then switch to the other arm and repeat.
Tighten your abdominal muscles and lift one leg at a time, holding each leg for three breaths. Then switch to the other leg and repeat.
If you prefer, you can stretch out both of your arms and legs at the same time; however, if you're just starting out you may want to focus on one limb at a time to develop a proper routine.

, The bridge works several muscle groups in your core, making it a highly-effective exercise. Begin by lying on your back and bending your knees. Plant your feet right in front of your buttocks as though you were about to do a sit up and keep your back as neutral as possible (not arched, but not pressed down either).








Tighten your abdominal muscles and raise your hips off the floor. They should now be aligned with your knees and shoulders in a straight downward line pointing towards the floor.
Hold the position for three breaths, then return to the starting position and repeat.

, Planks are a great exercise for building strength in your core. Start by lying on your stomach and lifting up onto your forearms and the tips of your toes. If you can't get onto your toes you can balance your weight on your knees and your forearms.








Keep your forearms and knees or toes on the floor and try to squeeze your elbows and knees towards one another.
Keep your abdominal muscles tight and your shoulders lined up straight above your elbows.Make sure your neck and spine are in a neutral position. You should be looking down at the floor and your back should not be arched or bent at all.
While in position, tighten your abdominal muscles. Hold the position for three breaths, then return to your starting position and repeat.

, The side plank is similar to a regular plank, except it works the core muscles that line your sides instead of your abdominal muscles. Start out lying on your side and balance yourself on either the forearm or hand on that side of your body (whichever you're more comfortable with).








Make sure your shoulder is above your elbow and aligned with your hips and knees.
Tighten your abdominal muscles while you're in position and hold it for three deep breaths. Then switch to the other side, rest, and repeat.

Warm up before you begin.,
Build a 15 to 20 minute routine.,
Increase resistance gradually.,
Stretch after you work out.",How to Work Out Your Abs2," Even if you are just going to do an abdominal workout, it is important to take 5 to 10 minutes to warm up. You can warm up by walking, jogging, biking, jumping rope, climbing stairs, or even just marching in place. Make sure that you include a warm up every time you work your abs.


Another option is to work out your abs after doing your usual cardio routine.

, To work out your abs, you need to do at least 5 to 10 repetitions of each exercise you add to your routine. Set up your routine in a way that works for you. Ideally, you want your routine to be 15 or 20 minutes long, but as you get stronger, you may find you need to work out longer to get a similar benefit.You may want to work out with a friend or family member who can watch your technique and keep time with you.
If you prefer to exercise on your own, use a kitchen egg timer or set an alarm on your mobile phone to keep the time.
Plan the days a week you'll exercise, and make it a habit. You should do this workout at least three days a week. Doing it every day or other day will bring you more continuous results.

, As you increase your core strength, you should be gradually making the exercises more difficult so that you continue to build strength and don't plateau. You can do this by adding resistance bands or weights to your workout.For example, if you're doing sit-ups, you can add small hand weights or weighted wrist bands to increase the amount of weight you're lifting and holding as you complete the exercise.
Ankle weights can be used to increase resistance for leg lifts.
Consider buying a set of ankle and wrist weights of varying weights so you don't have to purchase more equipment every time you want to increase resistance.
Another way to increase resistance is to increase the length of time you hold the target position. For example, if you start doing leg lifts and holding your lift for 5 seconds, holding it for 10 seconds will make the exercise more difficult.

, Stretching helps to build flexibility and ease tension in the muscles that you use during a workout. Make sure that you include a basic 5 to 10 minute stretch routine at the end of your workout.Basic side and forward bends, either standing or sitting, can help you to stretch and cool down after exercise. Bend slowly at the waist, and reach towards the floor. Hold the stretch for 5 to 10 seconds while breathing through it.
You can also try the cobra pose from yoga. Lay down on the floor on your stomach with your arms beside you and the tops of your feet flat against the floor. Bend your arms at the elbow so that your palms are under your shoulders, palms flat against the floor. Slowly raise your upper body, lifting from the waist, until your arms are straight. Hold the pose for 5 to 10 seconds, then slowly lower back down to your starting position.

Focus on reps rather than resistance.,
Combine intense exercise with slower exercises or stretches.,
Add aerobic exercise to your routine.,
Pay attention to your diet.",How to Work Out Your Abs3," Adding weight or resistance builds muscle, but additional repetitions of an exercise increases the exercise's aerobic nature and helps burn fat. Do more exercises with lower weight or resistance if you want to work out your abs to lose weight.If you want to lose weight while exercising, aim to start breaking a sweat during your warm up, and continue sweating throughout your entire routine.
Once you get your technique down for specific exercises, you can increase the fat-burning intensity by doing them faster.
For example, try to do 20 sit-ups in one minute. As that gets easier, gradually increase the number of sit-ups you do in one minute.

, With interval training, you divide your routine up into segments. One segment is highly intense exercise, followed by slower, more deliberate exercise. Then you do another intense interval, and so on.Interval training can be highly effective for weight loss, and may decrease the chance of injury.
The slower intervals allow you to recover so you can push hard through the next intense interval.

, If you want to lose weight, you need to increase your heart rate to get your body to start burning calories. If you do abdominal exercises without aerobic exercise, you run the risk of simply building muscles underneath a layer of fat, which won't do anything to give you a slimmer appearance.The easiest way to add aerobic exercise to your routine is to take a brisk walk or jog around the block a couple of times a day.
In inclement weather, you can always jog in place or do jumping jacks inside. You also may want to invest in a treadmill or exercise bike – but don't think you have to spend a lot of money (or take up precious space in your home) buying exercise equipment just to get some aerobic exercise.
Balance your aerobic exercise with the specific exercises, such as leg lifts, planks, and sit-ups, that you're doing to work out your abs.

, No matter what exercises you do, you won't lose much weight if you don't control what you eat. Particularly if you're trying to lose belly fat, focus on eating smaller portions of food with fresh ingredients.Get rid of snacks and other problem foods – especially those that are high in calories and sugar – in your house so you won't be tempted.
Focus on lean meats and fresh vegetables, and make sure you drink a lot of water.
Especially if you're just beginning your weight loss journey, a food journal can help you understand what you're eating.
Writing down everything you eat each day helps you see eating that may have been mindless or without purpose.
Limit your food intake to meals at specific times of the day, to get your body used to a routine.

If you feel capable, you can do side bends with a barbell (but don't add any weights). Otherwise you can just use a broom or some other long, straight stick.









Tighten up your abdominal muscles and stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your toes pointed forward and sling the broom (or barbell) across your shoulders.While holding the broom/barbell with both hands a little past your shoulders, lean to one side as far as you can comfortably go. Keep your feet planted on the ground throughout the workout.
Hold the side bend for three breaths, then return to your starting position. Bend to the other side, hold for three breaths, and repeat.
Try to complete two or three sets of 15 to 20 reps each.

, Squats are a great way to strengthen your core muscles in your abdomen and your back. Start out by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed forward. Make sure your knees are also pointed forward, and slowly bend your knees while simultaneously bending forward at the waist.








Tighten your abdominal muscles as you dip into a squat. Extend your arms slightly forward, but don't overextend them (aim for your hands to be about 1 to 1.5 feet, or 0.3 to 0.45 meters, out in front of your face).
Do not bend your back. It's important that you keep your back in a neutral position (not rigid, but not arched either).
Keep your chest lifted and your shoulders down and drawn back as you squat. Make sure your knees don't extend past your toes.
Hold each squat for three breaths, then return to your starting position.
Aim for two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps., Lunges will help you build core strength while also working your leg muscles. Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointed forward. Keep your arms at your sides and make sure you have enough room in front of you and behind you so you can take a huge step forward or backwards without bumping into anything.








Tighten your abdominal muscles as you bend one knee and extend the other leg behind you. Let your back leg and ankle bend as though you were going to kneel directly onto the floor with your toes planted behind you.
Your front knee should be aligned with your ankle. Your back knee should be bent enough that a straight line forms from your shoulder to your hip to your back knee.
Do not lean forward. Try to keep your upper body as straight as possible.
Hold the lunge for three breaths, then stand back up. Switch to the other side and repeat.
Try to do two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps each. If you have joint problems, hip, knee, ankle foot, or spine issues, reduce the number of reps. Instead hold the position a little longer when you want to increase the intensity.

Hold this position for 30 seconds, or as long as you can comfortably maintain your balance. Return to standing with both feet on the floor, then switch sides.







, Single-leg balances build off of weight shifts and help further develop your balance and core strength. Begin by standing with your feet hip-width apart, and distribute your weight evenly across both of your feet.








Put your hands on your hips and lift one leg up, then bend your knee and draw that leg back behind you.
Hold this position for 30 seconds, or as long as you can comfortably maintain your balance. Then return to standing with both feet on the floor and switch sides.

, There are many classes that can help improve both balance and core strength. Tai chi focuses on balance and controlled movement.Yoga combines breathing, balance, meditation, and stretching to work a broad range of muscle groups, including your core.You can find classes at your local gym, yoga studio, community center, or community college.
Try a few different types of classes and see which one(s) you enjoy the most.

, There are a few different types of balance boards (also called wobble boards) that can help you work your abdominal muscles. The most common balance boards are rocker boards, which move back and forth, and spherical-based boards, which move evenly in all directions. You can use a balance board while sitting, kneeling, or standing.Some common balance board activities include:


Side-to-side rock — Keep your feet firmly on the board and move your body from side to side while maintaining your balance.
Backwards and forwards rock — Sit, kneel, or stand on the board and slowly rock from front to back while maintaining your balance.
Circular movements — Sit, kneel, or stand on the board and slowly rotate around in controlled circular patterns.

Work your abdominal muscles with a fitness ball.,
Give your abs a workout with a medicine ball.,
Use a fitness ball to work your sides.,
Exercise your sides with a medicine ball.",How to Strengthen Your Core4," Fitness balls can help you engage in core-strengthening positions that might otherwise be uncomfortable or difficult. Choose a ball that's big enough that you can sit on the ball and still keep your feet flat on the floor. Tighten your abdominal muscles for each exercise and aim to do five repetitions each, gradually increasing the number of repetitions as you build strength.Some common fitness ball exercises for your abs include:









Abdominal crunches — Keep your feet hip-width apart and your back straight as you sit on the ball. Cross your arms, lean back as far as you comfortably can until you feel your abs tighten, then hold the position for three breaths.
Abdominal ball raise — Lie on your back with your legs on either side of the ball. Lift the ball by squeezing it between your lower legs, pull your bellybutton down towards your spine, and hold the ball above you for three breaths.

, Medicine balls are commonly used for strengthening core muscles.Remember to tighten your abdominal muscles as you engage in these exercises. If you're just starting out and haven't built up a lot of core strength, it's best to start out slow and easy: begin doing one to three sets of 8 to 10 repetitions each, then increase the number of repetitions and/or the number of sets as you get stronger.


Kneel on both knees with your body in an upright position and the medicine ball held at your chest.
Do a controlled fall forward and chest press the ball out of your hands and towards a wall in front of you as you drop.
Once you've dropped to your hands, do a kneeling push up. Then return to your starting position and repeat the entire process.

, The same fitness ball you used to work your abs can also be used to strengthen the side muscles of your core. As always, tighten your abdominal muscles every time you work out, and start out with at least five repetitions on each side.








Lie on one side with the ball between your legs and lift your upper body off the floor, resting your weight on your forearm.
Lift your legs off the floor, keeping the ball between them, and hold for three breaths.
Return to your starting position and switch sides.
If you are a beginner, start with your head down, resting in the crook of your elbow. This way, there is less chance of a back injury or herniated disk.

, You can also use a medicine ball to work the side muscles in your core. Remember to engage your core as you perform these exercises, and start out with one to three sets consisting of eight to 10 repetitions until you build up your strength.Single-leg chops — Stand on one foot and extend your arms up and to the side you're standing on. Bring the medicine ball downward and across your front in a chopping motion (towards your opposite foot) and switch which foot is in the air and which is on the ground as you swing, then alternate sides.
Figure eights — Hold the medicine ball above one shoulder and bring the ball down in a chopping motion towards your other foot (like in the single-leg chops). Stand back straight and raise the ball over your other shoulder, then chop towards the opposite foot, forming a figure-eight shape with the complete motion.
Twists — Stand with your feet hip-width apart and firmly planted, holding the medicine ball with your arms slightly bent. Swing the ball over one hip while twisting your upper body all the way around to the other side, then switch back in the opposite direction.

Don't get discouraged if you're not getting the results you want.",How to Get Tight Abs," Before you start thinking of tightening your abs, you've got to work on shedding the fat above them. One of most important ways to do this is to make sure you keep a healthy diet. You don't have to count calories, but you should focus on eating three healthy meals a day and cutting down on the fatty foods you eat. Here's how to do it:.


Replace the foods you eat that are high in fat and sugar, like fast food, ice cream, or buttery foods, with healthier foods, like frozen yogurt, grilled chicken, and fruits.
If you're not burning enough fat by eating three healthy meals a day, try eating 4-5 smaller meals a day to speed up your metabolism.
Don't skip meals. This will make you feel unbalanced and much more likely to binge eat.
Tone down your alcohol intake. Alcohol slows down your metabolism and makes it harder for you to burn fat.;
, Another important part of shedding tummy fat is regular cardiovascular exercise. Anything that speeds up your heart rate and gives you a workout will make you shed some of that tummy fat. This doesn't mean you have to run everyday—if running isn't your thing, you can try walking, dancing, cycling, or swimming.









You can also go for long fast-paced walks, climb stairs, go hiking, or even do circuit training at your local gym.
Hula hooping or jump roping are other great ways to get some cardiovascular exercise.
Jumping jacks are another great way to speed up your heart rate.

, Dancing is not only fun and a great way to pass time with your friends or your significant other, but it can burn some serious calories while getting your body moving. You'll be having so much fun dancing that you won't even notice that you're burning fat. Here are some ways to dance:


Take a salsa class. You'll burn fat by moving your hips in no time.
Take a Zumba class. Zumba is a fast-paced full-body workout that is guaranteed to make you shed some some pounds.
Go dancing at a club. Have some fun just dancing with your friends. You won't even notice when you've been dancing for an hour because you'll be having such a great time.

, Even if you don't have time to work out, you can give your abs a little exercise by breathing. Place your hand on your stomach and feel your muscles tighten. Be sure not to suck in or push out very much—breathing should still be easy and even.









You can improve your breathing by meditating as well.

, Even something as simple as keeping a good posture will help strengthen your core. While this alone will not give you tight abs, every little bit helps. Make sure to check your posture from time to time, whether you're sitting on the bus or at your desk.

, Yoga is a fantastic way to strengthen your core while burning some fat. Yoga improves your breathing and gives you a workout that strengthens your entire body, especially the core, which is the key to hitting many yoga poses. Take a yoga class just two or three times a week and you'll notice the difference on your body and abs.









The vinyasa, a yoga cycle consisting of three poses used to rejuvenate the body between poses, works your core tremendously. An hour-long yoga class can consist of at least twenty or thirty Vinyasas, and you will feel the difference.
Many power yoga classes even incorporate specific ab exercises into the practice, such as the bicycle.

, You can do the exercises in the comfort of your own home with only a mat and a medicine ball. You should start working out your abs for just 20-25 minutes twice a week, and work up to doing the exercises three times a week. When you begin your series of exercises, remember that quality is better than quantity, and that you should do each exercise just 2 or 3 times for a series of 15-20 reps each time.








If you plan to do other exercises in your workout routine, exercise your abs first. If you're adding ab exercises to your daily workout routine, do them first. You'll get the most out of your workout if you're not fatigued from doing other exercises.

, Stretched muscles create a sleeker, longer torso, and thus, better results. It's important to stretch after you do any form of exercise to keep your elasticity, loosen up your muscles, and to get the most benefit from your workout. REMEMBER TO ONLY STRETCH AFTER YOUR WORKOUT ROUTINE. Here are some great stretches to try for your back, abs, and arms:








Stretch your back and abs with some yoga poses. Start off with some simple yoga poses, such as the camel pose, bow pose, or cobra pose.
You can also stand up and touch your toes.
Stretch out over a medicine ball like you're doing a backbend to feel a deep stretch in your abs.
If you can do a backbend or a bridge, this is another great way to stretch out your abs and back.

, Cross your arms over your chest and keep your feet lifted but close together. Then lift your head, and then your shoulders toward your bent knees. Hold the position and lower back to the ground. Do a series of ten or twenty sit-ups before resting. Repeat three to five times.









You can also try a regular sit up, or a variation of different sit ups.

, Lie on the floor and put your knees together at a 90 degree angle. Put your hands by your sides, or behind your head if you feel particularly strong. Contract your abs to lift your hips up towards your rib cage. Be careful not to use your leg muscles here—you should only be using your abs.









Breathe out as you contract your muscles and in as you lower your legs.
Do three sets of 20 reverse crunches at a time.

, Lie on your stomach with your elbows in line with your shoulders. Lift yourself onto your toes and forearms. Contract your abs and make sure that your back stays in a straight line. Hold this pose for at least 5 seconds—ideally you'll be able to hold it for 90 seconds without rest.


For an added challenge, drop one hip towards the floor. Hold for a bit, then return to the basic plank position. Repeat with the other hip. This can also be done with an exercise ball—put the ball under your feet before you assume plank position. Then, use controlled motions to keep the ball in place under your legs.
You should do no more than three bent-elbow planks during an abdominal workout session or you will be very sore. You can do three in a row after you rest after each time, or do them at the beginning and end of your workout.

, Lie on your back and bend your knees at 90 degrees. Put your hands behind your head. Lift your upper back off the ground. Extend your left leg and bring your right knee in towards you chest. Keep your arms still and your upper back off the ground.









Rotate your trunk with each movement. Make sure that each moment is highly controlled—you don't want to move your hips.
Once you find your rhythm, you'll feel like your legs are really cycling a bicycle in the air.
Do the bicycle for one minute at a time before resting. Repeat 2 or 3 times.

, Just stand in place with your arms at your sides and your back straight. Then put your hands on your hips as you raise your right knee without changing your posture. Put your left knee down and raise your right knee.


Alternate lifting your right and left knee ten times each. Then rest and do two more sets.
Keep your abs tightened and your spine straight.

, Sit on the ball with your legs in front of you and your feet flat on the ground. Rest your hands on the ball for support. Then, lean back slightly from your hips, not your upper back. Lift and extend your right leg at the same time. Pull your knee up and toward your chest as you pull your torso forward from the hips.


Do the same in reverse to get back to starting position. Repeat with the left leg.
Do one set of twenty knee tucks at a time before resting. Repeat 2 or 3 times.

, Just like any muscle, your abs need time to recover between workouts. Working them too much will not give them the time to rebuild, and you're less likely to get the desired result.








, The older you get, the more difficult it will be to get a six pack. Women also have a hard time getting six packs, because their bodies store more fat than men's bodies . Men also tend to lose weight faster with the same amount of exercise.


Don't get obsessed with the idea of a six pack—just work on getting tighter abs and you'll feel great.

",How to Get Six Pack Abs Fast," The way to a man's heart is through his stomach...and the way to a man's abs is through the kitchen. If you're not eating right (man or woman notwithstanding), your abs will (or won't, rather) show it.


Not all carbs are evil. It's the simple, white carbs that you want to avoid. Whole grains (aka ""slow carbs"") are rich in fiber and go through your system much more slowly (hence the name) than simple, refined carbs (the white ones). So don't shy away from the browns -- brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat and oats.;
, Because straight up, you'll eat less (and it's the building blocks you need to build muscle tissue). One study of 20 obese female participants, showed that those who got 35 grams of protein at breakfast were less hungry throughout the day and saw favorable changes in the hormones and brain signals that control appetite.Getting six pack abs isn't necessarily about counting calories. But you do need to get rid of the fat on top of your abs to expose the muscles underneath them -- and eating a bit less will get you on track.
Eating any breakfast was associated with increased feelings of fullness, a reduced desire to eat, and lower levels of ghrelin (a hunger-stimulating hormone) throughout the morning. But a protein-packed breakfast was associated with these benefits over the course of the entire day.

This doesn't mean go for the ham and steak. To keep your calorie and fat levels in check, opt for Greek yogurt, whole eggs, and Canadian bacon.What's more, your body burns more calories breaking down protein than it does carbs and fats. Every little bit counts, right?



, Consuming most of your calories from processed and fast foods is going to produce an unhealthy body lacking in nutrients. Foods that have been through some sort of preservation have lost their nutrients and are really just empty, unhealthy calories. Definitely a no-go for a trim waistline.


To make matters worse, processing then adds in unhealthy fats, a ton of sugar or sugar substitute and synthetic vitamins and minerals. These ingredients include artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, hydrogenated oils, and high fructose corn syrup. These non-food ingredients, some of which are considered toxins, may end up languishing in your system, often stored with fat.Anything that's packaged is a processed good. That includes your ""health"" foods, too. Look for the top super foods (nutrient-dense, low-calorie fruits and vegetables, like broccoli). These give the most vitamins and minerals to energize your body.



, Research shows that people who drink and drink and drink water lose more weight and keep it off long term. What's more, it'll up your metabolism to boot.In a recent study, a 30% increase (albeit temporary) was seen within 10 minutes of participants drinking 17 ounces of water. And it's best to drink it cold -- your body takes energy to warm it up.And you'll naturally cut out those sugary, empty calorie drinks like sodas and processed juices. That's killing two birds with one stone.



, Dietary fat that comes from primarily monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats such as olive oils, fish oils, a mix of nuts, natural peanut butter and avocado is actually good for you. While it's true that eating fat ups your caloric intake like none other, as long as you keep it between 20-30%, it can help you get results fast. That's because it helps stabilize your insulin levels which, if they get too high, can cause fat retention.


In addition, consuming fat will keep you sated for a longer period of time; eating just protein or carbs leaves you traveling back to the fridge. So as long as they're the good fats, and they are consumed in moderation, you're good to go.

, When you starve yourself your body goes hungry, it likes to cling onto fat and tell you to chow down on that pizza. If you're never hungry, your metabolism is always up and you're never left wanting.


Eat three standard meals and three snacks, equaling six times a day. Concerned about overeating? Don't be. Because the foods you'll be piling on are high in fiber, protein, and nutrition, you'll be sated with smaller amounts., Once the fat on top of your abs is gone, you'll need washboard abs to be underneath. In the comfort of your home, you can exercise your core muscles -- it helps posture, too!



The plank: You can't just focus on what's on top -- it's what's behind your abs too -- your back! And doing the plank works both. With your forearms on the floor and your toes into the ground, lift up your core and thighs off the floor. Make sure your elbows are in line with your shoulders. To do it right, keep your butt and abs flexed.

The reverse crunch: Upper abs are easy; it's the lower ones that are hard. This exercise is much like a crunch, but with your feet in the air. To start, put your arms at your side, keeping your palms down. Place your knees over your hips, using your abs to place your body. Instead of moving your head toward your knees, move your knees toward your head. Hold your knees briefly as close to head as possible and then lower them back towards the mat.

The Bicycle: This exercise targets your sides, in addition to your upper and lower abs. Lie on a soft surface like a yoga mat and make a pedaling motion in the air. Alternate raising shoulders toward the opposite knee. Make sure to work both sides evenly. 2 sets of 12 reps is a good place to start., If you're going for a six pack, you'll need strong pecs, shoulders, and back too. Your entire body needs to be on track, not just your abs.



Wood Chop: Using a free weight or medicine ball, kneel down on one knee. Lift the weight up, with both hands, over the shoulder of your leading foot. Lower the weight to the other hip, hold, and bring back up. Always make sure your entire body is facing forward. Aim to use a weight that fatigues the muscle in 12 reps.

Trunk Rotations: Working with a dumbbell or medicine ball, get into a sitting position, knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly to engage your abs. Bending at the elbows, hold the weight close to your core and twist from side to side. Pause at the end of each rotation.

Dumbbell fly: Grab some free weights and sit on a stability ball. Walk it forward until it's your head and upper back that are balancing on the ball. Push the dumbbells up and out, directly above your elbows. Swing out and back in, slowly. Keep your abs flexed at all times and your arms loose, not locked. , The absolute quickest way to get rid of fat is cardio.While it's important to do cardio and it's important to work with weights, it's most important to do both in tandem. You need to burn and blast away the fat to see the results you want.


This doesn't necessarily mean running. Swimming, boxing, cycling, and tennis are also great alternatives (amongst many) if you don't feel like hitting the concrete.
Consider high intensity interval training. Most studies have shown that the benefits of cardio are amplified when done in intervals.Work out as hard as you can for 30 seconds, relax for a minute, and repeat 9 more times. And you'll get your workout in super quick.

, You don't want your body to get used to your workouts. Once something becomes easy, step it up a notch. Constantly challenging yourself is the only way you'll see results you've never seen before.


Each time you exercise, make sure to target different muscle groups. Do somewhere between four and eight moves and don't repeat the same moves the next day. Keep your muscles guessing by changing up your routine every few weeks. But, as always, check with your doctor if you're 45 or older.,"

In fact, it will mean your body will be missing out on important nutrients that keep you strong. Also missing breakfast creates low concentration levels, increased risk of heart disease and extra weight will be harder to lose. Eat all of your meals, especially breakfast, as it boosts your metabolism for the rest of the day, and without it, your metabolism will just be low and you'll burn less fat when you do eat.;
, Rather than skipping meals, just cut down your food intake and spread it out over the course of the day. For example, have a nice-sized breakfast, then a small snack at about 10 AM, then lunch, then another small snack at about 3 PM, then dinner. Eating less food at once, but eating more often will cut down your crazy cravings, and keep your body's energy up.

, When you eat, rather than eating lots of food, eat a few things that really fill you up. Foods that are very filling include porridge/oatmeal, soup, potatoes, eggs, pasta, oranges, beans, salad, avocados, apples, nuts (peanuts and almonds) and bananas. Eating those will fill your body up faster so that you consume less calories. Another food that helps fill you up is popcorn, which makes a great snack.

However, spending more time making healthy food will save you so many calories! If it's easier for you, chop up fruit and vegetables the night before school/work, then keep them in the fridge in Tupperware containers or plastic bags so that they're easy to grab when you're hungry. When you need a snack, always reach for fresh fruit or veggies (carrot sticks, anyone?!) Dried apricots are good as well, as they're surprisingly filling for their small size.

, For lunch, fill yourself with fresh salad (none of that oily canteen stuff)! Instead of having a burger, try grilled chicken inside a whole-wheat tortilla! Wraps are great for lunch, because they're easy and quick to make. For dessert, instead of having calorie-packed chocolate fudge ice cream, go for a healthier option such as vanilla yogurt.

, Never force yourself to finish your dinner. Just wrap it up and throw it in the fridge (or take it home in a doggy bag if you're at a restaurant). Don't wolf down your meals - give your body time to digest the food and let you know that you're full.

, Yep, that means exercise. But it shouldn't be a chore, go easy on yourself. Instead of making exercise a chore, just incorporate it into your lifestyle. Little things make a difference! For example, when you're watching TV, instead of flopping down on the couch, stand up. Even if you're standing still, you'll burn more calories that way. During commercial breaks, do sit-ups or walk around your living room.

, Before you do anything in the morning (except from waking up, of course), quickly do 50 sit ups while still groggy and in bed. The mattress will be less stressful on your back, and being tired will make you less aware of the pain. Build this up to 100. This fires up your metabolism before you've even eaten anything.

, If you live near school/college/work then walk or bike. Don't use cars or buses if you don't have to. When walking, walk quickly. This speeds up your metabolism, and will instantly give you more time.

, If you have an office job, take a break every hour or so, get up, and walk around your cubicle for a minute or two. During your lunch break, go for a walk around the block. If people are giving you weird looks, ignore them or say you're going to get coffee.

, It doesn't mean you have to join the gym, unless you want to. Instead, take up dancing, aerobics, or a team sport. They're more fun, and burn way more calories than prancing about in a Lycra pant suit. Plus, they'll give you a chance to meet people and make friends. Also, for a toned stomach, visit the swimming pool. And actually swim a few lengths while you're there.

, Running or jogging is a great way to burn calories and keep you in shape. You can go out on your own with your iPod, or grab some friends and start a jogging club. Running can be fun, and it'll help you get the beach body of your dreams.

, Whenever possible, park far away from your workplace or college. This will force you to include plenty of walking in your day's activity. Alternatively, walk or ride your bike to work, instead of driving.

, The US government recommends that adults exercise at moderate intensity for at least 2 hours and 30 minutes every week, and recommend 5 hours if you're looking for major benefits. Children and adolescents should exercise for one hour every day.It's usually more effective to spread your exercise out throughout the week, instead of sticking to one or two days.

, Sleep is essential for your body's rest, and for it to repair itself. It'll make you livelier in the morning anyhow, and you'll be more willing to exercise. It is suggested that you get 7-10 hours of sleep a night at minimum, so set yourself a bedtime, even if you're an adult. For half an hour before you go to bed, calm your body down by reading a book, drinking some green tea, or listening to relaxing music. This way, it'll be easier to fall asleep once your head hits the pillow.

, Don't go crazy and never eat chocolate again, and then run for four hours everyday. Do things in moderation. Eat chocolate every other day, or once a week. Run for half an hour each day. Don't drink too much pop because that just gets your blood pressure higher then normal

Your doctor can work with you to figure out an appropriate exercise plan. Be sure to ask your doctor about what exercises are right for you, as well as whether you should adjust your workouts based on preexisting medical conditions, weight, or age.;
, If you want to get firm abs, you will need to schedule exercise into your daily life. You should aim for 2-3 abdominal strengthening sessions each week that are around 15 minutes long., You can make your abs more visible by reducing your overall body fat. Try working tow to three cardio sessions into your weekly workout schedule. Aim for between thirty and forty-five minutes of cardio like running, spinning, or dancing during each of the sessions.

, You can use crunches to help firm and strengthen your abdominal muscles. While standard crunches are beneficial, you can also mix it up. Try doing reverse crunches, cable crunches, or twist crunches., Strong, firm abs can be acquired through some dedicated balance work. Try a stability ball, a balance board, or just standing on one leg for 60 seconds at a time. These exercises can help fire up your core and add some spice to your ab workout., Yoga can be a great way to firm up your abs.

Each exercise should be three or four sets long, with as many reps as you can possibly do in each set. If your repetition count for each set is over 30, add additional weight, such as a medicine ball, to make each exercise more challenging and your rep range is decreased. You should perform:Lying, straight leg raises on a bench. This exercise targets your lower abs.

Elevated feet ab crunches. This exercise targets your upper abs.

Lying twist, which targets the obliques.;
, HIIT includes all of your cardiovascular training. While most people think that you can get a six-pack by doing a whole lot of crunches, you actually have to lose a good deal of body fat to be able to achieve that dreamed-of six-pack. That’s where the HIIT comes in. Running, cycling, and swimming are all great ways to work up a sweat. An example HIIT session is:


Ten 100m sprints paired with 100 m walks. This means you would sprint 100 m and then walk quickly back to where you started. You would repeat this process 10 times and the session would last about 30 minutes.The goal is to keep your heart rate up for 30 minutes straight. You would do this five times a week and pair it with your ab training.

, You should try to do your cardiovascular workout in the morning and your ab workout in the afternoon or evening. Once you have figured out what works best for you, pair it with a great diet and stick to it for the duration of the month.

, A clean diet is one that avoids processed foods. Instead, it is comprised of whole, unprocessed foods that make up a well balanced macronutrient died. Processed foods can cover a whole range of things--the processed foods that you want to stay away from are the ones that are heavily processed. For example:


Potato chips, fast-food hamburgers, and frozen premade meals are all on the heavy side of the processed food spectrum.

, To really promote your six-pack abs, you will need to eat a balanced meal comprised of lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, non-fat dairy, and healthy carbs. Your meals should focus more on the proteins, with fruits, veggies, and a small amount of carbs to supplement your protein. However, breakfasts and post-cardio workouts can be higher in carbs.

, Rather than trying to skip out on meals to lose weight, you should actually be eating six small meals a day. Each meal should be less than 400 calories. As stated above, you should have a balanced diet, so try to get a good amount of protein, fruits, veggies, and whole-grain carbs each day. If you don’t want to cook during each small meal, you can drink protein shakes as a snack. A six-pack meal plan for one day would look like this:


Breakfast: one egg and spinach scrambled with non-fat cheese. Two slices of whole-wheat toast on the side.
Snack 1: Two scoops of low-fat frozen yogurt with no toppings.
Lunch: Shrimp pasta pomodoro--pasta, mushrooms, olives, shrimp, seasonings, veggies.
Snack 2: One cup of tomato soup.
Dinner: Braised chicken with vegetables.
Snack 3: Protein shake.

, It is important to stay hydrated during this month of high-intensity workouts. Drinking water also helps you to keep from bloating--when you become dehydrated, your body retains water which causes you to bloat. Drink cool, fresh water throughout the day to stay hydrated, happy, and bloat-free.

, Keeping your legs and arms in the same position on the bed, lift your legs and cross one over the other. Just work at your own pace and do what you feel you can.

, While cleaning up the kitchen or doing chores, try to remember to tighten your stomach muscles and then let them relax. This tip works great for your rear-end, as well. Add a little bending and stretching into your daily activities whenever you can.

Eat whole foods.,

Get plenty of sleep every night.,
Eat breakfast every morning.,
Drink a lot of water.",How to Get Abs at Home1," Filling up your diet with foods that haven't been processed and don't have a lot of artificial ingredients will give you the best chances for success when it comes to losing weight around your middle. The easiest way to do this is to cook from scratch instead of going out to eat or buying prepared foods. While these options are very convenient, it's difficult to know exactly what you're eating. Instead, buy whole, fresh ingredients and cook as many meals yourself as you possibly can.


Eat plenty of vegetables - the wider the variety, the better. Try to make most of your meals vegetable-based.
Look for meat with minimal processing, preferably labeled ""hormone-free."" The hormones given to animals to bulk them up faster can cause health problems in humans.
Choose whole grains like brown rice, quinoa and oatmeal over white flour-based items.
Try making a big pot of soup or a healthy, vegetable-based casserole at the beginning of the week; that way you won't have to cook every day.
Don't forget the importance of healthy fats when it comes to weight loss - olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fish are all excellent sources.
Eat regularly, and do not skip meals. Skipping meals will only slow down your metabolism and your body will not burn excess fat. You will need to burn excess body fat so that your abs will be visible.;
, Eating refined sugars and starches can lead to weight gain and fat retention. Processing sugar, flour, potatoes, rice, and other starches removes the nutrients and fiber from the product. Cookies, cakes, potato chips, white bread, pasta, and other processed carbohydrates cause the blood sugar to spike and lead to fat retention.For many people, the belly area is the first place where the fat collects. The good news is, that's also the area where people tend to see results first when they begin a weight loss regimen - so switching out refined carbohydrates for whole-grain alternatives will probably help you see results very quickly.Avoid sugary beverages like soft drinks. Even diet soft drinks have been shown to cause weight gain, not help with weight loss.
Instead of drinking fruit juice, eat whole fruits; that way you'll get the healthy fiber instead of just the sugar.
Take a break from packaged snack foods, even protein bars and granola bars, when you're trying to lose weight. Even items labeled as ""healthy"" could contain a lot of refined sugars and flours that'll make it hard to take that weight off.

, It might not seem like that big a deal, but being stressed out can have a huge effect on the shape of your body. Do you take time to destress every day? If not, it's likely that your body is overproducing cortisol, the hormone that is secreted in response to extreme stress.Too much cortisol secretion leads to the accumulation of fat around the torso - the spare tire effect. Taking measures to calm down can go a long way toward losing the pounds that are obscuring your abdominal muscles.


Figure out which stressors you can eliminate from your life. Are you completely over scheduled? Cross a few activities off your list so you have more time to relax. Opt out of events you don't really need to attend in favor of staying in and resting sometimes. You probably didn't realize that resting could help you lose weight around your middle, right?
Have rituals that help you relax. Whether it's daily meditation, quiet time outside breathing fresh air, a walk with your dog that you never skip, or a hot bath in the evenings, have a ritual that helps you calm down when you're feeling stressed.
Learn how to breathe correctly. Taking shallow breaths tells your brain that your body is under stress, and the adrenal glands go into overdrive to produce cortisol. It's really important to breathe correctly - that is, from your diaphragm. When you breathe in, your belly should move outward, and when you exhale, it should pull back in., A lack of sleep can cause people to gain and retain belly weight in two ways. First, it stresses the body out, causing the overproduction of cortisol. Second, it lowers inhibition, making people more likely to overindulge in foods they'd normally refrain from eating.If you get enough sleep, you might wake up early, eat a healthy breakfast and make solid choices for lunch and dinner. If you don't get enough sleep, your sleep-deprived self will be much more likely to try to wake your body up by eating too much salt or refined sugar or flour. The solution is to get a good 7 to 9 hours as often as possible.Having a sleep schedule can really help. Try to go to bed at the same time each night and rise at the same time each morning.
Oversleeping can also have a negative effect on your health, so try to get up after 9 hours rather than letting yourself sleep for 10 or more. If you find yourself consistently sleeping over ten hours a night, you may want to consult a doctor to make sure that you do not have an underlying health issue.

, Starting your day with a healthy breakfast is an important way to slim down. That's because eating nutrient-rich calories first thing will keep you feeling full and energized for hours. Skipping this meal will make you more likely to eat a big lunch and dinner, with snacks in between. Start your day off right with the following foods:



Oatmeal. It has a low glycemic index, so it won't raise your blood sugar and lead to hunger pangs. Oatmeal will keep you feeling full for a long time. Top it with almonds and cut up fresh fruit for a delicious, healthy breakfast option.

Scrambled eggs. Having protein in the morning is another great way to keep yourself nourished and full. Studies show that people who eat protein first thing stay full for a long time. Waiting until later in the day to get your protein fix doesn't have quite the same effect.Grapefruit and apples. These two amazing fruits both have components that help suppress the appetite and keep your body nourished.

, Drinking plenty of water has been shown to increase people's metabolic rates by up to 30%.Results are best when you drink 8 glasses or more per day, spacing them out over the course of the day to stay well-hydrated. The practice of drinking plenty of water will help you burn calories faster and keep your body in good condition for the next important step in getting abs at home - building up those muscles!


On the other hand, avoid drinking any beverages that will add calories to your diet. Do not drink sodas, alcohol, soft drinks or other highly caloric beverages.

Note that abdominal exercises like sit-ups help build muscle and do burn some calories, but do not target fat.;
, To reduce fat, you must burn more calories than you are taking in. There are a few simple ways to reduce calories:


Reduce your portion size, but don't skip meals. Not eating for long periods of time signals your body to store fat.Stay away from high calorie, low-nutrition foods.
Specifically, cut out extra sugar. Excess sugar tends to be stored as fat in the midsection.Read food labels and beware of hidden sugars in bread, sauces, dressings, soda, and alcohol.To curb your sweet tooth, opt for healthy choices like dark chocolate, honey, and fruit.Keep track of your caloric intake by using an online calorie calculator, reading food labels, and/or keeping a food journal. Many apps exist for tablets and smartphones that can help you calculate the amount of calories you should be eating and keep track of how many you are eating.

, Protein is an essential nutrient for building muscle, because your muscles are primarily composed of protein.The US government recommends that, depending on your body weight and activity level, about 1/4 of your food intake should be lean proteins.Your body also burns more calories in digestion of proteins than carbohydrates.Healthy options include chicken, fish, and turkey. Vegetarian options include tofu, tempeh, and seitan.

, These foods fill you up quickly, and are rich in the vitamins and nutrients you need to maintain an active lifestyle.


The US government recommends making sure that at least half of your food intake should be fruits and vegetables.The remaining 1/4 of your intake (after protein, fruits, and vegetables) should be grains. Whole grains are best and should make up at least half your grain consumption.Foods that are high in Vitamin C, such as oranges, kiwis, and kale help your body turn fat into fuel and balance stress-related cravings., Staying properly hydrated will improve your energy and mood levels, and will help keep you full between meals.Medical studies have shown that drinking two cups of water before each meal leads people to eat less, and reduces consumption of sugary drinks.Doctors recommend women should drink about 9 cups of water a day, and men about 13., To burn lots of calories, you should do 30-60 minutes of cardiovascular exercise (exercise that keeps your heart rate up) per day.Coupled with an improved diet, these exercises can help you shed pounds.


Choose an aerobic activity that you genuinely enjoy. If you enjoy your workout, you will be more likely to stick with it. There are many options for aerobic exercise that don't require a gym membership, such as walking, running, hiking, biking, dancing, and swimming.
If you don't have time to do a 30-minute workout, there are simple ways to make your daily routine more active. If you work a desk job, use your break time to take a brisk walk outside. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Do chores around the house or yard for 20-30 minutes, or walk to your destination instead of driving., To get a six-pack, you must exercise your upper abs, lower abs, and obliques (side abdominals). While you cannot target each area exclusively, each abdominal exercise emphasizes a particular area. The following exercises will help get you started.

, People often find this area hardest to get in shape, so it may require the most attention. Try these exercises to target these muscles.









Scissors: Lie on your back with your legs raised in the air at a 45 to 90 degree angle, depending on flexibility. Place your hands at your sides, and lower your right leg slowly until it is a few inches above the ground. Return to the original position, and then repeat the movement with your left leg. Continue alternating between legs. Try to do at least 10 reps without pausing.Leg lifts: Lie on your back with your legs elevated a few inches off the ground. Keeping your knees straight, slowly raise your legs until they are perpendicular to the floor. Slowly return to the original position without letting your feet touch the ground. Repeat the exercise.
Torso twists: Sit cross-legged and stretch your arms out in front of you with the fingertips of each hand touching the other. Inhale. With your abdominal muscles tight, slowly rotate your upper body about 45 degrees to the right. Exhale. Return to the center and repeat on your left side. Repeat the exercise.Note that when doing the leg lifts or scissors, your lower back should remain on the ground at all times.Otherwise, you may suffer a back injury.

, The upper abdominal muscles are those right below your sternum. They also must be strengthened to achieve a solid six pack.Here are some exercises that target these muscles.









Crunches with feet on the floor: Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 45 degree angle and your feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head without touching it. Inhale as you use your core muscles to lift your head and shoulders off the ground and toward your knees. Your lower back should remain flat on the ground. Then, exhale as you slowly lower yourself back to the ground.Crunches with elevated legs: Get in the crunch position, but instead of placing your feet on the ground, raise your legs in the air, keeping your knees bent. Holding your legs still and keeping your lower back on the floor, raise your upper body toward your legs while exhaling. Then, inhale as you slowly lower back to the floor. Repeat.Hip lifts: Lie on your back with your arms crossed over your chest. If you are a beginner, you can also place your hands by your side with the palms facing down. Then, raise your legs so that the soles of your feet face straight up. Lift your hips upward off the floor, lifting with your abs. Repeat.

, Last but not least, you'll need to strengthen your oblique muscles. Failure to do so will result in an imbalanced core and a six pack that looks strange or misshapen.Here are some exercises that will help strengthen your side abdominal muscles.









Side bends: Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place your hands on your waist, and then slowly bend sideways at your waist, moving your upper body to the right. Return to the original position, and then repeat the movement on the left side. For a more rigorous workout, do this with your hands at your sides and a heavy object such as a jug of water your hand as you bend.Oblique crunches: Lie on your back with your legs elevated and your knees bent at a 45 degree angle and hip-width apart. You may find it easiest to rest them on a flat surface such as a bench. Then, place your hands behind your head, and use your core to lift your head and shoulders off the floor, touching your right elbow to your left knee. Return to the original position, and then repeat the movement so that your left elbow touches your right knee. Exhale as you rise up, and inhale as you return to the starting position.Oblique twists (Russian twists): Lie down on the floor, bending your knees and placing your feet under a heavy object. Raise your upper body from the floor. Fully extend your arms, perpendicular to your torso, and twist your torso to one side while exhaling. Return to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat, twisting to the other side. For a more rigorous workout, do this while holding a heavy object such as a jug of water, a sack of flour, or a large dictionary., Plank exercises are important for any abdominal muscle workout because they work all the ab muscles together, plus many other muscle groups.To do this exercise, get in push-up position, using your elbows for support rather than your hands. Keep your body in a straight line, making sure that your hips do not sag. Contract and pull in all the muscles around your middle, and do not let your belly drop. Hold for as long as you can.


Keep your head relaxed and looking at the floor.Start off holding this position for 10 seconds at a time, and work your way up to longer intervals.To make sure that your body is straight, do this exercise in front of a mirror.

, For any exercise program, a journal is a good way to keep track of your goals and whether or not you are meeting them.Keep careful notes of everything you eat and all the exercises you do each day.
An exercise journal can help you see which areas of your diet and exercise regimen need improvement.

, Since muscle weighs more than fat, these measurements will be more important indicators of your progress than pounds on the scale.


Weekly measurements of your waist will keep you accountable and highlight the progress you've made.For an accurate measurement using an ordinary measuring tape, measure just above your upper hip bone.Don't measure over your clothes. Relax your muscles and don't suck in your gut., Since we look at ourselves in the mirror every day, it can be hard to notice our own overall progress without pictures.


Take a photo of yourself every two weeks and compare it to the previous photographs. The changes you see will help keep you motivated."

Try bicycle crunches to work the lower abs.,
Do the single-leg lift to work your upper abs.,
Don't forget cardio.",How to Get Abs at Home2," This is one of the best exercises you can do to start strengthening those abs right away, in your home, without ever needing to go to the gym. You don't need any special equipment - just a comfortable spot on the floor. Here's how to do it:


Lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet firmly planted.
Cross your hands over your chest.
Using your ab muscles, lift your head and upper torso up and forward, so that your shoulders leave the floor. Pause at the top, then slowly lower yourself down.
Don't lift your back off the floor, as this can cause you to strain it.
Do 3 sets of 20 crunches to start.

, Get in the same position you use to do regular crunches, with your knees bent and your arms crossed over your chest. This time, crunch to one side, moving your head and arms to either the left or right of your knees. Crunch on the same side for ten to twenty reps, then switch to the other side. Do two to three sets.

, This exercise might seem easy, but you'll feel the burn that tells you you're doing something right! This is a good exercise to do if you're worried about making your ab muscles look too big, and you just want them sleek and toned.


Lie on the floor on your stomach, with your legs stretched out behind you.
Lift yourself up onto your forearms. Your elbows should be directly below your shoulders, with your arms pointed forward, like a Sphinx.
Raise your torso and legs up so that your arms and tiptoes are holding your body's weight. You should feel your ab muscles tighten.
Hold the position for 30 seconds.
Try to repeat this move 2-3 times. Work up the length of time you remain in the plank until you are able to hold it for an entire minute.

, Get in the same position you assume for the basic plank. This time, raise yourself up on just one forearm - either the right or the left - and point the other hand toward the sky. Your body and head should be turned sideways. Hold the position for 30 seconds, then do the same thing on the other side. The side plank strengthens the oblique muscles on either side of your abdomen.

, Lie on your back with your arms at your sides and your legs stretched out. Keeping your legs together and your back straight, lift your legs off the floor until they reach a 90 degree angle. Hold them for a beat, then lower them back to the floor. Do 3 sets of 15 leg lifts.


You can also do alternating leg lifts, lifting one leg at a time in rotation.
Make this exercise harder by attaching weights to your ankles or keeping an exercise ball between your feet as you raise your legs.

, Lie on your back with your knees bent so your shins are parallel to the floor. Straighten out your left leg, and bring your left elbow and your right knee together by twisting across your body. Then, straighten out your right leg, and bring your right elbow to your left knee and repeat the repetitions.

, Lie on the floor on your back with your knees bent. Slightly lift your head towards your chest. Pull your left leg into your chest, and grab it with your hands. Then, lift your right leg to a 45 degree angle, hold for a few seconds, then switch legs.

, Perform cardiovascular exercise, like running, walking, biking and swimming, a few times a week. Remember that your body needs to burn fat so that your abs will be visible, and cardio will help with full-body weight loss.


How long you do cardio depends on the intensity of the exercise. Twenty or thirty minutes of a vigorous exercise like running, where your heart rate is at 75-85% of your maximum, has similar effects to ninety minutes of a low intensity exercise like walking.

Work your abs 3 times a week.,
Stay motivated with a friend.,
Give yourself a deadline.,
Reward yourself for making progress.",How to Get Abs at Home3," Develop a routine so that your abs get stronger and firmer over time. Don't work on your abs every single day; your muscles need a day in between workouts to rest and repair themselves in order to gain strength. Aim to work out your muscles every other day or every 3 days.


On your days off of ab exercises, work out other muscle groups, like your back, chest, gluteals, quadriceps, hamstrings, and shoulders. Developing full-body strength will definitely help your core stay firm, too.
Focus on going all in every time you work out. When you notice that your ab exercises are starting to feel easy, push yourself a little harder. Add more reps, go faster, or add some weight to the mix. If you don't, you're likely to plateau instead of seeing the results you want.

, Getting abs is no easy feat, and there will definitely be days when you're tired of working so hard at it. Having strong, nice-looking abs is always a work in progress, and it's okay if you backslide a bit now and then. That said, it's important to have some tricks up your sleeve to stay motivated and pick yourself back up when you're ready to quit. Setting goals with a friend can be a huge help - you can call each other up and commiserate, have workout sessions together, and trade tips that work for you.


Have a scheduled day of the week when you and your friend do an ab workout together. You won't want to back out on your friend!

, Tell yourself you're going to follow this routine - eating healthy, sleeping well, drinking water, and exercising - for 2 months. If you don't like what you see after two months, you're allowed to stop. 2 months of focusing on your abs is definitely enough time to see results, so hopefully you won't want to stop when the time's up.

, When you start to see your waistline shrink, treat yourself to something nice to motivate you to keep going. You could buy a new pair of pants, a nice box of green tea, or treat yourself to a movie night. Just don't let your indulgence be too high in calories - that'll just negate all your hard work!

Repeat this exercise 20 times.",How to Get Abs (for Girls)," To do a basic sit up, lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Cross your hands across your chest and smoothly lift your upper body, from your shoulder blades to your lower back, off of the ground. Sit all the way up, pausing for a moment at the top of your motion. Then, smoothly lower your body back down and repeat. Don't strain or use jerky movements and don't lift with your neck. The stress should be on your ab muscles, not your neck. Keep your back straight - never hunch while doing sit ups. To do a crunch, which is easier than a sit up, just lift your shoulder blades off the ground - not your whole upper body.









Sit ups and crunches work your central abdominal muscles. Your ab muscles, as a whole, run from the pelvis to just below the chest. The transverse muscles are rather large, but the rectus abdominus muscles are fairly thin. For the rectus abdominis to appear beneath the skin, you will need to both build your core and reduce fat around your waistline.For well-rounded, sculpted abs, it's important to hit every part of your abdominal region.
Another good core workout is the plank exercise. This exercise, which is a good core workout on its own, is highly versatile - by adding different poses and/or movements to the basic plank, you can work a wide range of muscles.;
, Lay on the floor with your legs straight and pulled together. Keeping your legs straight, slowly and smoothly lift your legs to a vertical position so that they're pointing at the ceiling. Gently lower your legs to the floor and repeat. Don't separate your legs or bend your knees as you do this exercise, unless you find it too difficult - in this case, modify the exercise so that you're bringing your knees to your chest, rather than pointing your feet towards the ceiling. For an extra challenge, try holding a medicine ball or a small weight between your legs as you do this exercise!









Leg lifts work your lower abs. Though they're especially hard to work and ""define,"" well-toned lower abs can take your six pack to an eight pack! The core muscles play an important role in hip and spine stabilization, which, if not maintained, can lead to back injury.Other lower ab exercises like reverse crunches and hanging leg lifts also target the hard-to-hit zones just above your hips, contributing to a toned upper pelvic area.

, Lay on your back in the basic sit up position with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Tuck your palms behind your head, keeping your elbows bent. Raise your right knee up towards your chest. As you raise your knee, gently lift and twist your upper body, touching your left elbow to your right knee. Ease your upper body back down and lower your right knee as you simultaneously raise your left knee, touching it to your right elbow. Repeat this motion, alternating knees and elbows.









Bicycle crunches work your obliques, which are a must for any thorough ab workout. Not only are these muscles on the side of your torso important in terms of abdominal strength and core stabilization, they also look amazing when they're cut and defined. Firm oblique muscles will make your sides appear tight and trim, giving a slimming effect.
Your obliques will likely be the first visible muscles appearing after doing ab work for a while. These will appear as thin lines from the lower ribs down to your hip bones.

Oblique sit ups and side planks, are also great exercises for your obliques. Within minutes, you'll feel that satisfying burn in your sides!

, One great exercise which hits your legs and glutes while simultaneously using your hips, back, and abs as secondary muscle groups is the lunge. To do a lunge, begin by standing straight upright with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with your right leg. Bend your right leg and lower your body down towards the floor, keeping your back straight, until your right knee is bent at 90 degrees. Push yourself back up to a standing position, keeping your weight on your right foot. Repeat this motion with your left leg. Do this exercise slowly and smoothly - straining or jerking can hurt your knees or back.









Though you're probably mostly interested in working your abs to get a tight stomach, a good, varied workout is essential for good posture, balance, spine stabilization, and overall health. Don't neglect any muscle group between your chest and your knees - you may regret it!
There are a huge variety of exercises for your supporting core muscles. You can try yoga poses like the the warrior pose, cobra pose, or camel pose. Supermans and pointing dog exercises can also help. A strong, solid core is an absolute must when going for sculpted abs.

, Because tight abs are so widely desired, ab workouts naturally attract urban legends and other unsubstantiated claims. Don't believe everything you hear when it comes to building sexy abs - if a certain piece of information sounds too good, it probably is.


You can't spot-burn stomach fat. This is a widely-circulated myth. It doesn't matter how intensely you work out one specific body part - exercise doesn't remove fat from that specific body part.Rather, fat is lost gradually from the entire body. To lose belly fat so that your abs will show, you'll need to lose fat all over.
You shouldn't only do ab exercises. Doing countless crunches will give you stronger ab muscles, but you may not see the results in the form of tight, sculpted abs. Often, for someone to get abs, she must also diet and make other lifestyle changes (see below) for the abs to become clearly defined.

, As with any exercise routine, the best way to see improvements in your ab muscles is to be persistent. Exercise routines are most successful when they're repeated consistently over a long period of time. If you're ready to work for the toned stomach you deserve and you haven't already established an exercise routine, try to set aside about an hour each day to exercise. Practice a healthy mix of strength and cardio exercise - a good policy for beginners is to do strength-building and cardio exercises on alternating days.


Even if you just want a tight stomach and you're not interested in exercising the rest of your body, your exercise routine should be varied and balanced. Not only will a well-balanced routine improve your overall look and physicality - it will also be better for your abs. Core muscles are used for support in virtually all strength exercises, so the greater variety of exercises you do, the better your abs and core!, Unfortunately, exercise isn't always enough to get amazing abs. You may get strong ab muscles from an intense ab and core workout, but if your new muscles are covered up by belly fat, you won't get the visual results you're going for. To burn fat, it may be necessary to make certain lifestyle changes so that you run a calorie deficit - that is, you use more calories than you take in.









To begin, try to change your current daily routine so that you use more calories throughout the day. If, for instance, you drive to school or work, try biking or running instead. If you spend most of your free time watching TV, try signing up for a local amateur sports team or simply going for a jog. Over the long-term, these minor changes can help you cut down on lingering body fat, making your abs much more defined.

, One sure-fire way to lose weight is simply to eat less. There is debate about how often and how much you should eat for optimal weight loss - the most important thing to remember for weight loss is simply to take in fewer calories from food than you use throughout the day. Calculate your basal metabolic rate, then count the calories from the food you eat throughout the day.


A healthy weight loss goal is to lose about one or two pounds a week. One pound of fat is 3500 calories. To lose a pound a week, you need to cut 500 calories per day from your diet.
Make sure that any diet you plan to participate in is realistic, sensible, and safe. You need to eat at least 1200 calories a day. Don't starve yourself or neglect your nutrition, or you may seriously endanger your health.

, When it comes to dieting, it's not all about how much you eat - it's also about what you eat. Try to cut as many processed foods as you can out of your diet - as a general rule, if you can't immediately tell what plant or animal a food was made from, it probably counts as ""processed."" Also try to cut out high-fat and high-sugar dishes. Instead, supplement your diet with vegetables (especially high-nutrient vegetables like kale and spinach) whole-grain carbs, lean protein (yogurt, chicken breast, eggs, and certain fish, for instance), and limited amounts of healthy fats (like olive oil, avocado, and nuts.)


Drink as much water as you can! It's refreshing, zero-calorie, and it's been found to promote weight loss., Cardio (or ""aerobic"") exercise is a great way to burn fat. Intense cardio workouts, like running, swimming, and cycling, burn lots of calories. If you're looking to burn fat, consider devoting time each week to cardio exercise. It's a great way to widen the gap between the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use every day. However, beware - if you increase the amount of food you eat in response to a new cardio routine, you may not burn fat.









As with most forms of exercise, pursue a new cardio routine with moderation. Don't go overboard - if you devote all your time to cardio and none of your time to strength-building exercise, eating healthy, and resting, you may exhaust yourself and be left with disappointing results.

, For comfort, use a foam exercise mat or a carpeted section of floor. Place your heels on a low table at an angle of at least 90 degrees.

, You may have seen people wrap their fingers behind their head while doing crunches - if you do this, you may accidentally stress your neck muscles. By wrapping your hands across your chest, you spare yourself the possibility of neck pain.

, Use your ab muscles to smoothly lift your upper body (keeping your neck relaxed) until you have gone as far as you can without lifting your lower back off the ground. Never use jerky movements - these can hurt your back.








, Begin to lower your upper body back down smoothly and slowly.








, Each time you reach the top of your crunch, hold this position for a second or two, then let yourself down slowly and repeat. If, at any point, you experience pain in your lower back, stop.








, After 20 repetitions, rest briefly (less than 1 minute), then do another set of 20. Do 2-4 sets, or go until you ""feel the burn"" - a light soreness in your abs that signifies the muscles in your stomach have been worked out.

"
Do crunches.,
Do the plank exercise.,
Lift your weight.,
Do leg raises.,
Do cardio as much as possible.,
Work out your abs for about 20-30 minutes, 3 days a week, at first.,
Watch what you eat!,
Eat small portions of food in regular intervals.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Get a Six Pack (for Girls)," Crunches are another great way to get abs quickly and effectively, and there are tons of variations on crunches. Basic crunches require you to lie down on a matted floor, with your back flat to the ground and your knees bent at a 60-degree angle. With your hands near your temples, or crossed on your chest, lift your shoulder blades off the ground a small bit and feel the ""crunch"" in your abs. Exhale and go back down to the ground. Repeat.









Try the hands overhead crunch. Instead of keeping your hands at your temple, do a basic crunch while stretching your arms overhead with your palms crossed. Keep your arms outstretched above your head at all times while you complete the crunch.
Try the cross-body crunch. With your hands to the side of your head and your fingertips at your ears, gently behind your head, bring your left elbow and right knee together when you crunch. Go back down and bring the right elbow and left knee together as you crunch. Try to bring your shoulder up towards your knee rather than just your elbow. Remember that the key is to contract the abs as you perform the movement.
Try the legs on exercise ball crunch. Instead of having your legs bent on the ground, place your legs at a 90-degree angle onto a large medicine ball. Slowly roll your shoulders off the floor and contract your abs, as in a regular crunch. Move down and repeat.
Try the decline crunch. Lie on a decline bench and secure your legs at the highest point so you won't fall off. Lower yourself down so your body is completely in-line with the bench. With your hands crossed over your chest, gently lift your shoulders up, contract your ab muscles, and hold it for a second. Lower your torso back down and repeat.
Try a rotation of crunches. Example: 20 regular, 10 cross-body, 15 hands overhead.;
, The plank exercise is one of the most reliable, deceptively simple ways to give great definition to your abs. All you need is a flat surface, a little bit of time, and some serious gumption as you feel the burn.


Get down in the prone position. The tips of your toes and your forearms — from the bottom of your elbow to your balled-up fist — should be the only parts of your body touching the floor.
Make sure your weight is supported by your toes and your forearms.
Keep your body as straight as possible at all times. Hold this position as long as you can.

To increase difficulty, an arm or leg can be raised. Place one foot on top of the other to also increase difficulty.



, Take two chairs of equal height, and rest your forearms on them, then pick your legs up off the floor in an up and down position. But be careful that you don't slip or fall.

, Another great ab-builder is leg raises. You'll be able to feel how effective this exercise is as soon as you get into starting position.









To get into starting position, lie down flat on a matted floor, your head, back and legs completely even with the floor. Shift your hands underneath your glutes.
Gently lift your feet an inch or so above the ground, so that they are just barely hovering above, and are parallel to the ground. Keep this position until you start to feel a burn in your abs.
Slowly lift your outstretched legs, with your knees bent a touch until they make a 90-degree angle to the floor. Your body should form an ""L"" shape.
When your legs have reached the 90-degree angle, lift your hips up off the floor with the bottoms of your feet facing the ceiling and contract your abs for a second. Gradually lower your legs back down to the starting position, exhale, and repeat.

, Set aside at least one day a week to run a mile. Playing games like tag and hide and go seek outside can even burn calories. Taking your dog for a run is also a convenient way to run, and make sure you drink plenty of water!








, Work up to exercises all 5 days of the week. Eventually, when it gets easier, do ab workouts twice each day, 5 days a week.

, Eat plenty of protein to build those ab muscles. Avoid sugar all together and reduce your caloric intake.


Eating dos:

Lean meat, such as beef, fish, chicken, or turkey.
Lean protein, such as eggs and soybeans (tofu) or other beans.
Antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, such as spinach, kale, blueberries, or strawberries.
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts and sunflower seeds (unsalted).
Whole grains, such as oatmeal or whole-grain pasta.


Eating don'ts:

Fast-foods.
Rich sauces, heavy cream, ice cream, desserts and carbohydrates (bread, starches, etc.).
Sweets, such as candies, cakes, and pastries.
Processed foods, such as sweet breakfast cereals, chips, or fish sticks high in sodium.



, Shoot to eat about 5-7 times a day, just with really small portions. For a snack, go for a banana and some walnuts, or a small bit of Caprese salad. Your biggest meal of the day should be before mid-day.


Try not to eat right before you go to bed. Food that gets consumed right before bed often doesn't have enough time to get metabolized by your body, and so is converted directly into fat. Avoid those late-night snacks!

, A suitable allowance of water for adults is 2.5 liters daily in most instances but most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods. Drinking water also prevents you from drinking other alternatives which contain calories while still keeping you hydrated.Cut out all sugary drinks from your diet! Sugary drinks — even those like Diet Coke, or Coke Zero — will not contribute to your overall health like plain, filtered water will. You don't have to be fanatical about it but try to avoid soft drinks as a general rule.
Drink green tea! Green tea is packed with antioxidants, which are instrumental in curbing free radicals — cells in your body that attack other cells and contribute to aging.Without sugar, green tea is a great way to get some fluids and antioxidants into your body, and it does not contain any calories.
Drink a big glass of water or green tea right before a meal. This will give your stomach the illusion of being full, which means that you're likely to eat less.

Finished.",How to Fake Abs," Before you can start creating your fake abs, you need to have some sort of canvas for the makeup to hold on to. This base or ""canvas"" can be a foundation that closely matches your skin tone, a tainted moisturizer, or sunscreen. You can also use a tinted sunscreen, or you can create your own by mixing little bit of liquid foundation that is close to your skin tone with your sunscreen. Choose something that suits your needs:


Foundation will give you the most coverage and will help even out your skin tone. A cream foundation will be more opaque than a liquid foundation.
A tinted moisturizer will help moisturize and condition your skin, as well as even out your skin tone. It will not have the same coverage as foundation, however.
Sunscreen will protect the tender skin on your abdomen against sunburn. If you add some foundation to it, it will also help even out your skin tone a little.;
, You want the bronzer to be about two shades darker than your skin tone.Do not use a shimmering bronzer, as shimmer causes things to pop out—use a matte bronzer instead.You will be creating fake shadows to give the illusion of a toned abdomen, so you want something that looks natural.


If you cannot find a non-shimmering bronzer, you can substitute a brown eyeshadow or pressed powder foundation instead, as long as it is no more two shades darker than your skin tone.

, You want the highlighter to be a shade lighter than your skin tone.This powder can be shiny, as shine causes things to pop out.


If you cannot find powder highlighter, you can substitute with pressed powder foundation that is several shades lighter than your skin tone, or a pale ivory eyeshadow.

, You will need two types of brushes: a large powder brush, and a creasing brush. If you cannot find a creasing brush, you can substitute with a small, round-tipped makeup brush. You will need two of these creasing (or round-tipped) brushes: one for the bronzer, and one for the highlighter.


If you cannot find a second creasing brush, you can use the same brush for both the bronzer and highlight. Just make sure you clean the brush by swiping it over a tissue until you cannot see any more bronzer on it.

, Having a bright light above you will make it easier for you to see your muscles and the shadows they cast., While it is recommended to take off your clothes to prevent staining them with makeup, you can wear an old swimsuit or workout outfit instead. You want your abdomen to be exposed.


Do not wear the same outfit that you plan on wearing later with your fake abs. Not only do you risk staining your outfit, but the makeup stains might give your secret away.

, Do you want a six pack? A four pack? A two pack? Consider this before applying your makeup.

, Using your fingers, rub the foundation, tinted moisturizer, or sunscreen onto your skin. Be sure to cover any areas of your abdomen that will be exposed, and to blend in the edges if you are using foundation or a tinted moisturizer.


If you are using foundation, you can use foundation brush or a cosmetic wedge instead of your fingers.

, To avoid ruining your brushes in the next few steps, wait for the foundation, tinted moisturizer, or sunscreen you have just applied to dry out. You can tell if it has dried out if your skin no longer looks shiny, moist, or dewy.


When in doubt, you can always touch your abdomen with your finger. If your finger comes away with makeup, moisturizer, or sunscreen on it, then you need to wait longer.

, Flexing your abdomen will help you find those muscles and highlight them in the next steps. You do not have to flex your abdomen the entire time, but it is a good idea to do so before drawing each line to ensure that you are placing the shadows in their proper locations.

, Swivel your brush in your powder bronzer and tap the brush to get rid of the extra. You can also blow lightly on your brush to dislodge any extra powder.

, Take your brush, and create a single stroke down the center of your abdomen. You want the line to extend from just below your ribcage to your belly button.


If the line is not dark enough, you may go back over it again, but try not to use too many layers. You want the line to be light. If it is too dark, it will look fake and unnatural.

, Load up your brush with more bronzer, and create two more lines just below your ribcage. You are drawing something that looks like an upwards-pointing arrow.

, Flex your abdomen again, if necessary, and find the vertical grooves to either side of your belly. They begin just below your ribcage and extend down towards your belly. Once you have found them, draw a line down each one using your bronzer and brush.


If you flex your abdomen, you may find some horizontal grooves to either side of your belly button. They extend from the belly button and connect with the vertical lines you have just drawn. If you wish to have a more defined abdomen, you can fill them in with bronzer, just as you have the other lines.

, Take a powder brush, and brush it over the lines you have just made using brisk, up-and-down motions. You may also have to brush side-to-side to blend further. This blends the lines in, and makes the shading less harsh.


If the lines appear too dark, do not panic! Simply take some pressed powder foundation that matches your skin tone, load it up onto your powder brush, and brush it over your abdomen. This will help lighten the shading and blend everything together.

, You have just applied the base and added some shading, creating something that looks like an upward-pointing arrow and some boxes. These boxes are your muscle, and will need some more defining.

, Simply swivel your brush in the highlighter, and then tap the brush to get rid of any extra powder. You can also blow on the brush to dislodge any excess.

, Take the brush, and lightly apply the highlighter to the muscles. Using a tapping or dabbing motion at first, then blend in the edges using a brushing, left-to-right and up-and-down, motion.

, Pick up your powder brush, and using a circular motion, go over the lines you have made.

, Look at yourself in the mirror, and be sure to examine your work from every angle: front, left, and right. If necessary, apply more bronzer or highlighter, but be sure to blend it again.


If your highlighter is too light and your bronzer is too dark, and blending did not help, you can further soften it by going back over it with pressed powder foundation. Simply swivel your powder brush into some pressed powder foundation that closely matches your skin tone, and dust it over your abdomen.

Use twisting exercises to work your obliques.,
Improve your balance with the standing warrior.,
Combine squats with knee crunches.,
Do lunges with rotation.",How to Exercise Your Abs Standing Up1," Ab exercises that include a twist or cross component will work your entire core, but are especially helpful at working the obliques that run along the sides of your abs.For example, you can try side-to-side waist twists. Hold your arms close to your body with your elbows bent. Slowly turn your shoulders to the right while keeping your hips forward. Turn as far as you can comfortably, hold, then return to center. Repeat on your other side.
You can combine a twist into common exercises such as high knees to work out your entire midsection. Do this similarly to the way you did the bicycle, using the opposite hand to reach for your foot. Alternate right hand to left foot and left hand to right foot.;
, The standing warrior is an exercise adapted from yoga's warrior pose. Not only does it build and engage your core, it helps you increase your stability and sense of balance.From a standing position, raise your right knee until it is about hip height in front of you. Then extend your right leg behind you as you reach forward. Reach your arms out straight ahead to help you balance. This should be one fluid motion.
Hold your leg behind you for a second, then bring it back down to standing position and pause again before repeating the exercise. Do 10 repetitions on each side.

, Combining a squat with a knee crunch or a twisting motion will make your body weight exercises more dynamic while working out your entire midsection and your legs.To do a squat into an oblique knee crunch, start by doing a squat with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your hands over your head and your back neutral. Go into a squat, then press through your heels to come to a full standing position.
As you stand, raise one knee up and to the side, crunching your elbow down to meet your knee. Then bring your knee down and go right into a squat. When you come up the next time, raise your opposite knee and crunch your elbow towards it. This is one repetition.
If you want to add a cardio element to this exercise, do the movement as fast as you can for 30 seconds while still maintaining good form. You also get a good ab workout simply by doing the exercise at a slower pace. Try to do four or five sets of 8 to 10 repetitions each.

, Lunges with rotation will work out your core, especially your obliques, as well as your glutes. Make sure you are rotating your body with your abs, not with your back for this exercise to work.For this exercise, you're going to start with a regular lunge. When you lunge forward, rotate your upper body and reach with your hands to the outside of your forward knee. You can add weight to this exercise if you want to increase resistance and make it a more intense strength-training exercise.
Build up muscle memory by performing this exercise with your body weight. Once you're comfortable with it, add dumbbells for greater resistance.

Typically you want to start with about five pounds of weight. If you can't complete your routine using a five-pound dumb bell, you may want to consider just using your own body weight for a few more weeks until you gain more strength.
Add weight as the exercises become easier for you to complete. You should be struggling to complete the final repetitions of each exercise.

, The teapot is a relatively small and simple exercise, but it can work your lats, obliques, and glutes as well as improve your grip. Windmills increase the stability in your shoulders and core.To do teapots, stand tall holding the kettle bell by your side. Your feet should be no more than hip-width apart, but you'll work out your abs more the closer together you plant your feet.
Put your other hand on your hip, then slide the kettle bell down the side of your leg, bending at your waist. Keep your back and shoulders flat so you are simply hinging to the side. When you've gone as far as you can, slowly stand back up.
Do 8 to 10 reps on one side, then take a brief rest and switch the kettle bell to the other hand so you can repeat the exercise on the other side.

, Try an exercise like wood choppers weighted with a medicine ball. Alternatively, you can use a single dumbbell if you don't have access to a medicine ball.To do wood choppers, stand with your feet about hip-width apart, or maybe a little wider – you want to feel stable.
Hold your medicine ball or dumb bell over your head with your arms straight. Then bend from your waist, also bending your knees, and lower the weight to the outside of your left foot. Engage your core as you lift the weight back over your head, then repeat on the opposite side.
While doing wood choppers, make sure you keep your arms and back straight.

Use your abs to correct your posture.,
Walk at least 30 minutes a day.,
Add toning moves during your walk.,
Do jumps and twists with a hoop.",How to Exercise Your Abs Standing Up3," Your core muscles are designed to support and stabilize your spine. Keeping your core active while you go about your daily activities will improve your posture and can help decrease back pain.Focus on breathing deeply, from the bottom of your belly, and keep your abdomen open. Remember that the muscles engaged in deep breathing are part of your deep core.
Many people over-arch their back, which can lead to back pain and other problems.Weak abdominal muscles can lead to this kind of posture problem. Keeping the abs toned is one of the best ways to help combat this issue.
When you allow your abs to control your posture, you may have less back pain and your abs are being engaged every minute you're awake.

, Walking is a good, low-impact exercise that can also decrease your belly fat – essential if you eventually want to build those washboard abs. Walk with good posture, keeping your back neutral and engaging your core.If you're just starting a walking regimen, start slow with shorter, 10-minute walks and work your way up gradually to 30 minutes a day.
Use varying intensity to pace yourself for optimal fat-burning and to work out your core. For the first few minutes and the last few minutes of your walk, you want to walk more slowly to warm up and cool down – generally at a pace slow and light enough that you could sing.
For the bulk of your walk, you need to be at a brisk or moderate pace. You should just be able to carry on a conversation at this pace.
You also want to include at least one interval of power walking – a pace at which you're still capable of talking, but it's more difficult than at your brisk pace.
For example, you might walk at a slower pace for five minutes, then at a brisk pace for 10 minutes, then power walk for five minutes, then walk at a brisk pace ten minutes, then cool down with a slower pace for five minutes. That would be a 35-minute walk.

, Particularly during the brisk portions of your walk, you can add arm movements that intensify your workout as well as target your abs. When you move both your upper and lower body, your core has to do a lot more work maintaining balance.Most of these movements are extremely simple. For example, you can reach your arms out in front of you at shoulder level as though you're punching. Alternate arms in opposition to your legs. You can do the same motion by raising your arms over your head as though you are punching the sky.
You also can make movements that mimic bicep curls or weight presses.

, There are a number of cardio ab exercises that you can do with a hope or ring. Buy or make a hoop or ring (you can even use a square shape) that you can use as a target for your jumps.Put your ring or square on the ground and stand to the left of it. Step your right foot into the ring, raising your knee high up to your chest. Follow with your left foot inside the ring, also raising your knee high.
Continue the same motion to step out of the ring on the other side, and then step back into the ring with your left foot, then your right, continuing to press your knees high up to your chest.
Try to do this exercise as fast as you can while still maintaining accuracy and good form. Keep your back neutral and avoid bending over. Do the exercise for 30 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. You may want to continue doing it for several minutes following this rotation.

Start in plank position.,
Engage your core.,
Jump your feet up and to the right.,
Jump back to plank.,
Jump your feet up and to the left.,
Complete a 30-second interval.",How to Do Ski Abs1," The ski abs exercise is a plank variation, so you start in the full, straight-arm plank position. Make sure your wrists are positioned directly under your shoulders and your back is flat.Keep your head and neck in a neutral position. Don't crunch your neck or hunch your shoulders up around your ears.;
, Ski abs is an abdominal exercise, so most of your strength and stability is going to come from your abdominal muscles. Lightly contract your core to engage the muscles. Don't hold your breath.You may want to take a few deep breaths from plank position before you start the exercise, so you get used to breathing while also engaging your abdominal muscles.

, To start the ski abs exercise, hop both of your feet over to the right side of your body. Bend your knees and aim to have your knees just outside your right elbow.Keep your torso flat and parallel to the floor. Use your abdominals to maintain stability.

, As soon as you complete the jump to the right, you want to jump your feet all the way back to the full plank position where you started. Again, focus on keeping your torso parallel with the floor., From plank, immediately jump to the other side. If you've ever seen downhill skiers, you now understand the reasoning behind this exercise's name. The movements are somewhat similar to a skier's.After you jump on the other side, don't forget to jump back to plank before continuing the exercise. Between each side, return to the center plank position.
You can use gliders under your feet to add a new challenge to the ski abs exercise. Come down to your elbows and forearms so your torso has a little more stability., The ski abs exercise is best done in an interval, rather than a specific number of sets. Set a stopwatch for 30 seconds or a minute, and do as many ski abs as you can with good form during that time."
"
Try different plank variations.,
Add a leg lift to the reverse plank.,
Alternate ski abs intervals with burpees.,
Test your balance with boat crunches.,
Work your side abs with the Russian twist.",How to Do Ski Abs2," The plank is one of the best exercises you can do to build strength in your core, but just doing a regular plank can get boring after awhile. Side and reverse planks can add some variety to your workout as well as giving you a more well-rounded abdominal workout.For a side plank, you want to raise up on one side, stacking your ankles one on top of the other. This exercise is a tough workout for your obliques, the muscles running along the sides of your core. Make sure you do the side plank on both sides.
A reverse plank is just like a regular plank, only you're facing the ceiling rather than facing the floor. Make sure your wrists are directly under your shoulders, with your fingertips pointed toward your feet.
You also can experiment with spreading your feet, balancing your hands or feet on a stability ball, or gripping dumbbells. These variations allow you to add other exercises, such as rows or curls, into your plank.

, If a simple reverse plank is too easy (or too boring), you can increase the difficulty of the exercise by raising first one leg and then the other. Your core gets a workout stabilizing your body, and the leg lifts crunch your lower abdominals.When doing leg lifts, make sure your hips remain raised at the same height throughout the duration of the exercise.

, Burpees are a classic bodyweight exercise that works really well with ski abs. Although burpees do work your core, they are a whole body exercise that also works your chest, arms, and legs.To do a burpee, stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Lower into a squat, then place your hands directly in front of your feet. Jump your feet back into a plank, then back forward to your hands. Explode into the air, hands over your head, then land and immediately come back into a squat for your next repetition.
Try doing a 30-second interval of burpees, followed by a 30-second interval of ski abs.

, The boat crunch is another exercise to build strength in your core. This exercise is inspired by the boat pose in yoga, and brings your entire core into play to help balance and stabilize your body.From a seated position (on the floor), bend your knees and then raise your legs until your knees are over your hips and your shins are roughly parallel with the floor. Lean back, keeping your spine straight and your shoulders and neck neutral, until your torso and your legs create a ""V"" shape. Extend your arms out in front of you for balance.
As you inhale, extend your legs out straight and lower your upper body until you are almost parallel with the floor. Don't lower all the way to the floor.
Come back up into a ""V"" shape to repeat the exercise. Do a 30-second interval of boat crunches, then move on to something else.

, The Russian twist is a classic abdominal exercise that targets your obliques as well as your lower abs. This exercise is done from a seated position (on the floor), knees bent so that your feet are flat on the floor.Clasp your hands together and lean back, keeping your back straight. Twist side to side, keeping your arms extended. Your hands should come to the outside of either thigh as you twist.
The further you lean back, the more of a challenge this exercise will be for your lower abs. You also can lift your legs to make it more difficult. Then it also will test your balance, much like boat crunches.

"
"
Avoid crunches.,
Train your abs in categories.,
Start a high-protein diet.,
Eat small meals frequently.,
Join a 30-day challenge program.,
Do full core training on non-consecutive days.",How to Do Ski Abs3," Crunches put pressure on your vertebrae, so doing them often can lead to injury over time. It is important to add variety and do exercises which work the abs without rounding the torso and hips. If you want a strong and defined abdominal area, you need to incorporate exercises that specifically target all the different muscles in your core.If you do a lot of crunches, you can actually worsen your posture or even injure your vertebrae or discs. Instead, focus on exercises that keep your head and neck in alignment and lengthen your abdominal area, such as boat crunches.

, Take some time to learn about the basic movement patterns of your core muscles, and how they work together. Then you can build a routine with exercises that target your upper abs, lower abs, and obliques.A full sit-up is an example of a classic upper abs exercise. However, if you only do exercises such as this one, that target your upper abs, you'll never get the stomach that you want.
Twisting exercises, such as the Russian twist, work your obliques. Any exercise that involves leaning your torso back, or lifting your legs, also works your lower abs.

, It's a common saying in the fitness world that abs are made in the kitchen. A healthy diet that is high in protein and moderate in overall calories will help you burn fat as well as build muscle.Focus on lean meats such as turkey and chicken. If you don't eat meat, look to plant-based foods that are high in protein, such as tofu and other soy products.
Make sure your body is getting all the vitamins and minerals it needs. Take a multi-vitamin supplement if you aren't getting enough vitamins and minerals through food, but keep in mind that food is still the best way to get the vitamins and minerals you need.

, If you're trying to get rid of stubborn belly fat, eating smaller meals five or six times a day will keep your body from accumulating extra calories as fat. You'll also probably snack less because you're eating more frequently.If your work schedule doesn't really allow you to eat a small meal every two or three hours, you can instead have a smaller protein snack that you can eat while at your desk or on the job.
Eating smaller meals more often also will boost your metabolism so that when you exercise you'll burn more fat.

, A 30-day challenge can help, especially if you neglected exercise for awhile and are trying to get back into it. You can find information about 30-day challenges on exercise websites, as well as at gyms and fitness clubs.Some 30-day challenges are focused on building a specific part of your body, such as your abs. If you want to build that tight, toned six pack, a challenge can give you a jumpstart toward achieving your goals.

, You won't build strong abdominal muscles unless you allow the muscles you've trained full time to recover after a workout. If you want to develop a six pack, leave at least 24 hours between abdominal workouts.For example, you might do core training on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, do a lighter cardio workout, such as walking or jogging, that doesn't target your core specifically.

Try a side plank.,
Transition between forearm planks and side planks.",How to Do a Marching Plank1," This is what most people consider to be the standard plank exercise, and it's a good place to start if you want to master the plank itself before moving on to more challenging variations.You can get into position either by starting on all fours or by laying face down on a mat. Line your elbows under your shoulders so that your upper body is supported by your forearms, and extend your legs behind you so that you are on your toes. Your body should be a straight line from your heels to the crown of your head.
Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body, imagining that you are lifting your weight up and away from your elbows. You can keep your forearms straight ahead, pressing your palms into the mat, or you can clasp your hands in front of you. No matter which position you choose, place your hands so that they line up below your eyes when you look down at the floor.
Start by holding the plank position for 10 to 20 seconds. You also can measure time by measuring your breaths. Make sure you are breathing slowly and deeply, controlling both your inhale and your exhale.;
, Once you can do the forearm plank for a minute or two without shaking, you may be ready to challenge your arms further with the high plank. For this plank, your arms will be extended straight, rather than bent at the elbows.Your body should be a straight diagonal line from your heels to the crown of your head. Really engage your abs and make sure your shoulders aren't crunched.
Your wrists should be directly below your shoulders. Cup your palms slightly and press all fingers into the mat to protect your wrists. You don't want all your weight bearing down on your wrists.
Hold the position for 10 to 20 seconds, breathing deeply. As the position gets easier, you can gradually increase the time you hold it. Only hold the position as long as you can with good form.

, Even if you have no problem with regular planks, you may find a new challenge doing a side plank because it targets different abdominal muscles than a standard plank does.Move into side plank from the forearm plank position. Breathe deeply, and on an exhale raise your left arm as you tilt your body to the side, stacking your ankles one over the other.
At first you may only be able to hold this position for a few breath cycles or a few seconds. Lower to forearm plank and repeat the exercise with the other side.
For additional challenge, you can also do high side planks with your supporting arm extended. Make sure your wrist is directly under your shoulder. You'll need a strong high side plank if you want to do marching side planks., You can create a dynamic plank workout by moving from forearm planks to side planks and back again. This movement prepares you to do marching planks with proper form.To create this exercise, lift your left arm on an exhale. As you inhale, lower back to forearm plank position.

, With your spine straight, your chin up, and your abs tight, take a breath in, and as you exhale, press your knees away from each other.


Press them far enough apart that you feel the muscles on the outer part of your thighs contracting.Hold the exercise for four seconds, and as you release exhale.
Do not hold your breath as this may make you feel dizzy!

, If it is your first time doing the exercise, you may only be able to repeat the exercise a few times; however, as you get stronger, you should aim for three sets of 15 reps.Try to do this exercise three to five times each week.


Therefore, you should do the exercise 15 times, stop for a little break, and then repeat another 15 times. Then, take another break, and repeat again 15 times.

Sit on a ball.,
Use your hands for support.,
Begin the exercise.,
Repeat.",How to Do a Sitting Abductor Exercise3," For this method, you will need a six to nine inch ab ball to sit on. Place the ball on an exercise mat, and sit down carefully on it.A medicine ball, which is a weighted ball used for exercise, could also work well.

, It will be very difficult to balance on the ball without support, so place your hands behind you on the floor, a bit wider than shoulder width apart.If it is difficult for you to do this, you can also rest your hands on a short bench, placed behind you.
You might also try using yoga blocks to rest your hands on.

, With your abdominal muscles contracted, and your spine straight, lift your legs straight into the air until your body makes a “V” shape. Take a breath in, and as you inhale, slowly open your legs. You should feel the outer muscles of your thighs contracting.


Exhale as you bring your legs back together.

, You should repeat the exercise for three sets of 15 repetitions.Repeat this exercise three to five times each week for best results.


If this is very difficult for you, try starting off by sitting on the floor and work up to sitting on the ball.

Start marching in forearm plank position.,
Transition between forearm planks and high planks.,
Crunch your knees to your elbows.,
Add a jump to your marching plank.,
Try marching side planks.",How to Do a Marching Plank2," The basic marching plank will challenge your core more thoroughly than the traditional plank, while also working your lower back, shoulders, and glutes.Get into the forearm plank position so that only your forearms and your toes are touching the floor.
Lift your right foot off the floor, taking care not to shift your body weight at all as you do so. Lower your right foot back to the floor and lift your left foot. Lower your left foot back to plank. This is one repetition. Do 5 to 10 repetitions, breathing deeply and maintaining a solid plank.

, You can incorporate the ""marching"" action with your arms by moving back and forth between forearm planks and high planks. Make sure your elbows and wrists remain directly under your shoulders as you raise up.First raise up to extend your right arm, then your left. Once you're in high plank position, immediately lower your right arm to your elbow, then your left, to complete one repetition. Do between 5 and 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, Add a crunch when you're in high plank position to further challenge your core and glutes. This exercise can be done from a static high plank position, or can be incorporated into the exercise where you transition between forearm planks and high planks.From high plank, bend your right knee and pull your knee toward your right elbow. Immediately release your knee and extend your leg back behind you. Then repeat the motion with your left knee to complete one repetition. Do 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, Exercises that incorporate jumps are known as ""plyometric"" exercises and they help build fast-twitch muscle fibers to increase your explosive power and reduce your reaction time.You want to add jumps when you're in high plank position, so don't try this if you're doing the basic marching plank from forearm plank position without moving your arms.
While in high plank position, jump your feet out simultaneously so that they're wider than shoulder-width apart. Then jump them back together and lower to forearm plank position. Raise back up to high plank position and jump again. Think in terms of doing horizontal jumping jacks. Do 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, The same knee crunch marching movement that you did with regular planks you can also do with side planks for an intense oblique workout that challenges your balance and stability.To do a marching side plank, you need to be able to get into a high-plank position on your side. Position your legs in a scissor stance so that the sides of both feet are on the floor, rather than stacking your ankles as you would for a regular side plank.
Lift your right knee toward your chest, release it back down, then left your left knee the same way. That's one repetition. Do 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise, then switch and do it on the other side.

Work in some ankle-tap push-ups.,
Try the starfish march.,
Challenge your stability with the fallen triangle.,
Add quadruped plank variations.",How to Do a Marching Plank3," Ankle-tap push-ups from a plank position not only give you a good core workout, they also work to strengthen your arms. Press into your fingers and cup your palm as you do this exercise to protect your palms.From plank, you're going to straighten your arms and push your hips up to the sky at the same time, ending in an upside-down ""V"" position with your hands and toes on the floor.
Press down into your heels and reach back with your right arm to tap your ankle. Return your right arm to the front and repeat the action with your left arm. Then return to plank position to complete the rep. Do 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise.
Placing your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width will give your chest a good workout. If you keep your arms close to your body, along your ribs, you'll get a good triceps workout.

, The starfish march is a variation of the marching plank that will give you a challenging whole-body workout. To begin this exercise, get in forearm plank position with your elbows directly under your shoulders.March or jump your right leg and right forearm out wide to the side, holding the plank steady. Try to avoid shifting your weight. Immediately march them back to starting position and repeat the movement on your left side to complete the repetition. Do 5 to 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, The fallen triangle is a variation of the marching plank and side plank that was inspired by the triangle yoga pose. This variation provides a good whole-body workout while also improving your balance and stability.Start in high plank, and roll over to your right in a right side plank with your left arm reaching up toward the ceiling. Kick your left leg forward.
Bend your left knee as you roll back over into high plank and through to left side plank, spinning your knee underneath your body. Then return to right side plank.
Repeat this exercise 1 to 3 times from right side plank, then do 1 to 3 repetitions from the left side. Make sure you're doing the same number of reps on each side.

, The quadruped plank with leg kickbacks may seem like a pretty easy exercise – after all, you are on all fours. However, this exercise actually is a surprisingly intense ab workout.From all fours, lift your knees about two inches off the ground and engage your core. Kick your right leg backward, extending it straight and flexing your foot. Bring it immediately back to starting position and repeat the motion with your left leg. Do two sets of 10 alternating repetitions, lowering your knees for a rest between sets.

You will also need to adhere to a healthy diet and reduce your calorie intake in order to really see results. You should find a trainer to help you calculate a proper amount of calorie intake a day. This will require discipline and determination. In addition to reducing your calorie intake, there are also some smart food choices you can make that will specifically help to reduce your waistline.


For example, in a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. Remember that fruits have sugar, so exceeding your intake of fruits per day will impede your progress.Keep in mind that in order to lose a pound of weight, you will need to cut 3500 calories from your diet. Health specialists advise that the optimal level of healthy weight loss is one to two pounds a week, so it is not recommended that your starve yourself or follow fad diets in order to lose weight more quickly. Follow what your trainer says.;
, Kicking off the day with a healthy, balanced breakfast is one of the best things you can do when following a weight-loss diet. A good breakfast kick starts the metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout the day. It also keeps you fuller for longer, reducing your tendency to snack throughout the morning and afternoon, which may result in a higher calorie intake overall.


Try eating a combination of filling wholegrain cereals and breads, protein-rich eggs and high-vitamin fruits for the perfect balanced breakfast. If you're on the go, grab a fruit smoothie and a cereal bar for convenient, yet filling goodness.
You should also try to drink a glass of water before breakfast (and every other meal throughout the day) as this prevents your body from confusing thirst with hunger, which may lead to you eating more than you need. Plus it helps to keep you hydrated, which is always important.

, It is very common for dieters to try to starve themselves between meals, with the result that they actually eat much more than necessary when the food is finally in front of them. One of the best kept secrets of successful dieters is that they actually eat more frequently throughout the day, they just eat smaller meals.


Eating smaller, more frequent meals prevents dieters from becoming too hungry, causing them to eat less overall. It also stimulates the metabolism, which allows the body to burn more calories throughout the day.
Try eating six small meals a day, rather than your regular three large ones. You'll find sticking to your weight-loss plan much easier in the long-run if you're not in a constant state of hunger!

, Many dieters believe that they need to avoid fat like the plague when trying to lose weight. However, eating a certain amount of healthy fat is essential for a balanced diet and can actually aid weight loss. In fact, studies suggests that a diet with a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) (avocados, nuts, seeds, soybeans, chocolate) can prevent the accumulation of belly fat. As a result, 25 to 30% of your daily calorie intake should come from such healthy fats.Polyunsaturated fats - such as the Omega-3 fatty acids found in mackerel, salmon, herring, walnuts, canola oil and tofu - are another type of healthy fat that you should try to incorporate into your diet. They help to lower bad cholesterol and boost brain function.Trans fats, on the other hand, (found in margarine, crackers, cookies--anything made with partially hydrogenated oils) result in more fat being deposited in the abdomen, so you should avoid these as much as you can.

, Fiber-rich foods are an essential component of any healthy diet, for a number of reasons. Firstly, fiber-rich foods help to normalize bowel movements, which minimizes bloating and blockages. Secondly, fiber-rich foods help you to stay fuller longer and may require additional chewing time, thus preventing overeating. High-fiber foods also tend to be lower in calories than other food types.


Try to incorporate a wide range of high-fiber foods into your diet, to get the benefits of both soluble and insoluble fibers. Examples of soluble fibers include oats and barley, peas and beans, apples, carrots and citrus fruits. Examples of insoluble fibers include wheat bran and products containing whole-wheat flour, nuts, beans and green vegetables.Soluble fiber, in particular, has also been shown to lower insulin levels, which can speed up the burning of visceral belly fat.
Plain water is the best alternative, as it flushes out your system, reduces bloating and keeps the body hydrated. However, if you find plain old water too boring, try drinking water with a hint of flavoring like mint leaves, lemon, lime, or even toss in a few frozen raspberries or create a combination- Be creative! Vitamin water, or naturally sweetened iced teas also make a significantly healthier alternative to sodas.
Don't use straws. You should also avoid using straws to sip your drinks, as straws cause you to suck more air into your stomach as you drink, leading to bloating and a bigger belly. Drink straight from the cup instead to avoid bloating.

, Even if you are carefully monitoring your portion sizes and consistently working out, your weight loss can be significantly impaired by a continued consumption of processed foods. This is because processed foods typically have high sugar and starch contents, which limit weight loss and lead to the buildup of harmful toxins.


Be extra careful when it comes to products that are marked ""non-fat"", such as cheeses, breads, yogurts, etc. These products may have a low fat content, but they are usually packed with extra sugar and empty carbohydrates, and offer very little, if any, nutritional value. Some frozen processed organic meals are actually not too bad, as long as you make sure to carefully read all the labels and check the content and ingredients list.
You should also avoid processed food products with a high salt content, such as ready-meals and frozen goods, as the salt leads to water retention and causes bloating. Just go for fresh foods instead of pre-packaged or frozen whenever possible.

, If you really want to trim your waist, you will need to commit to a regular and rigorous exercise routine. Great results will only come with hard work and dedication, so make sure you are prepared to put in the necessary effort before you begin. On the other hand, if you begin exercising too rigorously from the get-go, you may become disheartened and disillusioned, and therefore much more inclined to give up.


To overcome this, try making an exercise plan where you start at a reasonable level, before gradually building yourself up to longer more intense exercise routines. Keep a log of what you're doing each time in a record book or diary and check your progress against this.
Eventually you'll find yourself exercising regularly without feeling worn out or disinterested in it and your waist, along with your overall health and fitness, will have benefited a great deal.

, As mentioned before, weight loss is essential when it comes to losing inches from your waist. Unfortunately, there is no way to target weight loss in a specific area of your body, so overall weight loss is the only option. Cardiovascular exercise is the best form of exercise for burning calories, so it is essential to any weight loss routine.


Running, skipping and cycling are all excellent cardio options, which usually don't even require a gym membership. Cheap, yet extremely effective, there's no excuse not to incorporate a little cardio into your workout.
Trainers advocate tracking your heart rate during cardio. For example the best way to shed fat is by walking on the trail or outside and keeping your heart rate at low-medium level. Have that after a session of endurance training and you are on the way to shed this fat.
You should do at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio each week. You can even do a blend of moderate and vigorous activity. To reach this goal, aim for 30 minutes of cardio exercise four to five times a week.

, Many core strength-building exercises focus on the oblique muscles, which run along the side of your stomach. Although working these muscles will give you a toned and flat stomach, it will also build up the muscle, making your waist appear wider than before. This is definitely not what you want when aiming for a tiny waist. To work your core and trim your waist you should focus on your transverse and rectus abdominals.


Your transverse abdominals work as your body's natural corset and so with enough work in this area you can achieve a smaller waist. Pilates does a lot of work that focuses on the transverse abdominals and therefore can be a very effective method.
Remember to breathe when exercising core muscles. While it may seem obvious, many people forget in the concentration on getting the muscle action correct and then you leave your body tense and fragile. Instead, remember to breathe in and out, on the way up, on the way down, etc. If you can't work this out in a rhythm that works for you, consider joining yoga or Pilates for help.

, Even though you can't target weight loss on your waist, you can certainly perform certain exercises which tone and slim the muscles around the mid-section.


Do the 'hundred' exercise. This is done by lying on your back and lifting your legs up to a 90 degree angle. Raise your shoulder blades off the floor with your arms reaching towards your feet. Begin by pumping your arms up and down, and repeat for 100 pumps. Breathe in through the nose for five pumps and out through the mouth for five pumps. As you get stronger, you can start to lower the legs closer to the ground until your legs are only a few inches above the floor. Remember to keep your upper torso lifted off the ground.
Suck in your stomach. Try to keep your stomach sucked in throughout the day, while sitting at your desk, in the car or at the grocery store. This works the stomach muscles, while simultaneously making you look slimmer. Over time, you won't even notice you're doing it!

Do sit ups. Lie down on the floor or a yoga mat, and bend your knees while keeping your feet flat on the ground. Cross your arms over your chest. Slowly raise your upper body towards your knees before lowering yourself back down again. Work up to doing three sets of sit ups, with 10-20 repetitions in each set.
Do twist crunches. This requires you to lie on your back and bend your knees up while keeping your feet flat on the floor. Bring your fingers up to touch your ears and slowly contract your abdominal muscles, lifting your torso off the ground. When you're at the point of feeling you can't lift your body any further, contract your side muscles and turn gently to the left. Return your torso flat to the floor. Repeat on the right side. Build up to two or three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions each.Do a plank. Get into the position for doing a push up. Rest on your forearms and keep your eyes to the floor at all times. Pull your stomach muscles in tight, imagining them touching your backbone. As you do this, your bottom should be down and your back straight. Aim to hold this position for about a minute.Do the side plank. This exercise targets the ""muffin top"" region of the body. Lie down on a comfortable mat, on your right side. Rest on your right arm and extend your legs outward, placing your left foot on top of your right foot. In this position, slowly lift your pelvis up from the floor. Contract the muscles all around the lower torso, including the lower back and hips. Continue to bear weight on your right forearm and feet. Aim to hold this lift for around 10-15 seconds. Repeat three to five times for each side, or work up to holding the pose for 60 seconds., Emphasizing upper curves can make the waist seem to shrink, so you should incorporate some shoulder and chest building exercises into your workout routine in order to give the illusion of a smaller waist. Some specific exercises include:


Bench dips. This exercise works the arms and shoulders and is performed using an exercise step or kitchen chair. To do a bench dip, sit up straight on the edge of the bench or chair, extending your legs in front of you. Firmly grip the edge of the bench or chair and slowly slide your body off the bench, lowering yourself towards the floor. Keep your back straight, and keep lowering until your arms form a 90 degree angle. Push your body back to the original starting position and repeat.

Push-ups. This classic exercise works the chest muscles. It can be done by propping your body up on your toes (for a more advanced version) or by balancing on your knees (for an easier version). To do it, place your hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart and raise yourself up, using just the strength in your arms, until both arms are fully extended. Slowly lower your body down again until your elbows form a 90-degree angle. Raise yourself back up into the extended arm position and repeat.

, Exercise regimes can become repetitive and boring, making you less inclined to follow through with them. This is why it's important to shake things up from time to time and try something new, whether it's a new form of exercise, or simply incorporating a new prop. Here are some suggestions for shaking up your exercise regime that can also help to improve your waist reduction:


Use a hula-hoop. Your waist and hips will benefit from 10 minutes a day of hula-hooping, with the added bonus you get to behave like a kid again each day!
One way to get and keep your waist (and the rest of your body) looking great is to dance! You don't have to start up dance lessons, but turn on the radio or listen to your iPod and party around for about 20-30 minutes every day. Make sure you're moving all of your body. Dancing burns off lots of calories and it feels great when you're having fun, and you'll look and feel great!
Use dumbbells. Build shoulder muscles by lifting dumbbells out from your sides for resistance. Lift 10 times for each set, four sets a day. The broader your shoulders and outer thighs, the narrower your waist appears.
Consider doing yoga or Pilates; these are great activities for core abdominal muscle exercises and you can also be part of a group session which can be very motivating.
Make exercising comfortable; ensure that you have floor mats, breathable clothing, a water bottle, and other things that help increase your enjoyment of exercise. Music in the background can also add motivation.

, Draw attention to your waist by wearing belts that emphasize and nip in your middle. They can be wide, skinny, jeweled, braided -- whatever! Wear them over dresses, long tops and even winter coats to get an hourglass figure which gives the illusion of a smaller waist.

, A-line dresses are those which are tight at the hips, then flare out towards the hem, giving the illusion of a smaller waist. They are very flattering on almost every body shape, as they emphasize the waist, while skimming over any imperfections around the hips and thighs.

, Low-rise jeans can be very unflattering to anyone who carries even a little weight around their middle, as they create the dreaded ""muffin top"" effect. High waisted jeans are much more forgiving as they cover up any excess fat around the hips, and draw attention to the waist. Worn with a tucked-in shirt, these type of jeans can be very flattering indeed.

, Picking the right foundation garments can greatly reduce your waistline.

Try ""shapewear"". Most quality lingerie stores carry lines of undergarments that are designed to smooth and support your figure.
Corsets. Worn under gowns as a figure enhancing item of lingerie in centuries gone by, the corset has gained renewed popularity recently for providing an effortlessly sexy silhouette, whether under other clothes or on its own. Steel-boned corsets (not as painful as they sound - promise!) do the best job of cinching in your waist, and can actually permanently reduce the size of your waist with prolonged wear!

You are also much less active in the evenings and at night, which means that your body is more likely to store the calories you consume late at night as fat, rather than burning them as energy.
Try not to eat anything at least two to three hours before going to bed, or follow the ""daylight diet"", which only allows you to eat during daylight hours.;
, There's no real secret when it comes to having a flat-tummy friendly diet — you simply need to eat more healthy foods like fruit, veg, and whole grains, and cut down on junk food, like candy, chips and fast food. Just by making this simple switch, you'll see a world of difference to your stomach. However, it's not recommended that you go cold turkey — try to ease into a healthy diet by slowly, but consistently replacing the bad with the good. Here are some simple changes you can make:



Eat lots of lean protein. Beans, nuts, and lean meat are good for you.

Eat whole grains. Look for labels that say ""100% whole grain"" or ""100% whole wheat"" and not just ""wheat flour."" Whole grains keep you fuller longer, which can help with weight loss and getting a flat tummy.

Eat low-fat dairy products. Good dairy options include milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Avoid products high in fat like ice cream and hard cheeses.

Eat healthy fats. Not all fat is bad you know! The monounsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, olive oil, and fish oil are actually very good for you, as are the polyunsaturated fats found in seed oils. These can help you to lose weight. Just stay away from the trans fats found in processed foods and baked goods.Lower your sodium intake. Sodium causes your body to retain water, which causes you to look bloated — especially around your abdominal region. Whenever possible, try replacing high-sodium foods with healthier options. Switch regular table salt for kosher or sea salt, which is lower in sodium. Some foods high in sodium include soy sauce, restaurant meals, MSG, cured meats like pepperoni and salami, ham, bacon, sauces, and snack foods., Rather than eating the wrong kinds of foods, many people just eat too much of the right foods. You should eat just enough until you feel full, then stop. If you're eating regular, healthy snacks throughout the day, this shouldn't leave you feeling hungry.


One good trick is to use smaller plates when you eat meals. That way, your plate will look like it's heaped with food, but you're actually eating less than you normally would. Also try to fill at least half the plate with vegetables.
Try to chew more slowly and thoroughly when you eat. Chewing your food well helps the digestion process in the stomach, leaving you feeling less bloated and gassy. You should chew every bite until it reaches the consistency of applesauce.Take small breaks in between every bite of food when eating. The extra time will give your stomach a chance to realize that it's full, thus preventing you from over-eating.
Raw and unsalted nuts and seeds are especially good snacks when eaten in moderation as they will make you feel more full. Do not eat more than a handful at a time as they can be high in calories.

, These items take longer to digest, so you feel full longer. Your body will slowly absorb the nutrients so you'll avoid any spikes or drops in your blood sugar until your next meal. Some of the best low-GI foods are:Cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumbers, zucchini, dark leaf lettuce, onions, pears, tomatoes, watercress, broccoli, bananas, apples, and berries are all good foods to eat.

, Besides being full of empty calories, having less sugar in your system will help to lower your insulin levels.


Use artificial sweeteners with care. While they may help to reduce caloric intake, there is also evidence suggesting they trigger an increase in hunger that results in weight gain.Watch out for beverages like sodas, alcohol, juices and specialty coffee drinks. These often contain high levels of sugar.

, According to experts, eating a protein-rich snack at the magic hour between three and four in the afternoon will boost your metabolism and balance your blood sugar.


A protein bar or shake, a handful of almonds, or pumpkin seeds, or a chunk of low-fat cheese are all good options.
Having balanced blood sugars lowers the amount of insulin in your system, which is good because insulin can cause you to store fat around your middle., Replace your usual system of eating three large meals a day, with eating smaller, more regular meals. Many people make the mistake of eating nothing at all between breakfast, lunch, and dinner, especially when they are trying to lose weight.


However, this type of diet will negatively effect blood sugar levels and cause you to eat more due to hunger, thus making it harder to lose weight.
Having a small, healthy snack every three to four hours and not letting yourself go hungry is a much healthier and more effective system., You should replace all your regular beverages with water, especially soda and sugared drinks which are full of empty calories and will cause your stomach to bloat.


Take water with you wherever you exercise or do strenuous activity and take water breaks during hot or heavy workouts.
Drinking lots of water will help to flush toxins out of your system and keep your bowels moving, both of which are essential for a flat stomach.
If you find regular water too boring, consider making sassy water instead. Sassy water is simply regular water infused with a number of refreshing and energizing ingredients, which help to speed up the metabolism and cut down on belly fat. Recipes vary, but many include some combination of ingredients such as orange slices, lemon slices, grated ginger, cucumber, fresh spearmint, and fresh basil. The water is left to infuse overnight — making it refreshingly ""sassy"" by the next morning!
Pay attention to your body's signs. Your urine should be a light yellow or clear color; dark yellow with an odor could be a sign that you are dehydrated.

, While the prospect of cutting alcohol out of your diet completely may be hard to bear, you should seriously consider cutting down. Alcohol, particularly wine and beer, is full of calories (scary fact: one 750 ml bottle of wine contains roughly 600 calories).


Alcohol consumption also releases estrogen into the system, which is undesirable, as excess estrogen causes the body to retain weight.
Perhaps more importantly, alcohol stimulates appetite and causes willpower to melt away, making you much more likely to binge on all the things you've been depriving yourself of, like burgers, fries, pizza, chocolate, and potato chips., Sure, you can do 100 crunches a day, but if you've got a layer of belly fat covering up your ab work then what's the point? You need to burn the top layer of stomach fat to see the changes. Cardio exercises will heat up your core temperature and improve circulation, both of which will aid in acquiring a flat stomach. Strive for at least 30 minutes a day minimum, but include 1-2 days of rest each week.


Activities such as dancing, running, tae-bo, swimming, cycling, and walking at a good pace will all provide a great aerobic workout. In fact, anything that brings your heart rate up will do the trick! Boxing provides an excellent cardio workout, while the muscles involved in throwing punches will help to flatten your stomach.Try interval cardio training, such as alternating between sprinting and power walking. You can try sprinting for as long as you can. When you become too tired, you should walk. When you feel that you've caught your breath, sprint again. Do these alterations for a total of 20 minutes at a time.

, Plyometrics are exercises that require ""explosive power"". They combine cardio with strength training. Plyometric exercises are more suitable for experienced athletes than for the less experienced athlete or the older athlete, as there is risk of injury (falls, contusions, tendon injury and sprains). Some great plyometric exercises you can do at home include:


Modified jumping jacks. Start standing, then jump up with hands and feet spread apart, creating an ""X"" in the air with your body, then land back in standing. Repeat as many times as you can.
Squat-thrust push-ups. Start in push-up position, do one push-up, then push off with your feet and pull your knees up to your chest so your feet land between your hands (still on the ground in push-up position), then jump as high as you can, arms over head. Squat back down with your hands on the floor, then jump back to push-up position again. Do as many as you can do well with good form.

, Having more muscle will increase your metabolism, so you'll burn calories faster over time. Note that abdominal exercises will increase the muscle mass in that area, leading to a larger look unless you simultaneously follow the previous steps to shed body fat.


Crunches work the upper abdomen, leg raises work the lower abdomen, and side bends work the obliques (also known as love handles). About 15-25 reps each day should be enough. If you can do more than that, try adding weights to your routine. Note that doing crunches will only build muscle underneath your existing belly fat, but will not burn that fat directly.
Try using an exercise ball to work your tummy muscles. One great exercise is called the ball exchange. Lie flat on your back, with your arms extended over your head, holding the exercise ball. Lift the ball above your chest, simultaneously raising your legs (keeping them completely straight) off the ground. Place the ball between your ankles, then lower your arms and legs to the floor. Repeat the exchange, this time passing the ball from your ankles to your hands. Do 10-12 repetitions., You will have a flat stomach in no time!


Lie down on the floor with your hands crossed over your chest or raised over your head. Make sure your knees are bent.
Keep your feet on the ground as you lift your head, neck, and shoulders off of the floor. Do not yank the head forward as this can cause a neck injury.
Repeat 10 times and increase the amount you do daily.

, Doctors, certified dietitians, and personal trainers can help you in covering all of the bases you need to to lose weight. They can give you a diet and exercise plan that will help you get to your desired weight. Working from their guidance is much easier than doing it alone.


See a doctor to make sure that you are healthy enough for vigorous exercise or major changes to your diet. They can help you find a plan that fits with any health conditions that you may have.
A registered dietician can provide professional advice regarding diet and nutrition. You can also contact a certified nutritionist, although they cannot provide you with meal plans like a dietician can.
A personal trainer will help you create an individualized exercise plan. They can also help motivate you to stay with your exercise plan and work to the best of your ability.

, Eating healthy and exercising are the best ways to lose extra pounds. Fad diets may have short term results, but they'll turn on you after awhile, or even cause serious damage to your body. In the long run trendy diets just make you eat more or in unhealthy and unsustainable ways, causing weight gain. Try eating healthy.

, Your results will only be temporary and you will feel frustrated sooner, which makes you much more likely to give up.


While you might think that starvation is most effective, in essence it could do permanent harm to your body as well as make it hard to keep off the weight.

, You cannot expect immediate results in a healthy way. Any method that sees fat just ""melting off"" is also likely extremely bad for your body. The best way to preserve your health and keep the fat off long-term is to take the steps we discuss above.


Also, keep in mind: some people find it harder to obtain a flat stomach than others. Natural body shape and your own personal fitness level play a role. What works quickly for some might not work quickly for you.

, Many people overeat because work, their family, or other factors are causing them too much stress. Finding other ways to cope with this stress can really help you get and keep that flat tummy.


Try things like jogging to reduce stress, or take up a new hobby like boxing that gives you a positive outlet for those negative feelings.

, Having adequate rest helps you to relieve stress. You will feel less likely to go on an eating binge. Develop healthy sleeping habits.


Studies have also shown that inadequate sleep can inherently cause weight gain, so get yourself to bed!, Many people eat more food than they need to to make them feel better, because others put them down, they feel lonely, or they don't like how they look. Don't do this! You are beautiful and amazing! When you accept that you are incredible just as you are, you'll find that you're okay with a little softness in the navel region.


Don't compare your body to that of others. Everyone has a different body type and no one will ever look exactly the same. You might not need a flatter stomach at all. As long as you feel healthy, that's really all that matters.

Begin with traditional crunches.,
Move into doing bicycle sit-ups.,
Do long arm crunches.,
Warm up your lower abdominal with the reverse crunch.,
Finish your warm-up with exercise ball crunches.",How to Do an Effective Abdominal Workout1," Crunches are similar to situps, except only your shoulders and upper back come up off the floor. This compresses your spine less and doesn't require the use of your hip muscles. To do a crunch, lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and your arms crossed on your chest (or fingers laced behind your head). Slowly curl upwards until your upper back is off the floor. Pretend a string attached to your shoulders is pulling you up towards the sky (not towards your knees). Keep your abs tight and lower yourself back down slowly; you work your muscles just as much on the way down as on the way up.;
, You can keep the same starting position as you used for the traditional crunch, except you should lace your fingers behind your head if you haven't already. Then, lift your legs so that your knees are bent together and touching your chest. Contracting your abs, sit up slightly and inhale. As you exhale, straighten your right leg and try to touch the outside of your right arm to the outside of your left thigh. Straighten your core and bring your knee back to your chest on the inhale. Then, repeat for the opposite side.

, Long arm crunches engage all of the muscles in your abdomen to ensure a thorough workout. To begin, stay in the same starting position as you have for the last two exercises. However, instead of crossing your arms across your chest, extend them straight back on the floor (as if you're reaching up above your head). Then, contract your abs to lift your arms, head, and shoulders off the floor (Remember not to lead with your arms! They should stay next to your head the entire time). Stop when you reach a 30˚ angle. Hold for a couple seconds, then lower yourself back down in a slow, controlled manner.

, Bend your knees so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and your lower legs are parallel to the floor. Put your arms to your side, palms down. As you inhale, roll your pelvis backwards to pull your legs up towards your torso. Your hips should be lifted off the floor and your knees should touch your chest at the end of the exercise. Then, slowly release and return to the starting position.

, Prop your legs up on an exercise ball so that your knees are bent at a 90˚ angle. Place your hands behind your head (don't lace your fingers) and tighten your abs. Gently lift your upper body off the floor be contracting your abs. Don't tuck your chin into your chest. Slowly lower yourself back down to the floor as you inhale."

Finish this portion of your workout by using an ab roller.",How to Do an Effective Abdominal Workout2," This exercise not only works your abdominal, but it will help give your body more overall flexibility. Lie on your back on the floor with your arms extended at your sides and an exercise ball between your straight legs. Squeeze the ball slightly and tighten your abs. Then inhale as you slowly use your legs to lift the ball up. Push your hands down into the ground or place them under your glutes for more support. Keep lifting in a slow and controlled motion to pull the ball all the way over your head. Then, slowly lower back down to the ground.

, This is an extremely effective exercise, but it requires the use of a captain's chair. If you don't have one at home, they should be readily available at your local gym. To perform the exercise, position your forearms and back on the provided pads and dangle your legs down below you. Tightly grip the handles of the machine. Slowly lift your legs towards your chest. Keep your knees and feet together. Then lower your legs back down in the same slow, controlled manner.

, Place the rocker on a flat, lever surface and lower yourself to the floor. Place your head on the head rest so that your back is flat on the floor and your shoulders are slightly raised. Keep your feet on the floor and your knees bent at a 45˚ angle. Grip the sidebars of the rocker. As you exhale, contract your abs (not your arms) to push yourself forward. To work your obliques, do the same motion, but drop your knees to one side. Then, repeat with the other side.

, Lie on the exercise ball so that the middle of your back is touching the ball and your feet are planted firmly on the floor. Lace your fingers behind your head. Contract your hips and glutes and inhale. As you exhale, roll your body up slowly so that your head is raised and your shoulder blades are raised slightly up off the ball. Don't drop your hips. Then, slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.

, Tie a piece of exercise tubing about two and a half feet above the floor. Lie on your back and bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor. Hold the exercise tubing in your hands behind your head. Then, perform a traditional crunch. Keep in mind that the further you are positioned from the anchor point of the exercise tubing, the more strenuous this exercise will be.

, A torso track is a machine that is designed to work all of your abdominal muscles at once. To use, place the track on the floor. Kneel on the padded cushion. Grip the handles with both hands. Contract your abs. Exhale as you move forward as fast as possible. Then pull yourself back to the start and inhale. Keep your abs contracted the whole time. If you loosen your abs, you'll place dangerous strain on your back.

, An ab roller is a wheel designed to help you work your abdominal. Kneel on a pillow or folder up blanket on the ground and grip the roller with both hands. Contract your abs and roll yourself forward until your knees come up off the floor and your body is hovering just above the ground. Hold the position for 2 to 3 seconds or as long as you can before slowly pulling back to the starting position. Remember to use your abs to pull yourself back, not your hips. Your ankles shouldn't come close to your hips when you're performing this exercise.

",How to Do an Effective Abdominal Workout3," Lie down on the floor with your knees bent and your hands clasped behind your head. Flatten your back and clench your abs. Raise your toes up so that your heels press down into the ground and you feel your upper thigh muscles working. Then, bring your head and shoulders up towards your hips as you would for a traditional crunch. Using primarily your abdominal, hold yourself up in this position for a few seconds. Then, slowly lower back down to the starting position.

, Sit down on the ball with your legs in front of you, knees bend and feet on the ground. Then, walk yourself forward so that your back is leaning against the exercise ball rather than perpendicular to it. This is similar to the starting position of exercise ball curls. Then, tense your abdominal muscles while you bring your torso towards your knees. Keep your feet planted firmly; try not let any muscle below your hips move. Then, slowly move back and arch your back over the ball so that your head moves closer to the floor.

, Lie on your back with your hands behind your head. Cross your legs at the ankles and raise them in the air so that they're almost all the way extended. Then, contract your abdominal and lift your torso up towards your knees. Be sure to keep your chin off your chest. Slowly return to the start position as you inhale.

, To do the plank, get down on your hands and knees. Extend your legs out behind you so that your toes are together and touching the floor. Then, rest on your forearms so that your elbows are bent at a 90˚ angle directly below your shoulders. Hold for as long as possible.

Make sure you warm up first.,
Start with flutter kicks.,
Add the Superman exercise.,
Move on to bicycles.,
Stretch to cool down.",How to Tone Your Abs with Flutter Kicks1," For an ab workout, incorporate dynamic stretching into your warm-up that will target your abdominal muscles and get them ready for more intense work.Start your warm-up by walking or jogging in place for a few minutes to elevate your heart rate a little and increase your core temperature.
Then you might try the ""good morning"" stretch, which is a good way to start engaging your core. Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and your hands at your waist. Hinge forward from your hips with a flat back. You can keep your weight on your heels, or roll forward onto your toes to engage your abs more. Then rise up to stand and repeat. Do this for about 30 seconds, aiming to do 10 – 15 forward bends in that time.
Planks also are a good warm-up for an ab workout. If you have difficulty with a full plank, you can do a half-plank by coming onto your elbows and knees. Just make sure your back is flat and you're engaging your core.;
, After your warm up, start your exercise routine off with basic flutter kicks. Start the exercise by lying on your back on the floor with your legs straight.Lower your arms to your sides and place your hands, palm-down, under your rear end for cushioning and greater stability.
Lift your legs so they're hovering just a few inches off the ground, and lift your shoulders and upper torso off the ground to engage your upper abdominals. Make sure you're not crunching your neck — keep it long and soft, an extension of your spine. Try fixing your eyes on the spot where the wall and ceiling meet; this can help you position your head correctly.
Kick your legs up and down, keeping them straight and the movement even. As you kick, slowly move your legs up higher off the ground. If it helps, you can imagine that you're walking up a wall or an incline.
When your legs are straight up so that your body is in an ""L"" shape with your legs perpendicular to the floor, reverse the movement to kick back down. Resist the urge to simply drop your legs down.
Stop when your legs are a few inches off the floor, roughly where you started, and begin the upward movement again. Do 22 repetitions in a set. You can start with one set, and add more sets as your fitness improves.

, The Superman exercise is a great complement to flutter kicks. It targets your spinal erectors as well as working your hamstrings and glutes.To start this exercise, roll over on the floor so that you're laying flat on your stomach. Extend your legs straight behind you and your arms straight over your head. Basically, you look like Superman flying in the air, except that you're on the floor.
Raise your left leg and right arm off the ground, anywhere from 6 to 15 inches – just as far as you can comfortably and with controlled movement. As you lower, begin to raise your right leg and left arm to make the same movement.
Alternate sides for 10 to 15 repetitions as one set. then lower to the floor and rest for a minute before doing another set. You can do as many as three sets of this exercise.

, Bicycles (or oblique crunches) are a good way to modify basic flutter kicks for even greater results toning and firming your abs. This exercise targets all four abdominal muscle groups, but really focuses on your obliques.You'll start this exercise lying on your back, either on the floor or on an exercise mat if the floor is too hard for comfort. Place your hands behind your head with elbows out, and raise your straight legs about one inch off the floor.
Raise one knee to the opposite elbow, trying to touch your elbow and knee together. Then immediately lower and repeat with the other side. Do as many repetitions of this exercise that you can do while maintaining proper form and control.
As you do this exercise, make sure you're not crunching your neck. The work should be coming from your core, not from your neck and shoulders. You also want to make sure you aren't holding your breath. Your breathing should be deep and even.

, The cool-down portion of your exercise routine gives your heart rate and core body temperature a chance to return to normal. Stretches are a good way to cool down as well as loosen up the muscles you just worked.Many good static stretches for your core come from yoga. For example, you can do the cat-cow flow for a good stretch of your core and back. Get on all fours on a mat. On an inhale, raise your tailbone and head to the ceiling, arching your back. Then as you exhale, drop your head and round your back, drawing your tailbone down toward the floor and pressing your navel toward your spine. Repeat for about 30 seconds, following your breath.
Try an oblique stretch. Stand and raise your right arm, leaning your torso to the left until you feel the stretch along your side in your obliques. Try to square up your hips and keep them pointed straight ahead. Then slowly rise back to center and do the other side. Repeat once more on each side if you want.

, You can also place your hands behind your neck or head, but many people tend to pull their head or neck up during the exercise, which can place extra strain on the spine. Your head and neck should be resting on your hands.









For increased resistance, you hold a weight on your chest or behind your head.


, It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. When your shoulders are off the ground, pause and hold that position for a full second (or more).










It can be tempting to move your head forward (tucking in your chin to your chest) because it makes you feel like you're lifting further, but you're not. It's a bad habit that increases your chance of getting injured. One good way to prevent this is to always try to keep looking up at the ceiling.
If you have your hands behind your head or neck, don't let your elbows come together. Keep them level with your ears. Letting your arms close in around your head encourages your head to tilt forward.

Go for a walk or a jog.,
Take your flutter kick to the pool.,
Do cardio that targets your abs.,
Accurately measure intensity.",How to Tone Your Abs with Flutter Kicks2," Walking or jogging is the easiest way to add a little cardio to your overall workout regimen, mainly because you can do them anywhere. You don't necessarily have to join a gym or use a treadmill.If you're new to exercise, start slow, with only a 5 – 10 minute walk a day. Gradually increase the time you're walking each week until you're going on 30-minute walks.
Check your posture when you're walking. Keep a neutral back and engage your abs to straighten and lengthen your spine.

, The flutter kick exercise is based on the flutter kick that you do while swimming. If you have access to a pool, swimming is a low-impact cardiovascular workout that will incorporate the flutter kicks you're already using to tone your abs.If you don't want to swim laps, you can hang on to the side of the pool and kick, or use a kickboard or a swim noodle to keep your head and upper body out of the water as you kick.

, If you want to continue your ab workout even on days you're doing cardio, engage your core with cardio intervals of exercises such as mountain climbers and burpees.For mountain climbers, get in the plank position, then lift your left foot and drive your left knee forward toward the center of your body, between your arms, Then kick it back and immediately do the same with your right knee. Alternate quickly and smoothly, trying to stay in constant motion for 30 seconds. Then rest.
To do burpees, start from a standing position with your feet about hip-width apart. Swing your arms up and jump, bending your knees as you land and lowering softly, dropping your hands to the ground in front of you. Then jump your feet all the way back to a plank position, immediately lowering to a push-up. Jump your feet forward and stand. Do as many of these as you can do in 30 seconds with good form, staying in constant motion.

, You'll get the maximum fat-burning benefits from your cardio exercise only if you're doing it at moderate to vigorous intensity. You can measure intensity either by paying attention to your body or by measuring your heart rate.The ""talk test"" is one of the easiest ways to gauge the intensity of your exercise, and works especially well if you're jogging or walking for cardio. With moderate exercise, you'll notice that your breathing quickens, but you won't be out of breath. You're able to carry on a conversation, but you're not able to sing. With vigorous exercise, you wouldn't be able to say more than a few words without losing your breath.
You also can look at how much you sweat. With moderate exercise, you should develop a light sweat. With vigorous exercise, on the other hand, you're sweating more heavily after only a few minutes.

"
Drink plenty of water.,
Determine the right calorie intake.,
Focus on protein.,
Check your carbohydrate intake.,
Limit your fat intake.",How to Tone Your Abs with Flutter Kicks3," You may be carrying a lot of water weight around your midsection, and this could be keeping you from meeting your goal of toned abs. When you don't drink enough water, your body retains more of it.Make sure you're taking a multivitamin, and try to drink between 2 and 3/5 liters of water a day. It sounds like a lot, but you can do it if you get in the habit of carrying a water bottle with you wherever you go.
The urine test is the most efficient way to tell if you're drinking enough water. When you're well-hydrated, your urine will be clear.
You also want to monitor your sodium intake. Sodium can cause you to retain water, so try to limit your sodium intake to between 2,000 – 2,500 milligrams per day.

, If you're exercising three to five days a week, you'll start losing weight if you set your caloric intake to 13 calories per pound of body weight (or less). Be careful not to bring it down too low — your body needs fuel.For example, if you weigh 180 pounds, the food you eat each day should contain about 2,340 calories. You could probably go as low as 1,620 calories, or nine calories per pound of body weight, but you don't want to get much lower than that.
You may want to consume more calories on days you plan to do an intense workout, then lower the amount on rest days or days you're doing a lighter workout. This will ensure that your body is getting the fuel it needs.

, If you're on a low-calorie diet, protein is all important to build the lean muscle mass you need if you want tight, toned abdominal muscles. Protein shakes are one way to make sure you're getting the protein you need.You'll find whey protein at health food and nutrition stores, as well as at many grocery stores. Use the powder in a fruit or vegetable smoothie or shake. You can find good protein shake recipes online.
You also might look at protein snack bars or commercial protein shakes. Read the label carefully and avoid those with added sugar, or that are high in calories.
Try to include a substantial source of protein, such as lean meats, eggs, or soy, with every meal.

, When you consume fewer carbohydrates, such as pasta and bread, your body burns more fat and also retains less water. A diet that's lower in carbohydrates will help you get toned abs faster.You don't necessarily have to cut out carbs entirely. Keep in mind that your body needs carbohydrates for fuel. A carbohydrate snack 30 or 40 minutes before an intense workout will give your body the energy it needs.
You also should keep in mind that if you go too long on a low-carb diet, your metabolic rate may slow, causing your energy to plummet.
Oats and quinoa are healthy choices that are high-carb and low-fat, so they'll keep you on track to meet your ab goals. Fruits such as apples and bananas also are good sources of carbohydrates., If your goal is to tone your abs, your overall diet should be extremely low in fat. Look for sources of healthy fat, such as almonds, olive oil, and fatty fish. Only include a few grams of fat with every meal.Once you've met your goal or are feeling better about your midsection and have lost the weight you want to lose, you'll want to increase your fat intake.
Avoid fat entirely immediately before or immediately after your workout.

, You can either have your knees bent at a 90 degree angle, or you can point your feet in the air with your legs as straight as you can get them.








, Be careful not to push down with your hands, back, or head. If you can't lift your hips using just your abs, you'll need to build more strength with regular crunches. Otherwise, you're just wasting energy while other parts of your body do the work.

Do a twist crunch.,
Do a side crunch.,
Do a cable crunch.",How to Do Crunches3," Follow the steps for regular crunches, but instead of lifting both shoulders off the ground equally, lift one shoulder towards the opposite direction (left shoulder towards right, right shoulder towards left). Alternate shoulders. This targets the obliques (the muscles at your sides).








, Follow the steps for regular crunches, but lean both legs to one side (still bent, knees together, close to floor). Lift both shoulders off the ground simultaneously like in a regular crunch. Since your torso is twisted, you will feel it in your side. Do several crunches on one side, then move your legs over and repeat on the other side.








, Stand and hold onto a cable. Pull the weight down by curling your back and engaging your abs.

Place your palms flat on the floor while kneeling.,
Move into a plank position by straightening your body.,
Stabilize your body.",How to Do Pike Ups1," Ensure the palms are aligned directly under the shoulders. If hand placement is too wide or narrow, you’ll be engaging other muscles too much and minimizing not only the stability, but also the effect on the muscles being worked by the pike up., The plank should look like the starting position for a pushup, where your palms are on the ground, arms are straight, and the body (i.e. legs, torso, neck) are aligned. This move will work your abdominal muscles, lower back, triceps, and all major leg muscles.Your body should be entirely straight, from head to toe.This may be difficult at first, and your muscles may fatigue enough to start quivering., By pushing your toes into the ground and squeezing the buttocks muscles, the strain is taken off the abs somewhat. Without locking out your knees, tighten your leg muscles. Finally, locate a spot approximately one foot in front your hands to ensure proper neck alignment."
"
Raise your hips.,
Lower your head.,
Hold the pike up position.,
Return to the initial plank position.,
Complete multiple reps.",How to Do Pike Ups2," The initial part of the movement out of the plank should be a matter of weight distribution.As you raise your hips into the pike, which will resemble an inverted-V shape when completed, the weight will shift some from your arms muscles to your leg muscles. Your hips should be as high as possible, with your hamstrings fully extended.


It is similar in form to the downward facing dog position in yoga, but with less emphasis on stretching and breathing, and more focus on the muscular repetitions.
Push your palms down flat into the floor to ensure you’re not moving back too far.
Do not bend your knees.
You may need to walk your feet in a step or two to achieve the inverted-V shape.

, While the weight is shifting backward, you should begin lowering your head. If you keep your neck in a static position, there will be a considerable amount of strain on the back of the neck muscles.Once you reach the top of the pike position, you should no longer be looking at the spot in front of your palms. Instead, you should be looking somewhere near the ground directly under your waist.

, Depending on your strength and conditioning, even holding the position for a second could be challenging. With more practice, however, you’ll be able to extend the length of time you can hold the pike up. Try holding the position for one second to start.


Ensure the abdominal muscles are being kept tight while moving upward. Otherwise, there may be unnecessary strain on the back or other muscles., Slowly straighten your hips back out, keeping your core engaged.Correspond the movement of your neck so that your vision moves forward as you’re straightening out your body. This return to plank is the completion of one repetition.

, Depending on fitness level, it may be difficult to accomplish more than a few reps. For beginners, do minimal sets with minimal repetitions. Go until you feel some fatigue in the arms, abs, and back. Once you've built up endurance, strive for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.

Start from your knees.,
Walk your feet forward.,
Add in a pushup.",How to Do Pike Ups3," Instead of keeping the full plank position, start on all-fours. Once you start your hip shift backward and upward, straighten your legs at the same time. This will delay the amount of time where pressure and tension are on your core., If you find the top of the V to be difficult, particularly on the abs, try moving repositioning your feet. At the top of the V, when you are experiencing the most stress, shuffle your feet forward towards your hands just a few inches at a time. Continue moving forward until you feel like you can hold the V a little easier.


Moving the feet forward adds extra load to the front of your body, and will increase the weight your shoulders and triceps have to hold steady., Once you’re at the top of the V, make it a bit more difficult by adding a pushup to the process. Instead of a two-count movement, it will now be a four-count movement. Raise from the plank into the inverted-V, then bend your elbows and slowly lower your head towards the ground while maintaining the inverted-V angle. The top of the head will get close to the ground; so, be careful. Then engage your triceps and shoulders, pushing back into the inverted-V. Finally, return to the plank position."

Get into a raised plank position with a Swiss ball under your feet.,
Lift your hips into the inverted V-shape.,
Hold the position.,
Lower your hips and return to the starting position.",How to Do Pike Ups4," A Swiss ball (a.k.a. stability ball, yoga ball, gym ball, or Pilates ball) is an inflatable, rubbery ball that can be used to improve balance and stability. By adding it to the pike up, your upper and lower bodies are forced to work together to stabilize, and all the work comes from the core. This makes it an excellent variation if you're trying to strengthen your abdominals beyond the usual crunches.


Your toes should be pointed so that the top, or laces, of your sneakers are resting on the ball.Keep your back flat and straight — not sagging or rounded. Your arms should be in push-up position, under your shoulders and straight (though not locked).Be careful when attempting this exercise. It's extremely challenging and requires balance, and you could harm yourself if your arms give out or you fall off the ball.

, As you raise your hips, the ball will roll forward. Do not roll the ball so far forward that you fall off — your toes should maintain contact with the ball while you are in the pike position.


Keep your abs very tight, your hips square with the ground.

, You may only be able to hold this position for a moment. Start with one second and, as you improve, hold for longer. Again, make sure your abs are tight, which will help keep your balance.

, Using your core for stability, slowly lower your hips back down, rolling the ball backward, until you are in the raised plank position. This return to plank is the completion of one repetition.


You may only be able to do a couple of reps at first. That's okay. Work your way up to doing eight or ten reps.

Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.,
Exhaling, curl your head, neck and shoulders up off the floor and reach toward your feet.,
Pause and inhale.,
Exhaling, slowly return to the starting position.",How to Build Lower Abs1," Wear comfortable exercise clothing and do this on some kind of cushioning, like an exercise mat. Inhaling, tuck your chin to your chest., Don't tug on your neck and shoulders, let your ab muscles do the work.

, Feel the different muscles groups working. Start becoming familiar with the way different muscles respond.

, After a set of 8-10 of these light crunches, your abs should be warmed up for these lower abdominal exercises.


This exercise should work the rectus abdomens or the vertical band of muscles stretching across your stomach from the middle of ribcage to the pelvic region. It includes both upper and lower abdominals and, because it has three horizontal creases, forms the part of the abs called the washboard. While the upper and lower abdominals cannot be worked independently, you can position your body to target one area more than the other.

Tone your glutes.,
Get into cardio.,
Begin circuit training.",How to Shrink a Fat Butt1," Strength-training exercises are ultimately the best way to shrink your butt. Muscle takes up less physical space than fat, so toning it up (turning it into muscle) will lift it and make it smaller. It will also increase your overall metabolism and bring your whole body into proportion.




Dead lifts are great exercises for the glute area. But when doing this exercise, be sure to emphasize form over weight. Lifting more weight the wrong way won't get you better results.
Put squats into your routine. This exercise primarily targets your thighs and butt, but also works the hamstrings and lower back. Make sure to warm up beforehand.

Lunges are another fantastic exercise for your bottom half. There are a bunch of different varieties (side, reverse, etc.), so constantly change it up.;
, Since fat is the culprit to a big butt, cardio is the quickest answer to blasting it away. Running, swimming, boxing, or cycling will burn the most calories for your time.And fewer calories equals a smaller butt.










In addition to straight up cardio, try interval training--it burns even more calories than its one-paced counterpart.Exercise full out for 30 seconds and rest for a couple of minutes. Repeat 8-10 times. Your metabolism will get upped in minutes and stay up. And the best part? The hard part of your workout is done in 15 minutes.

, If regular ol' strength training is getting a bit boring, mix it up with circuit training. While you can do cardio every day, keep the strength training to 30 minutes, 3 days a week. Alternate between a new glute-toning exercise and high-intensity cardio activity for your entire workout session.









Circuit training is about combinations. If you don't have access to a number of weights or machines, jog with weights in intervals of a minute or two. Otherwise add weights into your cardio exercises. You'll be killing two birds with one dumbbell.

Take a rest day.",How to Build Core Strength Using Medicine Balls," To work the front of your abs, back and your obliques (the side abdominals) try seated twists. Using a medicine ball will make this exercise even more challenging.


Sit on the floor with your knees bent in front of you. Your feet should be flat on the floor. Hold a medicine ball with two hands.
Lift your feet off the ground a few inches and recline your back slightly. Your body should form a ""V"".
Keeping your legs stable, twist your torso and arms over to your right side. Tap the medicine ball on the ground. Aim to hit the area of the floor just a touch behind your right hip.
Pull the medicine ball back around to the front of your body and lower it in a controlled way slowly over to the left side and tap it on the ground as well.
Repeat this exercise, alternating from side to side for 30 seconds. Repeat as many times as you can.
If this exercise is too challenging, modify it by putting your feet flat on the floor.;
, A much more challenging exercise to try is an extended v-sit with a medicine ball. This will engage your whole core including deep front abdominal muscles.Start by lying face up on an exercise mat or carpet. Your arms should be extended over your head with your hands holding a medicine ball. Keep your legs straight out in front of you.
While engaging your core muscles, lift your torso and your legs, simultaneously, up towards the ceiling. Keep your torso and legs as straight as you can.
The goal of this exercise is for you to tap the medicine ball to your toes or front of your shins without bending your upper body or legs.
Repeat this exercise as many times as you can. Try to do 1-2 sets of these if possible.

, If you want to focus on strengthening your abdominal muscles, try doing crunch-ups with a medicine ball. These are great if you're looking for tone and definition as well.Start this exercise by lying face up on an exercise mat or carpet. Bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the floor.
Extend your arms over your head while holding a medicine ball in your hands. Your arms should remain straight during this exercise.
Crunch up and act as you are pushing the medicine ball away from you and up towards the ceiling. You should feel this in your mid and upper abdominal muscles.
Do 10-12 reps of this crunch exercise. Aim for at least 1-2 sets as well.
If this is too challenging, drop the medicine ball.

, Target your core muscles and increase your heart rate by doing burpees with your medicine ball. These exercises will help improve balance and core strength.To start, stand straight up with your feet hip width apart. Hold a medicine ball with both hands in front of your belly button.
Squat down, pushing your butt out, and place the medicine ball on the floor. While keeping your arms straight and balancing on the medicine ball, jump your feet back behind you. You should be in a plank or push-up like position.
Quickly jump your feet back up towards your hands and then stand back up. As you are standing back up, push your hands and the medicine ball over your head quickly. Then bring it back down to repeat.
Do 10-15 medicine ball burpees if you can. Repeat as many sets as you can.
If you are unable to do this exercise, try it without the medicine ball.

, Another great exercise to strengthen your entire core, are weighted boat rocks. This exercise specifically targets your abs and your back muscles.Sit on the floor in a v-sit type position. Your body should be bent so it's in a ""V"" shape. Extend your shins so they are parallel to the floor.
Place a light medicine ball in between your ankles and press your feet together to hold the ball in place.
Recline your torso slightly and stretch your arms out in front of you at shoulder length. Keep them straight.
Rock your body slightly to the left side so the right side of your buttocks comes off the ground slightly.
Slowly rock back to the other side so that your left side of your buttocks comes off the floor.
Rock back and forth for about 30 seconds or as long as you can. Repeat this exercise as many times as you can.
If this is too tiring and you need to take a break, drop your feet to the floor for a few seconds.

, The plank is a great exercise to complement your medicine ball core workout. It's an all encompassing move and will strengthen your entire core all at once.To start the plank, get down on the floor. Place your elbows on the ground, directly below your shoulders. Keep your hands at eye level. Your forearms should be supporting your upper body weight. Alternatively, you can do a plank in a push up position.
Keep a neutral spine, but engage your abdominal muscles.
Tighten your thighs and glutes as well to help stabilize you in this position. Hold here as long as you can and repeat 1-2 more times.
Also try maneuvering into side plank as well. This variation is done by balancing on one arm. Your palm should still be flat on the floor, but you should only balance on the one arm. This will work the sides of your core muscles.
If this is too challenging, modify it by dropping your knees to the floor.

, Another great all encompassing pose is the superman pose. Although it engages all core muscles, it specifically focuses on the back side of your body.Start this exercise by lying face down on the ground. Use a mat or carpeted floor so this exercise is comfortable for you.
Extend your arms above your head. Your legs should be extended straight behind you with your feet pointed away from your body.
Using your back muscles and glutes, pull your body up so your head and chest is off the ground and as much of your legs as possible are off the ground. It should almost seem like you're flying - like super man.
You should feel your entire back side of your body contracting to hold this position. Hold it for as long as you can and repeat 1-2 times.

, A more traditional core exercise are bicycle crunches. These are difficult to do, but really focus on working the front and sides of your abdominal muscles.To start with bicycle crunches, lay down with your back on the floor. Place your hands lightly on the tips of your ears.
Pull your torso up towards your legs. At the same time, pull your right knee up towards your face. Crunch towards your knee on the right side. Your left shoulder and right knee should pull towards one another. You can touch your elbow of your left arm with the knee of your right leg if you'd like.
Relax back down and repeat on other side. Bring your right elbow up to meet with the knee of your left leg.
Do 10 bicycle crunches on each side. Repeat for another set or two or do as much as you can.

, Another exercise that can help you work both your abdominal muscles and back are supine leg lifts. These are more difficult than they sound, so they'll give your core a great workout.To start this exercise, lie down on a carpet or fitness mat on your back. Place your arms down by your sides or you can pin them underneath your head.
Your legs should be stretched out in front of you. Keep your legs pressed together during this exercise.
Slowly lift both legs up towards the ceiling. Keep your legs pressed together and try to keep them straight. The straighter you keep them, the more difficult this exercise is.
Lift your legs up until they are perpendicular to the floor. Then, slowly lower them back down to the floor.
While performing this exercise, keep your lower back pressed down to the floor and your abdominal muscles engaged. Repeat this exercise 10 times per set and do as many sets as you can.
If this is too hard, do one leg at a time.

, To strengthen your core muscles, you'll need to do a variety of exercises. Using a medicine ball is great, but do more than that to get a well rounded workout.


When only performing one type of exercise, like using a medicine ball, you will not be able to maximize the total benefits to your core.
Try doing a combination of medicine ball exercises, body weight exercises and weight machines. The combination of all these exercises will give your core the best work out., Your core muscles, like any other muscles, will eventually get used to your medicine ball workout. While this shows that you've improved in performance, you need to continue adding more intensity or more reps.You will most likely notice that over time, your body will get used to your core exercises. Once this happens, you'll need to change your workout in order to continue seeing benefits.
For example, if you're only doing one set of your medicine ball exercises, increase it to two sets. Or increase your reps from 8 reps per set to 12 reps per set.
You can also continue using heavier and heavier medicine balls so that you continually increase the resistance and difficulty of these exercises.

, You may not realize, but cardiovascular or aerobic exercises are just as important to core strength. So in addition to your medicine ball exercise, incorporate cardio.


Cardio exercises are great for burning any extra fat layer which might be hiding some muscle definition. Core strength is reinforced during cardiovascular exercise, which requires core stabilization.
Health professionals recommend that you include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardio exercises each week. However, you can increase this to 300 minutes per week to see even more benefits.
Try jogging, running, swimming, cycling, using the elliptical, taking an aerobics class or rowing.

, No matter what type of exercise you do, you need to include adequate rest. This is especially true if you're looking to increase the strength or size of muscles.


Fitness and health professionals note that rest is essential to a well rounded workout. It's actually during rest that your body, especially muscles, gain strength and increase in size.Days off and during sleep, your body and muscles are able to rest and recover. Growth hormones are secreted and will help your muscles rebuild and become stronger over time.
Make sure to include at least 1 total rest day during the week. Also, don't work out your core every single day. Alternate days between core work, upper body and lower body strength training exercises.

In a slow, steady and controlled movement, use the strength of the lower abdominals to bring the knees close to the chest so that your butt lifts slightly off the ground.,
Slowly release to the starting position and repeat.",How to Build Lower Abs2," Rest your hands on the floor lightly and do not use them to push off. Raise your legs off the floor in a bent knee position.

, It's important to do this slowly, because toning occurs less from repetitions and more from consistent tension. Keep your muscles flexed.

, To start with, try a set of 10.


Combine the reverse crunch with a regular crunch for a complete abdominal workout.
The first two ab exercises work the internal oblique muscles, found beneath the external obliques and running at right angles to them. Together with the external obliques, they are responsible for flexing the rib cage and pelvis as well as bending and rotating the trunk.

, Don't lock your knees, which cuts off the blood flood flow in your legs. Hold this position as you inhale.








, Hold them there and breathe. Repeat.









For a variation on this exercise, you can scissor your legs when they're in the down position, adding a cardio and leg-toning element to this work out. Spread your legs in a ""V"" and bring them back together, first with the left foot over the right, and then the right foot over the left. Try six scissors per set of ten reps to start out with.

Bend your knees into 45-degree angles and pull them upwards so that your calves are parallel to the floor.,
Straighten one leg, holding it about 45 degrees from the floor, while keeping the other knee bent; at the same time, twist and lift your upper body so that the elbow opposite your bent knee touches that knee.,
Bend the straightened leg, straighten the bent leg, and twist the upper body to touch the other elbow to the knee across from it.",How to Build Lower Abs4," As with the warm-up crunches, don't tug on your head and neck while doing the crunches. Let your muscles do the work.

, Pressing the small of your back pressed into the mat, lift your shoulder blades off the floor.

, Don't worry about touching the knee to the elbow perfectly--the point isn't the touching, it's the rotation. Get as close as you can.

, Repeat.


This exercise works the external oblique muscles, found on either side of the rectus abdominus, forming a diagonal V shape by connecting the sides of the ribcage to the pelvis and pubis.

Start slow.,
Vary your workout.,
As you build your endurance, shorten the periods of rest you allow yourself between sets.,
Stay motivated.,
Remember: quality not quantity.,
Once you’re very comfortable with your routine, you may want to increase the angle of a particular movement or even attach leg weights to yourself to create a new challenge.Trying the reverse crunches on an incline, with your head pointed upslope is a good challenge once you've become familiar with the exercise.,
Remember to combine ab-specific workouts with healthy nutrition and consistent all-around exercise.,
Eat healthy ab foods.,
Avoid foods high in saturated fats, carbohydrates, and processed or refined sugars.",How to Build Lower Abs6," While it may be tempting to jump right into a heavy workout with lots of reps, you'll want to ease into any exercises you aren’t familiar with. Eventually, you can gradually increase the intensity of your workout to keep from hitting a plateau.


Start by increasing the number of repetitions per set (i.e. the number of times you repeat a given exercise). Then, increase the number of sets you do. You might start out with a 2x5 routine (two sets of five repetitions, before increasing to a 2x7, and then a 2x10. You'll be doing 5x10 in no time.

, You can wear out and overwork muscle groups, so it's very important to vary both the frequency and the content of your workouts. You might try this routine 3 days a week the first week, but switch to two the next, supplementing cardio or other exercise.

, If you're waiting five minutes between sets, your heart rate will slow and you'll lose the cardio element to these ab workouts, an important part of all-around health. You may need the break in the beginning, but gradually work up the speed of your exercise.

, It may be slow going at first, but keeping at your routine is how to build this muscle group. Set a goal and stay consistent.


Try motivational tricks like reading a page of a novel in between sets, or watching an episode of your favorite TV show while you do these ab workouts. If you're excited to work out, you'll be more likely to do it consistently.

, It's better to do a small number of reps correctly because working the abs quickly tends to rely upon the stronger abs and ignore the weaker muscles, which defeats the purpose of exercise.

,
Exercise balls can be likewise useful in this capacity.

, Though the exercises below will help you build your abdominal muscles, no targeted exercise can selectively burn fat from a certain area. This means you’ll have to lose weight everywhere to show off the muscles you’re creating.The best way to do this is to couple a healthy diet with a regular cardio exercise regimen.

, Eating a balanced diet rich in protein is a good way to build your muscles. Good ab foods include:


Salmon
Almonds
Berries
Yoghurt
Quinoa
Rice
Turkey
Soy
Natural peanut butter
Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower

, Avoiding the following foods will greatly benefit your abdominal development:


Sodas, including sodas with artificial sweeteners
Bagels
Jams and jellies
Pastries
Ice cream
Salty foods
Frozen and processed meals, including ""Diet meals""

Cut the calories.,
Eat the right carbs and fats.,
Get a healthy amount of dairy and protein.,
Cut out the crap.",How to Shrink a Fat Butt2," Fewer calories in equals more calories lost. More calories lost equals a smaller everything--including your bottom. Cutting the calories with exercise may not be enough; you have to monitor your eating habits, too.



1 pound is 3,500 calories. If losing 10 lbs is your first goal, cutting 500 calories a day will equal the loss of 1 lb per week, 10 weeks in total. But don't forget: exercise cuts out the calories, too.

, So often carbs and fats are made into villains. However, there are good carbs and good fats that are very important to your diet; they give your body energy, maintain your metabolism and help your digestive system absorb vitamins.Avocados, olives, nuts, olive oil and salmon all have good unsaturated fats that you shouldn't feel guilty about. They'll also keep you satiated, keeping you from overeating later.
Whole-grain and whole-wheat breads, cereals and pasta, oatmeal, couscous, quinoa and brown rice are good carbs that provide fiber, energy, and keep your insulin levels normal.

, Both of these food groups help you build muscle and are full of nutrition. It'll be easier to burn the midnight oil and get you through those hefty workouts.



Eggs, turkey, chicken, fish and low-fat yogurts, cheeses, milk and cottage cheese are all good options. If you opt for red meat, make sure it's lean.

, To cut the calories, you're going to have to eliminate the bad fats and empty calories. That means no junk food and no sodas. On either, your body doesn't get full and stores the junk in with your fat cells.



Load up on the fruit and vegetables. They are low-calorie but still dense, providing you nutrition, few calories, energy, and leaving you fuller longer.

Drink water. Two cups before every meal will fill you up, hydrate you, and keep the weight off.You'll also have less time to consume those sugary, high-calorie drinks that do nothing for your body's nutrition or waistline.

Squeeze your rectus abdominis muscle that runs down the front of your abdomen from ribs to pelvis.,
Relax back to the starting position and repeat.",How to Use Ab Lounge 22," Think of doing a crunching motion, bringing your ribs down toward your hips.


Note that although the Ab Lounge 2 directions instruct you to do an abdominal crunch, the resulting jackknife motion--as your hips drop and your legs and upper body come up--happens at your hip joint, not the lumbar spine. Your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform hip flexion; your hip flexors do.

, Although your rectus abdominis muscle doesn't perform the primary motion during this exercise, it does work to stabilize your lumbar spine against the pull from your hip flexors.

Do plié squats.,
Do cossack squats.,
Try single leg squats.,
Try plyometric jumping squats.",How to Tighten Inner Thighs1," Stand and position your feet a little bit wider than shoulder width apart.Turn both of your feet out slightly (approximately a 30-60 degree angle), so you look like a ballerina. Raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height, and bend your knees to begin to squat. Try to get low enough into the squat that your knees are bent at a 90° right angle. Keep your back straight as you lower into the squat. Do these squats for about 1 minute.You can do as many repetitions as you like.









Try to keep your knees behind your toes as you bend into the squat.Squeeze your butt to keep a tight, controlled form to your squat.
To add some dimension to this workout, gently bounce at the bottom of the squat for the last 20 seconds of the workout.Instead of extending your legs completely straight after reaching the bottom of the squat, keep your knees bent, and pulse up and down.;
, Stand and spread your feet out wider than shoulder width apart and your arms relaxed at your sides.Your legs up to your groin should look like a wide triangle. Squat as deep as you can going one direction, and keep your other leg straight and turn your toes to point upward. For example, if you squat to the right, your right knee will bend as you keep your left leg straight and turn your left foot to point your toes up. As you squat, raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height and slightly lean your torso forward for additional stability.Extend and straighten out your squatting leg to return to the starting position.


Do this same Cossack squat on your opposite leg to complete one full rep.Complete 2 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps on both of your legs., Stand upright with your feet together and your arms relaxed at your sides. Shift your body weight onto one of your feet, and touch the toes of your opposite foot next to the foot holding your body weight.Push your hips back to slowly bend at your hips and knees, and squat down onto your one leg that is maintaining your body weight.Raise your other leg out in front of you, trying to keep it as straight as possible. As you squat, raise your arms out in front of you at about shoulder height for balance. Stop the squat when your squatting leg’s thigh is nearly parallel to the ground. Then press through your squatting leg’s heel to return back to your starting position.Keep your back straight and your abs tight as you perform this squat.


Complete this exercise by squatting down on both of your legs, doing approximately
You could also use a wall to hold onto and maintain stability as you squat., Get into a typical squatting position, with your feet about shoulder width apart, and your toes slightly turned out.

Do squats regularly.,
Perform lunges.,
Enroll in a yoga course.,
Try planks.,
Perform side lying leg lifts.,
Include strength training for your shoulders.",How to Make Your Hips Look Bigger1," Squats are a classic exercise that can strengthen your hips and core. Work squats into your regular workout routine to strengthen the muscles around your hips. To start, stand with your feet shoulder width apart and hold two dumbbells at your sides.Choose a weight you feel comfortable with for the dumbbells. If you're just starting out doing squats, you will probably need to start with a light weight, like something in the 2 to 5 pound range. Talk to a trainer at a gym, or your doctor, to figure out a safe weight for you.
Pull your back up straight as you tighten your core. Bend your knees to lower your body. Take a quick look at the tops of your shoes when you are at the bottom of the range of motion. You must be able to see the tops of your shoes, or this means that your knees are coming too far forward in the squat.
Keep lowering your body until your thighs are roughly parallel to the floor. Then, return to the starting position. You should repeat this exercise 10 to 12 times.;
, Lunges are another hip and thigh strengthening exercise that can improve the appearance of your hips. To do lunges, start with a dumbbell in each hand. Choose a weight you're comfortable using. Take one step forward with your left foot.With your left foot forward, bend your knees. Slowly lower yourself to the ground.
Use your feet to push yourself back to the starting position. Repeat the exercise with the other foot.
You should repeat this exercise roughly 10 to 12 times.

, Yoga involves a variety of stretching and poses that demand a lot from the core muscles, so it can also be a great way to keep your core strong and help your hips appear bigger. Try enrolling in a yoga course at a local gym or community center if you want to make your hips look stronger and bigger.If you can't afford a class, there are many yoga routines you can find online. You can also purchase DVDs. However, be careful when doing yoga alone. Build up to the more difficult poses, and do not do any pose that makes you feel uncomfortable.

, Planks are a great way to tone your core muscles and get a flatter stomach, which may help to make your hips seem bigger. Work on doing planks a couple times a week as part of your exercise routine.To do a plank, lie flat on an exercise mat. Keep your elbows under your shoulders and clasp your hands together just under your chin.
Prop yourself up to form a bridge with your body running from your shoulders to your toes. Support your weight with only your toes and forearms on the ground, squeezing the muscles of your chest, abdominals, lower back, buttocks, and legs. Hold this position for 10 seconds when you're first starting out. Eventually, you will want to build yourself up to 3 minute planks.

, You may choose to strap ankle weights to your lower leg for this exercise. You can buy these at a gym or sports equipment store, but make sure you start out with a lower weight. Lie on your side. Have your legs stacked on top of each other and place your hand on your hip.Lift your leg until it's at a roughly 45 degree angle with the floor, and then lower it back down. Repeat 10 to 12 times. To build muscle, do three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions.
Switch sides after you finish a set on one leg and repeat with the other leg.
As with squats, the amount of weight you need depends on your fitness level. It's a good idea to start small. Talk to a doctor or trainer about a safe weight for you.
If you feel like you need more resistance, then you can try holding a dumbbell just above your knee as you lift. This is a good way of increasing resistance without risking injury to your knee.

, It might seem counterintuitive, but strengthening the muscles in your shoulders will make your waist seem smaller, which may help to make your hips look wider. Try doing some simple shoulder exercises like the overhead dumbbell press, dumbbell pec flyes and dumbbell rear flyes to achieve this effect."

Do forward lunges.,
Try forward lunges into single leg dead lifts.,
Do side lunges.",How to Tighten Inner Thighs2," Stand straight up with your feet about hip length apart.Take a large step (about 3 feet) forward with one of your legs, and dip down your back knee into a lunge. Lunge until your front thigh is nearly parallel with the ground.Keep your back knee off the ground as you lunge. Push off of your forward foot to come back into your starting position.


This functional exercise works not only your inner thighs but also your hamstrings, quadriceps, abs, calves, and glutes.You can also hold onto weights to increase the intensity of this exercise.
Consider doing this exercise in 3 sets of 10 for both of your legs., Begin this workout by lunging as usual: Take a forward step with one of your feet, and dip your back knee down until your front thigh is parallel with the ground. Keep your arms relaxed at your sides. Instead of pushing off your forward foot to come back to your starting position, you are going to shift all of your weight onto your front foot and stand up, keeping your other leg (that was previously back) up and bent at the knee.From there, straighten your hanging leg backward and you lean forward as you slightly bend your balancing leg and hinge at your hip. Swing your straighten leg forward, and immediately go into a lunge with that foot forward.From that lunge, repeat this process using your opposite leg to complete one full rep.


Complete 2–4 sets of 8–12 reps. Give yourself about 45 seconds to rest in between each set.As you are in the deadlift position, you goal should be to make a straight line extending from your crown to your heel., Stand up straight with your feet together. Take a big step out to one side of your body keeping your torso facing forward and your squatting side foot facing outward a bit.Push your hips back as your lunge to help keep your body posture correct with your back straight and knees over your toes. Lunge until your squatting leg’s thigh is parallel with the ground. Pause for a moment, and then push off your lunging foot and squeeze your thigh muscles to come back to your starting position.Do this exercise with both legs lunging out to the sides.

Use an adductor machine.,
Use a fitness band or cable.,
Use an exercise ball.,
Do scissor planks.",How to Tighten Inner Thighs4," If you are able to use exercise equipment in a gym or workout facility, an adductor machine is great for working your inner thighs. Adductor machines can add a bit of variety into your workout routine. Sit in the seat of the machine, and place your inner thighs on the outside paddings.Your legs will be starting in an open position. Adjust the machine settings to set your starting degree of opening, and add any weight. Tighten your abs and make sure your back is flush against the seat back as you flex your legs and thighs to bring your knees together in the center.Once you reach both legs to the center, slowly open your legs back up to the starting position.


Beginners should begin with small amounts of weight. As you gain muscle, you can add more weight.
Consider doing about 3 sets of 8–10.

, Cable machines are readily available at workout facilities or gyms. However, if you don’t have a gym membership, the same resistance results can be found using a fitness band to carry out the identical mechanics. If you’re using a cable machine, attach the cable around your innermost ankle (closest to the machine) and adjust the added weight settings. If you’re using a fitness band, wrap the band around something immobile (like the leg of a table) and then attach the band around your innermost leg (closest to the table leg).Put all of your weight on the foot furthest from the table or machine. Flex your foot up that the cable or band is attached to, and pull your leg across the midline of your body, past your weight bearing foot. Let the cable or band travel in front of your weight bearing foot.Then slowly bring your foot back into your starting position. Each time you come back to your starting position, is one rep. Do this on both legs to complete this exercise.


Keep the center of your body straight and your core muscles tightened as you pull your leg past your body’s midline.
Complete approximately 3 sets of 10 reps on both of your legs.

, Stand on one leg and fully extend your other leg to prop the side of your foot on top of the exercise ball.Keep your body facing forward as you find balance on the ball. With the foot that is on top of the ball, push and roll the ball away from your body. As you push, your other weight bearing leg will have to bend at the knee to accommodate the movement. Do this movement on both legs to complete the workout.


As you do this exercise, do not lead with a squat. Rather, have your other leg that is propped up on the ball lead the roll, and your squatting leg will follow.This will ensure that you are working your intended thigh muscles.
Do approximately 2 sets of 10–15 on both legs.

, Start in a plank position on a smooth floor surface. For this plank position, your hands will be on the ground rather than your elbows, and your feet will be starting together. Make sure your shoulders are over your hands. Place each of your feet underneath a gliding disc. Keep your upper body steady and slide your feet outward and apart from each other.Open up your legs as wide as you can. Hold your legs in their open position, then slide your legs back together by squeezing your thigh muscles.Complete 2 sets of 15 reps, making sure to rest in between the sets as you need.Alternatively, you could use dishrags, washcloths, or paper plates to serve as gliding discs.

Choose your length of cardio according to the amount of fat you want to lose.,
Do stair climbing.,
Go hiking.",How to Make Your Butt Rounder2," Workout for at least 20 minutes 4 times per week, doubling the time for 1 to 2 months if you want to lose more than 15 lbs. (6.8kg).


Keep in mind, that although people can shed weight differently, fat loss cannot be targeted. You will lose it around your entire body; however, you can choose cardio movements that strengthen you gluteal muscles faster.

, The best way to do this is to combine running and stair climbing in a stadium or indoor gym with stair.


Stair climbing on a large set of stairs is an interval workout, which burns unwanted fat faster. You can rest as you run down the stairs and push your body as you climb.
If you don’t have access to large outdoor stairs, choose a hard interval workout on a stair-climbing exercise machine.

, Walk on rolling hills or mountain trails. If you don’t have trails around you, set your treadmill to an incline.


Choose a trail or treadmill program with a 5 to 7 percent incline. "

Adopt a healthy diet.,
Reduce your sugar intake.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Record your eating habits and progress.",How to Make Your Hips Look Bigger2," Belly fat can make your hips look smaller by comparison. Losing weight overall can cut down on belly fat, and make your hips look bigger. To lose weight, the first step is a healthy diet.Your diet should be primarily plant-based. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains should make up the bulk of your diet. Go for brown rice over white rice, and whole wheat breads over white varieties.
Stick to lean forms of protein, like fish and poultry, and low fat dairy products. For example, go for salmon for dinner instead of steak.

, Sugar can contribute to weight gain overall, so look into cutting back on sugar in your diet. Sugary beverages can be a big culprit, as many people fail to think about liquid calories in their diet.Avoid sugary beverages like soda, specialty latte drinks, and alcoholic beverages including cocktails, wine, beer, and wine coolers. Drink plenty of water instead and opt for unsweetened beverages like unsweetened iced tea and club soda. You can even flavor water and other zero calorie beverages with lemon or lime juice.
Read labels before making a purchase. Sugar is found in surprising places, like breads, yogurts, and pasta sauces. You should also look for words like fructose, dextrose, and maltose in the ingredients list. These are all names of added sugar.
For women, strive to limit added sugar to 24 grams a day, which is about 6 teaspoons. For men, limit added sugar to 36 grams, which is about 9 teaspoons.

, Many times, you are eating more calories than you realize. Portion sizes, especially when eating out, can be quite large. Be conscientious of portion size.


Try to avoid going out to eat. When you do, split an entree with a friend to halve the calories. If a restaurant has a special menu of low calorie foods, try ordering off of that.Be aware of how much food you should eat at home. One serving of carbohydrates is about the size of a hockey puck. An ounce of dairy is about the size of six dice. A serving of protein should be no bigger than a deck of cards.It can also help to eat slowly. Your body will feel more satisfied, and you will realize you're full quicker.

, It can be helpful to keep a record of your eating habits, any weight loss you have, and any inches you lose off of your waist. This can help you stay on track and see what days of the week you're likely to slip up. It can also keep you motivated to have a running log of your progress to look at each day.You should also be sure to include other factors that can affect weight loss. For example, note things like your stress level, your sleep schedule, and your daily exercise.

, Go for clothing with vertical stripes, especially clothing that's going over your waist. Stripes are slimming, and can create a slimmed down look that makes your hips look wider, and your figure more flattering overall.Vertical stripes will not work with all body types. For example, if you have a carrot shaped body, then this may have the opposite effect and make your hips seem even narrower.

Wear clothes that draw attention to your hips and butt.,
Wear shapewear under your clothes.,
Draw attention to your behind with the right pair of pants.,
Find shirts that flatter your body type.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger Fast1," Clothing that enhances your feminine hourglass figure often does so by accentuating your hips and butts, while slimming and flattening your midsection.Wear dresses and skirts with an A-line shape that go in at the hips and waist, but fall loosely over the thighs and calves. While you do not want something that is skin-tight, look for clothes with slim cuts that cling to the body.


Look for structured or tailored pieces. Avoid items that are loose-flitting or low-wasted.
Consider contrasting colors. Wear a brightly colored top with a darker bottom.
Make sure your waist is well-defined. Select pieces that include beading, ruching, or cinching at the waist, or use accessories such as a cinch-belt. By doing this, you can create the illusion of a larger butt in only a few minutes.;
, Today’s shapewear is considerably more flattering and comfortable than your grandmother’s girdles. Like girdles, shapewear and body slimmers are worn underneath clothing to smooth out your thighs and/or midsection, and create an hourglass figure.Girdles emphasize curves by forcing the fat from your tummy to your hips and butt. This is a great trick for people who carry weight around their stomach, but are less endowed in the butt. Shapewear tights and shorts can do a similar trick to a usually lesser extent. Popular brands include Spanx and Yummy Tummy. You can mix and match shapewear to emphasize – or de-emphasize – different parts of your body.Pieces that slim your thighs and stomach without compressing your rear lend themselves to creating the look of a more toned, rounded butt.


Purchase shapewear designed to flatten your midsection while lifting and separating your butt cheeks, giving your butt a larger, more perky appearance.Do not purchase shapewear in a smaller size. Not only will you have difficulty fitting into it, but too-tight shapewear can lead to health problems., Flaunt what you got with pants that are fitted around the butt, but don’t flatten. This includes wearing pants that fit snuggly but aren’t too tight, avoiding baggy or too-large jeans, and selecting pants that include some design or embellishment around the butt. Deciding what to wear depends largely on your body type:If you have a large bust but slim waist (ice-cream cone or triangle shape), you want to minimize the bust while drawing attention to the hips and butt. Choose A-line skirts and dresses that flare out at the hips. Define your waist with belted jackets, tops, or dresses. Elongate your body by wearing high heels. Avoid skinny jeans or pants that taper at the ankle, skin-tight clothing, and hight-necked tops such as turtlenecks.
If you have a boyish or athletic body type, try wearing jeans, pants, or skirts that sit an inch or two below your waist. Accentuate curves with tailored jackets and wrap dresses. For slim individuals, select jeans that have some embellishment – such as embroidery or beaded design – on the back pockets. Avoid oversized or baggy tops and bottoms.
If you are smaller on top but larger on the bottom (pear or teardrop shape), then you are fortunate to have naturally wide hips and bottom. Create a balanced look, especially if you have a slim midsection and slender arms, by wearing bottoms that sit at the waist. These include empire-waist dresses, A-line skirts, and wrap dresses. Avoid skinny jeans or pants that taper at the ankle, tucking your shirt in, or wearing jackets that extend below your waist.

, Skirts are often more flattering than pants when it comes to making your butt. However, finding a figure-flattering skirt depends on your body shape. Common body types include: hourglass or figure eight, pear or teardrop shaped, athletic or boyish, and ice-cream cone or triangle shaped.Try on different skirts based on shape, length, color, and pattern until you find something that works for you. Pencil skirts or bandage skirts look best on hourglass body types, but should be avoided among pear-shaped or athletic body tapes. These skirts can be dressed up or down. Cotton-spandex skirts are generally more popular with the younger crowd, whereas skirts made of sturdier fabrics look more professional and sophisticated. These skirts are tightly fitted, so they emphasize your curves to the maximum. Pair them with a loose top for a casual look, or a button down or blouse for a more sophisticated one.
High-wasted, flared skirts look great on pear shape body types. These cinch in at your natural waist (the thinnest part of your torso) and flare out, making you appear to have a small waist and big hips. These skirts are often called “skater skirts” or “circle skirts”.
Rounded skirts with stripes create the illusion of curvier hips and work well on those with a narrow waist and small butt, such as triangular and athletic body types.
A-line skirts look good on athletic, triangular, and pear-shaped body types, but should be avoided among curvier or heavier women.

On the road: Walk sideways. Pulling your leg away from your body works your butt at a different angle.

Treadmill: Jog, making sure that your heel hits the ground before your toe. If you're walking, increase your incline.

Elliptical: Bring your hips back so that your butt sticks out a little bit. When you step down, push your heel down first.

StairMaster: Lean slightly forward and take bigger steps as though you're trying to climb 2 stairs at a time. Also, let go of the bar so that your butt muscles are forced to keep you stable.

Bike: Ride an upright bike and concentrate on pushing down forcefully on the pedals.;
, Any personal trainer or fitness buff will tell you squats should be your main glute exercise. You can do these with a barbell or with dumbbells, depending on your preference.









To do squats with a barbell:

Start by placing your barbell on a squat rack about 3 to 5"" (7.5 to 13 cm) below your shoulders. Lift up the barbell off of the rack and step out of the way (don't use your neck). Position your feet about shoulder-width apart with your knees and toes pointing outward. Make sure your knees line up vertically with your toes so that you don't overextend them.
Squeeze your glutes and lower your body until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Use your glutes and push yourself back into your original position. Do 8 reps at a heavy weight or 2 sets of 8 at a lighter weight.


To do squats with dumbbells:

Hold 2 dumbbells in your hands and stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees, making sure that your knees line up vertically with your toes and don't extend out over your toes. Your toes and knees should angle slightly outward.
Squeeze your glutes and lower your butt. Your knees will bend, but they should still not extend beyond your toes. Keep your back as tall as possible. Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Focus on using your glutes more than you use your thighs when you're raising yourself back into an upright position. Do 2 sets of 8 reps.



, Add weights to your barbell, being careful not to add too much weight until you get the form of this exercise correct. Stand with your feet beneath a barbell shoulder-width apart so that the balls of your feet are directly under the bar. Turn your toes and knees slightly outward for stability.









Squat down and grasp the bar. Your grip should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
Lower your hips a bit more until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Make sure that your back is flat and that you are looking straight ahead for good alignment.
Lift the barbell off of the ground. Stand up, move your hips and shoulders upward at the same rate and keep your back flat.
Lower the barbell slowly back to the starting position. Use your glutes and stick your butt out as you lower yourself, as though you're about to sit down in a chair.
Do 8 reps. As you get stronger, increase the weight.

, Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold dumbbells in each hand, with your arms relaxed at your sides.









To do a front lunge, step forward with your right foot. Bend your right knee until your thigh and calf are at a 90-degree angle. Don't allow your right knee to extend beyond your toes. Push off of your front foot to place yourself back in a standing position. As you rise up, tighten your glutes, your thigh muscles and your calf muscles to bring yourself back to the starting position in a slow and controlled manner.

You can either repeat the lunges on your right side or you can step forward with your left foot and lunge, continuing to alternate sides. Do 2 sets of 8 so that you perform 8 lunges on the right side and 8 lunges on the left side.


To do a reverse lunge, place your left leg a step behind you. Lower your hips until your left calf is parallel to the floor and your right knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Push off of your right foot and raise yourself up. Keep your back aligned with your hips, and use your glutes, quads, hamstrings and calves to push yourself upward. Bring your left foot back to the starting position. Extend your right foot backward and repeat the reverse lunge on your right side. Do 2 sets of 8 reps so that you get 8 reps for each side of your body.

, Start by getting down on your hands and knees. It's best to do these on a soft surface like a yoga mat.









Keeping your leg bent at a 90-degree angle, lift the outside of your right knee toward the ceiling until the inner part of your right thigh is parallel to the floor.
Hold the position for 5 seconds and then lower your knee back to its starting position. Do the same with your left leg.
Do 8 reps on each side and increase the number of reps or the amount of time that you hold your leg in the air to make it more difficult.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms extended outward at shoulder height for balance. Do you feel like you're flying, Jack?









Lift your right foot behind you as high as you can while maintaining your balance. You should feel the squeeze in the right side of your butt.
Hold the lift for 5 seconds before lowering your foot back to its starting position. Repeat the same exercise on your left side.
Increase the challenge as you go by holding your kickback for longer or by doing more reps.

, Start by getting on all fours, preferably on a yoga mat or other comfortable surface. Keeping your knee bent at a 90 degree angle, open one leg outwards so that your knee is parallel to the floor.Hold for two seconds, then lower your leg again.
Do two sets of 15-20 reps on each side.
Make it more challenging by holding your leg up for longer and increasing the number of reps.

, Skater lunges work your glutes, plus a number of other muscles in your legs. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. With your left leg, step diagonally behind your right, and settle into a lunge so that your knee almost touches the floor. Then, return to your starting position.Repeat the movement with your right leg, stepping diagonally behind your left. Do three sets of 15-20 reps on each side.
You may not be able to complete 3 sets at first. Do as many as you can, gradually working up to three sets.
If you want to increase the intensity, hold a weight in each hand while you do the exercise.

, Your muscles need time to recover if you don't want them to shrink, which goes against your mission of getting a huge butt.


Muscles need time to repair, literally, the rips and tears that occur with extensive exercise. You may think going, going, going will get you the fastest results, but your muscles will burn out.

, mantra. Every muscle-tee-wearing sweaty guy at the gym may be pounding protein bars, shakes, and powders, but research says it's a myth. In fact, too much may lead to bodily harm.The only way to build muscle is through exercise. Bodies need a modest amount of protein to function well. Extra protein doesn't give you extra strength.For women, the US Department of Health and Human Services says that two daily servings for a total of 6 ounces (170 g) is plenty.
Teenage boys and active men can get everything they need from three servings, or 7 ounces (198 g).



, Cut out refined, white sugars. Instead, go with brown rice, lentils and beans. These ""resistant carbs"" can cut fat around your midsection, which will make your butt look bigger.


Processed, refined goods are generally a no-no for anyone wishing to sculpt their body. Sticking to whole grains, oats, beans and nuts can give you the carbs that are good for your body.

, If you tend to store fat around your hips and butt, upping your calories so that you have more padding in that area will really help you to get a bigger butt. If you tend to store fat elsewhere, like around your midsection, then you'll just end up putting fat in the wrong place.


If you store fat in your arms, stomach, and legs, cutting calories and losing weight will help your butt look bigger by comparison. Since it's hard to target areas completely, a calorie-restrictive diet may be necessary.

, Choose boot-cut or flared jeans, or wear cropped skinny Capris with heels. The right pants can be miracle workers. Check them from all angles and walk around in them before you take them out of the store.


Opt for a tight fit. Anything too baggy will hide your form and make your curves impossible to see. Skinny jeans will obviously do the trick, but any cut with a fitted rear can work wonders, too.
Consider pocket placement and color. Small, high back pockets and ones with eye-catching designs are great for giving the illusion of a bigger rear. Stay away from jeans with big pockets or no pockets at all.
Both high-waisted and low-waisted jeans will work in your favor. High-waisted jeans draw in at your natural waist, making your butt seem much larger in comparison; low-waisted jeans start at the widest place on your hip, drawing the eye to that area.

, Try Booty Booster Shorts, which have removable butt pads, or Naomi & Nicole's Firm Sheer Boy Shorts, which claim to pad your butt without jiggling.


Try girdles or spanx. They cinch in the fat around your midsection, pushing it to the areas it should be and giving you a shapelier, hourglass look.

, Cinch in your waistline or wear clothes that contour your hourglass figure. Anything that draws in at your smallest points is a safe bet. Avoid tops or dresses that cinch in just below your bra or that cinch around the hip.


Place a dark-colored belt over any shirt or dress at your natural waistline to elongate the line of your body and draw the eye to your smallest section.

, Heels will make you naturally tilt your pelvis forward, making your legs look longer and your butt look bigger. They also flex your calves, making your legs look more toned.


If you're uncomfortable in heels, it's best to start out with a kitten heel. No one will be looking at your butt (no matter how great it is) if you're constantly on the verge of spraining your ankle.

, A really intense lymphatic massage to reshape your rear, combined with an algae wrap to kill cellulite and water retention, will make your butt look awesome. Or you can ask for Lipomassage, which is a massage tool with rollers designed to make your butt look sleeker.Note: This will not directly affect the size of your butt. It may make the skin glow and give the temporary illusion of tone, but your rear will not get magically bigger overnight. If only, right?

, Creams like FDA approved Glutiplus claim that they can significantly increase your butt size. Keep in mind, these are just claims.


Again, the only thing that can truly affect butt size is exercise and weight loss/gain. Some people claim that the creams work, but know that there is no science behind it.

, If your butt is hopelessly flat or bony, then talk to a plastic surgeon about treatments. Some examples include:


The Body-jet system: A doctor performs liposuction of fat from the hips, stomach and thighs and then injects the fat into your butt while you're under a local anesthetic.
Silicone butt implants: A doctor will put silicone implants under your butt muscles. Just know that these can be painful, and the surgery carries an infection risk.

These are extreme, expensive, permanent solutions. Think long and hard before you go about doing something foreign to your body.

Do butt-shaping exercises.,
Start with a low-intensity bridge workout.,
Make planks a central part of your workout plan.,
Do single leg exercises such as lunges.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger Fast2," The workouts that will best build your butt are the ones that work your glutes. You use your glutes when you extend your hip and thigh, lift your thigh out to the side, and rotate your thigh inwards. Fortunately, some of the most effective glute toning and strengthening exercises can be done at home with little or no equipment.These include: sets of squats, static lunges, butt bridges, lateral lunges, leg extensions, and leg lifts. If you need to bust some fat as well, fit two-minute intervals of intense full-body cardio (running, jumping jacks, jump roping) in between every few sets to keep your heart pumping.


If you are a beginner, start with only a few repetitions of different types of exercises, and gradually work your way up. Try to do 3 sets of 5 repetitions every other day. Depending on your comfort level, gradually increase to 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions 6-days a week.
If you do these exercise regularly (at least every other day), you should begin seeing results in 2 to 3 weeks.

, Bridge exercises can not only help you achieve a rounded butt, but also help prevent injuries by strengthening and stretching the muscles in your butt and lower back.Start by lying face-up on the floor. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Raise your hips while squeezing your butt so you form a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for 3 seconds, and then lower your body to the starting position. Do 3 rounds of 10 repetitions per day, taking a short break between each round.


Combine this with other butt-building exercises to create a daily workout routine., Planks are a great total-body exercise in that they strengthen and tone your glutes, core, shoulders, and arms.To get the full effect, it is important you do this exercise correctly. For a basic plank, start by getting into push-up position on the floor. Bend your elbows 90 degrees and lower your forearms to the ground. At this point, your elbows, forearms, and fists should be flat on the ground and supporting your weight. Make sure your elbows are directly beneath your shoulders, and curl your toes under feet and pull your belly button toward your spine. Straighten your body that it forms a straight line from your heels through your spine to your neck and head. Finally, engage your core and butt by flexing (tightening) your abdominal muscles and glutes. Hold this position for at least 30 seconds and then relax. Repeat 3 times.


Modify this exercise by turning it into a side plank.Lie on one side with your legs straight. Bend your elbow 90 degrees and place it directly below your shoulder. Lift your hips and legs off the floor, and hold your body in a diagonal line, supporting your weight on the side of your foot, and elbow and forearm. Tighten your glutes and abs and hold for at least 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times on each side.
When doing a basic front plank or side plank, try lifting up one leg at a time and holding it for 5 to 10 seconds. Incorporating leg lifts into your plank exercise will give your glutes an added workout.
Avoid injury by doing this exercise on a yoga mat or carpeted surface.Planks are a great way to work-up to weight training. Once you can hold a plank for one to two minutes, you are in good shape to start heavy weight exercises., Unilateral training where you focus on one side of your body at a time helps with stability, posture, and lets you really focus on one area of the body at a time.Lunges are great unilateral glute workouts and can help prepare and strengthen your glutes for weightlifting exercises such as dead lifts and squats. Like with planks, lunge technique and proper form are key to preventing injury and getting the most out of your workout. For a basic stationary lunge, start by standing upright, relax your shoulders and back, and focus your eyes on a spot directly in front on you (keep them fixed on this point throughout the exercise).Step forward with leg and lower your hips until your knees on both your front and back legs are at 90 degree angles. At this point, make sure your front knee is positioned directly above your ankle – pushing your knee over your ankle can cause muscle strain. Hold your back knee just above, but not touching, the floor. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds before returning to your starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 lunges on each leg.


Challenge yourself with a walking lunge. Instead of returning to a starting position, push-off with your front foot and step forward directly into a lunge on your opposite foot. Reduce knee strain by taking smaller steps and going slow. The most important thing is technique, alignment, and balance – not speed.Add weight and increase the intensity of your lunges by incorporating bicep curls. Hold a small dumbbell in each hand. As you lunge forward, flex your elbows and curl the barbells to your shoulders.
Single-leg squats are another unilateral exercise that strengthens and builds your glutes. Stand on one leg and slightly bend your knee, making sure your knee is aligned with your ankle. Lift your opposite leg to just above knee height. You can extend your hands to help with balance. Push your heel into the floor and hold this position for 10 to 15 seconds. Do 3 sets of 5 to 10 on each leg. Start with shallow squats and try going deeper with each repetition."

Add bulk through weight training.,
Start with basic squats.,
Round out your weightlifting regimen with deadlifts.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger Fast3," Once you feel confident doing non-weight training exercises such as bridges, planks, lunges, and running, you can move onto adding bulk to your toned and strengthened butt.The best weightlifting exercises for bulking up your behind are squats and deadlifts. If you are just beginning, try squatting and deadlifting the bar before adding weights. Gradually add weights in 2.5 lb increments

Keep your back straight and keep your eyes focused on a point directly in front of you. Hold the squat for several seconds before pushing back up to starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions., Deadlifts provide a total body workout – adding bulk and strengthening your back, butt, arms, shoulders, and thighs.Place the bar with or without weights on the floor in front of you. Inhale deeply and squat down. Pull the weight off the floor by straightening your legs, making sure your back stays flat, your arms are straight, and the bar is held close to your body. It is also important that your shoulder, trunk, and hips move and rise up at the same speed. As you stand upright, imagine your feet pushing through the floor. Maintain momentum while making sure your movements are smooth and deliberate. Forcefully exhale as you near the top of the lift. Keep lifting until you stand erect in a fully upright position. Your legs should be straight, your knees locked, with your shoulders back and chest out. Keep your arms straight – do not lift the bar above your hips. Take three deep breaths and hold your breath as you descend back down.


Do 3 sets of 3 to 5 repetitions. Try going directly from one repetition to the next. If you have to take a break, do it for only a few seconds. You can take a longer break (1 to 2 minutes) in between sets.
Do not bounce the barbell when setting it down on the floor. Stop as the plates make contact with the ground.
Before starting deadlifts, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of cardio plus simple dynamic exercises (such as lunges) to get your blood flowing to the skeletal muscles and joints in your upper and lower body.weightlifting should only be performed under professional supervision. They should never be attempted alone. If you feel yourself losing your form, drop the barbell instead of continuing.

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Either stretch out your arms straight in front of you or maintain them in a controlled position near your chest.
Lower your butt towards the floor, as if you were about to sit down on a chair. Aim to get your thighs parallel with the floor, but don't allow your knees to extend over your toes.
Keep your back straight and your head up as you perform this exercise, and try to distribute your weight equally between your two feet.
Slowly return back to the starting position, then continue for eight to 10 repetitions.;
, Lunges are another great exercise for getting your gluteus maximus in shape. To perform them correctly:









Stand up straight, then take a large step forward with your right leg. Bend both of your knees until they form right angles. Don't allow your right knee to extend over your toes, or allow your left knee to touch the floor.
As you lunge, keep your back straight and your head up. Also try to keep your stomach muscles contracted as you lunge to work your abs.
Slowly step back to a standing position, then repeat — this time stepping forward with the left leg. Keep going until you have completed 10 repetitions with each leg., Leg raises are performed while lying on your side. They are an effective exercise as they allow you to work your butt and lower back simultaneously. To perform leg raises correctly:









Lie on your right side, propping your head up with your right elbow. If desired, bend your right knee but keep your left leg straight and in line with your back.
Keeping your foot parallel with the ground, raise your left leg as high as you can, without moving your hips. You can use your left hand to support your hips and prevent them from tilting backwards.

Keeping your knee at a 90 degree angle, lift your right leg as high as possible behind you. Contract the muscles in your butt as you lift.
Keep your neck in line with your spine as you perform the exercise — don't try to raise your head. Also try to avoid arching your spine as you lift your leg.
Lower your leg back to the starting position and continue for eight to 10 repetitions. Then repeat with your left leg.
If you want a more intense exercise, try to keep your leg straight as you lift instead of bending the knee or add ankle weights to increase the resistance.

, Bridges are very easy exercises to do, but produce great results! No butt-toning routine would be complete without them! To perform:









Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Your heels should practically be touching your butt and your palms should be pressed down to the floor.
Lift your hips off the ground while tightly squeezing your butt muscles and sucking in your tummy. Lift until your body forms a straight, diagonal line from your knees to your shoulders.
Tuck your chin slightly as you lift and remember that the lift should come from your butt muscles, not your hamstrings. Slowly lower your butt back to the ground, then continue for eight to 10 repetitions.

, Lateral step-ups are another easy, yet effective exercise for toning your butt. To perform them, you will need a step bench and a set of 5 pound dumbbells (though these are optional).


Stand to the right of the step bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand (if using), in front of your thighs.
With your right foot, take a sideways step onto the step bench and hold your left leg straight in mid-air.
Hold this position for a count of three, squeezing in your butt muscles the entire time.
Step back to the starting position and repeat the exercise 10 to 15 more times, before switching to the other leg., Deadlifts are a great total-body exercise, but they are particularly good for toning the glutes and hamstrings. You will need a set of dumbbells for this exercise — 5 pound ones will do, but 10 to 15 pounds will provide a more intense workout. To perform dumbbell deadlifts:


Place the dumbbells on the floor in front of you and stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart.
Now, squat down towards the floor (as described above), keeping your head and chest up.
Grab the two dumbbells simultaneously, using an overhand grip. Make sure your arms are completely straight and that your back is not rounded.
Slowly raise yourself back to a standing position by straightening your legs and contracting your butt muscles. Thrust your shoulders back and your hips forward.
Hinge forward at the hips, bending your knees very slightly, and bring the dumbbells as close to the floor as you can without any pain or discomfort in your back.
Still holding the dumbbells, hinge back up to an upright position. Contract your abdominal muscles and buttocks.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 15 more times.

, Getting a firm, toned butt is not all about stretching and weight exercises — you can can incorporate some glute work into your regular cardio workout too!


Step aerobics will improve the shape of your booty. Look for a class at your gym or get your own step and watch a video at home.Uphill walking/jogging/running will provide the best workout for your butt and thighs, so hit the great outdoors and do some hiking. If you're not the outdoorsy-type, switch to using the trainer at the gym, or set the treadmill to a steeper incline than normal.
Other machines you can use are the elliptical and the exercise bike, as these provide great cardio workouts while also helping to firm and tone your butt and legs.
Just remember — working out for short periods of time on high resistance builds muscle, while working out for longer periods of time on lower resistance tones.

, Push-ups are a great chest exercise which will help to produce firmer pectoral, arm and shoulder muscles. To perform correctly:


Get into a plank position, with your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart and your legs resting on the balls of your feet.
Slowly lower yourself down to the ground by bending your elbows. Remember to keep your back straight and your stomach muscles sucked in.
Raise yourself back up to the plank position, then continue for 15 to 20 more repetitions.
If this exercise is too challenging, you can modify it by balancing on your knees instead of the balls of your feet., This exercise will help to stretch out your chest and build muscle, while also toning your arms. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells. To perform this exercise correctly:


Take a dumbbell in each hand and get your body into a push-up position (you will be resting on the dumbbells). Place your feet just over a hip-width apart, as this will provide more stability.
Lift your right hand straight up into the air, twisting your torso and turning your chest and upper body to one side. Stack your arm above your shoulder and keep your hips in place — the movement should be in your torso and upper body only. Your body should be forming a ""T"" shape.
Return to the starting position, then repeat with the left arm. Continue until you have completed 10 repetitions with each arm.

, Chest presses will firm and tone the pectorals, while also working the arms. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells for this exercise.


Lie on your back on the ground or on an exercise bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing away from you.
Bend your elbows so your arms form a 90 degree angle, keeping your upper arms parallel with your shoulders.
Slowly extend your arms, stretching them towards the ceiling, directly above your chest.
Slowly bring your arms back to the starting position, then continue for 15 to 20 repetitions.

, The chest fly exercise builds muscle in the chest. You will need a set of 5 to 10 pound dumbbells for this exercise.


Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground.
Hold a dumbbell in each hand and open your arms wide, almost parallel with your shoulders.
Raise your arms, palms facing towards each other, until your hands almost meet above your chest. Imagine you are giving someone a bear hug!
Slowly lower your arms back to the starting position, then repeat 15 to 20 more times., This is a simple exercise that works out the chest muscles. You will need dumbbells again for this exercise.


Stand up straight and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Raise the weight up to eye level and bend your elbows so they form 90 degree angles. Imagine your arms as football goalposts.
Draw your elbows towards each other, keeping your arms parallel. Don't allow the weight to drop past eye level.
Open your elbows wide again, returning to starting position. Continue for 15 to 20 more repetitions., These exercises won't do much to physically change your shape, but they can help improve your posture, which can improve your overall appearance. If you have large breasts your posture can really suffer, leading to hunched shoulders and major neck pain.


Find out if there's a yoga or pilates school in your local area, or look into what classes your gym offers — they often offer stretching classes which incorporate aspects of yoga and pilates.

Lower your calorie intake overall.,
Switch carbohydrates for vegetables.,
Eat more protein.,
Ease off of sugar.",How to Get a Great Bikini Butt2," Generally, you need to burn more calories through regular activity and exercise than what you take in through food to lose weight.One way to eat less is to use smaller plates.
Another way to track how many calories you're eating, and thus, reduce them is to keep a food diary. Just write down everything you eat in a day, including portion sizes, then calculate your calories using an online calorie counter. You can also find apps for your phone that will help you count calories.

, In place of chips at lunch, choose the broccoli instead. When you're going through the drive-thru, opt for a side salad instead of the fries. At dinner, eat spinach instead of a bowl of rice. By making a few simple switches, you'll lower your calorie intake while still eating enough to feel full. In addition, the extra fiber will help you feel fuller.Remember when you're grabbing a salad that not all salads are healthy. Some have fatty cheeses or dressings that add extra calories. Look for salads that are mostly vegetables and fruits with low-fat dressings, though be sure to add some protein if it is your main meal., Protein takes a while to digest, which means you stay filled up for longer. Eat a protein-rich breakfast, such as a couple of boiled eggs paired with fruit, to stay fuller all day., Sugar can quickly add up when it comes to calories, especially if you're drinking it in juice or soda. Also, the American Heart Association recommends that women only eat about 6 teaspoons of added sugar per day. Sugars in fruits and vegetables are fine, but try to cut out refined sugar where you can.Always look at food labels. Foods can have added sugars without you even realizing it, such as breads, dressings, and condiments. Don't forget that sugar can be under other names, such as ""high fructose corn syrup,"" ""molasses,"" and ""sucrose.""Add other flavors to replace the sugar. For instance, you could add cinnamon to your coffee instead of sugar or sweetener."

, Use a gentle all over scrub in the shower to help remove dead skin. Removing dead skin will make your skin feel softer and appear smoother., Use a tanning lotion or cream to give your skin that sun-kissed look without actually using the sun or a tanning bed. Simply use a mirror to apply the cream evenly to your body, making sure to go lightly on problem areas such as your knees, elbows, and face.

Change your walk.,
Build up your butt muscles.,
Tighten your core muscles.,
Try sports that build your leg and buttocks muscles.,
Adjust your weight.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger1," How you carry yourself can highlight or obscure different parts of your body. Stand and sit straight with your shoulders square and your head raised. Keep your abs contracted and your pelvis in a neutral position. This will not only make your butt more prominent, but it'll also slim your torso a bit and make your chest look bigger.


Imitate the way runway models walk. Imagine there's a straight line running on the ground ahead of you, and it's located exactly beneath your belly button, in the center between your two feet. When you take a step, move your foot toward the center of your body, putting it down on this imaginary line. Then put your other foot down on that line, directly in front of your first foot. Keep walking this way, one foot in front of the other and clench your glutes.
You can ask a personal trainer to evaluate your posture and help you improve it.
To further emphasize your curves with a feminine swagger, follow the steps in How to Walk Like a Diva.;
, You can actually make your butt rounder and larger by strengthening the muscles in it, known as your glutes. Do the following exercises at least 3 times a week for the fastest results:



Butt Bridges. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your arms at your sides. Lift your butt toward the ceiling, then lower it. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions.

Squats. Stand erect with your feet about shoulder width apart and your arms extended in front of you. Bend your knees to a ninety degree angle with your back straight, then rise back up. As you do this, make sure that your knees do not move in front of your toes. Do 3 sets of 20 repetitions.

Lunges. Stand erect with your feet about shoulder width apart. Bend one leg behind you and the other leg in front of you. Both should be at 90-degree angles. Return to starting position, then alternate with your other leg. Do 3 sets of 20 lunges.
Do kick backs. Stand on one leg. With the leg that is free off the ground, kick it back until you see your butt squeeze into a bubble. Do 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps. To add resistance, use ankle weights. In this case, try doing 3 to 5 sets of 8 to 12 reps.

, Working on your core can tone your belly, making it look tighter and smaller compared to your butt. Exercise your core at least 3 times per week for best results. Start off with these exercises:


Leg lifts. Leg lifts (or raises) might sound like they're focused on your legs, but really they'll help work your abs. Lie flat on your back with your legs stretched out in front of you. Bend your legs and raise them, keeping your toes pointed. Straighten your legs so that they're pointed at the ceiling. Slowly lower your legs to about an inch off the floor. Repeat 5 to 10 times, then rest for 30 seconds.
Twist crunches. Lie on your back on the floor and bend your knees. Put your hands behind your head, keeping your elbows bent. Lift one shoulder off the ground, and twist to the opposite direction. For instance, if you lift your left shoulder up, twist your body toward the right. Repeat, alternating shoulders. Do 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest for between 30 to 60 seconds between each set.

, A hobby you enjoy could also simultaneously enhance your rear. Here are some possibilities:


Running
Cycling
Swimming
Gymnastics
Skiing
Volleyball
Soccer
Field Hockey
Cheerleading

, Whether you should gain weight or lose weight in order to make your butt bigger (relative to the rest of your body) depends on your natural body type, which is controlled by genetics. When you gain weight, where does the fat go first?


If it tends to go to the butt and hip area, gaining a little weight will help fill things out. See How to Gain Weight.
If fat goes to your arms, stomach, or back first, losing some weight will make your body more petite in relation to your butt, which makes your butt look bigger. Read How to Lose Weight. This is especially true if you carry extra weight on your waistline. Getting a smaller waist can make your butt look bigger, even if it didn't change a bit. See How to Lose Belly Fat.

Pick the right pants.,
Cinch up your waist.,
Wear high heels.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger2," The right pair of jeans can seemingly transform your butt, making it appear round and perky. Consider the following next time you buy a pair of jeans:


Pick the right fit for your body type. If you have a slim waist, try a pant that will hug your waist, such as skinny jeans or a tight-fitting bootcut. If your waist is smaller than your hips, wear low-rise jeans (that hit at the widest part of your hips) with a fitted shirt.
If you have a thicker waistline, try wearing high-waisted jeans. The top of the pants should fit around the slimmest part of your waist, making it look small and your butt appear bigger.
Look at pocket placement. Small, high back pockets will make your butt appear larger. Additionally, pockets with embellishments such as sequins, stitching, or colored thread can add more interest and ""direct traffic"" (or draw the eye) to your rear. Avoid jeans with big pockets or no pockets at all.
Avoid dark wash jeans, which will make your legs and rear look smaller (especially if you're wearing a light-colored top). Instead, try white, pastel, or light blue jeans.

, Emphasizing a small waist will make your bottom look bigger by proportion. Whether your tummy is tiny or not, try these tips to trick the eye:


Wear a belt over your waist. Find a medium to large width belt, and tie it around the tiniest part of your waist, over whatever shirt you're wearing. (This looks best over button-down shirts, sweaters, or loose blouses.) For extra emphasis, try using a dark-colored belt over a light shirt.
Try a girdle. If you have a little more girth than you'd like around your middle, try a girdle. It should push the excess from your tummy down around your hips and butt. Girdles can be found at most department or lingerie stores.
Don't wear horizontal stripes or patterns around your waist. Busy fabrics or colors will emphasize your tummy and make it look bigger. Instead, stick to dark, solid colors on top.

, Heels change the natural curve of your spine, causing both your butt and your boobs to protrude more.


Avoid wearing heels for longer than two or three hours at a time. This will reduce the strain on your body.
For an extra-lifted rear end, ditch the kitten heels and go for stilettos.
If you're unsure that this works, get in front of a mirror and stand up on your tiptoes (it will help). Take a few steps, and you'll notice how the movements of your legs and rear are a little more exaggerated. Your legs should also look more toned, and your butt should appear to be an inch or two higher.

Get butt enhancing shapewear or padding.,
Consider surgical butt enhancement procedures with caution.",How to Make Your Butt Bigger3," You can try shapewear that lifts instantly without major padding, or get padded inserts designed to enhance your butt when you wear jeans and pants. These work quite effectively and make your butt bigger immediately. Choose the size that works best with your clothing and the look you want to achieve.


Some jeans are actually sold with butt enhancers sewn in. Look for jeans or leggings that have a little extra padding.
Try making your own padding by using the foam filler or the batting material used to fill pillows and quilts.

, Butt fillers, injections, and implants have gained popularity in recent years, but the results are very mixed. In some cases these procedures have led to very uneven looking butt cheeks, with the filler material sliding and moving over time. Worst case scenario, the enhancement procedures lead to severe medical difficulties.Some people have died as a result of receiving toxic injections or implants that were done improperly. It's important to know the potential consequences before you take steps toward getting an enhancement procedure.

Lower yourself into a crouch.,
Keep your weight on your heels.,
Balance your weight on one foot.,
Take a step forward.,
Get into a rhythm.",How to Duck Walk1," The most recognizable characteristic of the duck walk is its low position. Start by sinking into a squat, your center of gravity aligned over your heels. Get as deep as you comfortably can. You may want to lightly warm up and stretch your hips, knees and ankles beforehand to make working through the motion easier.If you’re doing the duck walk for exercise purposes, a slightly higher stance (thighs about parallel to the ground) will be more muscularly demanding.;
, To aid in stability, keep your entire foot in contact with the ground and rest most of your weight over your heels. This will ensure that you’re taking advantage of the most surface area possible and will allow you to use minor adjustments to keep your weight evenly distributed. Tense the muscles in your legs the whole time you’re in the bottom position—relaxing could cause you to lose tightness and fall over.Engage your core by squeezing your abdomen. Don’t allow your torso to lean or turn as you start the walking motion.

, At the bottom of the squat, lift one foot off the ground slowly. All of your weight will now be poised over your other foot. Spend a few seconds getting used to maintaining your balance in this posture. While duck walking, you will essentially alternate between single-foot balancing in a low crouch.Ankle flexibility is important at this stage because it makes balancing on one foot much easier.

, While balancing on your first foot, bring your opposite foot forward and across your body and set it down in front. Then, shift your weight to your front foot, pushing your back knee forward as you do so. Get centered over your front foot to stay upright.Hold your arms in front of your body or out to the sides to help you balance.

, Now repeat the stepping action using both legs to start walking. Make sure you shift your balance carefully when transitioning from one foot to the other. Duck walking can be quite strenuous at first, as you’re basically holding yourself in a one-leg squat, but it will gradually become easier with practice.Try to cover 10-12 feet at a time by duck walking, or aim for a specific number of steps to complete. Increase your steps or distance over time as you get better.
After every few steps, stand up and give your leg muscles a chance to recover.

Squat down at a slight angle.,
Stand on one foot.,
Use small hops to travel forward.,
Focus on your upper body.",How to Duck Walk2," Bend your knees to about a 45 degree angle and lower your weight at your hips. Your head should come to a stop at around chest level or slightly lower. Unlike the exercise-focused variation, the version of the duck walk designed for use on stage keeps you in a more vertical position so that you can continue playing or singing.Chuck Berry did his signature duck walk quite low. This made it look impressive and memorable, and also a bit humorous. Angus Young from AC/DC, another notable representative of the move, tended to stay in an upright stance, making it look more like a game of hopscotch., Lift your non-dominant leg and extend it straight out in front of you at an angle with the floor. Keep your dominant leg planted for better stability and balance. Once again, your entire foot should be flat on the floor, with more of your weight hovering over your heel.


Since the “rock and roll” style duck walk is done on one leg, it can be harder to balance and may tire you out faster.
Try switching up which leg you use from time to time until you can do it on both sides.

, From this skewed-leg position, take a small hop off your grounded foot. You don’t need to try to jump too high or far: only move forward a couple inches at a time. Hop along in this manner on one foot to accentuate your performance. Let your extended leg hover just over the ground, or touch down with your heel if you need to correct your balance.Make your hops small and controlled. Your head shouldn’t bob up and down too much while you’re traveling forward.
If you want your duck walk to look more like Chuck Berry’s, flare your non-hopping leg up and down a little with each hop., Straighten your back and keep your chest up. This will allow you to create enough room to play the guitar, saxophone or another instrument while duck walking. A more elevated body position also won’t require you to use your hands to help preserve your balance, freeing them up for groovy solos.


Practice while holding or actually playing your instrument to see if you can pull off the two tasks simultaneously.

Do a few light squats.,
Flex your ankles.,
Stretch out your hips and legs.,
Be careful.",How to Duck Walk3," Get your muscles ready and your blood circulating before you attempt to duck walk. With your heels on the floor, squat down until your thighs are parallel with the ground. Hold for one second, then push yourself back up to a standing position. Perform 10-15 squats to make sure you’re adequately warmed up before you get mobile.You’ll find it easier to move around and get into challenging positions after your muscles have been primed.
An energetic stage show can make a good substitute for a thorough warm up.

, Lift one foot off the ground. Point your toes and hold for 5-10 seconds. Then, pull your toes back toward your shin and flex your foot, again holding for several seconds. Repeat this exercise a few times with each foot to help loosen up your ankles and prepare them to support your weight.You can also stretch your ankles by getting down into a full squat and leaning over the balls of your feet while making sure your heels remain on the floor.

, Do a couple minutes of static stretching following your warm up. Exercises like forward lunges, standing quadriceps and hamstring stretches and hip circles will temporarily increase your flexibility so that you can effectively move in a deep crouch. Stretching is critical for elongating and promoting blood flow to the tendons and ligaments, which can easily be torn or strained by awkward, low-leverage movements like the duck walk.Don’t neglect to stretch if you feel stiff, as it can greatly reduce your chances of getting hurt. The only thing you want to tear up is the music.

, Duck walking can be fun and entertaining in the right setting, but it’s not for everyone. Avoid any movement that feels uncomfortable or places your joints in unstable positions, especially if you’ve suffered an injury to any part of your hips, knees, or ankles in the past. Even the young and uninjured should be aware of the potential risks of duck walking, as it’s such an unusual form of locomotion.Those with arthritis or mobility issues should think twice before playing around with squatting movements.
If you experience pain at any point while duck walking, stop immediately.

Track your progress.",How to Tone Your Butt Fast," Bridge exercises are among those that will target your butt and, if you do them consistently, you should tone your butt fast. Sometimes these are called hip lifts. You should strive for at least 15 reps of each exercise twice a day.









One variation of this exercise is to lie on your back with your knees bent. Keep your feet anchored firmly on the floor. Now, press your hips upward and squeeze your butt. Then lower your hips back to the floor. Do this as many times as you can.
Lie with your back on the floor with your left knee bent, and keep your right leg straight. Now, lift your right leg until it lines up with your left thigh. Push your hips up, while keeping your right leg elevated. Then, lower your body and leg back down. Repeat. Now, switch and do the same exercise with your other leg.For an advanced version, extend one leg into the air during each hip lift. Elevate your hips first, then extend your leg. Hold for 10 seconds, then bring your leg back down to its original position before lowering your hips. Repeat.;
, Butt toning exercises that involve using a pair of dumbbells will show you results fast. Remember, the glutes are a muscle, so at least some strength training is important. You can either buy your own or use the dumbbells at a workout center.









Bend down at the knees, and pick up the dumbbells. You should hold them with an overhand grip. An overhand grip means that you keep your palms facing downward toward the dumbbells as you hold them.
Now, stand up with the dumbbells, and then lower them back down. Repeat. This is a simple exercise that basically just involves you bending your knees while holding weights, which will help you see faster results.
Another dumbbell exercise you can do to tone your butt involves using a light pair of dumbbells. Stand on one foot, and then lift the other foot behind you, while bending your knee. Bend forward, and lower your body as far as you can. Go back to starting position, repeat and then switch to the other leg.

, Squats are one of the easiest ways to tone your butt, and they are an exercise that doesn’t require equipment. Such toning exercises are the most common ways to tone the butt fast. Remember to keep your knees safe by lining them up directly above your feet. Don't let your knees extend forward.









To do a squat, stand with your feet spread apart at hip width and squat down at a 90-degree angle. Then, stand back up. The key to doing a proper squat is to make sure you are pressing back on your heels, not forward on your toes. Keep your feet firmly planted on the floor. Again, doing 15 reps 2 times is a good goal when you are starting out, but you can increase the reps as you get stronger.
Another variation of this exercise is called the squat hold and pulse. In this exercise, again stand with your feet hip width apart. Squat down at a 90-degree angle, but when you are in the squat position, move up and down slightly. This is called pulsing. Perform a jump squat. Once you squat down, simply swing your arms overhead. Jump as high as possible. , As with squats, lunges and plies are other butt targeting exercises that are easy to learn and quickly effective.









To perform a lunge, stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Your feet should point straight ahead. Step forward, while keeping your knee from going past your toes. Push off with the heels so you keep your balance. Then, straighten back up. Now, switch to the other leg.
To do a plié, remember this move isn't just for ballerinas; it's also a great butt-toning exercise! Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing outward. Keeping your back straight and your arms held out in front of you, lower yourself into a squatting position, and then use your glutes to bring yourself back to standing position. Repeat the move for one to two minutes.

, Yoga and pilates poses will relax you and improve flexibility, but many of them also target the butt. So, if you add yoga or pilates into your daily routine, your butt will tone up fast.









Try the downward facing dog pose, and then a three-legged dog pose. Put both hands and both feet on the floor, and keep your back straight while hinging forward at the hips. For the three-legged dog pose, lift your right leg in the air, while keeping your left foot and both hands pressed to the floor. Now switch legs.
Hold each pose for five breaths.
The warrior pose also tones the butt. To do this pose, put both hands straight over your head and look up to the sky. Step forward with your right foot and lunge, while keeping your left leg straight behind you and both feet anchored into the ground. Now switch legs. , If you add even 5 or 10 pound weights to basic butt exercises, like squats or lunges, you will quickly improve your results. 








Hold the weights at shoulder or hip level. If you hold a position for at least 30 seconds, you will get more out of the maneuver.
Experts recommend that you choose the heaviest weights you can lift, even if it means you will end up doing fewer reps of an exercise. It's a quicker way to see results.

, Circuit training is great for the butt because many of the exercises in a typical circuit exercise target the glutes from different angles. Circuit training involves different types of exercise, which means the butt will get a thorough work out.









The key to getting a better butt is to build muscle. You aren’t going to have a toned butt with a lot of flab. Circuit training usually involves some kind of resistance and strength training. Circuit training also involves some cardio exercises. This is the perfect balance. If you only do toning exercises (like squats and lunges), you are unlikely to reduce fat. To tone your butt, you need to get rid of unwanted fat, and this means you need some cardio. Other options for cardio are running, walking, and cycling. Most circuit training workouts have at least three separate exercises (or circuits). Each typically involves doing 10 to 15 reps of each exercise. You rest in between each circuit, and then move to the next. , It’s unlikely that you will be able to tone your butt fast with exercise alone. If you are eating a bad diet, exercise won’t be enough to counteract the food’s effects. Junk food needs to go.


The problem with fast food is that it contains a lot of fat and calories, but it also contains lots of sodium. Sodium makes you retain water, so this will make your butt look bigger, and it will make cellulite look worse.
The sodium in fast food will also make you feel tired, which makes it harder to find the energy for exercising, so fast-food consumption is a double whammy.

, The problem with simple carbs is that the body will turn them into fat stores if you don’t burn them off right away. So stay away from eating lots of simple carbs, which have just 1 or 2 sugar molecules, so the body burns them off very fast. Examples of simple carbs to avoid include foods with molasses, corn syrup, and honey. Candy, soft drinks, jellies or jams, and fruit juices are examples of foods that have simple carbs in them.
Don’t eat anything white. This is a good rule of thumb. White bread and refined sugar need to go. They don’t offer much nutritional value. And the fat will go right to your butt (and abdomen and hips). That means no white pasta, either.
Do eat good, complex carbohydrates, such as fresh, green vegetables, oatmeal, and brown rice. These will have some carbs, but not many and not the kind that pack the fat on your backside. Complex carbohydrates take the body longer to digest.

, This means you shouldn’t starve yourself (remember, again, that the glutes are a muscle. That means they need calories and protein). You should try to eat natural foods (not things that come in a can or box), and you should have a good balance of them.


Try to eat lean meats like fish and poultry. Other choices that work include tuna fish, and whole eggs. These are good sources of protein. Don’t fall into the trap of eating shakes and protein bars. You might be shocked what you see on the ingredient label. Instead, get the majority of your calories from whole foods you find in the produce section. Avoid diet foods with artificial sweeteners, too.
Vegetables, nuts, fruit, and whole grains are good choices. Buy only what you will eat that day. This will help you keep the focus on perishable, whole foods.
Only eat a limited amount of dairy. Don’t drink sugary fruit juices or sodas. And read food labels. You'd be surprised to learn that extra sugars have been creeping into your bread, salad dressings, cooking sauces, and fruit juice!

, Keeping your body hydrated all day long will make your butt look better (and your skin, too).


For example, if you have cellulite, it won’t be as obvious if you guzzle H20. You should drink as much water as you can all day long.
This means that caffeine and alcohol are not good beverage choices because they cause dehydration. So cut out that glass of wine you have each night and the cups of coffee in the morning if you want a better looking butt.

, If you don’t have a lot of time for working out, you can still work on those glutes. Be active throughout the day. Having a sedentary lifestyle is extremely detrimental to your health, and it forces your body to store extra fat.









If you work a desk job, be sure to get up and walk around during your breaks or lunch.
Tone your butt while you walk by consciously contracting your glutes. To do this, keep your heel on the ground as long as you can and when you do lift it, roll through to your foot and push off with your toes. Squeeze your butt all day long! Be conscious of it.
You could use an exercise ball for an office chair. You might as well work those muscles while you’re sitting at your desk, taking phone calls or working on the computer! This will also improve your core, but it helps the butt.

, The glutes can actually atrophy if you sit all day long. Little things matter, but one of the biggest killers on the butt is the amount of time that people sit at the office before plopping down on the sofa in front of the television at night.









Get rid of your office chair altogether. Ask your work to give you a desk you can stand at. You might as well exercise while you are on the job by simply standing.
Take the stairs, not the elevator. Park farther away so you have to walk more. Bike to work. Small steps like this can add up if you do them every day. Consistency is key. Walk up hills as much as possible.

, Don't try to guess what you weigh, and don't hide your butt in baggy clothes. You need to actively measure progress.


Take progress photos each week. When you're having a bad day look back at your starting photo to remind yourself why you want to change!
Keep a food diary. Many experts believe that charting out what you eat every day will help you be honest about what you're putting in your body.
Weigh yourself almost every day. If you stop weighing yourself, you may be tempted to let little things slip.

Choose a proper weight.,
Warm up before you start.,
Keep your spine straight.,
Move through the full range of motion.,
Start with eight to ten reps.,
Rest your muscles.,
Remember to breathe.",How to Work out Your Abs With Dumbbells1," You do not want to use a weight that is either too heavy or too light for you. A good weight will be one that you are comfortable using for at least twelve or fifteen reps.To find a good weight, you may want to practice bicep curls with a dumbbell first before trying any of your new ab exercises.
, Before you begin, you should warm up with a short jog or run. Five or ten minutes is all you need to make sure that your muscles are ready for exercise. This will prevent injury and maximize your results.If you are doing cardio and weight training together, you should save the cardio for after your weight training. Only do five or ten minutes of jogging before you start lifting., Spine injuries can be devastating and permanent. To make sure that your spine is safe, keep it straight while doing weight exercises., For your weight training to be effective, you should move through the full range of motion as dictated by the exercise. Exercise with slow, controlled movements. This will work out all of your abdominal muscles as you train. Do not rush through a movement, or you risk injuring yourself., Unless otherwise indicated by the specific exercise, you should start your exercises with about eight to ten reps. Do three sets of these reps total. When you are more comfortable, you can increase the reps or the number of sets that you do. In addition, you can you’re your number of reps and sets based on what kind of training you would like to do.

For strength training, do up three sets of five to eight reps with a heavier weight.
For endurance, do up to three sets of fifteen or twenty reps using a lighter weight., Take a full minute of rest between each set. This will prevent you from overexerting your muscles. It will also help you perform more sets without injuring yourself.In addition to resting between sets, you should also rest between days. Do not work out the same group of muscles two days in a row. Give your ab muscles at least day (if not longer) to rest before you try again., Many people forget to breathe while they lift weights, but it is very important to breathe during exercise. Not only does it deliver oxygen to your muscles, but it also prevents injury and fatigue. For abdominal exercises, you should exhale as you tighten your abs. For example, during a crunch, exhale as you rise and inhale as you lower yourself."

Lift the weight in a staggered stance.,
Lean to the side.,
Perform an abdominal twist.,
Raise your legs.",How to Work out Your Abs With Dumbbells2," Hold one dumbbell in each hand. Stagger your stance by placing one foot slightly behind your body and one foot slightly in front. Lower yourself into a slight squat. As you rise, press the dumbbells above your head until your arms are straight. Switch legs every thirty seconds.Make sure your back heel is lifted off the ground. The front foot should be flat against the floor., Hold a dumbbell in one hand, keeping the other hand free. Bend to the side without leaning forward or backwards. Your chest should be flat as you do this exercise. Slowly rise and straighten your posture. Repeat.This exercise is very effective if you vary the weights that you use. Use a heavier dumbbell to do between six and ten reps and a lighter one to do up to forty reps in a set., This move will work out your oblique muscles and the entire abdominal sheet. Grip the dumbbells in both hands. Hold the weights at shoulder height. Plant your feet and twist your upper body as you punch one dumbbell forward. Bring the dumbbell back to the starting position as you switch arms, punching between eight and twenty times with each arm.

, Leg raise exercises can help work the lower abs. Place the dumbbell in a standing position on the floor between your feet as you sit with legs extended. Lay flat on your back. Grip the weight between your feet or ankles. Clench your leg muscles as you raise your legs from the ground toward the ceiling, until they are perpendicular to the ground. Lower your legs slowly.


Try to keep your back from arching and maintain contracted muscles as you lower your legs back to the floor.
You may want to practice gripping the dumbbell for lifts from a sitting position first. Holding the weight between your ankles or inner feet, lift the dumbbell slowly and practice keeping your legs and back stable.
If you cannot easily lift the dumbbell, select a lighter weight. It is essential that you can securely lift the dumbbell, as serious injury can occur if the dumbbell slips out of its position between the ankles or feet.
If needed, you can support your lower back muscles by folding a towel under the small of the back.

Slowly rise and straighten before lowering into a squat. Hold this pose for two seconds. Slowly rise and return to the forward starting position., Lie down on the floor, and bend your knees. Grasp the dumbbell between both hands, gently leaning it against your chest. Raise your torso towards your knees before lowering slowly back to the floor. Use your abs to lift your body, not your arms or back.Make sure that your lower back muscles are strong enough to support weight from dumbbells before attempting this exercise.

, Lay flat on your back with a dumbbell in one hand. Extend your arm straight toward the ceiling. Contract your abdominal muscles to sit up, keeping your arm extended and stretched toward the ceiling. Gradually lower your upper body back to the floor, keeping the dumbbell above you.

Practice pectoral fly exercises.,
Try the bench press.,
Learn incline dumbbell presses.,
Do pull-ups.,
Work on dumbbell rows.,
Perform bicep curls.",How to Work out the Pecs1," The standard fly move is perhaps one of the best chest builders. Perform it in a high number of repetitions without equipment or in smaller sets with dumbbells or resistance bands. To do them:









Lay on your back with a dumbbell in each hand.
Extend your arms out to your side, as if your were forming a cross. Your palms should be pointing up.
Slowly, with your arms still extended, curl your hands together until the dumbbells meet above the center of your chest.
Slowly return your arms back to your sides.;
, The bench press is arguably the most popular chest workout move. It can be done in a home gym or with a large variety of weight options at a gym. When benching, always have a spotter behind you to hold the weight if it falls.









Lay on your back with the bar of weight above you, roughly in line with your nipples.
Grip the bar firmly with both hands roughly aligned with your shoulders.
Push the bar up off the holsters, then slowly bring it down until it is a few inches above your chest.
With a smooth, fluid motion, push the bar up until your arms are almost fully extended. That is one rep., Once you are familiar with traditional bench presses, handheld dumbbells can be used on an inclined bench to work your chest muscles in a different way. The motion is the same as a bench press, but you can lay on an incline or decline to work different parts of your pectoral for fuller muscle growth. You can also wrap a resistance band around your back and use that instead of dumbbells.







, Pull-ups strengthen the chest as well as the arms, shoulders, back, and abs. Depending on your grip you will get a different muscle focus.









Pull-ups with a wide grip and your palms facing forward will work your back, as well as some chest.
Chin-ups, with a narrow grip and your palms facing back towards you, will work more of your chest and bicep.
Keep your lower body from moving when doing pull-ups. You want your stomach and legs solid while you arms and back do all the work., Dumbbell rows help strengthen the shoulders, arms, and back and can be performed at home or at a gym.









Stand with dumbbells or resistance bands in both hands.
With your palms pointing down, pull the weight up to shoulder height.

Imagine you are a puppet, with strings in the center of the back of your hand. You're being pulled straight up.


Slowly return your arms back down by your sides., Although traditionally considered an exercise for the arms, bicep curls can help work the pectoral muscles and add to definition in the chest. They can be done with or without weights.









Hold a dumbbell in one hand, sitting.
Rest the elbow of your weighted arm on your thigh, with the weight between your legs.
Curl your arm up from the elbow bring the weight to your shoulder. Only your forearm should move.
Slowly return the weight to the center of your legs.

Plant your feet on the ground.,
Bend your knees.,
Lower yourself in a controlled manner.,
Repeat.",How to Do a Squat1," Keep your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width. Straighten your back. Angle your feet slightly outward toward 10 and 2 o'clock, not straight ahead., Pretend as though you are going to sit back in a chair. Keep your heels on the ground. Pull in your abs. Keep your back straight in a neutral position throughout the exercise.








, As you go down, push your hips back. Go as low as your body can while still keeping your shins vertical and your heels on the ground.From the lower position, push up off your heels and slowly rise up, balancing by leaning forward as necessary.









If you can, aim to lower yourself until your hips sink beneath your knees. If you are just starting out, you may not be flexible enough to go this low. Work your way up to this level.
Inhale as you lower. Exhale as you rise.
Look forward as you squat to help keep your form correct.
Extend your arms straight forward to help your balance. This will also help you keep your shins vertical., If you're a beginner, you may want to aim for ten reps. If you're fit, you can aim for 15-30 reps each set. Do one to three sets. Remember to rest between sets.

Lie on the floor on your right side.,
Place your left arm forward, resting your palm on the ground.,
Lift your left leg in the air slowly.,
Lower your leg back to the starting position.,
Repeat the exercise for 10-15 reps. Once your leg comes back down, immediately send it back up.,
Roll over onto your left side and repeat the exercise with your right leg.",How to Work Quads Without Weights1," Make sure your lower body, from waist to ankle, is completely straight. The leg raise is well suited for working the stabilizer muscles in your quads, such as the rectus femoris., This will help you stay balanced throughout the exercise. You can lay your head on your right arm to get more comfortable.


Alternatively, you can prop yourself up on your elbow, though you want to be sure you keep the straight line from your hips down to your ankles., Lift your leg until it reaches about a 45 degree angle. Keep your abs tight as you lift: this will help you stay balanced and keep you from tipping over. Inhale as you lift your leg. Try to keep your leg going up in a straight line, rather than letting it drift to either side., Continue tightening your abs as you lower your leg and exhale. Lower your leg in a straight line until it touches your other leg.


Inhaling as you lift and exhaling as you bring your leg back down helps control your breathing. Proper breathing is key for efficient exercise., This rep range is ideal for increasing strength and size in your quads.


If this rep range is too easy for you, try raising and lowering your leg more slowly. The more time your leg spends moving, the harder the movement.
If you’re more concerned about muscular endurance than strength, aim for the 15-20 rep range rather than 10-15., You’ll essentially be following the same steps, just reversed.


Once you’ve completed a set of 10-15 reps with each leg, roll over on your right side and start the next set. Ideally you’ll want to do 2-3 sets of this exercise for each leg."

Loose laces pose a risk of injury., If you’re a beginner, start with the lightest, smallest dumbbells you can find and slowly work your way up to heavier dumbbells over the course of several weeks (depending on how often you work out).

If you are pregnant or have a history of back or joint problems, talk to your doctor about safe lifting limits., It’s important to give your body some time to stretch and warm up before burdening it with heavy weights. Try working with lighter dumbbells for 5 to 10 minutes before switching to heavier dumbbells for the remainder of your workout., Poor posture or straining during lift work can cause severe injury. Try to avoid jerking your arms or back (or the dumbbells, themselves) when you’re lifting. If you’re ever unsure of proper form and position, talk to a trainer at a gym or watch instructional videos online for help., If you start to strain or huff and puff, it’s time to set the dumbbells down. You’re more likely to get injured lifting dumbbells when you’re tired because your muscles or joints can give out under the weight., It’s safer (and usually more fun!) having a buddy to work out with. Lifting dumbbells is particularly dangerous when you’re lifting alone because you don’t have anyone to take the weight from you or monitor your physiology if you run into trouble.If you have to lift alone, always let someone know where you are and how long you plan to work out for. If they don’t hear from you within 15 minutes of your projected workout finish time, ask them to check on you or call for help., To obtain the squat, flex your knees and hips. Lift both dumbbells straight up to your chest and then lower them (after a pause) without changing the angles of your body.This is called the Wide Row.
Be sure to exhale when you lift the dumbbells and inhale when returning to a resting position.

, With a slight bend in your knees, reach down with both hands and lift the dumbbells until your upper arms are parallel with the line of your torso. Lower the dumbbells back to the floor, after a short pause.This is called the Bent Over Row.
Do your best to keep your back straight during this exercise. Focus on only moving your arms.

, Lower the dumbbells to the floor by flexing at your knees and hips. After a short pause, raise yourself back up.This is called the dead lift, and it is one of the most efficient dumbbell exercises because it works both your back and other muscle groups.
Do your best to keep your back straight during this exercise. Focus on only moving your arms.
You can also adapt this exercise into the Stiff Legged Dead Lift by bending at the waist to lower the dumbbells to the ground and then straightening after a brief pause., Keeping your knees slightly bent, reach down to grab it with your left hand. Lift the dumbbell up until you are standing with a straight waist and back. Then, lower the dumbbell after a pause.After 5 to 10 repetitions, switch to lifting with your right side.
This is called the Bend to Opposite Foot.
Try to keep your knees slightly arched and your lifting arm straight.

, Keeping your knees slightly bent, reach down to grab a dumbbell with each hand and lift them until you’re standing up straight. After a pause, lower the dumbbells to the other foot, so that you alternate sides.This is called the Twisting Bend to Opposite Foot.

, Keep your palms facing each other. Push the dumbbells up towards the sky until your elbows come close to locking. After a brief pause, lower the dumbbells to resting position at shoulder level.This is called Back Supported Palms-In Shoulder Press.
Be careful that you don’t jerk your back during this exercise – your arms and shoulders should be doing the lifting work.

, Be sure that your palms are facing each other. While sitting on a bench, bring the elevated dumbbell down to your shoulder. Raise the other dumbbell to the sky.After a brief pause, bring the dumbbell back to your shoulder and lift the other dumbbell to the sky. Alternate each arm, lifting and lowering one dumbbell at a time.
This is called the Seated Palms-In Alternated Shoulder Pass.

, Make sure that your palms are facing forward. Push the dumbbells up towards the sky until your elbows come close to locking. Then, lower the dumbbells back to shoulder-level.This is called the Seated Shoulder Press.
Be careful that you don’t jerk your back during this exercise – your arms and shoulders should be doing the lifting work.

, Grab a dumbbell with your left hand, and using your left leg for balance, lift the dumbbell up towards your torso. Lower it back down after a brief pause. After five to ten repetitions, switch to your left arm and knee on the bench.This is called Kneeling One Arm Row.
Be sure to exhale when you lift the dumbbell and inhale when returning to a resting position.
You can also adapt this exercise into the One Arm Row by resting one hand on a bench, standing with both feet on the ground, and lifting the dumbbell towards your torso., Grab a dumbbell with each hand while keeping your elbows at 90 degree angles. Lift the dumbbells so that your arms are like wings and parallel to the ground. After a short pause, lower the dumbbells back to the ground.This is called the Back Fly.

Adjust the exercises you do, and how you do them, to build well-rounded pecs.,
Use free weights for tailored, easily adjusted workout.,
Use weight machines for bigger weights and specific muscle groups.,
Use resistance bands when you can't go to the gym.,
Use body resistance.,
Know that weightlifting is not the only way to build a strong chest.",How to Work out the Pecs2," The best way to get a well-rounded pectoral workout is to use a variety of techniques. Changing the types and tools of your pec workout on a regular basis can also prevent you from plateauing in your strength training or becoming bored with your workout.









You can generally only do 2-4 exercises in the same muscle group each day. Try a different set each time you work out your pecs to get a full workout.Your pectorals are not one muscle, they are a set of interrelated muscles. Certain exercises will focus more on one section than another, so a variety helps you build the whole muscle group., Free weights allow you to tailor your workout to a variety of locations and physical needs. The range of motion and the added stress to your stabilizer muscles (compared to weight machines) will be essential to build strong pecs.









Free weights are those not attached to a cable or machine -- so dumbbells and barbells.

, Weight machines offer a variety of convenient chest workouts that can be quickly altered to add or reduce resistance. Physical trainers can give advice on additional pec workouts that involve overhead pulls, hanging dips, and alterations of other common chest exercises. Because you're locked into one range of motion (the one the machine track moves on) weight machines are good for focused, intense workouts.









Try not to only use weight machines. Free-weights are important for letting your muscles move naturally, preventing injury., Resistance bands offer convenient, affordable alternatives to free weights or weight machines. They are portable and can be used for virtually any chest routine desired. They are sold in a variety of resistance levels for a beneficial chest workout at any skill level.








Frequently, resistance bands are ""too easy"" for some people. To get around this, focus on doing low-weight, high-rep sets, trying to hit 25-30 reps with each exercise, and do 3 sets., Body weight can be used to help build and tone chest muscles with push-ups and pull-ups. Using your body weight eliminates some of the joint and muscle stress brought on by added weights and is a great way to get big anywhere:










Push-ups: With your toes and both palms on the floor, shoulder length apart, straighten your spine. Lower yourself to the floor, then slowly push yourself back up until your arms are extended. The wider your hands are spread the more the exercise works your pecs.
'Dips: Sit in the air off a ledge with your feet on the floor, both hands behind you, and your butt off the ground. Your body will form a little chair, with your arms extended behind you. Keeping your elbows parallel with your legs, lower your butt towards the ground, dipping down, then push back up until your arms are extended.

, Strong pectoral muscles require a variety of different challenges and the ability to function well in a variety of situations. To give your pecs the best workout, perform a variety of other exercises that will force your pectoral muscles to grow along with the arm, shoulders, and back muscles. Play sports that require upper-body strength and coordination. Opt for activities that involve considerable upper body motions like throwing, pushing, or pulling.









Rowing
Rugby
Football
Baseball/Softball
Swimming
Rock Climbing
Volleyball."
"
Stretch before and after you work out.,
Push and relax slowly throughout the entire range of the exercise.,
Focus on keeping muscles tight.,
Perform the right number of repetitions for your body.,
Workout your back, shoulders, and arms as well.,
Rest your muscles 1-2 before returning to the chest exercises.",How to Work out the Pecs3," Stretching your muscles is essential to prevent injury and help your muscles get the most benefit out of your efforts. It also limbers your shoulders and back to help them engage effectively in your workout.









Slowly swing your arms in circles, making the circles slowly bigger.
Reach your elbow up and pull your hand back to your shoulder. Gently push your elbow back behind you until you feel a stretch.
Put your arms to the side with your hands up, forming a small, square ""U."" Have a friend grab your elbows and slowly pull them back behind your back. Resist slowly by pulling your chest muscles together.

You can also do this against a wall by yourself. Put your hand on the wall and walk past it to stretch out your pec., Concentrating on slow, deliberate movements helps strengthen all the muscles associated with the motions you are using in your workout. This enables your stabilizer muscles to grow and will help you perform real activities with better control.









You want every motion to be in control. Think of being fluid, not jerky, with each lift or push., Concentrating on keeping your chest muscles contracted and tensed as you perform the repetitions can help challenge and tone your muscles more with the same number of repetitions. You can feel your chest muscles working, so focus in on them. Otherwise, your form will start to suffer.








, If you are working on toning and firming, aim for about 20 repetitions of each exercise, with the repetitions growing difficult by the end. If your goal is a large chest, aim for 8 to 12 difficult repetitions; once you can perform 12 without much trouble, increase the weight or resistance for that exercise so that 8 becomes the maximum again.









You should be struggling, but still able to complete the exercise, at the 8th, 9th, and 10th rep of each set., Back, shoulder, and arm exercises not only help strengthen the pecs, they also balance muscle strength and growth. This prevents poor posture and an unsightly physique that can be caused by working only one muscle group to excess.








, Unless you are at an advanced level of strength training, you should allow your pecs to rest 1 to 3 days in between targeted workouts. You may feel like you'll gain muscle faster by crushing it every day, but your muscles need the time to actually rest and grow new muscle fibers. Hitting your pecs every day is not only painful, it prevents them from actually growing. More importunately, it is the fast way to end up with an injury."

Plant your feet flat on the ground, toes slightly outward.,
Position the bar behind your head, with the weight on your upper back.,
Bend your knees and slowly lower your hips as if to ""sit"" on an invisible chair.,
Contract your abs as you move through the squat.,
Push straight back up, lifting your hips up and forward to lift toward starting position.",How to Do a Squat2," Feet should be about shoulder-width apart. Get below the bar, bending your knees slightly. The height of the bar must be adjusted for your personal body height. It is important to keep the weight on your heels but keeping your full feet on the ground. Refrain from distributing the weight to your toes or ball of the foot, as this is bad for your knees.


Feet too straight ahead tends to cave knees inward, so angling them out toward about 10 and 2-o'clock is useful (with ""pigeon toed"" or ""toeing-out"" feet, do your best to be stable, and do not use much weight). But, do not toe out more than that angle.
Do not stand with your feet further than shoulder width apart (too wide stance). That would bring your adductors (inner thighs) into the movement, which would cause stress to the medial collateral ligament (MCL), abnormal loading of stress on knee cartilage, and improper patellar tracking. Likewise, do not keep your feet in a close stance (too close together), as that can cause you to distribute the weight through your toes, which is bad for your feet and knees.

, Place your shoulders below the bar for it to be across the trapezius muscles. These are the muscles along your upper back between your shoulders. You will want the bar to be positioned over your trapezius muscles, not on your neck. Grasp the bar with your hands at a spot that you find comfortable, usually about six inches (15cm) outward from your shoulders. If this is your first time squatting, do this with no weight on the bar to learn the movement first.









Raise and dismount the barbell from the rack. Then take a step forward or backward, or the rack would interfere in the motion.

You should always have a spotter when squatting! This is especially important when ""racking"" (taking weights on and off the rack).

, Look straight ahead, keeping your back straight and chin up throughout the movement. Keeping your spine aligned, bend at your knees as if you were lowering toward sitting down in a chair. Keep your heels on the floor.









Do not rock your knees forward at the ankles.
Do not curve or bow your back either forward or backward.
Keep your head up and your shoulders solid.
Only go as far as you can comfortably go toward chair seat level. You'll get nearer there as you get stronger.

, Pull in your abs, and keep your lower back in a nearly neutral position. To keep your abs braced and contracted, keep your back as straight as possible in a neutral alignment. For most people, this means that there may be a slight curve in the lower back. Make sure that you get your quads no lower than parallel to the ground (hips to knee level), for the full range of motion.








Really focus on tightening your abs throughout the movement. Let your body assist you in managing the weight.
Keep the weight distributed over your heels with your shins vertical.
Avoid moving your hips forward through the motion. This will cause your pelvis to tilt and reduce the action of the glutes.

, From lower position, push up off your heels and lift the weight while maintaining good, proper and safe form. Use almost every part of your body while straightening your legs, and slowly, evenly move up.









Your back should stay straight. Do not let your spine curve throughout any part of the exercise.
Focus on using your glutes (butt muscles) to push up without using your back.
Try to make this movement smooth, moving in one fluid motion to prevent injury.

Do not wear a lifting belt when learning this lift.",How to Do a Squat3," Your spine should be in alignment (i.e.: with your slight natural curve, as if you were standing straight up). Keeping your hips back and chest up prevents a rounded spine. Most people start to get lazy as they get tired, and their back starts to curve. This is dangerous and ineffective. No matter how tired you are, you must focus on your spinal alignment.


A rounded spine can lead to very serious injury.
If you can't do a rep right, don't do it at all -- bad form is much worse than none at all.

, You should be able to lift and wiggle your toes if you wanted. Resting on your toes puts stress on your knees, whereas you have a much more solid base on your heels.

, Do not let your knees pull or ""cave in"" while squatting. This is bad for your knees. Actively push your knees toward proper position throughout the entire squat to ensure against bad alignment. You need to keep your knees mostly quiet, bending but otherwise leaving them in roughly the same place throughout the exercise. If you feel extra muscle exertion through your glutes (hips), you are doing it right.









Focus on keeping your knees outward, pushing through the heel, not the toes.
Never let your knees extend beyond your toes, as this will increase the likelihood of damage to the patellar tendon and ligament in the knee.
Your knees might move slightly forward as you squat, but this is okay -- just keep them over your foot, behind the toes.

, You want the bar to rest on your traps, (upper back muscles). You'll know if it's on your neck if you can feel the bar digging into your neck-bone, as one of your hard vertebrae will be right in the way. Lower the bar a bit and distribute/balance the weight evenly across your upper body.


A slightly wider grip may help.

, This most effectively utilizes your body's natural rhythm, allowing you to access the most air and move through the squat fluidly.









In general, inhale as you ""enter"" an exercise, like a stretch. Then exhale as you exert action.

, As with any athletic endeavor, warming up and stretching is necessary to prevent strain or injury. Warm up first by getting your heart rate up and then following the directions below for a warm up squat, but with a very small amount of weight.









Static versus dynamic stretch: Static stretching is a type of stretch where you hold a position for a certain amount of time (usually 15-30 seconds). Dynamic (active) stretching involves controlled movements through various ranges of motion. Dynamic stretching is sometimes recommended because warming up by moving may offer less risk of injury. Shoulder rolls, light kicks, sumo squats, leg circles, and knee bends are all good examples of dynamic stretching exercises.

Start with no weights at all—or an unloaded barbell, if you're new to squats and weight training.
If you're more experienced, or you find an unloaded barbell too light, select weights that are appropriate for your strength and set them up on the barbell. If you have the option of adjusting the height of the rack, bring it to a level below your shoulders, to about your armpits. Do not use too much weight because you can hurt yourself.

, A lifting belt keeps your back supported and aligned with the rest of your body which you need to train yourself to do on your own. However, when you are at a level where your back strength (lower and upper) is sufficient, a belt may be desirable in order to brace the back and core for heavy lifts.

Try dumbbell squats to start building muscle if you can't accomplish barbell squats yet.,
Assume the plie (""PLEE-ay"") form.,
Try a front squat to work new muscles heads and grips.,
Try overhead squats to really start building muscle.,
Keeping your upper body with the same form, stagger your legs.,
Slightly lower the bar down on your shoulders with normal squats for new muscle groups.",How to Do a Squat4," Stand in front of a sturdy armless chair or heavy-duty equipment box, as if to sit. This is a great exercise for beginners. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, dangling at your sides. If you're new to squats, 5-pound dumbbells are good. As you get stronger, you can increase the weight accordingly.









Place your feet about shoulder width apart, feet angled out slightly.
Bend your knees. Shift your hips back and slowly lower yourself down until your butt's just about touching the chair, then stand back up.
Don't lock your knees. Keep them loose at all times. Also, keep them from going past your toes. You will feel it more in your thighs than in your knees.

, Holding one dumbbell or kettlebell, use both hands to hold one end of the dumbbell, so it hangs vertically towards the floor. Keep your abs tight throughout the squat; involving your abs will help you maintain balance.









Place your feet. They should be a little more than shoulder width apart, and spread your knees/legs, so feet are turned out about 45°. This is based on a ballet form called ""plie.""
Lift your heels off the floor. Balance on the balls of your feet, and bend your knees.
Slowly lower your body down. Keep your hips under your shoulders and your back straight.
Keep your knees behind your toes. Do not let them extend beyond this point!
Slowly raise back up. Lower your heels as you rise.

, This is a variation on the basic squat, holding the bar in front of you rather than behind you. Place the bar below your neck and across your chest, parallel with your clavicle (collar bone). Grasp the bar from underneath, with your hands at a spot that is comfortable, usually about six inches (15cm) from your shoulders.









Plant your feet flat on the ground, about shoulder-width apart. Get below the bar and bend your knees slightly. You'll want equal weight distribution throughout each foot during the exercise. Point your feet slightly outward, not straight ahead.
Looking straight ahead, keep your back straight and bend at your knees, keeping your heels on the floor. Make sure that you get your quads parallel to the ground, for the full range of motion.
Lower yourself in a controlled manner down and back so that your upper legs are about parallel with the floor. Do not extend below parallel. Keep the weight distributed on your upper thighs and the heels or balls of your feet, not on your toes nor your knees.
Lift back up, pushing up off your heels. Keep the upper body tight at all times.

, If you're ready for a real challenge, overhead squats fit the bill. If you're not up to heavy weights yet, stick with an unloaded bar or very light weights. Remember to keep your body as vertical as possible -- neither leaning forward nor backward -- for the best results.









Using a wide snatch grip, lift the bar overhead with your elbows locked.
Push your shoulder blades together, and keep your core tight.
Looking straight ahead, keep your back straight and bend at your knees, keeping your heels on the floor.
Pull in your abs, and keep your lower back in a nearly neutral position (a slightly arched back might be unavoidable).
Lower yourself in a controlled manner down and back so that your upper legs are nearly parallel with the floor. Keep your shoulder back, and the weight over your heels at all times.
Lift back up, pushing up off your heels. Keep the upper body tight at all times.

, Get into lunge form with your lower body, with one leg a foot in front, knee bent, and the other leg extended behind you. Then...









Keep your spine straight.
Lower your hips down to the ground so your back knee touches.
Keep your front knee bent at 90-degrees.
Push back up off your front heel, keeping your back straight up.
Repeat with the opposite leg.

, Lower the bar an extra inch or so, then keep your normal squat form. This activates your quads more than your hamstrings. These are often known as ""low-grip"" squats.









You can also extend your arms much lower behind you, grip the bar around your knees. From there, you keep your form the exact same -- however your arms stay low and the weight touches the floor between each rep."
"
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.,
Take a step forward with your left foot.,
Bend your knee.,
Return to the starting position.,
Repeat this process with the other leg.,
Lunge again, alternating between both legs.",How to Work Quads Without Weights2," Make sure your weight is evenly distributed between both feet. You can keep your hands on your hips to improve your balance. This is the starting position, and the position you’ll return to when you complete a rep., Plant your heel first, then roll the foot forward until it’s completely flat.


You should step far enough forward that the distance between your feet is roughly equal to twice the width of your shoulders.
You should be inhaling as you step forward., Once your front foot is flat, bend your front knee until it’s at a 90 degree angle. As you do this, your rear leg should bend as well, until your rear knee almost touches the ground., You do this by pushing off of your front foot, extending your leg as you bring it back. You should feel the front of your thigh working to push you back up. You should now stand with your feet shoulder width.This counts as one rep.

, You’ll be doing the exact same process, only this time with your right leg going forward. It’s important to alternate this way to prevent any muscle imbalances from forming.This counts as one rep for the right leg.

, You should aim for 10-15 reps on each, for 2-3 sets. This will give you the best workout for strengthening your quads and improving muscle definition.


If you have knee problems, or are feeling pain when you do lunges, try reverse lunges instead. The process is essentially the same, except you’ll step backwards and bend the knee instead of stepping forwards"

Start with your feet shoulder width apart.,
Bend your knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor.,
Drive through your heels to push yourself back up.,
Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps.",How to Work Quads Without Weights3," Point your toes slightly outwards and keep your arms at your sides. Pull your shoulders back, which will force you to keep your back straight throughout the movement., Push your butt back and down, like you’re trying to sit down on a low box. Keep your abs tight. Bring your arms up in front of you to help you keep your balance and inhale.


Make sure you don’t let your knees go past your toes. This puts additional strain on your knees and could cause an injury.
If you’re not very flexible, you might not be able to reach parallel depth on your squat. That’s fine, just go as far down as you can without injuring yourself., Your weight should be in your heels as you push up. This will keep you from tipping over forward and putting too much strain on your knees. Extend your legs until you’ve returned to the starting position, with arms by your sides.


Exhale as you push your way up., This is the ideal range for a balance of strength building and muscle development. You might not be able to complete all the prescribed reps when you start, which is fine; just do what you can until you work your way up to 10 reps.


If the bodyweight squat is too easy for you, try the jump squat. The movement is essentially the same, except that as you push up, you jump as high as you can."

, Doing exercises that work your pelvic floor are a good place to start controlling the important abdominal muscles that most people skip during an ab workout.

, Just like strength training with weights, the best way to sculpt muscles is to work them hard enough so that they have to rebuild during your rest days.

, If you only have time to do a limited number of exercises, remember that standing or extended exercises work your entire core, instead of the top muscles.

, When you do ab exercises laying down, hold 5 to 10 lb. (2.2 to 4.5kg) weights for added toning. Your body has to try harder to keep your shoulders above the ground.

, Inhale on the easiest part of the exercise, then breathe out when it is harder. This will also keep your ab muscles from popping out.

, In order to tone abs, you must lift both deep and surface muscles in toward your rib cage. Many people let their ab muscles bunch out, like a loaf of bread, which can add bulk, rather than definition.


As you do each exercise, visualize your stomach muscles lifting upward and inward. Look down at the abs occasionally and try to make your stomach look skinnier as you do the move.

, You need to loosen your lower back to minimize strain on it. Back and stomach muscles are closely linked, and any good ab workout will strengthen the back as well.

, Don't look down all the time, or you will strain your neck. Lead with your abs, not your chin.

, Taking 2 to 5 more seconds with each exercise will tone your body faster in the long run. People often use too much momentum to complete ab movements.

, Get into a push up position, with feet hip width apart and arms shoulder width apart. Look slightly forward on your mat while you hold the position.


Keep a timer nearby. Start with 2 periods of 15 seconds with a rest in between. Work up to 2 periods of 1 minute. Do not hold your breath. Focus on controlled breathing as you complete the time.
The plank is 1 of the best core building exercises you can do, because it requires a lot of strength throughout your mid-section to remain static.

, Get into a push up position. Rotate your body until your weight is held up by your left foot and left arm.


Keep your form straight and hips up, just as you did with a plank. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds. The side plank targets your obliques and core extremely well.

, Hold small hand weights. Stand with feet hip width apart and sit down like you are trying to sit in a chair.


Make sure your knees never go further forward than your toes. Pause and return to standing. The squat works the pillar muscles, like quads, hamstrings, buttocks, hips, back muscles and abdominal muscles.

, Get into a squat position, with your arms behind your head in a crunch position. Squat, and as you rise bring your left knee to meet your right elbow.


Make sure your abs are always pulled in during this exercise. Keep your elbow to the side of your head and twist to get your knee and elbow near to each other. They do not need to touch, but the main movement in the standing crunch should come from your stomach. Repeat 10 to 20 times.

, Lay on your back with your knees in a table top position. Lift your abdominals until your shoulders are off the ground.


Keep your hands bent behind your head in a crunch position. Extend your right foot while you twist. Try to make your right elbow touch your left knee. Return to the original position and extend your left foot while you twist your left elbow to touch your right knee. Repeat 10 times on each side.

, Place your arms behind your head in a crunch position. Hold your legs straight, like you are trying to walk on the ceiling.


Lower your legs as far as you can to the ground without forcing your abdominals out. Flex deeply in to bring your legs to the original position. Done properly, this exercise works your transverse abdominis, the underlying muscle that wraps around your abdomen to your back. Repeat 12 to 20 times.

, There are dozens of variations on planks, squats, standing crunches and lower abdominal crunches that will help tone the muscles in new ways.

, If you get tired of your ab workout and need new ideas, a pilates or pilates barre class is a great place to find them. Since most of the work is focused on the core, these classes tone abs quickly.

, Cardio exercise 3 to 5 times per week for more than 30 minutes is essential to burn the fat on your abs. You will not get a toned look without burning all over body fat.

, You will burn body fat more quickly if you do 30 minutes of free weights or weight machines 3 times per week.


Make sure your abs are tucked during all weightlifting activities. As an added bonus, strength training usually requires you to hold your core in a static position while you do them, so you will tone your abs even faster.

, Many trainers believe ""abs are made in the kitchen."" Make your meals a combination of whole grains, produce and lean proteins.


If you have a large layer of fat between your abs and your epidermis, you may need to do calorie restriction in addition to working out. Cut your calories between 15 and 25 percent for up to 11 weeks. Then, go on a maintenance diet of the calories you need to maintain your new weight.

, People who sleep less tend to develop fat in their mid-section. This may be because your body doesn't rest and handle stress hormones as well.

, When you are stressed, your body releases hormones that tell you to store fat in your mid-section. Channeling stress better leads to better abs.

Try wrist curls as a good ""bread and butter"" exercise.,
Use reverse wrist curls to work the other side of your wrists.,
Try wrist rolls for a challenge.,
Try two-hand pinches.,
Use grip-based exercises to indirectly improve wrist strength.,
Don't forget wrist stretches for improving flexibility.",How to Strengthen Your Wrists1," Wrist curls are one of the quintessential wrist and forearm exercises. To do a wrist curl, you'll need a weighted dumbbell (you can also use a barbell to hit both hands at once).Sit at a bench or bicep curl rack. Hold your dumbbell so your palm faces upwards. Using only your forearm muscles, curl the dumbbell up toward your wrist as far as you can without bending your elbow. Lower the dumbbell back down and repeat the curling motion. Repeat for both arms.
Do three sets of 15 reps or until you feel sufficiently fatigued. Unless otherwise noted, these set recommendations hold true for all exercises in this article.

You can also do this exercise at home with a soup can or a jug of milk in place of a dumbbell.;
, Reverse wrist curls are just what they sound like — normal wrist curls performed backwards. These are great to do right after a few sets of ordinary wrist curls to ensure that you work out all of your wrist muscles.


Sit on a bench. Rest one forearm on your thigh so that your hand extends beyond your knee. Take a dumbbell and hold it so your palm faces downward. Let the dumbbell hang limp in your hand, then, using only your wrist, pull it up so it is level with the rest of your arm. Lower the dumbbell back down and repeat the raising motion. Repeat for both arms.

, These exercises may look unconventional, but if you can power through them, they're highly effective at strengthening your wrists. For this exercise, you'll need a sturdy stick or rod (like a broom handle or a dumbbell without weight on it. Tie a modest weight (like five or ten pounds) to the end of a sturdy string and tie the other end to the center of the rod.









Hold the rod out in front of you and let the weight hang at the end of its string. Your palms should be facing down. Start to turn the rod with your arms — the string should start winding up and the weight should start climbing towards the stick. Stop when the weight touches the stick, then, carefully roll it back down to the floor. Do not stop or let your arms fall throughout this exercise.
Repeat for three to five windings or until you are sufficiently fatigued.

, This challenging exercise uses heavy barbell plates, making it a good choice for those who are already strong and want to take their wrist and forearm strength to the next level. Because these plates can cause serious injury if they are dropped, you may want to stick to the exercises above if you aren't already an experienced gym-goer.


Place two barbell plates of the same size on the floor in front of you so that you are facing their wide edge and so that they are touching each other. Grip both plates at once over the top — your fingers should be on one side of the plates and your thumbs should be on the other. Lift the weight off of the ground and hold it in front of your hips as if you were doing a deadlift. Pinch the weights together to keep them from slipping. Hold for 30 seconds (or as long as you can), then set the weights back down.
Repeat for 3-5 sets or until you are sufficiently fatigued.
Perform this exercise while sitting on a bench and hold the weights well away from your feet. If you must stand, keep a wide stance. If you keep your feet together, the plates are more likely to hit them if they slip out of your hands.

, A huge variety of gym exercises that don't directly target the wrists still rely on grip strength and thus will indirectly work the forearm and wrist muscles. If you're serious about improving your wrist strength, try adding more of these exercises to your workout schedule to give yourself extra opportunities throughout your week. Below is a short list of exercises that use forearm/wrist grip strength for support — there are many more (you'll notice that all involve gripping a bar or handle to move weight.)









Pullups
Chin ups
Bicep curls
Deadlifts
Seated rows
Lat pulldowns
Chest presses
Chest flies
Shoulder presses.

, Just like the other muscles you train at the gym, wrists need stretching to maintain flexibility and keep them feeling great from week to week. In addition, regularly stretching your wrists is one way to stave off painful conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome that can develop over time as the body matures. Below are a few recommended wrist stretches:Prayer stretches: Start with your palms together in front of your chest. Slowly lower your palms (keeping them together) until your forearms form a straight line. This should look a little like you're praying and you should feel a gentle stretch in your forearms. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and repeat several times for best results.
Wrist flexor stretch: Extend one arm in front of you with the palm facing up. Point your hand at the floor by bending your wrist — don't turn your arm. Apply gently pressure with your other hand until you feel a moderate stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch hands.
Wrist extensor stretch: Extend one arm in front of your with the palm facing down. Point your hand at the floor by bending your wrist. Apply gentle pressure with your other hand until you feel a moderate stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch hands.

If you make an effort to start using your non-dominant hand for your daily tasks, you will probably be surprised at how hard they are to accomplish! Stick with it — over time, your weaker wrist will become stronger and your tasks will become easier. Below is a short list of tasks you can start using your ""off"" hand for.









Brushing your teeth

, You may have seen these hand-held exercise devices in workout rooms, high-stress places (like home offices), and more. Though they come in many different shapes and sizes, the basic idea is the same for all of them — hold the device in your hand, squeeze firmly but steadily, relax your grip, and repeat. That's all there is to it!









These are great for when you have one hand free. For instance, it's not hard to get a wrist workout in while you talk on the phone or read a book.

, Thinking of hitting the links in the near future? Dust off your golf clubs early for this exercise, which is great for improving your wrists' strength along their entire range of motion. You can also use any sort of long, rigid object light enough to manipulate with one hand (like, for instance, a broom.)Stand with your arm at your side and hold a golf club by the end of the handle. Using only your wrist, slowly point it toward the sky, then point it back down again. Repeat until you feel a good ""burn"" in your forearm.
For an extra challenge, start with a light club, then work your way up to your heavier ones.

, These minimum-resistance exercises are great for quick breaks at the office or in situations where you can't do more complicated exercises (such as when you're on an airplane.) They're sometimes also used in physical therapy situations, but don't let that stop you if you're perfectly healthy, as wrist circles can be a great relaxer if you're feeling ""all wound up.""


Stand or sit with your hands out in front of you, palms down. Move your wrists in a slow circular motion to the left, then back to the right. You may want to clench and unclench your fists as you do this to add an extra degree of motion to the exercise. After you've worked out any kinks, turn your palms over and start over.

, Resistance bands are large, elastic strips of rubbery material which are often used for physical therapy purposes, but they're also great for building strength even if you're not recovering an injury. You'll need a sturdy resistance band for these exercises — usually, these are available at exercise stores, but you may also be able to get them from physical therapy centers. Below are two resistance band exercises for your wrists you may want to try out:


Wrist flexion: Loop the resistance band over the fingers of one hand, then stand with your arm at your side, your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle, and your hand palm-up in front of you. Put the other end of your resistance band under your foot or attach it to the floor. Curl your wrist upwards as far as you can, then let your hand relax back down and repeat. Keep your forearms steady as you do this. Note that this exercise is very similar to the wrist curl described above.
Wrist extensions: Identical to wrist flexion, except with your hand turned palm-down. This exercise is very similar to a standing wrist curl.

, This unconventional exercise doesn't have much in common with the others on this list, but it's simple to set up and perform and it's quite effective at building wrist and forearm strength. In fact, some baseball teams recommend it for their players as a way to build wrist strength.All you'll need for this exercise is a container wide and deep enough that both hands fit in it comfortably without touching each other and enough rice to bury your hands in the container.


Start by pouring the rice into the container. Plunge your hands into the rice until they are buried up to your wrists. Next, make the following motions with your hands and repeat until you feel a good burn — the resistance of the rice being pushed by your hands will exercise your wrists a surprising amount.
Clench your hands into fists and turn them in circles back and forth.
Open your hands and turn them in circles back and forth.
Open and close your hands while submerged in the rice.
Move your hands up and down.
Make wrist curl movements with your palms facing you.
Make reverse wrist curl movements with your palms facing away from you.

Adjust your normal pull-up grip by keeping your thumbs under the bar and your wrists kinked forward.,
Try a ""flexus"" pull-up by cupping your hands over the top of a larger bar, touching only with your fingertips and the heel of your hand.,
Hold your pull-up position, instead of moving up and down, to build strength.,
Consider using ball-grips for pull-ups.,
Do fore-arm push-ups against a wall.,
Try wrist pushups.,
Try knuckle push-ups.,
Do handstands on solid ground and parallel bars.",How to Strengthen Your Wrists3," Basically, you want the palm of your hand to be directly underneath the bar. This will make your pull-ups a lot harder, but they will target more of your wrists.


This requires a ton of forearm strength to pull off -- these exercises are for further training, not beginners., Incredibly difficult but worth the effort, this pull-up variation requires you cup your hands on top of a beam or bar so that all of your stabilization comes through the wrist. Start with 1-2, building up until you can do full sets of 8-10.

, Get into position and hold it, aiming for 45 seconds to a minute at a time. Rest for a little longer than you worked out, (if you held for 45 seconds, rest for a minute or so) and then repeat two more times. Any exercise where you must hold your wrists in position while fighting tension will increase your wrist strength. To make it even harder:









Pull the lower half of your torso up so that it is parallel to the ground.
Use the grips mentioned above., These will work your wrist in multiple ways, which is key to avoid only training certain muscles. They hang from the pull-up bar to provide tricky, rounded grips, which will significantly increase forearm, finger, and wrist strength.









You could also use hanging ""rock holds,"" used to help train rock climbers. They can be found at many gyms already, even if they don't have a wall., Stand 5-6 feet away from a wall, leaning towards it so that your hands support you. You'll be diagonally pointed to the wall. Push off your fingers so that the heel of your hand rises off the wall. Then slowly lower them back out and repeat. Perform 15-20 reps.









Move further and further away from the wall to increase the challenge.

, This will hurt if you're not trained, so start on your hands and knees before moving into a plank push-up position. Instead of a normal palms-on-the-floor push-up, curl your hands back towards your feet and rest on the back of your hands. Perform the pushups like normal.









Try them as well with the outside edge of your hands. Can you ""walk"" forward on your feet and the blades of your hands?, You can also start by resting on your knuckles, with your hands in a fist. This is often a good middle-ground to strengthen your wrists, though you'll need to harden your knuckles first or it will be painful. Try this first on soft surfaces, like carpet or spongy gym floor.








, These full-body holds put a lot of pressure on your wrists, and if you can't keep them stable and strong, you won't be able to hold yourself up. Don't worry if you can't do a full handstand just yet -- you can rest your feet on a wall to keep balance without significantly compromising the wrist workout.Really ready to test yourself? Try a handstand push-up. Simply bend your elbows out to lower yourself to the ground slightly, then push back up to a full handstand. This is much easier with the wall for support.

Do a front lunge exercise.,
Do a reverse lunge.,
Do walking lunges.,
Do a medicine ball lunge with twist.",How to Get a Toned Butt1," When you perform lunges, make sure that your knee stays centered above your foot. If you don’t have any dumbbells, then wear a backpack filled with 1 or 2 heavy books while you perform the exercise. Make sure that the backpack is snugly connected to your shoulders.;
, If you have problems with your knees, the reverse lunge places less stress on them than a front lunge exercise. Keep your torso upright to further reduce the stress on your knees. If you can’t lunge too deeply at first, don’t worry. The more you perform the exercise, the deeper you will lunge and the more effectively you will work your glutes.

, Walking lunges are a series of forward lunges done with alternating legs. You will need a large space so that you have plenty of room to move. Think of lowering your hips toward the floor as you lunge, and bend you knees almost at 90-degree angles. If the exercise is too hard to perform while holding light weights, then place your hands on your hips instead.

, This lunge is a forward lunge with an added twist. When your knees are bent, you twist your waist before pushing yourself back into an upright position. When you hold the medicine ball, you can extend it out in front of your chest. However, be careful not to lock your elbows.

, With your standing leg, slowly lower yourself into a squat. Go as far as your body will let you. As you do this, straighten your lifted leg in front of you. When you reach the bottom of the squat, the lifted leg should be straight in front of you off the ground. Hold this for a second.


Make sure that the knee of your supporting leg does not extend past the toes of your supporting leg.

, Lift yourself back up by standing on the working leg. Go slowly so that you can maintain your balance. As you lift yourself, return the raised leg to a 45 degree angle relative to the rest of your body.


Your heel should never leave the ground as you raise yourself. You should be extending through your leg and pressing through the heel.If your heel does keep lifting off the ground, try placing a weight plate underneath it. This will help you press down through your heels instead of through your toes.

, Do two or three sets of five to ten reps of pistol squats. Rest for a minute or two between sets. Do not do too many pistol squats or you may cause injury to your knees.You may want to start small with this exercise. You do not want to cause injury by overexerting yourself too soon. Start with two sets of five and work your way up to three sets of ten.

Look for a handgrip dynamometer.,
Position your arm and hand correctly.,
Squeeze the dynamometer with maximal effort.,
Analyze your results.",How to Test Your Grip Strength1," One of the most conventional and more accurate ways to test your grip strength is by using a handgrip dynamometer. Find or purchase one of these so you can test your grip strength.The first place to look for a dynamometer is at your local gym or fitness center. Many gyms have a variety of tools to measure progress and a dynamometer is a common device to have.
If your gym doesn't have one, consider looking online or in a fitness or sporting goods store to purchase one. You can continuously use it and to track your grip strength over time.;
, Although using a handgrip dynamometer is fairly easy, it's important to make sure you position your arm and hand correctly for the most accurate results.Start by holding the dynamometer in one hand. You will test both hands, but can only test one at a time.


Bend the arm that's being tested at a 90 degree angle at the elbow. Your upper arm should be next to your body with your forearm pointing away from your body.
The base of the dynamometer should rest on the heel of your hand (or the muscle right under your thumb). Your four fingers should rest on the lever of the dynamometer.

, In order to get an accurate reading, you need to squeeze this tool with as much force and effort as you can. This will give you your maximum grip strength.


When your arm and hand are positioned correctly, begin squeezing the dynamometer as hard as you can.
Keep squeezing for at least 5 seconds. Have a stop watch or friend time you for 5 seconds.
Do not move any other body parts while you're squeezing as this can influence the reading on the dynamometer.
For the most accurate results, take an average of 3 tests.

, After you've performed the test on each hand and have found an average of your results, you can score yourself to see where you are compared to standards.For men, you typically want to have a grip strength reading of 105 and above. A score of 105 puts you at an average grip strength.
For women, you typically want to have a grip strength of at least 57. This is considered average. Anything above is considered very good or even excellent.
If your score is below average, you can take steps to improve. For men if your grip strength is below 105, this signifies you're below average or have poor grip strength. You may want to consider adding in exercises to help strengthen your grip. If your grip strength as a woman is below 57, this signifies your score is below average. Again, with practice, you can improve your score.

Stand up straight with your feet positioned hip-width apart.,
Bend your knees slightly and point your toes forward.

,
Lift both arms straight out to either side at shoulder height.,
Slowly twist your wrists until your palms are facing behind you.,
Hold this position for at least 30 seconds, and focus on breathing deeply.",How to Stretch Your Biceps1," If preferred, you can stand with your back against a wall or pole to deepen the stretch.;
,, Your shoulders should remain even with one another., You will immediately start to feel your bicep muscles stretching.


If you don’t feel the stretching sensation, gently and slowly push your arms back behind you until you feel the stretch.

, This will help deliver oxygen to your muscles, which will aid further in the muscle repair and recovery process.

Do squats with a resistance band.,
Do a single leg squat.",How to Get a Toned Butt2," This exercise shows you how to perform squats while getting extra resistance from a resistance band. However, you can also hold dumbbells while performing the exercise, or you can hold a barbell behind your shoulders. Make sure to equally distribute your weight on your heels and on the balls of your feet as you squat. This will place less stress on your knees.

, Start performing single leg squats without weights until you have mastered the form of the exercise. To increase the challenge, stand on a bench and lower one leg to the ground while bending your other leg to support your weight. Barely allow your heels to touch the ground before using your bent leg to push yourself back into an upright position. This new angle will significantly strengthen your legs.

, This exercise is similar to the bridge exercise except that you start with your knees bent and roll the ball away from yourself as you straighten your body. As you lower your body back to the floor, you roll the ball back toward yourself.

, Swimming kicks will challenge both your glutes and your core as you try to maintain your balance on top of the ball. For more of a challenge, only place one hand on the floor. Alternate hands so that you work your obliques equally.

Keep your wrist joint in a straight line with your shoulder to avoid over-arching your back. Also, be sure to push down through your hands and lift the top of your head to avoid compressing your neck vertebrae.

, This exercise will strengthen both your glutes and legs while stretching your shoulders and chest. If you have flat feet, this exercise can also strengthen your arches. Make sure to tuck your tailbone in as you lower your body. This will keep your back long and straight.

, The crescent moon pose tones your glutes as well as strengthening your chest and arms. Place a pillow or rolled towel beneath the knee that is touching the ground if you find that your knee is uncomfortable. If you have an injured back, then don’t lean back as far when you extend your arms.

Practice normal squats first.,
Squat onto a chair.,
Hold onto a stable object.,
Use a counterweight.,
Strengthen your vastus medialis muscles.",How to Do Pistol Squats2," If you have difficulty with two legged squats, you may not be ready to do a full pistol squat. Make sure that you can do at least twenty two-legged squats without a problem before progressing to this move.To do a normal squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your body as though you are about to sit in a chair.

, Instead of lowering yourself towards the ground, place a chair beneath your body. When you lower yourself, squat down onto the seat and raise yourself again. This will help you build leg strength without hurting yourself.You can also use a stool or box if you need to squat higher or lower. Gradually lower the height of the seat until you are comfortable and stable going into a full squat.

, If you’re having trouble keeping balance while doing a pistol squat, you can hold onto a pole, doorframe, barre, or other fixed object to keep you stable through the exercise. Face the pole or frame. As you lower yourself, hold onto it for balance. Your standing leg should still be doing most of the work., Use a dumbbell or kettlebell that weighs between ten or fifteen pounds. Hold it in front of you with your arms straight as you lower yourself. Once you are comfortable with the movement, progress gradually to smaller and smaller weights until you do not need a counterweight at all., If you find yourself consistently falling from one side to another, you may need to work out your upper leg muscles around the knee. Some exercises you can do include:



Step-ups: face a bench while holding a dumbbell in either hand. Step up onto the bench, then step back down.

Split squats: stagger your stance with one foot forward and one foot back. Raise the back leg, and lower yourself into a squat. Raise yourself up again.Leg extensions: at the gym, find a leg extension machine. Place your feet beneath the pads, and grasp the handle bars. Raise your legs but keep the rest of your body still.Barefoot pistol squats: practice the pistol squat without wearing shoes or socks. This will help your foot grip the ground and build strength through your leg."

Get the right equipment.,
Pull on the bar with maximal effort.,
Calculate your grip strength.",How to Test Your Grip Strength2," If you can't find a handgrip dynamometer, you can still test your grip strength at home or at the gym. Using a few household items, you can easily find a fairly accurate reading.


You need to make sure you have all the right equipment on hand. You'll need a bathroom scale, a pull-up bar or hanging board and a stop watch.
Position the scale right underneath your pull-up bar or board. These should be high enough that your arms will be fully extended above your head.
You want to test your grip strength for a 5 second time period. Set your stop watch to 5 seconds or have a friend monitor their watch.
To get in the right position, stand on the scale and place your hands on the pull-up bar or board. Look at the scale to make sure the weight reading is accurate.

, To test your grip strength with a bathroom scale, you'll want to see how much weight you can pull up with just your hands.While standing with feet flat on the scale, squeeze your hands around the pull-up bar or the side of the hangboard.


You should not bend your elbows, wrists or knees. Your entire body, aside from your hands, should remain stable. You want to aim to lift as much of your body weight off the scale as you can, with only the strength of your hands.
Squeeze or pull on the bar as hard as you can with your hands. Have a friend record what the new weight reading is on the scale. It will be less than your actual body weight.
Again, it's recommended to take an average of these readings. Do three to five tests and then take the average of these results.

, Once you've noted your current weight and the averages from the tests, you can calculate your grip strength. Follow this simple equation:


Your grip strength in pounds = your current weight - your weight while gripping the bar.For example: 180 pounds current weight - 80 pounds while gripping the bar = 100 pounds of grip strength.
Record this result and continue to track your grip strength using this same method over time. This will help you see any improvements after practicing strengthening exercises.

Do hand extensions.,
Use a hand gripper.,
Incorporate plate pinches.,
Squeeze wide barbells.",How to Test Your Grip Strength3," To help increase your grip strength, try incorporating exercises like hand extensions into your regular exercise routine. This exercise is not really a grip exercise, but it will strengthen the muscles that help to give you a strong grip.You can either use a thick rubber band (or multiple rubber bands) or get a professional tool that helps you perform this exercise.
To use the rubber bands, pull the rubber band down over your hand so that it's resting near the base of your fingers.
In a slow and controlled way, spread your fingers and thumbs out away from your palm. They should be pushing against the rubber band.
Hold your fingers and thumbs as long as you can against the pressure of the rubber band. Repeat a few times on each hand.

, Another great exercise to try is by squeezing a hand gripper. You will need to get a gripper, which is a handheld grip exerciser that you squeeze with one hand at a time. Squeezing a gripper will help strengthen your grip by working the muscles in your hand.Hold on to a gripper in each hand or work one hand at a time. Wrap your entire hand around the handles. Make sure the grippers have a plastic coating to help make this exercise comfortable.
Squeeze the handles so they are close together (this would typically open the gripper so it could be placed around a barbell).
Hold this squeeze for as long as you can. Repeat a few reps with each hand.

, Another great exercise to strengthen the muscles in your palms are plate pinches. Grab a few conventional weighted plates to get started on this exercise.Place one or more 10 pound plates together with the smoother side facing out.
Pinch or squeeze them together with your hands (thumb on one side and 4 fingers on the other side) and hold them as long as you can in the air.
Keep the plates closer to the floor in case you drop one. Also, do not hold them over your feet.
Try to work up to being able to hold four 10 pound plates in each hand for at least one minute. Repeat two to three times if you can.

, If you have barbells that have a wider circumference than the standard barbells, these are a great tool to use to help improve your grip strength as well.Improving your grip strength with a fat or wide barbell is easy and simple to do. Grab one of these barbells with both hands and squeeze as tight as you can.
Your fingers and thumbs should not be able to touch when your fist is clasped around the bar.
To make this exercise more difficult, add plates to either side of the bar. Your goal should be to hold this bar for at least one minute and repeat for one to two more sets.

Do bicep curls while sitting on a stability ball.,
Include forearm curls to improve your grip.,
Do the French press.,
Increase the weight you use gradually.",How to Strengthen Arms with a Stability Ball1," Bicep curls are a fairly common strength-training exercise. Doing them while sitting on a stability ball keeps your core engaged and adds whole-body difficulty to the exercise.To start, choose dumbbells of between 1 and 5 pounds, holding one in each hand. Sit on the top of the stability ball with your knees at right angles and your feet together. Position your hips slightly forward with your arms straight down beside you.
Face your palms forward as you bend your elbows to slowly raise the weights towards your shoulders. Curl upwards until the weight is about a fist's width from your shoulders, then lower the weight in a controlled motion to return to the starting position.
Keep your movements slow and steady, avoiding jerky movements or relying on gravity to drop the weight back down.
Do two or three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions each of this exercise to build the strength in your biceps muscles.
You can also do this exercise while standing and hold the ball instead of holding dumbbells. Holding the ball between your hands and doing curls with it will engage your biceps and pectoral muscles. You can even stand on one leg while doing this exercise for a balance challenge.;
, Forearm curls increase the strength in your forearms and wrists. Avoid this exercise if you've recently had a wrist injury, or if you have carpal tunnel syndrome.You want to use a lighter weight for this exercise than you did for your bicep curls. These are smaller muscles, and typically two or three pounds will be enough. You can use lightweight objects if you don't have dumbbells that small, just make sure the objects are identical.
Sit on the ball as you did for bicep curls, but with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Rest your elbows on top of your thighs and hold the weights with your palms up.
Curl your knuckles towards your elbow, bending at the wrist, then lower the weight back down to starting position.
Make sure your movements are slow and controlled. Don't jerk your wrists. Do 2 to 3 sets of this exercise that consist of between 10 and 15 repetitions.

, While tricep extensions target your triceps almost exclusively, you also get a decent back and core workout because you must maintain your balance on the stability ball.If you prefer to stand or don’t have any dumbbells, then you can also do the French press while holding the stability ball over your head.


Get a single dumbbell and hold it with both hands, or hold the stability ball in your hands. As you inhale, tighten your abs and stabilize your back and core, pulling your shoulders down.
Press the dumbbell or stability ball up until your arms are straight, pointed towards the ceiling, with the dumbbell or stability ball over your head. Be careful not to lock your elbows.
Start this exercise by sitting on your stability ball, or by standing and holding the ball over your head.
Bend your elbows to slowly lower the dumbbell or stability ball behind your head as you exhale, bringing it back up to starting position as you inhale and repeat.
Do 2 to 3 sets of this exercise, with 10 to 15 repetitions in each set.

, The effectiveness of any strength-training exercise will diminish over time if you don't gradually increase the weight of your dumbbells. If you find you're able to complete your routine without breaking a sweat, it may be time to add a pound or two.Keep in mind that increasing the weight is not going to cause you to bulk up. To build bulkier muscles, you must do a different workout targeted specifically to that purpose.
When strength training, your arms will gain strength over time if you're doing the exercise correctly. As your arms get stronger, you must add additional weight to get the same workout or even to maintain the strength that you've built.
You'll build strength more rapidly if you choose the maximum weight you can use to complete the repetitions required in your workout. This way you're working your muscles to exhaustion.

Before starting this intense regime:


Have a goal such as doing 50 V-ups or lift a barbell 10 pounds more than your previous personal record.,
When cycling:


Be patient and gradually increase resistance.,
When at the final stages of a cycle where if your personal best v-us was 50 repetitions and your are in that range:


Be aware to the tempo you will be using.,
When at the final few workouts of a cycle:


Keep blanket or jacket, to immediately cover yourself with after doing your v-ups.",How to Take It to the Limit," The V-up abdominal exercise will be used for this article.
Use cycling. Cycling is a methodical building of strength over time. Investigate this technique.
Have excellent technique.
In your long term plan, schedule your other exercise and lifts in the short term and long term based on your ultimate goal. For example, with a split routine do your v-ups on a different day that you do cardio because cardio work stresses the abdominals.;
, At the beginning of a cycle add a repetition or two at each workout. Toward the end of a cycle add just a repetition, a half repetition or repeat the previous workout's repetition.
As your crunch cycle progresses, reduce the intensity or workload of your other lifts and exercises if your final goal is important.
From the middle to final stages of your cycle: keep your abdominal area warm at all times and maintain your stretching program.
When sleeping, in a v-ups cycling regime, sleep more on your side and face down because sleeping on your back results in a constant slight tension on your abdominals. For sleeping on your side, have a pillow for your head, between your knees and to hug. Wear an additional tank top type of clothing to warm your trunk area.

,
Consider scheduling your v-up as a final exercise in your workout and in your workout do exercises that do not stress your abdominals.
Breathe evenly, concentrate, and go over technique (this is important when doing multi-joint exercises).
Stay calm and breathe evenly and deeply.
Do a cobra stretch after doing your v-ups. In you are cycling a different body part, stretch that body part after exercising it to reduce the tension.
Continue to keep your muscles warm after the workout and for a couple days after.
Increase the time between workouts to as infrequently as once every three weeks.

,
Be prepared to take a warm/hot shower immediately after doing your v-ups.
Do the cobra stretch immediately after.

Build up repetitions and resistance over a long period of time.,
Within a workout session and especially with the posterior neck exercise, build up resistance.",How to Strengthen Posterior Neck Muscles," Do this once a week or two, but regularly. If you are upright, these exercises will not strengthen your neck muscles much. You could tense your neck muscles while do these exercises and have a strengthening effect.;
, Lift your head an inch up when doing this. This exercise can be done at the edge of the bed and with your head in line with your body. For a change in routine, do the isometric version which has no head movement, merely lift your head up an inch when horizontal for 20 seconds or so. Doing this exercise with movement, besides using a little more muscle, measures effort by repetitions. When twisting your head, turning to the left then right would be a repetition, and as suggested do this fro 15 repetitions. Tilting your head can be done as well.

, Throughout this exercise, your head and body should be still. Repeat for another count of ten seconds. The posterior neck muscles are strong relative to the anterior neck muscles so the resistance from the body at the horizontal position whether lying or bending over is not enough, so this is where isometric resistance is useful.

, Add just one repetition at each workout. Isometric resistance is harder to gauge, still, work up to putting resistance on your posterior neck muscles within the workout and over a period of months (a year).

, If doing two sets of 10 seconds, make the first set at light resistance and the second set at medium resistance.

Perform bicep curl variations. After you do a set with a full range of motion, do half sets, where you start in the middle, go up, start in the middle, and go down. You will tone fast twitch and slow twitch fibers.
Switch your hands, so you do bicep curls with your hands pointing inward and dumbbells in a vertical position.
Do push ups. Get in a plank position. Do 3 sets of 10, with your arms in different positions. Place them at shoulder width (bicep), wider than shoulder width (chest) and less than shoulder width (triceps), to work different parts of your arms.
Perform rows. Bend your knees slightly, while your feet are hip width apart. Lean forward at a 45 degree angle. Push your arms out and pull your elbows back, pinching between your shoulder blades.
Do chest presses. Lay back on a bench, or choose a row position. You will be able to lift more while you lie on your back. Start with elbows back and even with your shoulders. Push until the weights meet in the middle and your arms are straight. Resist the weight back down.







, Holding a push up position for 1 to 2 minutes is called a plank. To keep a straight position, you must use muscles in your entire body, toning them in the process.

, (0.9 to 2.2kg) every 3 weeks. You should gradually increase your strength and notice more tone.

, Cardio is necessary to burn fat, so your strong muscle tone will show through.

, Do not set a pace and stay with it the entire time. Instead, do 30 second to 2 minute bursts of high intensity sprinting throughout your workout.

, Do several different workouts, such as running, swimming, biking and sports to work more muscles and burn more calories.

, You may burn more calories and fat when you are being instructed to work harder.

, Try to avoid ruts by jumping rope, running stairs, or hiking large hills. Difficult, high intensity sessions will reduce body fat faster.

Use the chest flye to build the front of the shoulder the pectorals and the biceps.,
Add the flye ball to your routine.,
Build your chest and shoulder strength with chest presses.,
Do shoulder stabilization exercises.",How to Strengthen Arms with a Stability Ball2," The chest flye helps build your pectorals, deltoids and biceps, while also providing a good stretch for your chest. This exercise also can help warm up your chest muscles before you do additional exercises to strengthen your chest and back.Start by sitting on your stability ball with a dumbbell in each hand. Your legs should be out in front of you with your feet about hip-width apart.
Roll forward on the ball until it is behind your shoulders and your knees are at right angles. Your body should be roughly parallel with the floor.
Press your weights together over your head, with your arms extended straight over your body towards the sky. Keep your elbows slightly bent. As you exhale, lower your arms in a slow and controlled manner until your palms are facing up. Take care not to simply let your arms drop – make sure you're actively controlling the motion.
Then inhale and lift the weights back to starting position. Do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise in one set.

, The flye ball exercise is another medicine ball exercise that you can do on a stability ball to build the strength in your chest and shoulders. You also can do this exercise using a dumbbell if you don't have a medicine ball available.Lie on your back with the stability ball, on your back with the stability ball underneath your shoulders and your head at the top center of the ball. Hold your medicine ball or dumbbell over your chest with both hands.
Make sure that your hips are lifted and your knees are at right angles with your feet pressed firmly against the floor. Your body should be roughly parallel with the floor. Then extend your arms over your head, so the medicine ball or dumbbell is directly over your shoulders.
Shift the ball or dumbbell to your left hand and leave your right arm extended overhead. Exhale, slowly lowering your left arm straight out to your side. Inhale and bring your arm slowly back to the center.
Switch the weight to your right hand and repeat the same exercise with your right arm, lowering it straight to your side as you keep your left arm extended overhead.
Do 10 repetitions of this exercise, or five on each side, to make one set. Build up until you are doing two to three sets.

, If you have difficulty with push-ups, you might want to start with chest presses, which work the same muscles but allow you to control the amount of weight more than you can with a push-up.Take one dumbbell in each hand and sit on your stability ball with your legs out in front of you and your feet about hip-width apart.
Slowly roll forward until your knees are at right angles and your body is roughly parallel to the floor, with your back flat and the stability ball under your shoulders and head.
Press the dumbbells upward until you are holding them straight over your shoulders. Your arms should be extended up straight, your palms toward your feet.
Exhale and lower the weights, opening your elbows until they form right angles at your sides. Your forearms should be straight up, roughly perpendicular with the floor.
Inhale and raise the weights back to the starting position in the center. Do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise to complete one set.
Incline chest presses, in which your hips are lower, will target and challenge your upper chest muscles more than regular chest presses., This exercise is an intermediate level exercise, so you may not want to add it to your routine until you have some experience on the stability ball and are confident of your overall strength.Start this exercise on all fours with the stability ball underneath your body. Your hands and feet should be flat on the floor. Make sure your hands are directly below your shoulders, then extend your legs until they are straight out behind you and your toes are on the floor. Stretch through your heels.
Try to keep your abdominals from touching the stability ball as you breathe, which will engage your core.
Walk yourself backwards with your hands until your feet are flat on the floor and your arms and chest are resting on the stability ball. Keep your shoulders pulled down and back, and your back neutral.
As you exhale, bring your arms slowly overhead. This is the ""I"" position, because when done correctly your body will look like a capital letter ""I."" Then inhale and bring your arms back down to your starting position.
On your next exhale, bring your arms up and out diagonally so that you're making a capital letter ""Y."" Inhale and bring your arms back down to the starting position.
Continue the same exercise while bringing your arms into the ""T"" and ""W"" positions. Take care not to crunch or shrug your shoulders. The whole series represents one repetition. Try to do three to five slow repetitions to build the strength in your back and shoulders.

Include planks to build strength for push-ups.,
Do push-ups on the stability ball.,
Advance your plank to a pike.",How to Strengthen Arms with a Stability Ball3," While planks primarily target your abdominal muscles, they also increase the strength of the muscles in your arms and chest, which prepares you to do other strength-training exercises that target your arms specifically.To start a plank with a stability ball, kneel behind the ball. Make sure your knees are about hip-width apart. Place your palms together on the top of the ball with your arms fully extended.
Roll the ball away from you until your forearms and elbows are resting on the top of the ball. Keep your legs straight so that your body forms a straight line from your shoulders down to your knees.
Breathe deeply and hold the plank position for several seconds or breaths. Then pull with your abs to roll backwards from the ball and return to starting position. Do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise to complete one set. You can build two to three sets into your workout as necessary.
You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by rising all the way to your toes rather than stopping at your knees. Reverse planks, in which you balance your feet on the ball rather than your elbows, are a slightly easier version.

, Make sure you have mastered regular push-ups before you try doing them on a stability ball. Push-ups are a good overall bodyweight exercise that will strengthen your arms as well as the muscles in your back and chest. The further down your shins you hold the stability ball, the more difficult the exercise will be.From a face-down position, place the ball under your shins and extend your body in front of it with your hands on the floor. You may want to have a partner help you get into the starting position.
Your hands should be a little more than shoulder-width apart. Slowly lift your body until your arms are straight. Then lower your chest, bending at the elbows.
Control the movement both when you are pushing down and when you are raising up. Avoid simply letting gravity control your movement as you lower your body.
If your shoulders are weak or you're recovering from a shoulder injury, then you should avoid doing push-ups.

, The pike is a more difficult exercise that primarily targets your abdominal muscles, but also engages your arms and chest to a significant degree. Use this exercise if planks are no longer challenging, or if you want some variety.To start this exercise, lay face-down on the ball, with the ball under your stomach and your hands on the floor. Your arms should be extended straight below your shoulders with your legs together.
Slowly walk forward with your hands until the ball is just under your thighs. Breathe deeply and tighten your abdominal muscles. Lift your hips up, keeping your knees straight, and roll the ball towards your hands in a slow, controlled motion.
In the finishing position, you will be in a modified handstand with your arms straight and your head, shoulders, and back aimed toward the floor as though you are diving into a pool. Your body comes to a point at your hips, with your arms straight behind you and the stability ball under your ankles and the tops of your feet.
To make the exercise safer and more accessible, reduce the range of motion on the hip lift so the final position looks like an upside down letter V.
Slowly roll the ball out until your body is flat to return to the starting position. If you're new to this exercise, you may want to start with only 5 repetitions in a set, working up to 10 or more reps.
Due to the danger of a head or neck injury, it's a good idea to have a spotter for this exercise, particularly if you've just started doing it.

Maintain a healthy weight.,
Use different yoga positions.,
Swim.,
Wear the correct bra size.One thing that will help your breasts be and look perkier is to have a good bra.,
Maintain good posture.,
Massage your breasts.,
Try hydrotherapy.,
Consider surgery.",How to Make Your Breasts Perkier2," Being overweight or yo-yo dieting (gaining, then losing, then gaining significant weight) can cause breasts to sag.When you gain a lot of weight, your breasts will stretch and grow heavier. If you then drop that weight, you will be left with excess skin that may cause your breasts to appear droopy. Maintaining a healthy weight and BMI can help prevent your breasts from sagging.

Breasts are more likely to sag if there is a higher ratio of fat to breast tissue. The denser your breasts — that is, the more breast tissue they have, as opposed to fat — the less likely they are to sag., Yoga can work to strengthen many parts of your body including your chest muscles. Consider taking a class to get a full-body work out. Otherwise, there are particular stretches you can try:


Bow pose:Lay on your stomach. Arch your back and place your arms behind your body. Pull up your legs so that your hands can grab your feet.
Cobra: lay on the floor on your stomach. Place your hands near your armpits, palms down, fingers pointing towards your toes. Gently raise your body so that your back arches. Your hips should stay on the floor. Hold the pose for five seconds., Swimming and especially doing the breast stroke can strengthen your chest muscles. Be sure to stretch before and after swimming. Swimming also will help your overall physical fitness, which will improve your appearance.

, Visit a department store or lingerie store to have a professional measure you. Many women wear incorrect bra sizes and that can lead to back pain too.


In comparison to bras with soft cups, underwire bras can give you extra support.

, Keep your shoulders back and do not slouch. This will not cure drooping, but hunching can make your breasts look heavier and droopier than they are. Do mirror checks to make sure you are standing straight., Use Vitamin E or shea butter to stimulate circulation in your breasts. This will also help the texture of your skin.Ayurvedic pomegranate breast oil is another option for firming purposes., While in the shower, wash your breasts first with warm water for one half minute. Then douse them in cold water for ten seconds. Repeat this process for a few minutes. End with cold water.This method can improve your blood circulation, which may improve your elastin and collagen levels., If you are not happy with your breasts, you can get a breast lift. There a number of different methods a surgeon may use, depending on your existing breast tissue and how much skin needs to be removed. Interview several different surgeons before making a choice. Find out how often the surgeon performs breast lifts, ask to see before and after photos, and how many procedures the doctor has performed. Make sure the surgeon you choose is board certified and the surgery will be performed in an accredited facility.Be aware that surgery may cause scarring or loss of sensation in your breasts.

Be patient.",How to Tighten Stomach Skin2," More water can increase your skin’s elasticity and smoothness. This likely won’t improve the appearance of a lot of loose stomach skin, but it can help if you have some slightly saggy skin., Certain protein-rich foods, like cottage cheese, milk, fish, beans, and nuts – contain collagen. They can also help your skin form elastin. Both elastin and collagen can tighten up your skin’s appearance.If you do go out in the sun, make sure your take a shower shortly after and apply a moisturizer to your skin.

Talk to your doctor.,
Know the risks.,
Prepare your body for the procedure.,
Take care of yourself post-surgery.,
Try non-invasive procedures.",How to Tighten Stomach Skin3," Before you decide to go through with a tummy tuck, talk to your doctor. You should go over your full medical history and bring any medications you are taking. If you want the tummy tuck because you lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time, be prepared to talk about your weight loss with your doctor.You should also tell your doctor what you want to look like after the procedure so they can best advise you.
If your doctor can't do the procedure, ask them to refer you to a doctor who can. This is a great way to find a good doctor without having to rely on things like online reviews.

, Because a tummy tuck is a surgery, it has some typical surgery risks: the incision can get infected and keep bleeding, or you could have a bad reaction to the anesthetic. There are also risks related directly to a tummy tuck, including scarring, fluid accumulation under your skin, or tissue necrosis, which is when tissue under your skin gets damaged or dies.Talk to your surgeon about your specific chance related to these risks.

, If you decide to go through with the tummy tuck, you'll need to do a few things to get ready. You should stop smoking, maintain your weight at the same level, and take any prep medications your doctor prescribes for you. You should also ask someone to be available to help you at home after your procedure., Your doctor will give you specific directions for taking care of your scar. You should also avoid moving or sitting in any way that will strain your scar for about six weeks. This usually means bending or twisting at the waist.

You'll also need regular check-ups with your doctor for a year after your procedure. Make sure you go to these appointments and mention any pain or uncomfortableness you experience., If going under the knife makes you nervous, there are other procedures you can try. In these types of procedures, your doctor will use lasers, radiofrequency waves, infrared light, or ultrasound waves. They all work by inflaming the collagen or elastin in your skin, making your skin look tighter.If you decide to go this route, make sure you see a doctor who has experience with this type of procedure.
Any of these procedures can feel quite painful, even after your doctor or nurse uses a topical anesthetic. Consider your tolerance for pain before you choose any of these procedures.
Non-surgical procedures are best if you only have a bit of loose skin - near your neck, for example. You probably won't get the results you want with a non-surgical procedure if you've got a lot of loose skin, especially around your stomach.

Do bench presses.,
Do weighted pushups.,
Do flyes.,
Do weighted dips.,
Do weighted crunches.,
Do planks.,
Do weighted leg lifts.,
Do bicycle crunches for your lower abs.",How to Get Pecs and Abs1," This is the best exercise you can do to start building up your chest.To do it, you'll need a weight bench and a barbell or some dumbbells. (At the gym, you can also use a bench press machine.) Select a weight you can lift 5 to 7 times before needing to rest. Don't worry if the weight seems low - that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that you lift enough to build your muscles, and that number is different for different people. You'll add more weight as you get stronger. However, in order to build a big chest, your goal should be to lift at least your bodyweight.Here's how to do a bench press:









Lie on your weight bench on your back, with your feet firmly planted on the floor.
Hold the barbell over your chest, with your hands spaced evenly apart.
Push the barbell toward the ceiling until your arms are straight.
Lower the bar until it touches your chest.
Repeat until you've lifted the weight 5 to 7 times.
Rest for a minute, then do 2 more sets.;
, Doing regular push ups with proper form and breathing techniques is one of the simplest, and best exercises you can do for your chest, but weighted pushups puts extra strain on your muscles that encourages them to break down, then build up stronger, but is not recommended for just starting out, as it could result in muscle tears and other injuries, that will only set you back from accomplishing your fitness goals. To do weighted pushups, strap on a weight to increase the weight of your torso. Do 3 sets of 15 pushups per workout. If you find it easy to do more than 15 at a time, add more weight.


You can also make the standard pushup tougher by doing rotating pushups and lifting dumbbells at the same time. Start in a regular pushup position, but instead of having your palms on the ground, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Lower your body to the floor, then push up up with one hand and raise the other toward the sky, rotating your body sideways as you do so. Lower it to the floor and push down again, then push up with the other hand and rotate in the other direction.

, Another great chest exercise is flyes, for which you'll need either a set of dumbbells or a cable station. This motion activates your pec muscles and helps break them down to build them back up. Since this movement is mechanically a little more difficult than the bench press, it's recommended that you use lighter weights.








Lie on your back grasping either your dumbbells or the cables (if you're using a cable station).
Extend your arms straight toward the ceiling.
Lower your hands to either side of your body, so that your arms are spread like eagles' wings.
Return to starting position, then repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 or so reps.

, You'll need two exercise benches. Try this exercise first without the weight and work your way up to doing it with weight added. Place your hands on one bench, and rest your crossed feet on the other. Your butt and thighs should be positioned over the gap between the benches. Once you have mastered the dip, you can begin to place a weight across your thighs. Make sure it's secure before you begin.Keeping your back straight, ""dip"" your torso and butt into the gap by lowering yourself with your arms. Bend your elbows and lower yourself so that your elbows align with your shoulders, pointing straight backward.
Straighten your arms to lift yourself back up.
Do 3 sets of 10 or so reps.

, Take this classic abs exercise up a notch by adding some weight. Crunches might be boring, but they're still one of the best ways to get your abs toned and cut. Make sure you're using the right form:









Lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet comfortably planted on the floor.
Hold a weight over your chest. Don't make it too heavy; you should be able to do about 12 - 15 crunches before stopping.
Use your ab muscles to lift your torso and head forward so that your shoulders lift from the floor. Don't lift your entire back off the floor; you could strain it, and lifting it doesn't give you any sort of advantage in terms of building abs.
Lower back to the floor, then repeat. Do 3 sets of 15 crunches.
Mix it up sometimes by doing side crunches; get in the same position you use for regular crunches, but crunch to one side or the other. This works out your obliques, the muscles on either side of your abs.

, This exercise engages all of your abdominal muscles at once, and no equipment is required. Make it part of every ab workout you do and you'll start seeing a difference. Here's how to do a plank:


Lie on the floor stomach-down, with your legs stretched straight.
Lift yourself up onto your forearms. Keep your elbows in a straight line with your shoulders, and point your fingers straight ahead.
Lift up onto your tiptoes, so that your legs and torso aren't touching the ground. Keep your back straight.
Hold the position for as long as you can - at least a minute. Tighten those ab muscles.
Relax on the floor, then repeat.
You can do side planks as well, to work out your obliques. Raise yourself up on just one forearm, turn your body sideways, and lift the other arm straight toward the ceiling. Hold the position, then repeat on the other side.

, Strap leg weights around your ankles before beginning this exercise. Lie on your back with your arms at your sides and your legs straight. Keeping your legs together and your back against the ground, lift your legs up until they reach a 90 degree angle with the floor. Make sure they're straight. Lower them back to the floor. Do 3 sets of 12 leg lifts.









You can use an exercise ball instead of leg weights; simply hold it between your feet when you lift your legs.

, Again, using some weights will make this exercise more effective. Lie on your back with your knees and your feet on the floor. Straighten your left leg, keeping the other one bent. Bring your left elbow to your right knee by twisting it across your body. Repeat with your right elbow and left knee.

, Pumping iron more than three days a week can lead to overtraining, which is perhaps worse for your muscles than not lifting at all. If you are a beginner, you should focus on compound exercises like push ups and pull ups which work your triceps and biceps rather than isolating your arms (3 days a week). If you are an advanced bodybuilder, you may wish to perform an intense arm workout once or twice a week.

Hold the bar with your palms up, arms shoulder length apart.
Slowly bend your elbows back, bringing the weight to your forehead.
Keeping your elbows parallel to your body, slowly extend your arms to raise the weight above your head.
Note that you can still do this with a single dumbbell. Simply hold the weight with both hands on end, so that the other end hangs down towards your forehead.;
, This machine has a cable, rope, or small horizontal bar hanging from the top. To use it, stand facing the rope with your feet slightly apart. Grab the cable or handle with your arms bent at 90-degrees, then:

Slowly curl your elbows back up until they are back to 90-degrees.
Keep your elbows by your ribs, not flaring out, throughout the motion.
To make this a bit harder, flair your wrists to the sides as you reach the bottom.

Slowly drop the weights back behind your head, bending only from the elbow.
Stop when the weights are roughly behind your neck.
Extend your arms back upwards to complete one rep.
Keep your elbows pointing forward the entire time., Sit upright with a dumbbell in both hands, making sure there is room behind you to freely move your arms. Bend at the waist until you are at a roughly 45-degree angle, keeping your spine straight as your bend.


Raise your elbows to your side at 90-degrees, as if you were doing a dip.
Extend the weights out behind you -- the motion is almost like a skier pushing off with their poles.
Slowly return the weights to your side., Set up for a normal bench press: feet on the ground, spine relaxed, a spotter in place. However, instead of grabbing the bar at shoulder width, try coming in to about nipple width apart.

Don’t lower the barbell quickly. Resist the weight as you slowly lower it to maximize the effectiveness of each rep.You can also do this exercise seated. The bar will come down to a rest at your thighs, which shrinks the range of motion to the area that pumps the greatest load on the biceps.;
, For standing dumbbell curls, you’ll assume the same stance as with a standing barbell curl, but the individual dumbbell in each hand allows you to work the arms either together or alternately. Generally speaking, you can lift more overall weight with a barbell, but you may find it easier to do more reps with dumbbells, especially when doing them alternately.









One of the biggest benefits to standing dumbbell curls is the additional grip variation. You can do so-called hammer curls with dumbbells. A hammer curl is when you have your palms facing your sides throughout the range of motion instead of facing out and coming up to face toward you as with a barbell motion.Yet another variation you can do with the hammer curl during your standing dumbbell curls is to extend the range of motion by bringing the dumbbell up across your chest at a 45-degree angle instead of directly up at shoulder width., This curl isolates the whole biceps. Sit down on a chair or bench with a dumbbell in one of your hands. Lean forward slightly and place your triceps (back of the arm) on the inside of your thigh. Inhale as your lower, and exhale as your bring it up to your shoulder.Then switch to other arm.









Ensure you avoid a swinging motion with your arm. Both the upward and downward movements should be slow and controlled to maximize the efficacy of each rep., Start by holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palm facing behind you and the top of your hand facing forward. Bring the dumbbell up toward your shoulder.At the top of the lift, the back of your hands will face up and your knuckles will face out away from you. This is a great exercise for both biceps and forearms.









You can just as easily do this exercise with a barbell as well., Preacher curls isolate the whole biceps. Start by taking a barbell or a pair of dumbbells and rest your arms on the preacher bench pad and press your chest against it. Curl the weight slowly, bringing it almost entirely to your shoulder before bringing it back down.








When using dumbbells to do preacher curls, you can add more variation and work different parts of the bicep by taking advantage of a hammer grip with your palms facing to the side rather than up in the starting position."

Talk to your doctor.,
Do 2-3 ab workouts each week.,
Aim for 2-3 cardio sessions a week.",How to Get 8 Pack Abs1," Before beginning any attempts to get 8 pack abs, you should consult a medical professional. This is especially important if you suffer from preexisting medical conditions like a heart condition or chronic back pain. Your doctor will help you figure out what types and intensities of abdominal exercises are right for you.;
, In order to get 8 pack abs, you will need to dedicate yourself to a workout regimen. Aim for 2-3 abdominal strengthening sessions each week. Each session can be anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes long. Make sure you take at least one rest day between ab workouts.Try fitting in your ab workouts after doing 30 minutes of cardio like spinning, running, or hiking.

, It is important that you are supplementing your abdominal workouts with cardio. This will help you burn calories and create a calorie deficit which will, in turn, help you burn body fat. Aim for 2-3 30 minute cardio sessions a week such as running, spinning, or Zumba."
"
Work your pecs and abs twice a week.,
Work out as hard as you can.,
Superset two or more exercises.,
Tense your abs when you work out your pecs.,
Add weight as you gain strength.,
Vary your exercises for your abdomen.,
Don't forget your other muscle groups.,
Do cardio sparingly.",How to Get Pecs and Abs2," Don't work out any one muscle group more than twice a week. Your muscles need time to rest and repair in between workout sessions - that's when they build and get stronger. You can work your pecs and abs on the same days, or alternate days. Either way will be just as effective.


Set a schedule for yourself so you never skip a workout. Committing to your workout regimen will increase your chances of success.

, When your aim is to build muscle, it's important to put your best effort into every workout. Do your best to complete each exercise using the proper form, and make every crunch, bench press or leg lift as high-intensity as possible. Anything less than your best effort isn't going to give you the results you want.









Your workout sessions should be about 30 minutes long. During that time, go all in - don't take a lot of long breaks. Maximize your time in the gym.
Do your reps quickly. Performing your exercises faster puts more stress on your muscles, resulting in faster growth.
Don't work out so hard that you end up injuring yourself. Your exercises will not be comfortable, but you shouldn't be in any kind of extreme pain. If you do feel excruciating pain, stop immediately.

, This means doing one type of exercise right after another without a break in between. Supersets make your muscles work harder, and can be an effective way to build muscle fast. For example, immediately follow your bench press with a few sets of pushups.








, This is called bracing your core. When lifting heavy weights you should always tighten your abdomen to avoid back injury. This has two additional positive effects on your workout. First, you end up strengthening your abs as you work out your pecs. Second, tensing your core will give you a lot more power during your pecs exercises. This will help you see results much faster than if you don't pay attention to your abs during your pecs workouts.

, You'll end up plateauing if you don't. Once you find you're able to easily bench a certain weight for more than 10 reps, it's time to add more weight. Same goes for all the other weighted exercises - when you can lift more than the recommended amount of reps without feeling the burn, add weight to keep the pressure on your muscles to continue building.


Don't be tempted to add more weight than you can handle. You could injure yourself - completely negating all your hard efforts - if you try to lift too much. If a certain amount of weight is too heavy to lift more than 5 times before giving out, you're lifting too much.

, your muscles could get bored of doing crunches and start to plateau. Do new exercises to work your abs at every possible spot. For instance, you could do the wood chop, plank and reverse crunch for one week, and knees up crunches, Russian twists and side planks the other week.








, Working out your entire body is key when you're trying to build muscle. If you neglect your legs, back and arms, your pecs and abs won't get as strong. Plus, you don't want to have a really muscular upper body with really skinny legs.









It is very important to balance chest work with back work to prevent muscle imbalances, a rounded chest, or spinal misalignment. Lat pull downs, chin-ups, superman exercises, and rows are all good exercises to work your back as well.

, Perform cardiovascular exercise, like running, biking and swimming, no more than a few times a week. Your body needs to burn fat so that your abs will be visible, and cardio will help with full-body weight loss. However, doing too much cardio will use up the energy that you need to spend on building your muscles. Doing cardio no more than a couple times a week is best.









The minimum amount of recommended cardio is 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio exercise a week.

Eat lots of protein.,
Eat a lot of calories.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Sleep well.",How to Get Pecs and Abs3," Protein is the main muscle builder in your food, so eat plenty, but not so much that you cut out carbohydrates, fat and other body fuels. Protein should be the foundation of each of your meals when you're trying to build muscle.


Choose hormone-free meat whenever possible.
Eat lean beef, chicken, pork, fish, and other healthy protein sources, like eggs and tofu.
Protein supplements, like creatine, can help muscle building as well.

, When your goal is to get bigger pecs and abs, you need a lot of fuel. That means eating five meals a day, not three, while you're in intense workout mode. You'll probably find it easy to eat this much when you're working out all the time. Be sure to stock up on healthy food so you never end up going hungry.


Don't eat a lot of empty calories from refined carbohydrates, sugar and trans fats. Stay away from snack food and fast food.
Instead, eat wholesome, high-calorie foods that fill you up and nourish your body. Get plenty of fruits and vegetables with every meal. Eat beans, brown rice, yogurt, whole grains, nuts, avocados, olive oil, and other nutritious foods.

, It's important to stay hydrated when you're working out and eating a lot of calories. Aim for 10 glasses of water a day, rather than the commonly recommended 8.

, Resting is just as important as working out when it comes to building muscle. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night, and on your rest days, do no more than a light walk, jog or another low-intensity activity.

Perform dips, either on a set of bars or a raised ledge.,
Try close-armed or diamond pushups.,
Try out some L-sits to work your triceps and core simultaneously.,
Try triceps extensions on a horizontal bar or surface.,
Give handstand push-ups a shot to really shred your triceps.",How to Get Ripped Triceps2," Classically, dips are between parallel bars, where you lower yourself down until your elbows are at 90-degrees, arms parallel to the bars. You then push your hold body back out until your arms are straight, then repeat. But you can still do these triceps crushers even if you're without bars:Find a sturdy table, ledge, chair, or stair step that comes up to roughly thigh level.
Facing away from the ledge, use your hands to lower yourself to a ""seated"" position, as if there was an invisible chair in front of your object.
Lower your but to the floor, keeping your elbows straight behind you.
Push back up to the ""seated"" position.
Repeat for 15-20 reps, doing three sets., The closer you move your arms together on a push-up, the more it will engage your triceps. The ultimate exercise, then, becomes diamond push-ups. To do them, simply use your thumbs and index fingers to form a diamond shape under your chest, entering otherwise normal push-up position:


Lower yourself slowly to the ground.
Spring back up to the point just before your elbows lock out.
Keep your neck and spine straight, not curved or hunched.

, This is a holding exercise, meaning you don't do reps, you simply hold the position, often timing out ""sets"" as 30-90 seconds of holding. L-sits are basically modified dips, but you can perform them on the floor or a set of parallel bars.


Pick yourself up by extending your arms straight down at your sides and pushing up.
Stick your legs in front of you, forming an enormous L with your body.
Keep your arms straight and strong as you hold your body above the ground of the bars.
If you're struggling, rest your legs on something to keep them up while you work out your arms.

, You'll need a bar at about stomach height, the lower it is, the harder the exercise will be. These exercises work best if you keep your elbows in towards your ears and focus on using your triceps:


Hold the bar with your hands 4-5 inches apart, palms down.
Place your feet together behind you, making a straight diagonal line from the bar to your toes.
Pull your head under the bar, bending your elbows in to do so.
Using your triceps, extend your arms straight back to ""push"" your body up and away from the bar., These take a ton of strength just to start, let alone complete, and are a great goal to set if you're just starting out. Even a few reps will seriously tire you out, and it supports a strong back and core as well. To perform them:


Crouch with your back against a sturdy wall, palms on the ground in front of you.
Use your feet to ""walk"" up the wall, entering a supported handstand.

You may need a spotter or assistant to help you gain your balance the first few times.


Lower yourself until the top of your head is almost touching the ground.
Push back up until your arms are almost completely extended, but your elbows aren't locked.
Repeat motion, walking your feet back to your hands to disembark."
"
Warm up before lifting or working out.,
Give two days rest between hard days on the triceps.,
Eat a meal high in lean protein shortly after working out.,
Use compound exercises that involve your triceps on off-days, or to develop great triceps without necessarily focusing on them.,
Vary the exercises that you do instead of sticking to the same 2-3 every week.,
Add weight slowly, aiming to keep the last 3-4 reps over every single exercise difficult.",How to Get Ripped Triceps3," You want to get the blood pumping and get your arms loose. Starting out on heavy weights can cause serious injury to your arm. Warm up before each exercise. Perform the same motion as your exercise, but use 30% of your maximum weight, aiming for smooth, easy motions.


Swing your arms, individually, in circles at your sides. Start with small circles, then gradually swing your entire arm.
Jog or use the elliptical for 5-10 minutes. Even if the machine doesn't use your arms, this elevates your heart-rate and prepares your body to exercise.

, Working out your triceps every day will paradoxically slow down your muscle growth. When you work out, you're stretching and ripping muscle fibers. The ""growth"" of your muscles is when they repair themselves, building up stronger than before. But if you never give your muscles time to actually repair and get stronger you won't get ripped triceps -- you'll rip your triceps!


This doesn't mean you don't work out on off days, just that you focus on muscles other than your triceps.

, Your muscles are made of protein, so it makes sense that your body needs protein to repair and strengthen muscles after a workout. Chicken, eggs, turkey, beans, chocolate milk, peanut butter, tuna, and protein shakes are some of the most common post-workout fuels, as they have enough protein to satisfy your body without being overly rich or fatty.


Be sure to drink plenty of water with your meal and keep drinking throughout the day as well.
Eating protein doesn't mean an all-protein diet. A chicken breast or can of tuna with a sandwich or pasta, a piece of fruit, and some water is a wonderful, simple meal to refuel.

, The triceps are smaller muscles that are naturally incorporated into a variety of other exercises. This means you can often work on your triceps without focusing strictly on them, making them a part of a more full-body workout. Exercises include:


Bench press (all forms)
Push-ups
Pull-ups (palms facing away from you)
Weighted Dips
Military Press
Wide-armed Row, While all of these exercises do target your triceps, it doesn't mean that they all do so equally. Different grips, exercises, and weights will all strengthen other ligaments, small muscles, and parts of your triceps (they are a collection of three muscles, after all) to get a healthier, more even tone to your outer arms.


Find the 4-5 exercises above you like the most and rotate through them, only doing 2-3 each time.

, Difficulty is how you know you're actually building muscle. The last few reps of every set should be challenging but doable, making you dig a little deeper to get the weight up or finish the set. You shouldn't be in pain, but you should be pushing yourself. Instead of artificially picking weights or raising the weight on a schedule, let your body dictate how you proceed.

Do drag curls.,
Do chin-ups.,
Do one-arm hammer rows.",How to Get Better Biceps2," In a standing barbell curl position, slide the bar upward against your body until it reaches your mid-chest level, which is about at high as you’ll be able to lift it while keeping the bar in contact with your torso. Then lower the bar the same way, making sure it does not lose contact with your torso.Your elbows will move backward and your shoulders cannot assist in the movement.








, Chin ups work the back and biceps. To maximize the load on your biceps with each rep, start at a dead hang with your palms roughly six inches apart on the bar, and then lift past just your chin so that your upper chest comes in contact with the bar.The additional range of motion when lifting all the way to your chest increases the demand on your biceps.









Though harder with chin-ups, lowering yourself slowly back down to a dead hang versus letting gravity pull you back down will increase the effectiveness of each rep.

, This exercise is essentially a dumbbell hammer curl from a row position. To perform, place your right knee on a flat bench with your left foot firmly on the ground to the side. Lean over so that your back is both straight and parallel to the floor. Then brace with your right hand against the bench. Lift the dumbbell with your left hand in the hammer position (with your palm facing toward your body). Initially let your arm hang straight down, and then simultaneously bring your arm up at the elbow as you also curl the dumbbell toward your pecks before lowering it again.Switch position to work the other arm.









This position should allow you to lift more weight than with a standard hammer curl because you also place a lot of the demand on your upper back muscles."

Reduce your intake of simple carbohydrates.,
Increase protein intake.,
Keep the calories coming.,
Focus on brachialis workouts.,
Extend the length of each rep fully.,
Use a narrower grip.,
Use a wider grip.",How to Get Better Biceps3," In addition to building those strong biceps, you probably want to maximize the appearance and definition on them as well. Many of the steps you’ll take to maximize biceps definition will occur outside of the gym but in coordination with your biceps-building routine. Start by cutting simple carbs out of your diet.You should decrease carbs to roughly 30% of your daily caloric intake, and 85% of the carbs you do eat should come from fruits and vegetables with the remainder coming from complex carbohydrates., If you want to build muscle while losing fat in order to maximize biceps definition, then you should really be upping your protein intake. Protein should make up about 40% of your daily caloric intake., One of the biggest mistakes people can make when looking to build muscle is to restrict calorie intake. No matter how hard you work those muscles, they’ll waste away if you don’t have the proper balance of caloric intake to help build the muscle fiber., When it comes to creating a mountain-like peak on one’s biceps as opposed to a football-shaped curve, genetics plays a huge part; however, exercises that work the brachialis and brachioradialis can actually push biceps higher to give them a more mountain-like appearance.Many of the exercises that work these muscles have already been explained above, including hammer curls, reverse curls, and preacher curls.To maximize the effectiveness of these peak-building exercises, make sure you keep your elbows locked at your sides and your wrists straight during the repetitions.The key peak-building portion of a curl comes at the end of the range of motion when the forearm is closest to the upper arm. You can additionally work on biceps peak by focusing on the upper half or the rep, especially by squeezing the muscles hard as you reach the top of the movement., If biceps length—the length from your elbow to your shoulder—is what you want, then you want to focus on the beginning of each rep as opposed to the apex, which is what builds a biceps’ peak. Put extra effort into slowly raising the weight at the beginning of each rep and also slowly lowering the weight as your arms reach the bottom again. One of the best ways to build biceps length is to resist inertia as much as possible as you fully extend each rep.







, The long head of the biceps, which is the portion at the top of the biceps farther away from the body, can actually be worked harder than the short head of the biceps—or the lower portion closer to the arm. To specifically target the long head of your biceps, use a narrower grip with your hands only a few inches apart when doing barbell curls.








If you strongly prefer using dumbbells, you can still target the long head of your biceps by curling across your chest at 45-degree angles—bringing the dumbbell up and across to the opposite shoulder—instead of simply bringing it up in a straight line.

, Using a wide barbell grip—even farther than shoulder-width especially—or curling dumbbells far away from the body will help you build the short head portion of the biceps. However, since even a standard shoulder-width grip works the short head of the biceps more than the long head, most people will start with this portion of the biceps already more developed than other portions.

Use a bench for crunches.",How to Get 8 Pack Abs2," Crunches can firm and strengthen your abdominal muscles, and help you get the 8 pack of your dreams. Lie with your back on the floor, knees bent, and feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest and lift your shoulders toward the ceiling using your abdominal muscles.Repeat the crunch 15-20 times, and then do a second set of traditional crunches.

, Prepare as though you were going to do a traditional crunch. Instead of lifting both shoulders off the ground at the same time, lift one shoulder at a time toward the opposite knee. Alternate sides until you complete the crunches.Do two sets of 15-20 crunches each.

, You can mix up your crunches by taking advantage of a flat bench at the gym or in your own home. Lie on the floor and put your legs up on the bench so that the backs of your knees are nearly touching the bench’s edge. With your hands behind your ears, crunch forward.Complete two sets of 15-20 bench crunches.

, Next you will need to place your hands on both sides of your head. Grab the top edge of the bench with your hands. You will continue holding on to the top of the bench while you do the leg raises.If you are lying on the floor, keep your hands beside your hips.

, While keeping your legs as straight as you can, use your abdominal muscles to slowly raise your legs. Raise your legs as high as is possible, while making sure your back is completely flat on the bench. Slowly lower your legs down to the start position.Repeat 20 times, and then do a second set of 20 leg raises.

Throughout the day make sure you are consuming water regularly, aiming for at least 64 ounces each day., Nutrition is an important part of getting 8 pack abs. Make sure your diet includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.


Try to get at least 20% of your calories from high quality protein sources like fish, poultry, grass fed beef, or organic soy.
Stay away from fried and processed foods.

, Aim for a breakfast that contains at least 250 calories but ideally no more than 500 calories. Try to eat within an hour of waking up each morning. Great breakfast options include Greek yogurt with berries and granola, scrambled eggs with fruit and whole wheat toast, or oatmeal with a scoop of why protein., Drinking alcohol can slow down your metabolic process, which can make it difficult to strip away the fat covering your 8 pack. Alcohol can also increase your appetite, which can lead to consuming more calories than you are burning."

Vary your grip.",How to Floor Press," A floor press should begin with you lying on your back under the bar. Ideally, you should be set up so that your eyes are underneath the bar. Too far forward or back could lead to injury or pressing your bar into the rack.The exact position varies for each person. Get a feel for what is comfortable for you. You want to be in a place where you’re not pressing into the rack, and stable enough to unrack. Remember to always have a spotter to help keep you safe.;
, Some people prefer to perform a floor press with their legs extended straight, but most beginners feel more comfortable starting with their knees bent. Bend your knees enough that you are able to place your feet flat on the floor. This helps provide some stability as you learn the exercise., Start by grabbing the barbell with your hands shoulder width apart. Once you’re comfortable with the exercise you may choose to use wider or more narrow grips to activate the muscles in different ways, but a standard grip will allow you to learn proper form while you are still mastering the exercise.Once you have a firm grip on the barbell, push yourself down into the ground. This will lock your shoulders in and give you stability to unrack., The safest way to unrack your barbell is to have someone help you lift off. You want to avoid pressing up to clear the rack, since this will unlock your shoulders and compromise your upper body stability. Pull the bar out from the rack to a position where it is hovering over your lower chest., Before you lower the bar, take a couple of seconds to make sure you are stable. Avoid bringing the barbell down until you know you can do so in a controlled fashion. If you feel yourself struggling or failing, let your spotter know.

, Once you have the bar stable, lower it in a controlled motion down over the lower part of your chest. Tuck your elbows and bring the bar down until your upper arms touch the ground. Pause here, and try to keep the weights from slamming or bouncing., With your elbows tucked, press the bar up with as much controlled force as you can. Keep your wrists aligned with your elbow, and try to finish the press in the exact position in which you started it., Repeat this motion for as many reps as you have planned for your workout that day. Remember that early on you should aim to build good form and muscle memory. Try starting with one to two sets of five to eight reps each.

, Instead of using a barbell, you can use dumbbells to do a floor press. Dumbbell floor presses utilize largely the same motion, but begin with your upper arms by your side and your elbows at a 45 degree angle with dumbbells in hand. Press up from this start position, and perform the floor press the same as you would with a barbell., One of the benefits of the floor press is that it takes away much of the ability to drive with your legs that occurs during bench presses. Once you have become comfortable with the floor press motion, you can reduce this drive further by extending your legs out straight in front of you., Once you have become comfortable with the standard barbell floor press, try varying your grip to change the way in which you work your muscles. Bring your hands in a little toward the center of your body for a more narrow grip, or set them a bit wider than the shoulders for a wide grip.Only vary the position slightly. Too tight or too wide a grip could make performing the exercise unnecessarily dangerous.

",How to Eat to Get a 6 Pack," This menu will provide fiber, antioxidants, protein, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats with minimal calories.


Make your own oatmeal to avoid the added sugar and salt from pre-flavored packs, sweetening with honey or brown sugar and topping with fresh fruit, a tablespoon of nuts or seeds, and/or ground cinnamon or nutmeg.
Use whole grain bread and vegetables (preferably with no mayonnaise) for the sandwich and consider vegetables like celery, red peppers, carrot sticks, or cucumbers. If you prefer to have a dip for the vegetables, opt for lentil hummus or homemade white bean dip instead of salad dressing or sour cream dip.
For dinner, add as many fresh vegetable variations to the stir-fry as you like, but do not increase the recommended amount of oil. Season with spices like fresh herbs and chillies to add flavor and eliminate the salt. Substitute whole grain noodles or brown rice for traditional processed starches.

, This menu will provide plenty of protein, carbohydrates, healthy fat, fiber, and vitamins and minerals to help give you enough energy to keep performing well during your workouts. Add a glass of low-fat milk to lunch or dinner to help your muscles heal from your ab routine.

Use fresh instead of dried fruit in your muesli (they’re filled with more air and water to give you the illusion of being fuller faster), low fat milk or yogurt (healthy fats are essential – you don’t need to cut them out completely), and do not exceed a quarter cup of nuts or seeds in the recipe.
Add additional fresh vegetables to the spinach salad if desired and use a vinegar and oil or fruit juice based dressing. If you want a richer dressing, add some Dijon mustard or turmeric powder to it.
Glaze the salmon fillet with fruit juice or olive oil and sprinkle with herbs before serving with brown rice and roasted or grilled vegetables such as zucchini, tomatoes, or eggplant.

, Use no more than one tablespoon of olive oil or vegetable oil for each recipe and buy low-fat cheese to avoid unnecessary saturated fat. This combination of meals will provide tons of nutrients with very few calories, and supplies the appropriate amount of fat for the lean diet you need.


Try a variety of vegetables in the omelet such as asparagus, tomato, and mushrooms, and serve with a side of fresh berries, half a grapefruit or a quarter of a pomelo.
For the lentil soup, add extra vegetables, such as mashed carrots or tomatoes, and top with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of fat-free sour cream instead of cheese.

, This menu is packed with protein, a few carbohydrates to supply energy, a healthy amount of essential fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.

If you would like to add cereal to your parfait, select a brand with no added sugar and made with whole grains. If you want to boost your protein intake, substitute plain yogurt for unsweetened, fat-free Greek yogurt.
Avoid using mayonnaise in your tuna salad by swapping in homemade vinaigrette and adding red onion, low-sodium pickle juice and a handful of fresh dill.
When making skewers, limit your meat to 3 oz. for women, and 4 oz. for men per serving. Fill up on vegetables, such as bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and zucchini.

Top the baked potato with powdered ginger and cinnamon, low-fat sour cream and pepper, or caramelized onions and garlic in a balsamic vinegar reduction.

, After a long week of hard work, it can be tempting to binge on restaurant foods, snacks, and sweets.;
, On rest days, it’s more important than ever to load up on vegetables and lean protein.

Grab the bar.,
Engage your core.,
Swing your legs up.,
Drop back down.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Do Toes to Bar1," Place your hands on the bar so that they are just slightly wider than shoulder width. Make sure your fingers and thumbs wrap around the bar for a secure grip.If your hands line up too precisely with your feet, you may accidentally kick your hands during the toes-to-bar, weakening your grip as a result.
Another reason for keeping your grip at or beyond shoulder width is to minimize the distance you'll need to swing during the toes-to-bar. Keeping your hands close together will cause the body to extend further down, increasing the distance your legs will need to travel and making the exercise more difficult in the process.;
, Squeeze your abdominal muscles and the muscles in your buttocks. Your body should be flexible but fairly rigid.Your legs should be straight and your feet should be just barely in front of your torso. The toes of your feet should point downward.
If your core muscles aren't tight, you'll end up relying on your arms to support your torso and lift your legs, making the exercise nearly impossible to complete.

, Lean back a little while lifting both legs simultaneously straight forward and up. Continue lifting your legs until your toes touch the bar.


Swing your legs at the hip. Your hips should do the majority of the work, and your shoulders should move very little, if at all.Your arms and legs should remain completely straight during a strict toes-to-bar. Ideally, your motions should involve very little swinging.
If your legs do not swing up together, your coordination will be thrown off and you won't be able to complete the motion effectively.

, Gradually ease your legs back down into their resting position.


Control the descent. Do not drop your legs down too quickly since doing so can cause your body to swing and may disrupt your balance.
Your arms and legs should still remain straight as you swing your legs down.

, Do as many repetitions as desired for your workout. Pause and rest for about five seconds in between each repetition.


When you're first learning the exercise, it is a good idea to work in small sets. Doing so allows you to perfect your form and avoid developing bad habits.Strict toes-to-bar are difficult to cycle through quickly. Attempting to rush through them can wear you out and may cause muscle injury, so take your time and work at a comfortable pace.
Note that strict toes-to-bar also demands a significant amount of flexibility in the hips and hamstrings, making them more difficult for many people to complete.
Your grip may loosen in the middle of your workout. If this happens, wait until your legs point downward again, then let go of the bar. Pause for a few moments to reset. You can then grab the bar again and continue the exercise as before.

Grab the bar.,
Straighten out and engage the core.,
Swing back.,
Build up momentum through kipping.,
Lift into a knees-to-elbow.,
Kick into a toes-to-bar position.,
Drop your legs straight down.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Do Toes to Bar2," Grab the bar with both hands, keeping your hands shoulder width apart or just beyond shoulder width apart. Wrap your fingers and thumbs securely around the bar.


Make sure that your hands aren't perfectly aligned with your feet. If they are, you may end up weakening your grip by kicking your hands on the upswing.
If your hands are too close together, you will actually drop the body further down and increase the distance your legs need to travel during the exercise. This will make it harder to complete.

, Tighten the muscles in your abdomen and buttocks. Extend your body down into a controlled hollow, making it fairly rigid without sacrificing flexibility or causing strain.


Your toes should point downward and your feet should actually be positioned slightly in front of your torso.
The body should be gently bent into a hollow curve. Imagine yourself lying on the ground, face-up, with your hands and feet lifted off the floor and the small of your back pressed to the ground. That is the posture you will need to mimic while hanging from the bar.
Your core muscles must be engaged and tight. Your arms alone will not be enough to support your body as you attempt to kip and swing your legs up.

, Use your shoulder muscles to swing your torso and legs back. Essentially, you're shifting the hollow from the front of your body to the back.


Imagine yourself lying on the ground again. This time, you would be face-down with your hands and feet lifted off the floor and your stomach pressed to the ground. Your hips and shoulders would also be stretch behind your torso. This is the posture you will need to swing into while hanging from the bar.
As you swing back, try to get your hips behind the bar instead of keeping your hips beneath it. Doing so will help you build more momentum while decreasing the angle you will eventually need to lift from.
Move your legs simultaneously throughout the entire process. If you don't, your coordination and rhythm will be thrown off, making the exercise almost impossible to complete.

, Snap back and forth between the forward hollow and backward arch. This movement is called ""kipping,"" and you are using it to create a controlled swing.


A controlled swing creates momentum, and this momentum will make it easier to swing your toes toward the bar.
If you don't feel like you have any control during your kips, you are likely using your legs to swing instead of your shoulders. Focus on moving your chest back and forth during each swing., On the backward swing of your kip, begin lifting your legs, bending your knees slightly so that they meet your elbows.Press down on the bar with your hands and follow the motion of your body to draw your legs upward.
Your hips must be as far back behind the bar as possible as you begin lifting your legs. By swinging your legs up while you're at the top of your kip, you minimize the distance between your shoulder and the bar, thereby shortening the distance your feet will need to travel to reach the bar, as well.While your knees do not need to touch your elbows, it is helpful to draw them together during this exercise. If you skip this step and jump straight into a toes-to-bar, you can wear yourself out faster and cause muscle strain.

, From the bent knees-to-elbow position, extend your legs out straight until your toes hit the bar.


Make sure both legs extend out simultaneously during this step.

, As soon as your momentum no longer moves you toward the bar, begin your descent. To drop down, you need to extend your legs down in a controlled motion that is even with the vertical posts of the bar.


Do not kick your legs out. Doing so will waste energy and disrupt the rhythm of the kip.
A good way to prevent yourself from accidental injury is to essentially reverse the motion of your toes-to-bar. Tuck your legs in toward your chest before pulling them back down into their previous position.

, Work as many repetitions as desired for your workout. Continue kipping, and use the momentum to complete each consecutive toes-to-bar.


You should work in small sets while first learning the exercise so that you can perfect the motion and form. Focus on building good habits when you're starting out to avoid developing bad ones.
It is much easier to complete more repetitions at a faster pace with the kipping toes-to-bar than the strict toes-to-bar.
If your grip loosens in the middle of your routine, release the bar and drop down to your feet at the bottom of your downswing. Pause for a few moments before grabbing the bar again and picking back up where you left off.

Pick other exercises to compliment the triceps kickback.,
Create an exercise schedule.,
Understand safety when doing triceps kickbacks.",How to Do Triceps Kickbacks," Before starting, choose a hand you want to begin with. After choosing it, pick up the dumbbell. This is important, as this method of performing triceps kickbacks works only one arm at a time.


Start with your strong hand, so you can more confidently complete the motion.
Remember that you will switch hands at the end of the set.
Grip the weight firmly, but not too tight.
Consider using gloves, if you prefer.;
, After picking up the dumbbell, you need to situate yourself into a proper stance before beginning the movement.









The forward leg should be the opposite of the hand you are holding the dumbbell with.
Make sure both of your feet are firmly on the floor.
Use your core to brace yourself.
Place your same side hand on your forward leg (right hand on right leg)., By leaning forward, you’ll position your body for maximum effectiveness while working your triceps. This is important because it works the triceps against gravity.


Hinge forward at the hips.
Make sure most of your weight is being transferred onto the forward leg.
Move your shoulders down and back.
Align your head and your spine.
Hold this posture throughout the exercise.
You can also complete this exercise while leaning with one knee on a bench with the same side hand on the front of the bench., Take the arm that is holding the weight and bend it at your elbow. This movement will position you to begin the triceps kickback. Remember to:


Hold your upper arm so that it is parallel to your torso.
Make sure your forearm is vertical with the floor.
Move it slowly and firmly., By lifting your forearm back in an arcing motion, you’ll be making the basic motion of the triceps kickback. This motion is essentially half of the overall movement.









Exhale.
Push the forearms back to straighten your arm along the side of your torso.
Make sure your arm almost locks as you bring it back., Pivot at the elbow, holding your upper arm still while the forearm slowly lowers to the start position, bringing the dumbbell back towards the shoulder. This is important, because the second motion will return your arm to its starting position so you can complete another repetition.









Inhale.
Hold your core stationary.
Your upper arm should be stationary and be held close to your body., Resistance bands are a great way to do triceps kickbacks without weights. Ultimately, the resistance band will stand in for weights and allow you to do triceps kickbacks normally.









Stand on one end of the resistance band with both feet.
Hold the other end of the band in one hand.
Carry out the motions of the triceps kickbacks as if you had weight in your hand., Another variant of the triceps kickbacks is to kneel on a weight bench -- or similar piece of furniture -- instead of standing. To do the kneeling triceps kickback:









Kneel down on the bench with one knee (what would be your forward knee).
Keep the other foot on the ground.
Use one hand to grip the front of the bench and to support yourself.
Carry out the motions of the triceps kickbacks as if you were standing., You can also alter the regular triceps kickback by turning your wrists at the end of the movement so that your palms are facing upwards. This will give your wrists a stretch and intensify the movement.









To do this, when the dumbbell meets your hip, turn your palm upwards to face the ceiling.

, After mastering the triceps kickbacks, you need to decide how many repetitions you want to do when you work your triceps. Ultimately, you need to pick a number of reps that will help you toward your goal but not overextend you.









Do three sets of triceps kickbacks per workout session
Start with a lower number of reps until you are comfortable with the movement and the weight you are using. For instance, start by doing 3 reps for the first set, 4 reps for the second set, and 5 reps for the final set.
Increase the number of repetitions per set as you grow more confident. For instance, keep your first set as 3 reps, increase the second to 5 reps, and the third to 7 reps.
After you’re completely comfortable with the movement, settle on 3 sets of 8 repetitions., Triceps kickbacks are just one exercise that should be used in conjunction with other movements that work your arms. Some other exercises include:









The alternating bicep curl.
The palms-up wrist curl.
The palms-down wrist curl., Triceps kickbacks are just one element of what should be a balanced workout regimen that is geared toward improving your overall physique. Ultimately, you need to design a week-long schedule in which you work cardio and every major muscle group. One example might be the following:


Exercise your chest and triceps on Sunday. Complete triceps kickbacks and bicep curls here.
Work out your shoulders and abs on Monday. Do some shoulder presses and crunches.
Rest on Tuesday.
Complete leg exercises on Wednesday. Think about doing leg presses or leg curls.
Exercise your back and biceps on Thursday. Try dumbbell shrugs or use a rowing machine.
Rest on Friday.
Do some cardio on Saturday. Think about running, swimming, or cycling., While triceps kickbacks are relatively simple, you should educate yourself about common dangers associated with the exercise. Without knowing about common problems, you may injure yourself.


Avoid using too much weight. Don’t use more weight than you are comfortable. For instance, you should start with weight that does not strain you such as 5, 10, or 15 lbs. (2.27, 4.54, or 6.8 kg.).
Don’t just do triceps kickbacks. Triceps exercises should be completed in conjunction with other movements that help work out nearby muscle groups. Consider doing compound movements like the deadlift or bench press to work nearby muscles.
The most common injury associated with triceps kickbacks are rotator cuff problems. The rotator cuff is located where the arm connects with the shoulder. If you have pain in that area, discontinue the exercise and consult a physician.
Know that there are criticisms of triceps kickbacks. Some experts argue that the exercise does not enable you to leverage enough weight on your muscle, making it an inefficient exercise. Other experts argue that it puts potentially harmful stress on your shoulder."

Determine if you are making progress.",How to Do Shoulder Presses," Situating yourself properly before beginning a shoulder press is extremely important in executing a proper and effective press.









Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart – or even a little bit more.
Prepare to inhale deeply as you pick up and complete the shoulder press.;
, The way you pick up the bar will set you up for how you conduct your shoulder presses. Thus, you need to pick the bar up purposefully and with force. Make sure to:









Inhale deeply.
Gripping the bar overhand, slowly lift the bar from the rack, or carefully squat lift the bar from the floor up to shoulder height.
Have your thumbs wrapped around the bar.
Rest the bar on the heel of your palm.
If you have a bar rack, you can set it on the rack and pick it up from there.
When the bar is at shoulder height, your hands should be a full shoulder width apart on the bar, and your forearms should be vertical to your body.
After picking up the bar, your arms should be bent at less than a 90-degree angle., Without rolling your shoulders back and positioning your arms, you won’t be able to properly execute the shoulder press. Make sure to:









Lean back slightly.
Squeeze or roll your shoulder blades together as your arms (now bent less than 90 degrees) contract even more.
Allow your elbows to slightly protrude in front of the bar. They should not be far out or behind the bar.
Extend your chest outward.
Brace your core muscles and keep your back straight., The single most important movement in a shoulder press is the upward motion. Without a measured upward motion, you could hurt yourself or achieve little progress toward your fitness goal.









Bend your head backward, slightly.
Push the bar up gently, and allow your arms to slowly straighten as you complete the movement.
After the bar is over your head, push it backward slightly. At this point, it should be aligned vertically with your head.Make sure that you start out with a light bar that you can easily lift above your head and gradually increase the weight as you gain strength. Otherwise, this exercise may lead to injuries.

, Once the bar is vertically aligned with your head, you need to hold it for just a second. Holding the bar will push you and is the key to strength training with a shoulder press.


Wait till the bar is at the top.
When the bar is at the top, shrug your shoulders a little and allow your elbows to lock.
Allow yourself to exhale fully., After holding the bar, you’ll have to bring it back down gently. If you rush this move, you may hurt yourself. Remember to:









Begin a slow inhale.
Make sure to bend your arms as you bring the bar down.
Repeat the movement your desired number of repetitions., The proper number of repetitions makes sure that you’re working toward your weight-training goals without taxing or injuring your body. When determining how many shoulder press reps you should do, consider:









Starting off with 3 sets of repetitions. Start low. For instance, do 3, 4, and then 5 reps.
Increasing the number of reps per set as you grow stronger and more confident. For instance, do 3, 5, and then 7 reps.
If you choose to lift a lower weight, feel free to increase your reps per set.Always start with a weight that is easy to moderate for you. Gradually increase the weight as you practice the move, develop muscle memory, and allow your connective tissues time to get stronger.

, A balanced training routine will make sure that you meet your weight-training goals in a healthy and effective way. Without a balanced routine, you won’t work out all the muscles that compliment your shoulders and upper body. Consider:









Working out your chest and triceps on Monday. Try pushups or bench presses.
Working out your shoulders and abs on Tuesday. Combine your shoulder presses with crunches or work on an ab machine.
Resting on Wednesday.
Working out your legs on Thursday. Try leg presses or leg curls.
Working out your back and biceps on Friday. Try dumbbell shrugs or rowing.
Cardio training on Saturday and Sunday. Think about running, powerwalking, cycling, or swimming., While shoulder presses may be the centerpiece of your workout routine, you should reserve some time for cardio. Without cardio, you won’t build the healthy physique you want.









If you’re working out for fat loss, you should balance your shoulder presses with a cardio workout 3 to 6 times a week.
If you’re doing high intensity training, balance your shoulder presses with a cardio workout 2 to 3 times a week.
If you’re simply weight training, balance your shoulder presses with cardio 3 times per week.
A cardio workout should be at least 30 minutes per session., Because shoulder presses are a demanding and high intensity exercise, you need to be very careful as to avoid injury. Make sure to:









Avoid super wide grips. The wider your grip, the less range of motion you have. This provides for a bigger chance of shoulder injury.
Never flare your elbows out, pointing away from your body. Instead, keep your elbows close to your sides.
Be careful bending down to pick up the bar. Instead, squat down and carefully stand up with the bar., The amount of weight you use when performing shoulder presses will determine the speed and type of progress you make toward your overall fitness goal.


Start with just the bar to see if you can lift it comfortably and without straining. For instance, a 180-pound adult with limited experience might start at around 80 lbs. (36 kg) or less, or even just the bar.
Add 5 or 10 lb. (2.27 to 4.53 kg) at a time. Adding smaller weight increments will lead to faster gains.
Avoid using too much weight in the beginning. It’s better to use less weight than you need until you have mastered the movements.
Stick with lower weight amounts to build a toned look.
Add more weight over time to build strength., While you may be able to self-teach yourself a lot, you should also consult a trainer for guidance about how to conduct proper shoulder presses.


Trainers will be able to advise you about holding the proper form.
Trainers will be able to make sure you are not hurting yourself.
Ask to talk to a trainer at your local gym. Most gyms have a staff of trainers who can provide group or individualized instruction.

, Spend a little time reflecting on whether your shoulder presses are having the desired effect. Without achieving your goals, your hard work will be wasted.


Be realistic about the amount of time it takes to see results. It might take weeks or months to see change.
If your goal is to gain muscle mass, you may be able to add 2 lbs (.9 kilos) a month. After about 15 weeks, you should be able to see substantial change.
If your goal is to build strength, you should be able to notice a change within 4 to 8 weeks."

Try a standing upright dumbbell row with shoulder press.This starts like the original, except you're holding the dumbbells at your sides, with your palms facing behind you.",How to Do Dumbbell Upright Rows," It's important to warm up before any exercise to loosen up your muscles. Jumping on the elliptical for 10 minutes is a great way to get your heart rate up and the blood circulating through your body. Then grab something much lighter than the dumbbells you plan to use for the row. Some smaller free weights or even two water bottles could do the trick.Stand with the lighter objects at your sides. Then lift the objects to shoulder height while flaring your elbows out to your sides until they're parallel with the floor and just below chin level. Repeat this motion with the light weights 10-15 times to prepare your muscles for the dumbbell upright row.;
, Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart, your back should be straight and your knees slightly bent.Keep your chest high and eyes forward. Good posture is important whenever you’re weight lifting., Sit with your feet on either side of the bench. Be sure to keep good posture with your shoulders back and head straight while you straddle the bench. Never slouch or slump, as this could cause injury or discomfort and renders your workout less effective.

, Grip one dumbbell in each hand with your thumbs curled around the handles and your palms facing the front of your thighs. Your hands should be slightly less than shoulder width apart. Rest the dumbbells atop your thighs while keeping your arms extended, and slightly bent at the elbows. This will be your starting position.The weight of the dumbbell depends on your arm strength. Choose a dumbbell that will challenge you. If you are straining just to pick up a dumbbell it is too heavy for you at this time, select a lighter weight to begin as using one too heavy can strain your back., Keeping your core muscles contracted helps align your spine and keeps the correct posture necessary for this exercise. To do this, crunch your abdominal muscles to form a stiff core of muscle support. Some people try to engage their core by simply sucking in, do not do this! Focus on using your midsection muscles and flex as if bracing for a punch to the stomach., Knowing when to inhale and exhale helps you gain stability throughout your workout. Take a deep breath in the starting position and exhale as your pull the weights up to shoulder height.An easy way to remember how to breathe while weight lifting is to always be exhaling as you push or pull the weights. Think of it as using the force of the air leaving your lungs to help you move the weight.

, Slowly pull the weights up to the front of your shoulders with your elbows leading out to your sides. Your elbows should be slightly higher than your wrists and not pointing forward at all.Squeeze your shoulder blades together as you're raising your elbows outward, and flex your wrists as you’re pulling the weights up.Make sure to do this slowly and controlled for best results.Do not use your body’s momentum to help move the weights, this makes the exercise easier and less effective.
Keep proper form as you raise the dumbbell. This ensures you will be using the correct muscles to reduce the chance of injury.The weights should remain close to your body as you lift.

, Check your form in a mirror while holding this position.Arms should almost be parallel with the floor. Elbows will be a bit higher than your forearms and wrists, but only slightly.
Remember your back should remain straight throughout the entire exercise.

, After holding the dumbbells at shoulder height for a few seconds take a deep breath as you begin to slowly lower the dumbbells., Do not simply let your arms fall back to your thighs. Keep your body controlled and slowly lower the dumbbell to the starting position, remembering to keep your arms slightly bent at the elbows.

, Continue through your desired number of repetitions (reps).For beginners with a goal of building strength and endurance, perform 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps. Don't strain yourself.
For more advanced lifters or body builders with the goal of increasing muscle mass in the shoulders and trapezius, use a heavier weight and perform more sets with fewer reps per set.

, It's always a good idea to do a quick stretch after your workout to help reduce soreness and aid in recovery time.Clasp your hands together and reach forward stretching the back of your shoulders. This will stretch the muscle group that was activated in this exercise.
Stretch your shoulder muscles by placing one hand on a wall and twisting your body to stretch your arm backwards, then switch arms.
You can also try clasping your hands behind your head and pushing your elbows back as far as you can.

, Doing an upright dumbbell lift while squatting is an awesome full body workout as it also engages your glutes and inner thighs.


Start with your feet about as far apart as your hips with your toes pointing forward. Hold your dumbbells with your arms extended downwards, and your palms facing your thighs.
Sink into a squat by bending your knees and lowering your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground. As you’re lowering your body, bend your elbows to pull the dumbbells up to your chest as before. Remember to keep your weight over your heels as you squat.Straighten your legs back to the starting position while lowering the dumbbells back to your sides in a slow and controlled fashion, and continue into your next squat., Set the weight to your comfort level then grasp the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Stand a few feet away, facing the cable pull machineLean back slightly, brace the torso and lift the handle on the cable pull up towards the chest.
Repeat for desired amount of reps.

,


Stand with feet shoulder width apart and a slight bend in the knees.
Exhale and slowly pull the dumbbells up along your sides. When your elbows are parallel to your shoulders, rotate your hands so they are facing up.
Continue by pushing the weights up over your head until your arms are straightened. Hold this position for a slow count of 2.
Inhale and lower the weights back to your sides, rotating your hands back downwards as your elbows come to shoulder level again.

Lie with your back flat on the ground, legs together and knees bent., With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other.As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor.

, Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat.Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch.
This movement can be made easier by placing you hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head)., Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week."

Prop and hold your body up on your elbow., From your propped position, place your upper arm’s hand behind your head.Inhale and contract your side abdominal muscles to crunch and bring your upper elbow down toward your side. As you crunch, the lower half of your torso and your hips are going to dip down to the floor. Hold the crunch position for a moment, exhale, then flex your side abdominal muscles again to bring your upper elbow and torso back up to your starting position.As you come back to your starting position, you can extend even further than you started, brining your elbow back and tilting your head down to the ground.This will give your upper torso a convex curve.

, Once you have completed one set of side crunches on one side of your body (approximately 10–15 reps), turn over and get into the same starting position as before, with your legs extended and your elbow propping up your body.

, Whichever side your hand is at your head, lift that same side leg up with your knee bent at a 90° right angle. Turn your knee out, so the side of your thigh is facing out as you crunch. As you bring your knee up, contract your side abdominal muscles to bring your upper body down.


As you crunch, your elbow should be touching you knee.
Try not to bend forward as you crunch. Keep your spine straight as your curve it down to the side.
This crunch style is a great alternative for people who have poor mobility and can’t get down on the ground., Once you have done one set of side crunches (approximately 10–15 reps), switch arms and legs to crunch on the other side of your body.


Try to do 1–3 sets of 10–15 reps on each side of your body.

Lower your arm.,
Stop the weight when it is parallel to your chest.,
Pause at the bottom.,
Bring the weight back up.,
Switch arms.",How to Do One Arm Flyes1," To start the one arm flye, you should lie on a flat surface. This can be the floor or a workout bench. Use your free hand to support yourself either on the bench or the floor. Plant your feet on the floor if you are on the bench, and bend them so you can place them flat on the floor if you are lying on the floor.





;
, Hold the dumbbell in both hands and then slowly lean back until you are lying down. Then, position the dumbbell next to your stomach and slowly extend your arm straight up over your shoulder.








You can hold the weight with your palm facing your feet or with your palms facing each other.
Your arm should have a slight bend at the elbow.

, With your arm in the up and down position, inhale as you lower the weight. Make sure to keep a slight bend at the elbow. The arc that your arm takes to lower the weight should be in the same line the entire time. Only your shoulder joint should be moving.







, You will slowly lower the weight in a controlled manner until it reaches the same height as your chest. Don't just let the weight drop fast. Use your chest muscles to move the weight.









If you are on the bench, you will stop when the weight is still hovering in the air. Don't drop your arm lower than the bench.
If you are on the floor, you will stop just before it rests on the floor. Don't let it rest on the floor. This will take away the work of your chest muscles.

, To help make sure your chest gets a workout, pause for a count of one to five at the bottom. Make sure to squeeze your chest muscles as you hold it here.

, Exhale as you lift the weight back up to the starting position. As you lift the weight, squeeze your chest. Keep the slight bend to your elbow. Your arm should go in the same path you used when you lowered it. Repeat the movement.







, After you have completed a specific number of repetitions, you should change arms. Follow the same steps with the opposite arm. Make sure to do the same number of repetitions with each arm.

Make sure your feet are shoulder width apart.
Due to the different position, you may not be able to use the same weight as with a supine one arm chest flye.

, Keeping your arm parallel to the floor, bring the weight towards the middle of the chest, squeezing your chest muscles as you do. Inhale as you complete this movement.








Try not to let your arm sag down. If that happens, lower the weight.

, Don't cross over your chest. Instead, stop when your arm is in a straight line in front of you. The path that your arm takes should be in the same line the entire time. Don't move your upper body or twist. Only your shoulder joint should be moving.









Make sure to keep a slight bend at the elbow.

, After a brief pause in front of your chest, exhale as you bring the weight back up to the starting position. Keep the slight bend to your elbow and make sure your arm travels in the same path. Keep your arm straight out to your side.







, Complete a certain number of repetitions with one arm. Then, you can change arms. Follow the same steps with the other arm. Do the same number of repetitions with each arm.

Lie on your stomach on a raised surface.,
Lift the dumbbell.,
Stop when your arm is parallel to the floor.,
Lower the weight slowly.",How to Do One Arm Flyes3," A variation of the lying chest flye is the back flye. You must lie on a raised surface, like a workout bench, so your arms can hang down. Rest your arm at a 90 degree angle while you hold a hand weight.








If you do not have a workout bench, you may lie on the edge of a bed, an exercise ball, or a chair. You may also bend forward at the waist so your chest is parallel to the floor.

, Starting with your arm hanging down, squeeze your back muscles as you lift the weight until your arm is straight out to the side. Make sure to keep your elbow slightly bent.







, Continue lifting the weight until your arm is parallel to the floor. This should be about as far as you can lift the weight due to mobility. Hold the weight there for a few counts as you squeeze your back muscles.








, In a controlled manner, slowly lower the weight. Don't let it just fall back to the floor. Use your back muscles to lower the weight to the floor. Repeat with the other arm.








You can alternate arms with each repetition, or complete a certain number of repetitions with one arm before switching to the next.

Think about why you may want to do one arm flyes.,
Choose an appropriate weight.,
Decide an appropriate number of reps. You should decide the proper amount of reps to do when you perform this exercise.,
Figure out a weekly exercise schedule.",How to Do One Arm Flyes4," Taking the time to reflect on why you want to do one arm flyes versus double arm flyes may be helpful. It is more common for people to do double arm flyes, but you might have some specific reasons for wanting to do one arm flyes.

For example, you might need to do one arm flyes due to an injury on one side.
You might also want to isolate your muscles as you work them. You can take more time to focus on isolating your shoulder muscles when you are doing one arm flyes.

, Flyes are often done with hand weights. When you begin, you should use low weights. Flyes can be difficult for some people, especially if you are new to exercising. Start by doing flyes with a small weight, such as five pounds, and increase from there.









If you cannot use five pounds, you can try two pounds, or do flyes without any weight at all.

, Break it down into sets and reps. You may want to do 3 sets of 10 reps, 2 sets of 15 reps, or another reasonable number. Consider keeping the total number of reps under 50.









You may want to combine chest and back flyes with other arm exercises, like curls, presses, or push ups.

, You need to decide how often you want to perform this exercise. Most exercise plans suggest doing three days of strength training with a day of rest in between. You shouldn’t do strength training two days in a row of the same muscle.


You may want to choose to work a different muscle group on your flye off days.

Find a bench to use for your bench dips.,
Grip the edge of your bench with your hands.,
Lift your butt off of the bench.,
Try a more difficult version of a bench dip.,
Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows.,
Push yourself back up to starting position.,
Repeat the exercise.,
Do bench dips two to three days per week.,
Give yourself a break.,
Track your progress.",How to Do a Bench Dip," A regular exercise bench is preferred, but you can also use a wide chair or your couch if you don't have access to an exercise bench. Whatever item you're using for your bench dips, it should be two to three feet off of the ground. Make sure that whatever you're using for a bench is at least as wide is your shoulders and is absolutely stable.All gyms have exercise benches, and they can also be purchased online or at most fitness stores or big box stores.
You will be placing all your weight on one side of the bench, so make sure that whatever you use, it will not tip over.;
, Place your hands onto the edge of your bench, one hand on each side of your hips. Your palms should be down, fingertips pointing forward and towards the floor, and thumbs next to your hips., Use your arms to push your butt up and off the bench. Firmly grip the edge of the bench as you straighten your arms and extend your legs forward so that your knees are no longer bent. Walk your feet out slightly so that your butt is in front of the bench. This will be your starting position., To increase difficulty, do this exercise with your feet propped up on another exercise bench or chair instead of the floor. This will add more weight for your triceps to lift, resulting in a more intense workout. Make sure that the other bench or chair that you prop your feet on is sturdy, otherwise it could flip over.








, Inhale as you lower your body towards the floor, and stop once your upper arms are parallel to the floor. You should have a right angle between your upper arms and the forearms, and your butt should be a few inches off the ground.









Keep the elbows pointing backwards, instead of out to the side, throughout the movement. Your forearms should always be perpendicular to the floor.If you are a beginner, start by reducing how far you lower yourself. This will allow your shoulders' connective tissues (tendons and ligaments) to build up strength as well, so they can, in time and with practice, eventually support the full range of motion down to a 90 degree bend.

, Straighten your arms to slowly lift your torso back up and into starting position. Your legs should remain still. Once you've reached starting position, you will have completed one repetition of a bench dip.








Make sure you keep your shoulders back and squared. The shoulders will want to roll forward, but this puts them at risk for injury. Engage the rhomboids before you start by pulling your shoulder blades together in the back. This will help keep the shoulder in a safe position.

, You should try to do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise per set. Start off by doing two sets of bench dips in each of your workouts. Once you feel you can complete that with ease, move on to three sets of 10 to 15 reps, and then on to four sets.









This should be challenging, but not impossible. If it is too easy, then you should increase your number of repetitions or sets., In order to start seeing results in your triceps, aim to add bench dips to your workouts two to three days per week. Stick with this workout regimen for a minimum of six to eight weeks.


For faster results, increase the number of sets and/or times per week you do this exercise.
Bench dips are a great addition to any workout, so don't stop doing them after six to eight weeks. If you don't want your triceps to bulk up, start doing your bench dips less often after the six to eight week period., Weight lifting actually damages your muscles' fibers, which is what creates that sore feeling after workouts. This is why it's important for you to rest your muscles for 48 hours before returning to them. Those rest days are when your muscles rebuild — and when they get stronger.


To do this, rotate your workouts. For example, do arm and chest exercises on Monday, leg and glute exercises on Tuesday, core and back exercises on Wednesday, back to arms and chest on Thursday, and back to legs and glutes on Friday., Sometimes working out can be discouraging if you feel like you're not seeing results. Since you look in the mirror every day, you won't see your progress like other people will. Consider documenting your progress with photos.


Take a ""before"" photo at the beginning of your bench dip journey. Make sure the photo is taken from an angle that shows the body part (in this case, the back of your arms) that you're working on.
Take photos every week from the same angle.
Look through your collection of photos when you are feeling discouraged, and you'll be able to see the progress that you're making."

Day 3: Perform 30 minutes of running, and follow with 40 exercise ball reverse crunches and 40 leg lifts.,
Day 4: Perform 30 minutes on a stationary bike, and then 2 sets of 12 scissor twists with an exercise ball, and finish with 3 sets of 15 sit-ups.,
Day 5: Run 30 minutes on a treadmill and then follow that with 20 Pilates boomerang moves, and 3 minutes of Pilates “hundred” moves.,
Days 6 and 7: Rest your body.",How to Do a 6 Pack Abs Workout," Start with cardio to get your heart pumping before moving to muscle-toning exercises. This combination of exercises will burn fat, tone your obliques, and strengthen your hip and lower abdominals.









If your abs or hips get tired or tight easily, work out each side in small groups of repetitions, working up to your target number of 15 or 25 per side.
Men should perform an additional set of 10 repetitions on each side if they have the energy.;
, Pilates routines force you to focus on muscle control and slow, deliberate movements that build strong, lean muscle.









Both the corkscrew and the jackknife work stabilizer muscles in your abs and back, which will help tone your abs and strengthen your back, preventing injury and improving posture.
Go through the moves slowly and carefully until you are comfortable with the positions and motions; then increase speed slightly, focus on tightening your abs and back muscles with each movement, and increase repetitions. Take care to avoid injuring your neck, back, or shoulders.

, These abdominal exercises will work your core and your lower abs as well as your lower back. Alternate exercises in groups of 10 without stopping until all 40 repetitions are complete.









Men should add an additional 10 to 20 repetitions if possible, provided they can maintain proper form and control.
Don’t rush through these; the point is to exert your muscles to control the movements.

, If you feel physically able to perform additional sit-ups, place your hands behind your head and bring each elbow to the opposite knee with each sit-up to work side abdominal muscles in addition to your central abs, and perform another 1 to 2 sets of 15 sit-ups like these.

, Like many Pilates exercises, these moves work multiple muscle groups at once, strengthening your entire core and improving your muscular control. Perform an additional set of 10 boomerangs and another minute of “hundreds” if you can take it.

, Take 1 to 2 days of rest each week from cardio routines and 2 days of rest from exercises that target your abdominal muscles, preferably spacing your rest days throughout the week to give your muscles time to recover and repair themselves. Overworking your muscles can lead to injury. Do not attempt to perform abdominal workouts every day. Adequate sleep is also required for effective and safe exercise routines. When exercising, you actually break down muscle, and if you give them the proper time to heal and refuel (by following The 6 Pack Ab Diet), they will grow back stronger than before. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep if you are an adult and 8 to 10 hours per night if you are a teenager.

Locate a chin-up bar.,
Put your hands on the bar with your palms facing your body.,
Raise your body until your chin is above the bar.,
Lower yourself back down.",How to Do a Chin Up1," Every gym has a chin-up bar, which is a horizontal bar positioned above shoulder height. If you aren't a member of a gym, you can buy a chin-up bar and install it in your house. Place it in a tall doorway and make sure it's positioned above your shoulders.






;
, Whereas a pull-up would begin with your palms facing away, a chin-up begins with your palms facing your body. Grip the bar comfortably but firmly, with your hands spaced a few inches apart.








The proper chin-up grip has the hands spaced close together. A pull-up requires that the hands be spaced further apart.

, Use your upper arm strength to lift your body toward the bar, stopping when your chin is above the bar. Your elbows will be fully bent. Bend your knees or cross your feet to distribute your weight more evenly.








, Using a slow, controlled motion, lower yourself until your arms are straight. This is the complete range of motion for a chin-up.

Choose the right dumbbells.,
Get in position.,
Row up with your right arm.,
Repeat with your left arm.,
Keep your hips and shoulders square.,
Tense your entire body.",How to Do Renegade Rows1," Because renegade rows are extremely challenging, and different from other exercises you may have done, start with a lighter weight and make sure you can do several repetitions with good form.Generally it's best to start out with 5- or 10-pound dumbbells. Choose dumbbells with hexagon rather than round ends, so they'll be stable on the ground and won't roll around.
If the exercise feels ""easy"" to you, go ahead and use a heavier dumbbell. But don't increase your weight until you feel confident about your form.;
, You want to start renegade rows in a high plank position, with your hands gripping the handles of your dumbbells. Your body should be a straight line from the crown of your head to your heels.Make sure your wrists are directly under and in line with your shoulders, and that your shoulder blades are tucked down alongside your spine. You don't want to crunch your shoulders. Your arms should be completely straight.
If you're just starting, you may want to come to a half-plank on your knees, at least until you get used to the rowing movement and can do it with good form.

, Shift your weight to your left side and lift your right arm, keeping your elbow in and raising the weight along your side. Your elbow should go up past your back, which should remain flat.Raise and lower your arm in a slow, controlled movement. Once you've rowed up, don't simply drop the weight to the ground. Resist gravity and control the movement on the way down.

, Once your right arm is back to the start position, raise your left arm in the same movement. A brief pause between rowing with your right arm and rowing with your left arm will help you maintain control and position.The movement should be in your arms only. Don't rotate or rock your body as you switch from side to side.

, If you rotate your hips away from the ground as you row, the exercise becomes easier. However, the point of this exercise is to stabilize your hips and engage your core to keep your body from moving.Decreasing the weight of the dumbbells can help if you find you have the tendency to rotate your hips. Focus on doing the exercise with correct form before you increase the weight.
Over-rotating twists your spine and can lead to back pain or injury. Focus on engaging and squeezing your glutes, quads, and core to stay square above the ground as you row, moving only your arms.

, Renegade rows are a challenging whole body exercise that require significant core strength to stabilize your body. Keeping your entire body tense and rigid enables you to do a full repetition rather than a half repetition of the exercise.Keep in mind that your elbow should be raising well past your back. If it's not, you're not doing a full repetition of the exercise. Lower the weight you're using until you get to the point that you can do a full repetition.
Aim to do 4 or 5 full repetitions with each arm to start. You can rest between repetitions if necessary.

Choose the right size.,
Keep your feet firm.,
Make sure your back is flat.,
Do wall touches.,
Practice deadlifts with the kettlebell.",How to Do a Kettleball Swing1," To avoid injury and ensure that you're getting the maximum benefit out of the kettlebell swing, you need to make sure you're using the right size kettlebell. Generally, men should start with a 16 kg (35 lb.) kettlebell, while women should start with a 12 kg (26 lb.) kettlebell.You want to pick a size that will challenge you. However, it may be a good idea to practice with a lighter kettlebell until you can be sure your form is correct.If you continue doing the kettlebell swing regularly, you will eventually need to increase the weight to continue to get benefits from the exercise. Move up to the next weight when you can comfortably swing for 60 seconds at the weight you're using.;
, One of the most difficult parts of the kettlebell swing is keeping your feet firm. As the weight of the kettlebell swings forward, it will pull you with it. To get benefit from this exercise, you must hold your body weight in your heels and the balls of your feet.Resist the tendency to roll forward onto your toes as the kettlebell swings out. If you're having a hard time holding your weight, you may want to switch to a lighter kettlebell that won't pull you as hard. Stay at the lighter weight until you are able to swing the kettlebell continuously and keep your feet firm.

, A flat back is essential when doing the kettlebell swing. Otherwise, you risk serious injury to your back. If you have problems hunching, leaning forward, or crunching your neck, you may want to switch to a lighter weight or practice the motion with no weight.You may need to go back and practice deadlifts some more if you're having difficulty maintaining a flat back through the swing. Remember that all of the force of your movement needs to come from your hips, not from your upper body.
Think of your head as an extension of your spine, and keep your neck flat as well. The momentum of the swing can be particularly jarring to your neck if it is crunched.
Set your gaze to the floor just in front of your toes, rather than looking up or further ahead of you, and don't follow the movement of the kettlebell as it swings in front of you.

, Wall touches will help you learn how to get your stance right when doing the kettlebell swing, so you know how to appropriately shift your body weight and can maintain correct posture.Start wall touches by standing about half a thigh-length away from a wall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Lower into a squat position with your knees bent, keeping your shins straight so your knees stay over your ankles rather than your toes, with your rear end sticking out behind you. Place the sides of your hands between your legs at the creases of your groin.
Using your hands, push your hips back toward the wall until your rear end just touches it, but without putting any weight against the wall. Return to your starting position and repeat. Do 10 repetitions of this drill.
Move further from the wall and do another 10 repetitions, then move a little further and repeat. Your hips should be traveling down and back. You are learning to carry your weight and momentum with your hips, not your lower body or your back.

, Deadlifts with the kettlebell enable you to become familiar with the equipment, how it feels and how it moves. Choose a lighter kettlebell initially so you can focus on form and technique, working up to the weight you plan to use for your swings.If you've already been doing wall touches, your body should be sufficiently warmed up for this exercise. Otherwise, do some squats or jog in place for about five minutes to warm up.
Use the same position you used for wall touches while you perform your deadlifts. Rather than reaching down with your arms by bending forward and possibly rounding your back, keep your back straight, bend at your knees and flex your hips back to lower yourself down.
When you can reach the handle, pull yourself slightly towards it and then reverse the motion by pushing the hips forward, expanding your chest and standing tall. Pause at the standing position for a second, then go on to lowering the kettlebell. The focus here is on learning to use the glutes to lift the weight.
As you lower the kettlebell, move again from the hips – don't simply bend down and put the kettlebell back on the floor. Push firmly on the floor with your feet to maintain your stance.
After you have learned how to contract your glutes to lift the weight, try repeating the lift to get the kettlebell to swing forward using your arms like a pendulum. Remember the goal is a smooth continuous motion raising the kettlebell up and swinging it down. In time, you can work on building up your speed in the return lift stage so there is less of a pause at the bottom of the range of motion.

Do isometric chin-ups.,
Start from slightly below the bar.,
Repeat these exercises for several weeks.,
Increase your number of reps.",How to Do a Chin Up2," Stand on a chair and grip the bar as though you were going to do a chin-up. Bend your knees as much as you need to so that your chin is just above the bar. Move your feet off of the chair and hang in this position for 30 seconds or as long as you can. After 30 seconds, lower yourself back down until your arms are straight. Repeat this five times.








It's important that when you lower yourself down it's slow and controlled. You use the same muscles on the way down that you use on the way up.
This exercise will help to train your muscles to perform a chin-up without the help of a chair.

, This time, stand on the chair and position yourself so that your head is slightly below the bar. Your arms should be slightly bent. Starting from this position, pull yourself up so that your chin is past the bar. Repeat five times starting from the same position.








Again, each time lowering yourself all the way down in a slow and controlled manner.
After a while you'll notice that you'll be able to start from lower and lower down.

, Each time, try to start the exercises from a lower position. Eventually start from a full hang, with your arms completely straight. See how far you can pull yourself up five times in a row.








, When you can do a full chin-up, pull yourself up five times in a row, or as many times as possible. You can also do a combination of full chin-ups and half chin-ups. As your muscles gain strength, increase your reps.









You should be able to increase your reps every other week or so.
Don't overdo it. You don't want to tear a muscle or overexert yourself. Rest between sessions to give your muscles time to repair and get stronger.

Start with RKC planks.,
Try other plank variations.,
Do body saws.,
Move to single-leg and single-arm body saws.",How to Do Renegade Rows2," The RKC (which stands for Russian Kettlebell Challenge) plank engages your deep core in a way that the traditional plank does not. This exercise engages the muscles in your deep core, giving you a better rounded core workout than traditional planks alone.Start on all fours. Lower your elbows to the floor so that the sides of your forearms are resting on the floor, and clasp your hands together to form a first in front of you. Activate your core and drop your shoulders down your back.
Extend first one leg, then the other out behind you using slow, controlled movements. Your toes should come to rest on the floor a little more than hip-width apart. Keep your spine neutral and your knees straight.
Your pelvis should be posteriorly rotated so that your buttocks are slightly elevated, rather than creating a straight line from your head to your heels as you do with a traditional plank.

, If you're bored with the plank, or no longer find it physically challenging, there are other variations that will work your core effectively so you don't have to keep doing traditional planks for longer periods of time.For example, you can do side planks to target smaller core muscles and obliques. Get on your side with your feet stacked one on top of the other and raise up onto your elbow with the side of your forearm on the floor in front of you. Your elbow should be directly underneath your shoulder. Hold for 10 seconds on each side.
You also can do a three-point plank, in which you lift one leg or one arm off the floor. Make sure you repeat with the other side.

, Because your body is moving with a body saw, you get more of a core workout than you would by just doing planks. A towel is the only equipment you need to add body saws to your exercise regimen.Fold your towel and lay it on the floor where your feet will be. When you get in plank position, place your toes on top of the folded towel.
Lower to your elbows so that the sides of your forearms are resting on the floor and stabilize your core. Brace your glutes and abs.
Slide your feet forward about four to six inches, keeping your arms still, and slide back to the starting position. This is the sawing motion. Do 2 to 4 sets of 10 repetitions, resting between each set.

, Once you've mastered the body saw, you can add single-leg and single-arm body saw variations to increase the challenge. Simply lift one leg or one arm off the floor. Saw by sliding your body forward and back with your feet (or foot).When doing single-leg or single-arm exercises, make sure you switch and do each side.

Use kettlebells instead of dumbbells.,
Add a push-up to your renegade row.,
Move your feet closer together.,
Increase the weight.",How to Do Renegade Rows3," When performing renegade rows, you have the option of lifting either kettlebells or dumbbells. Since kettlebells are going to move around more than dumbbells do, using them will make the exercise slightly more dynamic and more difficult.If you're switching from dumbbells to kettlebells, you may want to start with a lower weight kettlebell than you were using with dumbbells, so you can make sure you're still using proper form and get used to the change.

, You can add a challenge to the already challenging renegade row by doing a push-up in between each row. Start by rowing with your right arm, lower it completely, do a push-up, then row with your left arm., The further apart your feet are, the easier your renegade rows will be. Increase the difficulty by gradually moving your feet more closely together. Only move your feet closer together when your core is stable and you can do the exercise with perfect form., While it's not necessarily a variation, after incorporating renegade rows into your workouts two or three times a week for a couple weeks, you should regularly increase the weight of the dumbbells that you use.Increasing the weight on a regular basis keeps the exercise challenging to continue building a strong and stable core.
The ideal goal is to continue increasing weight until the dumbbells you are using are equal to your body weight.

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.,
Grip the kettlebell.,
Thrust forward with your hips.,
Shift your weight back to receive the weight.,
Drive through your hips.,
Keep your swings continuous.",How to Do a Kettleball Swing2," To start a kettlebell swing, spread your legs and plant your feet firmly on the ground. You may want to move your feet a little or rock back and forth to place your weight correctly.Make sure your weight is firmly in the heels and balls of your feet, and that as you are standing your feet are aligned directly under your shoulders and hips. Your toes should be pointed straight ahead in front of you.
Straighten your back and drop your shoulder blades down your back, keeping your shoulders neutral.

, Squat down and wrap your fingers around the handle of the kettlebell. Your palms should be facing you. Wrap your thumbs loosely around the handle as well – don't leave them sticking out.Once you have a good grip on the kettlebell handle, stand tall, retracting your shoulder blades. Make sure your arms are loose at your sides.
Shift your weight to your heels and bend your knees slightly, lowering your rear end down and back toward the wall, as though you are going into a squat. Your back should be straight, shoulders neutral.

, When you're ready to start the kettlebell swing, drive through your heels and push your hips forward at the same time you straighten your legs. Your arms work like a pendulum, with the weight of the kettlebell pulling your arms up and forward. Keep your arms straight and fully extended and aim to get the kettlebell to about chest height.For this motion, you should feel a line of energy running up from your heels all the way up your legs to your hips. Your entire lower body and core will be engaged.
When you are upright, contract your glutes and snap your hips. Contract your core as well to keep control of the weight.
This will pull you forward, but try to avoid rocking on your feet as you swing. Keep your feet firm.

, When the kettlebell reaches the desired height, shift your weight onto your heels. Rather than trying to bring the kettlebell back, let the weight return of its own accord.Bend your knees and, in a smooth continuous motion, allow the kettlebell to lower as your hips flex back.


This is counter to many exercises you may have done, in which you must control the negative movement as well. All you need to focus on is absorbing the shock and getting your body ready to swing the kettlebell back out again.
Allow the kettlebell to swing back through your legs, taking care to keep your feet and hips planted firmly, your shoulders neutral, your back straight.

, With the kettlebell between your legs, you're ready for the next repetition. Feel the energy coming through your heels and up your legs, and explode forward from your hips to propel the kettlebell back out.Focus on controlling the kettlebell with your arms and maintaining your grip, but keep in mind that your arms are doing the least work in this exercise. All the force is coming from your lower body, your hips, and your core.
Try to shift your weight through the swing without moving your feet or stepping out of position, keeping your back and shoulders in the same position with every rep.

, Once you've mastered your technique and form, when you go to do the kettlebell swing your focus should be on maintaining continuous motion, rather than pausing or stopping after each swing.It can help to think of doing this exercise for a period of time, rather than doing a certain number of swings or a certain number of repetitions.
Set a timer and do the kettlebell swing for 30 seconds, or for 60 seconds. Gradually increase your time as you get stronger, but don't worry about how many times the kettlebell is swinging – think of the entire exercise as one action, not a series of actions.

Learn the difference between the Russian and American kettlebell swings.,
Try one-handed kettlebell swings.,
Add a step to your swing.,
Build up to double kettlebell swings.",How to Do a Kettleball Swing3," When you first learn the kettlebell swing, the movement you'll learn first typically is the Russian kettlebell swing. The American kettlebell swing may require more work to master.With the Russian swing, you stop the kettlebell at your chest. However, the American kettlebell swing extends the swing until your arms are overhead, engaging a full range of motion in your arms and shoulders. The momentum this swing generates makes it more difficult than the Russian swing.
Once you've mastered the Russian swing, you may want to progress to the American swing. Don't do so until you feel you can accomplish it safely.

, When you get to the point that you're able to do a two-handed swing (of either the Russian or the American variety) for 60 seconds without difficulty, you're ready to progress to a one-handed swing.With the one-handed kettlebell swing, you are increasing the load on your shoulder and your core. You want to use the same form and technique that you used for the two-handed swing, but the arm you're not using will be at your side.
As you do the one-handed swing, allow the arm you're not using to swing back as the kettlebell swings forward, and to swing forward as the kettlebell swings backward between your legs. This will help control the rotation so you maintain good form.
Do one-handed kettlebell swings using a single kettlebell. Swing with one hand for 60 seconds, then switch and do the other side. Once you can do a one-handed kettlebell swing comfortably on each side for 60 seconds, you can progress to alternating kettlebell swings, still using one kettlebell but alternating the arm that's doing the swinging.

, If you've mastered one-handed and alternating kettlebell swings, and you're ready to advance to something more challenging, try adding some movement to your lower body by side-stepping or walking forward with each swing.Taking a short step either forward or sideways while doing the kettlebell swing requires immense focus. Make sure you have strong technique and perfect form before you attempt this, or you risk injury.
You also want to make sure you have plenty of room before you attempt stepping or walking kettlebell swings. These exercises aren't necessarily best in a crowded gym, where you might run into someone. You may want to try them outside on a flat, grassy surface.

, Double kettlebell swings are one of the more difficult variations, and not just because you have double the weight. Handling two separate kettlebells requires immense focus and control.Make sure your technique is solid and that you can keep your arms straight so the two kettlebells don't bang into each other at any point.
If you've progressed to double kettlebell swings, you may want to start with each kettlebell at a significantly lower weight than what you were using for one-handed swings. Keep the overall weight that you're swinging in mind.

Perform overhead shoulder presses.,
Enter the starting position.,
Do the press.,
Lift heavy.",How to Build Shoulder Muscles1," This workout is great for your anterior deltoids, and it is often considered the most effective exercise for building shoulder muscles. You can use a barbell, a pair of dumbbells, or a shoulder press machine. Barbells are more effective for ""maxing out"" with a heavy load, meaning that you can lift more. Dumbbells require more coordination to lift, however, and they can help keep you from perpetuating strength imbalances between your shoulders., This exercise is best done when standing. Hold the barbell or dumbbells with a palm-forward grip, slightly wider than your shoulders. Hold the weight in front of your head, just above shoulder level.








You can do this exercise while seated, although the seated version does not exercise your core as much. If you've had lower back trouble, stick to the seated version. Sit on a press bench with vertical support for your back. Keep your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground.

, In one smooth motion, lift the barbell or dumbbell above your head to the point that your elbows straighten. Hold the weight there for a moment, and then slowly lower it to the starting position. Keep the weights in the resting position for two seconds, and then repeat. Take your time, and pay close attention to form. Make sure that you're not favoring one shoulder over the other.







, Shoulder presses build muscle most efficiently as a high-weight, low-repetition activity. Begin with 2-4 sets of 4-8 reps each.

Do lateral raises.,
Pace yourself.,
Use good form.",How to Build Shoulder Muscles2," Start in a standing position, arms hanging at your sides, holding one dumbbell in each hand. Lift your arms straight out from your sides until they are parallel to the floor. Bend your elbow, slightly, and tilt your hands forward as if you are pouring a drink. Hold the dumbbells at arms' length for a moment. Then, slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.Exhale when your arms reach the apex of the lift. Then, inhale slowly as you bring your arms back down.

, Try 1-2 sets of 10-12 reps, or 4 sets of 6-10 reps, Give yourself 60-75 seconds to rest between each set. Make sure to lift at a steady pace: one second with your arms down, and two seconds with your arms up.You might want to try doing some article circles or shrugs in between each set.

, Keep your back steady and straight throughout each set. Bend your knees very slightly, and keep your weight centered through your spine. Make sure that your elbows are somewhat bent, but not so much that you remove the pressure from your shoulders.


Be careful. Keep your arms straight, and do not overdo the number of reps. It is easy to injure your shoulders with this workout.
The routine is best performed while standing, although you can also sit on a bench. Make sure that you can keep your back straight.

Try the bent-over dumbbell lateral raise.,
Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand.,
Perform the raise.",How to Build Shoulder Muscles3," This workout is similar to the standard lateral raise, except that you are bent over forward. You can perform this routine while standing, or you can sit on a press bench and lean over your knees.Try resting your forehead on the bench or another padded surface to help keep it steady.

, Hold your chest up and keep your back flat. If you are sitting, bend forward over your knees until your forehead nearly touches the bench. If you are standing, then bend forward from your hips to bring your chest parallel with the floor. Let the dumbbells hang beneath your chest. Keep your elbows slightly bent, and let your palms face each other., Lift the dumbbells up and out until your upper arms are nearly parallel to the floor. Raise your arms in a steady arc, and make sure that you are not favoring one over the other. Hold the weights at the top of the arc for a moment before slowly lowering them toward the starting position.Start the next rep just before your arms hang perpendicular to the floor.

Lift heavy weights, and focus on steady gains.,
Develop all three heads of the deltoid muscle.,
Create a diverse exercise routine.",How to Build Shoulder Muscles4," Try to make small, measurable gains with each workout. When you work out your shoulders, lift heavy, and stick to 4-7 reps per set. Increase either the weight or the rep number very slightly with each workout. This way, you'll set a pattern of incremental, sustainable gain.Keep a practice of ""progressive overload."" Lift more and more weight over time so that you are always pushing the limits of your muscles. You will not get bigger shoulder muscles without getting stronger.
Imagine that in your most recent workout, you lifted a 55 lb. dumbbell shoulder press in sets of seven reps. Next time, push yourself to do eight reps with the same weight. Alternately, move up to 60 lbs and do seven reps again.

, The deltoid (shoulder) muscle comprises three sections: the anterior (front) head, the lateral (middle/medial) head, and the posterior (rear) head. Try to build muscle in each of these areas in order to balance out your shoulders. The wider and thicker your shoulders are, the more impressive they will appear., Pick four or five workouts that variably focus on your anterior, lateral, and posterior deltoids. Change up the exercises fairly frequently so that you don't get into a rut. For maximum gain, be sure to combine heavy sets with brief rest times.Switch up your repetition ranges. Some days, try to overload your deltoids with a heavy set of low reps. Other days, perform high rep sets with a slightly lower weight.

Get or make a wrist roller.,
Start with a very light weight, and increase the weight gradually.,
Hold the rod in front of you.,
Rotate the rod.,
Rotate the weight back down.",How to Build Forearm Muscles1," This is simply a bar or rod with a rope tied around its midpoint. The other end of the rope is attached to a weight. This simple piece of equipment is one of the most effective ways to build forearm muscle and train grip strength.;
, Most people cannot lift nearly as much with their wrist as they can with their full arm. Find the weight where a set is challenging, but not painful or extremely difficult., Grip the rod in both hands and hold it in front of you at around waist level. Since this position is not difficult to maintain, your wrists will be the limiting factor of the exercise. This lets you repeat the wrist roller exercise as long as your wrists are holding up.You can extend your arms straight in front of you instead to work your lower arms and shoulders as well, but this will likely limit the number of repetitions you can perform.

, Maintain your grip with one hand and turn the rod with the other to wind the rope around the rod. Alternate the turning and gripping hands until the rope is fully wound and the weight reaches the rod.


Try to keep the rod in position as you rotate it, without much tilting back and forth., Rotate the rod the other way until the rope is fully extended. Do this slowly and evenly. If the rod keeps slipping out of your grip, wrap a grip around the rod to reduce friction, or just focus on the upward motion.


Try 3 sets of 10 reps.

Hold the raise for two to three seconds with a slight bend in your elbow.,
Slowly lower your arms back to start position.,
Keep your arms away from your body.,
Repeat the move by raising your elbows up and out to the sides.,
Complete 10 – 12 reps per set.",How to Do a Lateral Raise," Select a few different dumbbell sizes to experiment with lifting. Make sure you can lift the dumbbell comfortably and repeatedly. Your focus for lateral raises will be building muscle tone, not on lifting heavy weights.


While dumbbells are most popularly used for this exercise, they are not a requirement for doing lateral raises. You can use a resistance band if you’d prefer not to use dumbbells.
The main difference between using a resistance band versus free weights is that with a resistance band, you will use your feet to keep the band in place as you pull up on the ends of the band. Your form and technique should be the same as it is with free weights.Selecting the correct weight is important and key for lateral raises, but do not get caught up with finding the perfect weight. Using a lighter weight will cause tension and resistance with the more reps you do each set.;
, Keep your legs shoulder-width apart, hip-width apart or in a split-stance position to keep your body stable., The arm can be straight (but not locked) during this exercise. If you are using dumbbells, you can also bend your elbow at a 90° angle (do not bend the elbow to 90° if you are using a resistance band).

, This will prepare you to work out your medial or middle deltoids, which is the muscle group you want to target while performing lateral raises.


Grab a bench if you prefer to do lateral raises sitting down. Set the incline in the seat between 15 and 60 degrees before starting the lateral raises.

, Pull your shoulder blades down and back. You should feel a slight tension in your shoulders, which is completely normal.

, Turn the palms of your hands inward so that they are facing your body. Keep your thumbs wrapped around the dumbbell handles, or turned toward the ceiling if you want to work out different muscle groups.


Get your torso ready for the raises by tightening your abs and core muscles.
If you are using a resistance band, stand on the center of the band and take a handle or end of the band in each hand. There should be some tension in the band., Slowly lift each dumbbell out to the sides, like wings, until your arms are almost parallel to the ground, almost at shoulder-height. Slowly exhale as you use the muscles in the top of your shoulder to lift the dumbbells.Keep your head straight and aligned with your spine.
It the lats are engaged, and the shoulder blades are retracted (as they are supposed to be), it is impossible to lift the arms above shoulder height. If the arms go above shoulder height, the lats are not engaged. If you are doing the exercise correctly, your arms will not go higher than the shoulders.
If you are using a resistance band, lift the ends of the band as you raise your arms to shoulder-height or just slightly below., Allow yourself to build a little tension in your shoulder, making the workout more effective. Keep your core engaged and stabilized.Do not flex your wrists or position your arm so that your wrists are higher than your elbows (they should be roughly at the same height or in line). If your wrists are held too high you will shift the work away from your shoulders.To prevent this, imagine the dumbbell is actually a bottle of water and you are tilting it forward to pour out the water.

, Take two to three seconds to slowly lower the dumbbells back down to your start position, steadily inhaling as you go. Your movement should be slow and controlled.


If you are using a resistance band, slowly lower your hands back to the starting position. Do not allow the tension in the band to pull your arm back for you — this should be a controlled movement., Elevating the arms from the sides of your body will keep the stress on your deltoids.


Don’t allow your arms to touch your body when you reach the bottom of the movement.

, Lead with your elbows so that they’re the highest part of your arm when you do the raise. Your elbows should lead the lift to keep the workout concentrated on your deltoids.Concentrate on how your muscles relax and contract when you do the raise.

, Keep the reps slow and consistent to build resistance in your arms. Repeat until you’ve completed a minimum of three sets.Aim to complete three sets three days a week, for at least six weeks to start seeing results.
Increase or decrease the number of reps you do per set to change your level of difficulty.

Lift a heavy dumbbell or kettle bell in each hand.,
Stand up straight.,
Start walking.",How to Build Forearm Muscles2," This exercise is geared toward working your forearm muscle endurance by maximizing the time under tension.Start by lifting the dumbbells or kettle bells of your preference. Since “heavy” is relative to your routine, try a weight heavier than you would try to curl but not so heavy that you have to strain. You can always add more or less as needed.


If you really want to maximize this workout, instead of barbells or kettle bells, lift two weight plates pinched together in each hand instead. You will have to work your grip—and therefore forearms—extra hard to keep the plates pinched together so they don’t fall.If you want to try loading even more weight into this exercise, try using a trap bar instead. With a trap bar, you can stand in the middle and lift the weight with both arms, which allows you to carry much more than your arms working individually., In order to put the brunt of the weight on the correct muscle groups, you want to brace your abs, keep your chest up, and keep your shoulders back.If you hunch, you’ll divert too much of the strain to your upper arms or back.

, The natural movement and inertia from walking will work your forearms much more than simply standing in place holding the weights, so start walking. Try this workout in sets of twenty yards to start with, or whatever you find comfortable. Increase the length of time gradually. Walking for a long time or using heavy weights before you are ready can cause a shoulder injury."

Sit at the edge of your workout bench.,
Lift an appropriate dumbbell or kettle bell in each hand.,
Rest your elbow on your thigh with your arm flat.,
Curl the weight by moving only your wrist up and toward you.,
Repeat for 12-15 repetitions.",How to Build Forearm Muscles3," This exercise requires you to be in a sitting stationary position, so take a seat at the edge of your workout bench. You also want to have your feet flat and your knees shoulder-width apart., Since this is specifically targeting your wrists and forearms, you will want to start with less weight than you typically use for full-arm curls. You can start with as little as five-pound weights in each hand and increase them incrementally if they prove far too easy.


If you prefer, you can always work just one forearm at a time, which means you can pick up just one weight. Make sure you do the same number of sets and repetitions with each forearm to ensure an equal workout.

, By resting your arm on your leg, you put the majority of the weight on your forearm instead of your bicep. This position also braces your arm, which allows you to perform the curls with less risk of injury.

, Each rep of this workout requires curling the weight up and toward you and then back down. You additionally want to ensure that you breathe out while curling the weight and that you inhale while lowering it.To get the most out of this exercise, try performing sets of both upward and downward wrist curls. Upward means your palm is facing up, so the weight rests against it. Downward means your palm is facing down, so the weight rests mostly against your fingers. Each direction will work different forearm muscle groups., If you have chosen the ideal amount of weight for this exercise, then you should be able to do a set of twelve-to-fifteen repetitions and just barely be able to perform the final one."
"
Sit with your forearms down on a flat bench.,
Lift up the barbell with both hands.,
Lower your wrists.,
Curl the barbell up and toward you.,
Do 12-15 repetitions.,
Flip your arms over and do the curls downward.",How to Build Forearm Muscles4," For this exercise, you want to place your forearms flat with your hands and wrists protruding off the edge of the bench.If you use a standard workout bench, you can simply kneel to the side of it in order to rest your forearms on the bench—just make sure to put something down to cushion your knees.

, In order to balance the weight, you want your hands roughly shoulder-width apart to form your grip on the barbell. To start, use a standard grip with your palms facing upward.Again, the ideal amount of weight is going to vary by person. You should aim for an amount that allows you to do twelve-to-fifteen repetitions before tiring out.

, The starting position is going to be with your wrists lowered so that the barbell is hanging low in your grip.

, With a slow, controlled motion, you want to curl the barbell up and toward you. By moving the barbell slowly, you maximize the gain on each repetition. You want to curl your wrists all the way, bringing the barbell as close to you while only using your wrists as possible, before letting it back down.At the apex of this motion, you will feel the hard squeeze in your forearms., As with the individual wrists routine, you want to do twelve-to-fifteen reps in your set before stopping. If you cannot do this many, try curling less weight.

, This is another workout that you can do with either upward or downward curls. To work a different forearm muscle group, turn your arms over on the bench so your palms face downward. Then lift the barbell back up and do the curls so you can see the backs of your hands.

"
"
Increase the girth of your grip.,
Use a hammer grip whenever possible.,
Use handgrips while away from the gym.",How to Build Forearm Muscles5," You can additionally increase the workout on each forearm by enlarging the grip on your barbells and dumbbells. You can purchase a fitness product tailored to go over the bar or simply wrap a towel around it. The larger grip area forces you to squeeze harder to maintain your hold, which in turn works your forearms even more., Utilizing a hammer grip for other exercises will also increase the workout on your forearms. A hammer grip is when the palm faces inward rather than up. You can use a hammer grip with dumbbells or even two-handed workouts such as chin-ups. By using a hammer grip, less weight rests on your palms, which forces you to grip more tightly., A good old-fashioned pair of hand grips with the metal tension coil at the top are an easy way to work forearm muscles while multitasking. Alternatively, you can squeeze a spare tennis ball or racquetball that you have around as well. Anything dealing with isolating and working your hand grip will work your forearm muscles.

Use an EZ curl bar if possible.,
Start with the base round of seven reps.,
Move the movement up for the second seven reps.,
Do the final round of seven reps.,
Decrease weight as necessary.,
Allow yourself rest days.",How to Build Arm Muscle with 21s1," People generally do 21s biceps curls with an EZ bar. This bar looks wavy and may be shorter than its straight counterpart. Use an EZ bar if you are able. This can minimize the risk of wrist or forearm pain.Recognize that you can use a straight bar or dumbbells if you don’t have an EZ bar.
Grab the EZ or straight bar using an underhand grip. Stand with your feet about hip width apart.
Allow your arms to hang towards the floor and keep your elbows tucked in as you go through each set of seven reps.;
, The point of 21s is to make sure you build arm strength along the short and long head of your biceps. You’ll do a total of three rounds of seven reps of each progression for a total of 21s. Your first round of 7s targets the longer head of your biceps. You’ll go from the bottom of your movement to the halfway point for seven reps.Begin holding your choice of weight with your arms extended downward. Engage your biceps and go from the bottom of the movement to the halfway point. You should end with your arms at a 90-degree angle at the elbow level.
Repeat this movement for six more reps for a total of seven.

, The second progression of the 21s targets the short head of your biceps. This time you’ll start at the halfway point and curl to the top of your bicep.Start with your arms holding your chosen weight at a 90-degree angle. Your hands should be at elbow level. Engage your arm muscles and curl your arms to the top of your biceps. Your hands should be at shoulder level.
Repeat for six more reps for a total of seven.

, The final progression of 21s target both heads. It goes through your entire range of motion to help build your arm strength. Start at the bottom of the movement with your arms extended downward. Then engage your arm muscles and curl your arms through 90-degrees to the top of your biceps. Lower the weight back to starting position and repeat for six more reps., The 21s exercise is not easy, especially if you perform it properly. It will tire you out and make your arms burn. Because of the strain 21s can cause, it’s advisable to decrease the amount you’re lifting by 25%. For example, if you normally do bicep curls at 20 pounds, reduce the weight to 15 pounds.Recognize that decreasing weight doesn’t mean you’ll lose strength. In fact, you may find you get stronger faster with 21s.

, You may be tempted to use 21s every day to build maximum strength. This can actually hinder your results in the long run. Giving yourself time to rest allows your muscles to grow stronger. Take a couple rest days per week for maximum benefit from 21s.Focus on triceps or the bigger muscle groups in your back, chest, buttocks and legs, and don’t forget to include cardio on days you don’t do 21s.

Do dead hangs.,
Do dead hangs into chin-ups.,
Do finger and wrist push backs.",How to Build Forearm Muscles6," Some people may prefer using their own bodyweight as the main resistance while building muscle since bodyweight workouts are easier to do at home and don’t require gym equipment. Dead hangs are simply holding onto something above you and supporting your bodyweight with your grip alone. Since the tension is on your grip, you squeeze harder the longer you hang and work forearm muscles.The larger the surface you choose to grip, the harder you will have to squeeze, so something wider than a typical chin-up bar will work your forearms harder., For a harder, advanced workout, you can do a dead hang of several seconds at the bottom of every chin-up. The pause will ensure that you’re not using any body swing or inertia to start the next chin-up as well.

, You can do this exercise either leaning against a bar or a table, or you can do it on the ground in a push-up position (which will be harder). Lean your weight against the surface, and use your wrists and fingers to push your weight back off the surface.In a push-up position, for instance, you will not bend at the elbows to lower yourself; instead, keep your elbows straight and use your wrists and fingers to push off the ground and lift yourself even higher.You can add this extra movement onto each normal push-up to get more out of every repetition as well.

Lift dumbbells for your 21s biceps curls.,
Curl with resistance bands.,
Perform pushups.,
Try pull ups.,
Do overhead presses.,
Build your triceps with dips.,
Pay attention to signs of injury.",How to Build Arm Muscle with 21s2," If you don’t have a bar, you can also use dumbbells or other free weights to do your 21s. You may also prefer dumbbells if you want to lift lower weights.Use kettlebells if you prefer them over dumbbells or other types of free weights.
Grasp your dumbbells or kettlebells with your palms facing outward. Stand with your feet about hip width apart. Lift the weights towards your body in a curling motion and keep your elbows tucked as you curl the weights.

, You may prefer not using weights to build your arm muscles using 21s. If so, then you can also try using resistance bands. These rubber bands come in different resistance that you can use to build your strength.Use the same progression and method with resistance bands as you do with bars and dumbbells. Stand with your feet hip width apart and grasp the bands using an underhand grip. Make sure to keep your elbows tucked through all three ranges of motion.
If your gym has cable weights, then you can also do 21s this way. Set the weight to the desired amount and then grasp the cable weight handles and do bicep curls.

, In addition to building your biceps, you also need to develop other arm muscles such as the triceps and shoulders. This will ensure you have balanced strength in your arms. This can also ensure that you look toned.Pushups are a great way to build strength in your arms and upper body. They target the muscles of your arms, chest, and shoulders. They also help develop back and abdominal muscles.Extend your arms completely and place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders so that you’re in plank position. Keep your elbows pointing towards your ribs rather than having them stick out like chicken wings. Keep your shoulders square and your shoulder blades retracted as you lower your body down. Your chest should almost reach the floor. Make sure to engage your abs and leg muscles for core and leg strength.
Do half-plank/knee pushups if you can’t perform full pushups.

, They may be daunting, but pull ups are very good at building arm and upper body strength. Use different grips or pull up variations to develop your arm, shoulder, and back strength.Hold onto an overhead bar. Use the most comfortable grip for you— narrow or wide. Hanging from the bar, engage your upper body muscles and abs. Pull up until your chin is above the bar.
Consider alternatives until you build enough strength to do full pull ups. Put a box under your feet and, holding the bar, jump and pull up until your chin clears the bar.

, Lifting weights above your head is another great way to develop arm and shoulder strength. Lift your chosen weight directly above your head to get maximum muscle development.Use free weights, resistance bands, or a weighted bar. The weight should challenge you while still being comfortable. Grasp the weight slightly wider than your shoulders. Stand upright with your feet hip distance apart. Engage your core as you press the weight straight upward until your arms are straight. Lower the weight and repeat for a total of 10 to 12 reps.
Work towards a goal of three sets of 10 to 12 reps.

, Triceps dips are a great way to build the muscles on the opposite side of your arm. They can also develop strength in the gluteals and hamstrings.Sit on the edge of a chair or bench with your back straight and feet flat on the floor. Grasp the front edge of the chair and have your palms facing away from you. Walk your feet out to a position where your back lightly brushes against the seat. Retract your shoulder blades and keep them retracted to prevent shoulder injury.
Bend your elbows and slowly lower down your body until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle. Straighten your elbows to push back up.
Repeat 10 to 12 times for one set. Aim towards a goal of three sets.

, Even if you are very safe when you build your arm strength, you can still injure yourself. You may feel something odd or hear noises with certain movements. Paying attention to the signs of injury can help you get prompt treatment and get you back to building your arm strength as soon as possible. Get medical treatment if you experience any signs of injury including:Pain in any part of the arm
Snapping or popping sensations
Swelling
Trouble moving
Strange noises when you perform exercises

Have somebody hold your feet down, or wedge them underneath something heavy. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades. Keep your back straight (no hunching). Lower yourself down. Repeat.


Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench. Do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights.;
, Lie on the floor (with or without a mat) with your arms in front of your chest or with your hands lightly touching your temples (never behind your head). Bend your knees. Raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles.


It is very important to not lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain. Additionally, the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster.
The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off the floor. Concentrate on lifting up more than curling forward. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor, exhale through your mouth and end with your shoulders are off the floor.
Pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. Lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground.

, Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a 90 degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor.


For more of a challenge, use a parallel bar at a gym to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs.


Easy: Just raise your knees to your chest.

Medium: Raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight and outstretched. This helps firm up the lower abdomen.

Hard: If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or, hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar, keeping your legs straight.



, Lie down flat with your back on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold, bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. ""spread out"") and repeat.


Don't let momentum bring you down. Slowly put your hands and feet back on the ground. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it.

, Start in the push-up position, except with your elbows and forearms on the floor. With your elbows and forearms resting on the ground, slowly lift your rear as high up into the air as possible. Your body will look like a mountain, with your glutes being the peak. Slowly lower the glutes back down into the starting position, being careful not to sag the back below the hips.

, Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and your whole body flat. This position is also known as the plank, and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place. Hold this position for as long as possible.


Beginners should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers are known to achieve over 5 minute static holds.
To perform the side static hold, roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before. This time, only one arm should be on the ground, with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non weight-bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible.

, It's not as important to work on your oblique muscles at first, but eventually you'll want to start working these too. These are the muscles on either side of your stomach. There are multiple ways to do this and anything that includes twisting your torso against a resistance counts. There are twisting machines at gyms; you can twist while you do sit-ups; you can do side bends; you can twist side to side with a medicine ball in hand, etc. Be aware though, that many beginners tend to have weak obliques compared to their abs (it simply isn't used as much in daily life) so go easy on the sides at first.


Do bicycle crunches. Lift your feet off the ground while doing the crunches by alternating each leg in the air. Bring your left knee up toward your right shoulder and then your right knee toward your left shoulder. Extend the other leg out straight so the heel almost touches the floor.

, Some possibilities include:


Use a stability ball. Do your crunches on the ball to introduce instability to your workout, which will improve your balance and offer support for people with mild lower back issues.

, Hold the ab roller while kneeling down on the floor. Slowly push the ab roller out away from your body, extending your arms. Go down as far as you can without touching your torso to the ground. Yours arms should be well outstretched above your head.


Try a barbell ab rollout if you don't have an ab roller. Use an Olympic barbell loaded with 5 or 10 pounds on each side. Get into pushup position, with your hands on the barbell instead of on the ground. Slowly lift your hips and bring the barbell back towards your legs, until your legs are perpendicular to the ground and your rear is all the way back. Go back down slowly and repeat.
Perform this exercise with caution and starting with a small forward reach. This exercise can tear the tendons and ligaments of the shoulder if performed without first building a strong core and chest.

, You will be amazed at the number of muscles around your stomach working with pull-ups. Do 5 pull-ups with your palms facing away from you and 5 pull-ups with your palms facing towards you. This will also build your lats and biceps at the same time.


Add complex core-movements to your workout. That will boost your overall body constitution tremendously. For example, combine push-ups with rows. Go into a push-up position on two dumbbells. Now don't do a push-up, but instead start to row alternating dumbbells. See how much power you need only to hold balance? Combine exercises! Be creative. Tension is your friend.

, Check out the various types of push ups like the standard push ups or knuckle push ups or even the diamond push ups, which ever you feel comfortable with.

, It is also known as reverse crunches, and it is the most extreme form of abdominal exercises, Bruce Lee and Sylvester Stallone have done this great workout. Lie on your back on a bench or bed, place your hands behind your head and hold onto the edge of the bench or bed. Balancing on the back of your shoulder blades and not applying full pressure on the back of your neck, tighten your abs like bracing yourself for a punch along with your legs and butt. Raise your legs and lower back off the surface and bring it down to 45 degree angle, not letting your butt touch the surface. Do not bend your hips when raising or declining.


This type of move places extreme strain on the neck and may be harmful, especially if done with poor form.

, To build really great abs it's helpful understand what abs do. Their full name is ""rectus abdominis.""The ""rectus"" bit is Latin for ""straight, proper, upright."" Contrary to popular opinion, the abdominals' primary job is not to curl you up into a ball, but rather to work together with the back muscles to maintain correct posture and stabilization. Some of the best exercises for abs are ones that force your entire core to go into overdrive to support your spine. Some exercises that do this are squats and deadlifts.

, In order to burn fat, you need to use up calories. Since there are about 3,500 calories in a pound, you need to burn about 3,500 more calories than you bring in with food or drink in order to lose one pound.It sounds simple, but it's actually quite hard.


Don't have unrealistic expectations. A vigorous, hour-long workout will only burn 800 - 1,000 calories. Luckily, being active helps, and if you burn between 600 and 800 more calories than you take in per day, you can expect to lose about one pound per week. You'll start seeing results in your abs quite quickly.
Understand this before you start trying to lose belly fat: There is no way to target fat loss in any one area of your body.(This is also called ""spot training."") Just like your body deposits fat in many different places, it burns fat in your entire body, not just from your abs or your thighs.

, You need to lose some of that extra fat over your abs. Even if you work out and get gigantic ab muscles, if there is still a layer of fat over them no one will ever get to see them. Cardio workouts are workouts that raise your heart rate for a given set of time. Some examples would be running, jogging, bike riding, dancing and rowing. Try cardio workouts often (3 to 5 times per week) for at least an hour at a time.


Try interval training. Interval training is short burst of furious activity alternating with periods of lower activity. Researchers think that interval training helps burn fat better than exercising at the same intensity for longer times: One study found that participants who practiced interval training on their bikes for only 20 minutes a day lost on average 4 more pounds, over 4 months, than participants who cycled at the same speed for 40 minutes a day., Meals later on in the day tend to get stored as fat not because your metabolism is beginning to shut down, but because late-night meals are often overly caloric snack foods such as pizza or ice cream that aren't worked off before you go to bed.Your metabolism works even while you sleep; the fact is that most people eat sweets and starches before bed rather than kale and spinach.


Try eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner. Fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite while offering healthful benefits. A handful of nuts might do the same.
Try drinking a large glass of water or tea right before sitting at the table. Your stomach will feel more full, allowing you to comfortably eat less.

, Many people skip breakfast because they don't have time for it. The harm of skipping breakfast from a weight loss perspective is twofold: it causes you to get hungrier later on, and it fails to jump start your metabolism.Eating a healthy breakfast will keep you from eating more later on and can not put increase your resting metabolism by as much as 10% — for the rest of the day!Try eating lean protein in the morning. Skip the bagels and cream cheese. Instead, try:

Omelet with spinach, turkey, and chipotle peppers.
Greek yogurt with blueberries, bananas, and flax seed.
Leftover salmon with whole-grain toast.


Avoid eating:

Sugary cereals.
Simple starches such as potatoes (hash browns, etc.) and refined wheat (white bread, etc.).
Smoothies. Low fat drinks don't always translate to lean physiques.



, The more muscle your body has, the more calories your body burns, even at rest.Plus, resistance training is important to limit the amount of muscle mass lost whilst reducing your calorie intake. If you only do cardiovascular exercises (running, playing basketball, football) without weight training, you may lose the muscle mass, including the muscle in your abs.

, While there isn't any scientific merit to the claim that eating six meals a day instead of three will help you lose weight, there are foods that will slow down your metabolism. Avoid these foods when possible:Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice.

Sugar, which is absorbed quickly, but which brings your metabolism to a crawl.

High-fat foods, such as fast food and fried food.

, To find out how much water you need to drink as a minimum per day, halve your weight (in pounds) and that is how many ounces of water you need to drink.So a 150 lb person would need to drink a minimum of 2.2 liters a day. It sounds like an absurd amount of water, but you get water from the food you eat, and you can drink teas to make up some of the quota.


Drinking too much water (several liters, especially while sweating) can dangerously dilute certain salts and minerals. If you are exercising heavily and sweating a lot, you will need to replace your salts as well as fluids. Supplement your water drinking with a sports drink or potassium rich fruits such as bananas and apples.

, In a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains.A diet rich in whole grains changes the glucose and insulin response in your body, which hastens the burning of fat.

, Doctors are beginning to dive deeper into information suggesting that hormones that control appetite are affected by sleep, or lack thereof.In one study, scientists compared individuals who got 5.5 hours of sleep per night, and individuals who got 8.5 hours of sleep per night. The individuals who slept 8.5 hours per night were able to lose more body fat than those who slept only 5.5 hours per night., Stress management, along with sleep, is helpful in pushing you toward your weight-loss goal.Participants in a study who slept at least 6 hours but no more than 8, and who had the lowest levels of stress, were more likely to lose weight than participants who reported higher levels of stress."

Purchase a power t shirt that looks like a regular t shirt but acts as girdle.,
Check your shirt size.,
Buy a collared shirt.,
Wear your overshirt.",How to Get Rid of Man Boobs1," Some brands include Chest FX which are currently the top of the line product that can be purchased online.;
, You may not have the time or the money to fix your gynecomastia permanently right now. If this is the case, the best solution you can hope for is to hide it a little bit with an overshirt and make it less obvious. If your breasts are too large, this won't work, but in most cases, it's an acceptable short-term answer to the problem for things like reunions and other brief public appearances. Begin by taking note of your shirt size.


You probably already know your T-shirt size, but write it down anyway.
Using a tape measure, find the girth of your neck to get a collar size. American collar sizes are displayed in inches on the tags of collared shirts. Write this number down, as it may come in handy at the store. To convert inches to a size classification, follow this rule of thumb:

14-15”: Small
15-16”: Medium
16-17”: Large
17-18”: Extra Large
18-19”: Extra Extra Large
Above 19”: 3XL, or specialty sizes not commonly available in department stores.


Measure your girth (around the stomach) and torso height as well. If either of these numbers are large, you may need to look for a tall-cut (“tall”) or wide-cut (“big”) shirt. These are generally available at specialty “big and tall” stores, as well as many of the larger department stores.

, Choose something that fits you well. It should be reasonably loose in the sleeves, and broad enough to be buttoned easily, though you won't be buttoning it.


Avoid “work shirts” (the type that often come in plastic boxes at department stores), as they are not meant to be worn unbuttoned and usually have a tail in the back for tucking into your pants that will look odd hanging free.
Avoid anything with an overly flashy screen print or pattern, such as flames, dice, or skulls. (Skulls with flaming dice for eyes, though quite entertaining as a concept, are also right out.) You'll look out of touch unless it's already a well-known part of your personal style, in which case you already own such shirts and don't need to be buying any more anyway.
Try different colors and patterns to find what suits you best. Silk and other clingy fabrics won't hide your man boobs as well as stiffer cloth, so choose a shirt made of such material at your own risk. Consider gingham, plaids, block-stripe prints, or Hawaiian shirts – whatever suits your taste and doesn't clash with the rest of your wardrobe.

, Be sure it is unbuttoned and untucked, and wear it over a T-shirt. (The T-shirt can be tucked or untucked, as you prefer.) Your overshirt will help hide your gynecomastia with reasonable effectiveness for social functions.


If the shirt alone isn't enough, consider the time-honored tomboy tradition of breast binding. Though uncomfortable, binding your breasts with tightly-pulled linen bandage cloth or a similar lightweight material is a very effective way to reduce their profile. By combining binding with an overshirt, all but the most severe cases of gynecomastia can be effectively, if temporarily, hidden.

Try side laterals.,
Perform upright rows with a wide grip.,
Try some rear deltoid raises.,
Perform front deltoid raises.,
Do overhead presses.,
Try wide-grip pull-ups.,
Perform pike-style push-ups.",How to Get Wider Shoulders1," One good exercise for building up your shoulder muscles is the side lateral raise. Start out with light weights and move up to heavier ones as you gain strength.









To perform this exercise, hold some dumbbells in each of your hands and place your arms against the sides of your body.
Then, raise the dumbbells up to they are parallel with your shoulders.
Do three sets of 6 to 10 repetitions.;
, Upright rows are also great for building wider shoulders. By performing upright rows with a wide grip, you can work the muscles on the outer edges of your shoulders and this may make it easier to widen your shoulders.









To perform upright rows, grasp a low cable bar. With an overhand grip, pull the bar straight up and back, leading with the shoulder, pulling the bar back.
Another option is to do rows using dumbbells. Stand next to a bench and place one knee on the bench. Then, place the hand on the same side of your body on the bench and grasp the dumbbell with your other hand. Pull the weight upwards lifting your elbow into the air behind you as you do so.
Do three sets of 6 to 10 repetitions, or as many as you can do before you can’t do any more.

, You can also work your rear deltoids to increase the width of your shoulders. These are similar to side deltoid raises, but you perform them while bent over.









To do rear deltoid raises, bend over so that your back is parallel with the ground.
Get a dumbbell in each hand that is light to moderate. The weight should not be so heavy you can’t lift it more than a few times.
Then, begin raising the dumbbells out and away from your body until they are almost parallel with your back.
Do three sets of 8 to 10 repetitions on each side.

, You also have deltoid muscles in the front of your shoulders, which you can work by performing front deltoid raises. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand.Starting with your hand close to your body, begin lifting the dumbbell upwards and in front of your body.
When the dumbbell is about at shoulder height, begin to lower it slowly back to its starting position.
Do three sets of 8 to 10 repetitions on each side.

, Pressing weights overhead will also help you to add bulk to your shoulders and make them look wider. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and holding a dumbbell in each of your hands.









To do the exercise, press the dumbbells straight upwards above your head and then bring them back down slowly.
Do three sets of 8 to 10 repetitions.

, If you want to work with your own body weight, then doing pull-ups is a great option. Pull-ups will work your shoulder muscles along with your arm and back muscles at the same time. Using a wide grip will enhance the shoulder work as well.Grasp a pull-up bar with your hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Then, pull your body weight upwards until your chin reaches the bar. Do as many pull-ups as you can.
If you can’t do regular pull-ups yet, then you can try doing assisted pull-ups with a machine. Most gyms have one of these machines. They use weights to counter your body weight and make the pull-up a little easier.

, Push-ups also use your body weight to work your upper body and core muscles. However, you can target your shoulder muscles more intensely if you do pike-style push-ups.To do pike-style push-ups you will need a weight lifting bench or a sturdy chair. Get into the push-up position in front of the bench or chair and then put your feet up on the chair.
Use your hands to walk your upper body back towards the chair until you are in the pike position, which is similar to a headstand, but with your feet on the bench or chair. Your body should be bent at the waist.
To do the exercise, lower your face down towards the ground by bending your arms. Then, when you are close to the ground, raise yourself back up.
Repeat this exercise 8 to 10 times and do three sets.
Keep in mind that this type of exercise should be done with caution because losing your grip or positioning for even a second could result in serious harm to the neck and spine.

Commit to losing weight.,
Make a plan.,
Follow your plan.",How to Get Rid of Man Boobs2," If you are overweight and suffer from man boobs, then your most sensible long-term option is to burn fat and lose weight. Once you start to lean up, you’ll burn off fat overall, including in your chest area. There's no guarantee that this will fix your gynecomastia, especially if it turns out to be a problem with mammary gland tissue rather than fat, but it's a lot cheaper than the next method and it will certainly help you to feel better about yourself either way.

, At the most basic level, weight gain and loss are both controlled by caloric intake. If you burn more calories in a day than you take in through eating and drinking, you will lose weight (and vice versa). This means that any successful weight loss plan must combine a healthy, portion-controlled diet with plenty of exercise.


Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and martial arts, burns more calories per hour than most resistance exercise (weightlifting). On the other hand, building your muscle strength through resistance training will cause your body to burn calories faster in general, and especially when engaged in aerobic exercise. It is best to incorporate both types of exercise into your regimen.
Forget spot reduction. Bench presses, push ups, and similar exercises, though important, will NOT “spot reduce” chest fat. Remember, fat only burns off when your body needs to burn more calories than you have given it with food and drinks. Just focus on spending more calories than you save, and the rest will take care of itself.
Maintain dietary balance. As you control and reduce the amount of calories you consume, it is easy to lean towards a few food items and neglect balancing your diet. The fact is, the less energy you're taking in through food, the more careful you'll need to be to ensure that the food you do eat is providing balanced nutrition. You can read about recommended intake levels of various nutrients online and go from there. Alternatively, a dietitian can prepare a customized meal plan for you to follow.

, Don't deviate from the routine you've set up for yourself. Bad habits form overnight, but turning a healthy lifestyle into a habit can take months. Be strict with yourself and push through the uncomfortable transition period until your new lifestyle becomes second nature to you. As you become fitter and leaner, your excess fat will slowly melt away, reducing your breast size and increasing your confidence.


Be patient. Real fitness takes time. There are no healthy shortcuts. Crash diets only cause your weight to yo-yo, so be sure to avoid the temptation of short-term results or you might end up in worse shape than when you started.
Work with yourself. It's important to be strict about not deviating from your diet and exercise plan, but if you do, don't get depressed and give up. Instead, vow not to do it again and pick up where you left off.

Save money.,
Understand the risks.,
Undergo surgery.,
Recover and enjoy.",How to Get Rid of Man Boobs3," The absolute most effective and permanent way to eradicate gynecomastia for good is through elective cosmetic surgery (plastic surgery). Surgery to reduce breast size is called reduction mammoplasty in the medical world. A skilled surgeon can open up the breasts, examine them, and remove the offending tissue. Unfortunately, gynecomastia isn't exactly a life-threatening medical condition, which means you'll have to pay for it yourself. Assume a cost of at least $5,000; call your chosen practitioner for a more accurate estimate.

, For many men with gynecomastia, surgery is the only way to completely get rid of it. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that male breast reduction surgery, like all surgery, has some inherent risks. Speak with your surgeon ahead of time and be sure you're completely clear about potential complications during and after the surgery. Follow any advice he or she gives you to the letter to minimize your risk.

, The surgery will begin with anesthesia, and then take one of two directions.


Liposuction: If the source of the gynecomastia is primarily fatty deposits, liposuction will be used to remove them and lower the profile of the breasts.
Excision: In cases where mammary glands are causing the condition, the excess tissue from them will be carefully excised with a blade.

, Recovery from reduction mammoplasty typically takes some time, as the incisions need to heal and scar, and any fluids building up underneath them will need to be drained. However, this surgery is not considered particularly invasive, so any hospital stay is likely to be minimal. Your surgeon will give you specific recovery instructions; follow them closely. Be aware that the surgery will leave faintly visible permanent scars, typically on the underside of the breast area.

Wear shoulder pads.,
Choose clothing that fits well.,
Try some horizontal stripes.,
Opt for white shirts.,
Dress in layers.",How to Get Wider Shoulders2," Shoulder pads are a classic solution to narrow or small shoulders. Some clothes come with built in shoulder pads, such as blazers and coats.You might also be able to get away with putting shoulder pads on under a thick sweater.



Be careful not to overstuff with shoulder pads or they will look too obvious.

, Baggy clothing can actually make your shoulders look narrower, so it is best to avoid it. Instead, choose clothing that fits you well, such as fitted jeans and shirts.It is especially important to choose clothing that is fitted around your waist because this can help to create the V-shape that makes your shoulders look wider.

, Wearing horizontal stripes across your chest and shoulders can also make your shoulders look wider. Try wearing a sweater that has a stripe or two going across the chest and/or shoulder area., White can make you seem like you have wider shoulders as well by making the top half of your body appear larger.Try wearing white dress shirts and t-shirts to see if this enhances the size of your shoulders.


, You can take advantage of the effects of layering your clothes in the winter to give the look of wider shoulders. Try wearing a sweater over a long sleeved shirt, or layer a t-shirt over a waffle shirt.You can also try wearing two or three t-shirts in warmer weather to create this effect. However, make sure that the collars or sleeves of the other shirts don’t peak out or it may look odd. Wear a larger shirt over the others to hide the edges.

Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Stand up straight.,
Work on your confidence.",How to Get Wider Shoulders3," Carrying extra weight around your waist can make your shoulders look smaller in comparison. Along with sculpting your shoulder muscles, try to lose weight to decrease the circumference of your waist. This will help to create a V-effect and make your shoulders look wider.To lose weight, you will need to reduce your overall caloric intake so that you are eating fewer calories than you burn. Try keeping a log of everything you eat to determine how many calories you consume and cut down as needed.
Fill up on non-starchy vegetables, such as green beans, cauliflower, peppers, and zucchini to help reduce your overall caloric intake. You can also replace fatty proteins with lean proteins, such as skinless chicken, turkey burgers, tofu, and eggs.

, Good posture can make you seem thinner and enhance your shoulders at the same time.Stand up straight with your chest out and shoulders back to make them look wider.



Throughout the day remind yourself to correct your posture, such as by placing a note on your desk or by setting an alarm on your phone.

, Exuding confidence can affect the way that people see you. Being confident is also helpful for feeling good about yourself. If your confidence is low, then work on building it up so that you can look and feel your best.Try writing yourself a letter from the perspective of someone who cares about you and wants to boost your confidence.What would that person say? Which of your strengths might he/she point out? After you write this letter, try reading over it once a day to help boost your confidence.

Do push ups.,
Get into bench pressing.,
Do bar dips.,
Focus on the pecs separately.",How to Get Bigger Chest Muscles (Pecs)1," This often-neglected exercise focuses on building up your shoulder and upper chest muscles. Lie face-down on the floor and start with your hands about shoulder-width apart, with your legs stretched behind you. Push your body up from the floor with your hands until your elbows are straight, then lower yourself until your arms reach a 90 degree bend.









Do 3 sets of 15 push-ups, or as many as you can before growing fatigued. Add more reps as you gain strength.
Push ups also work your triceps and shoulders (deltoids).
Try this variation: elevate your legs by placing your feet on a block or step before doing the exercise. This puts emphasis on your shoulders and upper chest.;
, This is the most popular chest building exercise of all time, and for good reason. Load a barbell with weights appropriate for your strength level. Remember, it's always better to start too light and adjust than to risk injury by starting too heavy. Lie on a bench with your feet flat on the floor. Lower the barbell down to chest until you reach about 1"" from your chest, then lift it straight above your chest.









To build muscle mass and hypertrophy it is best to do between 8-12 reps of 1-3 sets.
You can also do incline bench presses by using an inclined bench. This is the same as bench pressing, only it focuses more on your upper pectoral muscles. Decline bench presses focus more on your lower pectoral muscles. Most people don't perform this exercise but it is essential in obtaining a full and rounded chest.

, Stand in front of a wide-grip parallel bar. Pull the bar down and slowly raise it back up. This can be a strenuous exercise that gives you some trouble in the beginning. But it’s one of the best pec workout movements you can do to build lots of chest muscle fast.








, Lie down in the push up position and push up. Hold for 3 seconds, then transfer all your weight to your right hand and foot. Stick your left hand and foot up in the air as if you are doing a sideways jumping jack. Hold for 3 seconds. Repeat with your left hand and foot. Again, hold for 3 seconds.

Eat the right foods.",How to Build Massive Arms," Get most of your work in the gym done through major compound lifts. These include the bench press, pull ups, rows, dips, etc. Compound movements target multiple muscle groups at once, rather than isolating a single muscle. They also help you become stronger, which will increase the amount of specialized arm training you can perform.A solid training program with compound exercises as its foundation will allow you to build a balanced, functional physique, rather than a merely aesthetic one.
A simple way to organize your workouts is the traditional bodybuilding split, in which you train two or three related muscle groups during a given workout (for example, a “push” split would focus on chest and triceps, while a “pull” split would utilize the lats, deltoids and biceps).;
, When it comes time to emphasize the biceps, pick one or two exercises to include at the end of your workouts. Some good choices are EZ bar curls, preacher/concentration curls and cable curls. The biceps are smaller muscles and only have a secondary function in the compound lifts, meaning they’ll need to be trained directly more often if you want them to grow.Wait until you’ve finished your strength-focused compound movements before getting into higher volume accessory exercises.
The biceps are stubborn when it comes to increasing their size. They require quite a bit of isolation work with high numbers of sets and repetitions.

, Following a grueling chest workout, dedicate some time to working your triceps. Lifts like skull crushers, overhead tricep extensions and close-grip pushups are efficient at singling out the triceps muscles, which serve to extend the arms. As a bonus, tricep-specific training will add pounds to your bench press and ratchet up the number of dips you can bang out.The triceps are the single largest muscle group in the upper arm, so developing your triceps goes a long way toward building massive arms.
Contraction of the triceps is key to all major pushing movements.

, What good are sculpted biceps and triceps if your forearms remain the same size? Luckily, it’s easy to benefit the lower arm muscles while doing compound exercises that challenge your grip, such as deadlifts, pull ups and farmer’s walks. Thick, powerful forearms complete the impressive appearance of a svelte physique.Any exercise that requires you to hold onto heavy weight for a lengthy period of time will be effective at building your forearms.

, There’s a lot of debate about whether it’s better to focus on strength or volume (the total amount of work you do) in order to build muscle, but in reality you need both. Build your strength levels by performing 3-4 sets of heavy compound lifts (bench press, weighted dips/pull up and row variations will all do the job), then switch your focus in the latter part of the workout to doing multiple sets of higher reps for your accessory work.Though training methods differ slightly, there is a close relationship between strength and size. Being able to lift more weight means you can lift heavier weights more times, driving up your total volume and, in turn, your mass-gaining potential.

, One core principle for building muscle mass that has stood the test of time is that of ""progressive overload""—continuing to challenge yourself and see results by adding weight or volume (or both) over time. If you can perform an exercise for 10 reps with a given weight one week, set your sights on 12 reps the next, or stick with 10 reps while using a heavier weight. This way, you can program progress into your training by guaranteeing that you're always pushing yourself to do more.Progressive overload is most effective when you take small steps consistently: one extra rep here, a couple additional pounds there. Trying to add too much weight or volume at one time makes you more likely to fail, which can be discouraging and lead to plateaus.
Cycle between adding weight and adding volume to steadily maximize your growth potential., Sidestep the common pitfall of overtraining by dedicating only a single workout to training your arms during the week. On “arm day,” pick 2-4 lifts each for the biceps and triceps and do each lift for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps. Many people make the mistake of trying to do too much. This means they’re just breaking down muscle without giving themselves time to rebuild it.A typical arm workout will consist mostly of bicep curl and tricep extension variations that hit the muscles at slightly different angles.
Schedule your dedicated arm session right before a rest day to give yourself at least 24 hours to recover.

, No matter what exercise you’re performing, always work through a full range of motion. Go from full extension to full contraction with each repetition, and make each part of the lift smooth and controlled. By using a greater range of motion, you put more strain on the muscle fibers. The physiological response to this stress is what causes muscles to grow.Studies have demonstrated that a full range of motion stimulates significantly more muscle growth than partial movements.Prevent injury to your joints by stopping just short of lockout (hyper-extension).

, As a general guideline, select a weight you can lift 8-15 times in a set while doing isolation exercises. With each contraction, blood will be forced into the muscle, causing it to become firm and engorged. This is commonly referred to as a “pump.” Not only will getting pumped make you look bigger, it also plays a role in muscle growth by transporting valuable nutrients to the muscles while moving waste products out.Squeeze the muscle tight at the end of each rep to pump as much blood into it as possible.

, Take one or two days off every week. Rest is integral to the muscle-building process because it gives your body a chance to catch up and repair itself. Get quality, restful sleep at night and do a little light cardio or stretching to help ease soreness. Once you’ve had some time to rest, you’ll be ready to hit it hard when you get back in the gym.In most cases, soreness is a good thing. It’s a sign that muscle tissue that has been broken down is being built back up.Get to bed on time. Most of the body’s growth and repair takes place while you’re asleep.

, Your diet should contain an ample amount of protein from lean, natural sources. Some foods that are high in protein include lean cuts of meat, fish, eggs, nuts, legumes, tofu and dairy products like milk and yogurt. The body takes whole proteins and breaks them down into amino acids, which are then used to construct new muscle tissue.Try to get somewhere around 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your body weight (if you’re 160lbs, for example, that’s roughly 70-80g per day).Think of protein as the payment your muscles receive in return for all the work they perform.

, In addition to the protein you get from food, consider using protein shakes, bars or other supplements to increase the total amount you receive each day. It can sometimes be difficult to hit the numbers you need to grow, especially if you’re not all that hungry. A fast-absorbing whey protein shake will offer an extra 25-40 grams per serving, giving you a decisive edge when it comes to piling on size.Having a shake during or immediately after a workout provides much-needed protein to feed and replenish your muscles.Protein supplements can also work as meal replacement options when you’re in a pinch. Have a protein bar before you go to bed or during times when you know you won't be able to eat for a while to keep your muscles stocked with a steady supply of amino acids.

, In order to grow, you have to eat. This means going hard at the dinner table as well as in the gym. Aim to consume a moderately sized meal or protein-rich snack 4-5 times a day. Let all the major nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, healthy fats, fiber) be represented in your daily intake. A lot of people trying to add muscle don’t get the results they're after because they simply don't eat enough.The exact number of calories you should ingest depends on many different factors, such as height, weight, body composition, metabolism, and activity level. Trust the expertise of a physician or nutritionist to recommend an optimal amount of calories to help you gain muscle.
Exercise is only half the battle. No matter how hard you’re working out, if you don’t get enough to eat, you won’t get any bigger.

, The amount of calories you receive is important, but what form they arrive in also makes a difference. Choose lean meats, fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains over french fries and milkshakes. Not only do wholesome foods contain more vital nutrients, they’re also generally lower in calories, which means you can eat as often as you need to without having to worry about going hungry.Feasting on candy, fried food and other junk can cause you to exceed your ideal calorie threshold fast. Since these foods are so dense with calories, you can easily eat way too much of them before you feel satisfied.

Do bench presses.,
Try dumbbell hex presses.,
Include twisting dumbbell presses.,
Try weighted push-ups.",How to Build Pectoral Muscles1," To do bench presses, you will need a barbell and a bench. Lie back and grasp the bar with your hands shoulder-distance apart. Lower the bar all the way down to your chest and then slowly press it straight up until your arms are fully extended. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps and increase the number of reps and the weight as you gain strength.Check the weight of the bar itself, which should be engraved or printed somewhere on it. The barbell usually weighs 45 pounds, so if you are a beginner, you may just want to start by bench pressing the bar and then add weight as you gain strength.
If you’re new to lifting or lifting a large amount of weight, have someone to spot you in case you need help returning the bar to the rack.
Pressing on an inclined bench will maximize pec involvement.;
, You will need two light dumbbells and a flat bench. Lie back with the dumbbells in your hands. Rest the dumbbells on your chest so they are touching and your elbows are pointing out. Slowly press straight up while keeping the dumbbells in contact with each other. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps and increase the number of reps and the weight as you find comfortable.Keep your shoulders back during the press to maximize pec involvement.

, You will need two light dumbbells and an incline bench. Lie back with the dumbbells in your hands and your elbows bent. Hold the dumbbells as if you’re going to do a bench press. Then, begin to press the dumbbells straight up. As you press up, slowly twist your wrists so that your palms are facing each other. Hold this position at the peak for 2 second before twisting your wrists back to the starting position and slowly lowering the dumbbells back down. Start with 3 sets of 10 reps and increase the number of reps and weight as you find comfortable.Keep your shoulders back during the press to maximize pec involvement.

, Get a flat weight and a clear floor space. Place the weight on your back near your shoulder blades and position your feet so they are shoulder-length apart. Perform 3 sets of 10 push-ups and increase the number of reps and the weight as you find comfortable.Do this as a close grip push up to maximize the focus on your pecs. This means keeping your hands closer together than you would for a normal push up. Place them about 8 inches or roughly two hand-lengths apart.

Start with bent over dumbbell rows, the most basic of back exercises, in case you’re starting from ABSOLUTELY square one.,
Move on to body weight rows.,
Do assisted pull ups.,
Do negative pull ups.,
Do your first pull up.,
Once you’re able to do 3 sets of 10 pull ups or chin ups, you have a few options:

Continue to get better at doing more reps – 3 sets of 12, 3 sets of 15, 3 sets of 20, etc.",How to Do Your First Pull Up," For these exercises, focus on lifting more and more as you get stronger. Every OTHER day, pick up a dumbbell that you can lift for three sets of 8 repetitions with a 2 minute break between sets. As soon as you can do 3 sets of 8 reps, it’s time to move up to a heavier dumbbell.


As soon as you can do dumbbell rows with at least a 25-pound (10kg) dumbbell or heavier, consider moving up to the next level.






If you are a little bit bigger than the average bear, you might want to stick with this step until you lose a little bit more weight and get stronger – maybe go to 35 or 40-pound (18kg) dumbbells.;
, Body weight rows are the PERFECT precursor to pull ups – they work the same muscles, just at a different angle. You can also make adjustments. Use a smith machine: Because you can adjust the height of the bar, you can adjust how difficult the exercise is. If you’re just getting started, put the bar very high, so you only have to lean back slightly. If you’re stronger, you can start with a lower bar.


Clench your butt and keep your abs tight and body straight throughout the exercise. Focus your mind on PULLING with your arms.
Set the bar at a height where it’s challenging for you to complete 3 sets of 8 reps with two minutes of rest between sets.
As soon as you can complete all 3 sets of 8 reps, lower the bar!
If you need to make the exercise easier, bend your knees and put your feet flat on the ground. You can drop your hips too to make things easier.






A sample routine that starts with your back exercises:

Monday - 3 sets of 8 reps of overhand body weight rows
Wednesday – 3 sets of 8 reps of underhand body weight rows (hands reversed)
Friday - 3 sets of 8 reps of overhand body weight rows
...and then go underhand, overhand, underhand the following week.


As soon as you’re doing body weight rows where your body is at a 45 degree angle or lower, you can progress to the next step.






If you don't have access to a bar for inverted rows, try using your kitchen table, or move to the next step and progress with caution there.

, You can use the assisted pull up machine in a gym. It doesn’t give you the full feeling of a pull up, but it’s certainly better than nothing. Or, try doing one of these alternatives:

Assisted Pull Ups with chair – (either one foot or two depending on your needs) – your feet are ONLY there for support, use your upper body as much as possible.






Assisted Pull Ups with exercise band – (you can get different types of exercise bands with different levels of strength). Put your foot in the exercise band and pull yourself up.






Assisted pull ups with a partner - (have a friend hold your feet behind you and help you complete each rep). Have your friend use the least amount of help possible to get you through your workouts.








Some advice:


Clench your butt and keep your abs tight throughout the exercise – try not to swing like crazy.
Keep your shoulder blades pinched behind you throughout the movement and focus on PULLING the bar down with your arms.
Use the least amount of assistance that you can handle – as soon as you can do multiple pull ups with both feet on the chair, switch to just one foot.
If you’re using an exercise band, try to get a few bands of varying tension so you can decrease the resistance as you get stronger.
As soon as you can do 3 sets of 8 with assistance, it’s time time move on up.


A sample level 3 routine:








Monday – Assisted Pull Ups – 3 sets of 8 reps
Wednesday – Body weight rows – 3 sets of 8 reps
Friday – Assisted Chin Ups – 3 sets of 8 reps







, Now, let’s say you don’t have a rubber band, you don’t have somebody to hold your feet, and you don’t have a chair – you ONLY have a pull up bar. That’s okay – you can do what we call negatives. When doing a negative, you jump above the bar and try to lower yourself slowly and in control until you’re at the bottom of the movement. This can be very dangerous if you’re very overweight, so move slowly through the previous steps first. However, once you have a decent amount of back strength, doing negatives is a great way to build arm and back strength.


You can either jump above the pull up bar, and then begin to lower yourself back down IN CONTROL, or you can hop up on a chair to get above the bar and then lower yourself back down. Again, the name of the game is “in control.” You don’t need to lower yourself so slowly that one repetition destroys you...lower yourself in a controlled speed – Counting to three during the movement is a good tempo.
Here’s a sample workout using everything up to this point:


Monday – Assisted Chin Ups – 3 sets of 8 repetitions
Wednesday – Body Weight Rows – 3 sets of 8 repetitions
Friday - Negative Pull Ups – 3 sets to failure – capped at 5 repetitions for each set.


For your negative pull ups, do as many as you can (up to 5 reps) per set – jump and lower yourself in control, then jump right back up and lower yourself. If you can do 5, wait 2 minutes and then start again. If you can’t do 5, do as many as you can in control, wait 2 minutes and then start again. Once you’re doing 3 sets of 5 repetitions on your negative pull ups, along with your assisted chin ups and body weight rows, you’re ready.

, Depending on your weight, your level of fitness and strength, and how far along you are in these progressions, you might be able to start with more than one pull up. For MANY people, especially if you have spent time in the gym in the past working on your biceps (like most guys do), you might find it easier to start with chin ups (with your palms facing toward you) for your first exercise before trying pull ups (with your palms facing away from you). Focus on these things:

Pull your shoulder blades back as you’re going through the movement, and focus on pulling the bar down.
Again, keep your butt clenched and your abs tight throughout the movement.
Get your chin above the bar, or it doesn’t count as a full rep.
Do whatever you need to get through the full rep.
If you can only do one rep, try to do at least 3 sets of one rep…after your three sets, add in some negatives to exhaust the muscle.


At this point, here’s a Level 4 routine set up for a week:


Monday – Chin ups – 3 sets for maximums repetitions
Wednesday – Inverted Rows – 3 sets for max repetitions
Friday - Pull ups – 3 sets for maximum repetitions

,
Start doing other types of pull ups - like wide grip pull ups (grab the bar WAY out with both hands), side to side pull ups, uneven pull ups, etc.
Add weight and do weighted pull ups or weighted chin ups; if you’re at this level and interested in doing so, here’s what you need to do:

Get a weight belt. The whole “put weights in a backpack” certainly works, but the angle of the weights hanging off your back is weird. With a weight belt, the weight hangs down between your legs (not a euphemism) so it feels more natural.
Add small amounts at a time. Most gyms will have 2.5 lb (roughly 1kg) weights; you might feel stupid putting on a big weight belt and only hanging a tiny weight off it, but you need to start somewhere.
Consistently add more weight. Warm up with two sets of 5 pull ups with no extra weight, and then do 3 sets of 5 weighted pull ups. If you can complete all 3 sets of 5 reps (with you chin over the bar for every rep), make a note to add 2.5 or 5lbs (1 or 2kg) to your weight belt for the next time.










So, here’s an advanced sample routine for back exercises:


Monday – Weighted Chin Ups – 3 sets of 5 reps
Wednesday - Elevated Feet Body Weight Rows – 3 sets of max repetitions
Friday - Wide Grip Pull Ups – 3 sets of maximum repetition
The following week, alternate by doing the chin ups without weight, and then doing weighted pull ups.

Do cardio exercises every other day.,
Monitor your heart rate.,
Assess whether you should focus on cardio for a while.,
Don’t be so hard on yourself.",How to Achieve Slender Arms1," The most important factor in slenderizing your arms is cutting down on body fat. Cutting your calories with a diet is the best way to reduce body fat, but adding cardio exercises can also help you to burn more calories. Spend 20 to 30 minutes on alternating days doing something that keeps your heart rate up throughout the exercise. Some of the best forms of cardio exercise include jogging, swimming, and biking. If you prefer to work out at a gym, rowing and spinning can also get your heart rate up and keep it going.Team sports like basketball may be more fun, and can also offer a decent cardio workout. If you’re playing a sport that allows a lot of stop-and-go action, supplement the workout with a ten minute jog after the game.
While cardio workouts can initially be challenging if you have a significant amount of body fat to lose, know this: the more you have to lose, the quicker you’ll see results.;
, If possible, monitor your heart rate while exercising, as this can help you determine whether you’re working hard enough. Your mid-workout heart rate should decrease after a few weeks of doing the same exercise at the same level of intensity. If it does not drop noticeably as you improve your cardio fitness, this means you haven’t been doing an aggressive enough workout. Pick up the pace or exercise for a little while longer! Expect to see your body – including your arms – start to lose body fat within four weeks. While initial achievements are only the beginning, record them and congratulate yourself to fuel your motivation to stick with your workout routine.

, Arms are especially hard to keep slender, and will wiggle a bit, no matter how fit you are. It can be helpful to make non-judgmental self-assessments of your level of fitness and proceed accordingly. For instance, if you are unable to do a push-up, you should start a fitness regimen based on cardio, and proceed to resistance exercises after you’ve gotten rid of some body fat.For a more specific assessment of your body fat, get in a push-up position, with your body held horizontal by outstretched arms, about shoulder-width apart. Reach up and across your body with one hand to the midpoint of the back of your other arm and pinch the flesh. If you can loosely gather an inch or more between your fingertips, you should focus on cardio exercises initially.

, Know that you may be perfectly healthy – and look great – even if your arms aren’t as taut as the people in this seasons’ swimsuit magazines. Women, especially, tend to accumulate body fat in particular areas of their body. This includes the upper arms. Women are also less likely to include upper arm workouts in daily exercise regimens without making the conscious decision to target the arms specifically.There’s good news: the areas of your body that accumulate fat deposits are also those that will give up fat the quickest as you begin to maintain a cardio regimen.

Don't overwork your muscles.,
Work out as hard as you can.,
Use the right form.",How to Get Bigger Chest Muscles (Pecs)2," Many people make the mistake of lifting weights every single day, thinking that the more they work out, the bigger their muscles will get. This is actually detrimental to muscle growth; your muscles get bigger on the rest days in between workouts, when the tissues repair themselves. To make sure you're not overworking your muscles, follow these tips:


Work out your chest muscles no more than once or twice per week. On the days when you aren't working out your chest, work other muscle groups, like your legs, arms, and back.
Don't work out for longer than 30 minutes in a session. You'll risk damaging your muscles, and you might have to sit out for awhile instead of working on building strength and mass.

, When you do work out, you need to go all in. Challenge yourself to lift as much weight as you can without risking muscle, tendon, ligament, or joint damage. To find out how much weight you should be lifting, try doing reps with different weights. You should be able to do 8 - 10 reps without having to put the weights down, but you should be sweating and panting by the end of the set.









If you can't do more than 5 or so reps without stopping, you're lifting too much weight. Scale back. As you get stronger, you can start lifting more weight.
If you can do 10 reps without feeling a burn, add more weight. You need to challenge yourself if you want to get bigger.

, Have a personal trainer or instructor show you how to do your exercises using the right form. You should generally start with your arms fully extended, and use your muscles, not momentum, to complete each motion.









Using the wrong form can cause muscle, tendon, joint, and ligament damage, so make sure you know what you're doing.
If you can't complete a motion with a particular weight, it might be too heavy for you. For example, if you can't straighten your arms while you're bench pressing, ease off on the weight.

Don't eat too many calories.,
Eat plenty of protein.,
Consider taking supplements.",How to Get Bigger Chest Muscles (Pecs)3," People often believe that to get big muscles, you need to eat a lot of calories. You do need to be eating enough calories to give you energy through training, but not so many that your body has to work on burning fat instead of building muscle. Being lean helps the muscles you're working so hard to build look more visible.


Stay away from empty carbohydrates like pasta, white bread, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. Choose whole grains.
Don't eat too many foods that are processed or fried, and limit fast food and snacks.

, Protein is a building block for muscle, and you're going to need a lot of it if you want a big chest. You can get your protein from a multitude of sources - not just meat. Consider these options:


Lean meats like chicken, fish, lean beef, and pork.
Eggs and low-fat dairy.
Nuts and beans.
Kale, spinach, and other vegetables that have protein.
Tofu and soy

, Many people who are working on building muscles take creatine, a powdered amino acid that is mixed with water and ingested three or more times daily. It is considered safe to consume by the FDA, since it's composed of the same protein that our bodies produce naturally to build muscle.


You may also consider taking a protein shake supplement it is one of the most beneficial supplements to gaining muscle and leading an overall healthy life.

Use a pec-deck machine.,
Do machine presses.,
Try crossover cable flies.,
Do dips.",How to Build Pectoral Muscles2," A pec-deck machine, sometimes called a butterfly machine, can be found at most commercial gyms and is a great way to target your chest muscles. After selecting your desired starting weight, grip the handles one at a time. Pull one handle forward first, then reach while turning your torso to grip the other handle. Then, face forward with both arms extended to the sides and begin pressing.


Start with a light weight and press the handles toward the middle. Keep your back straight and feet planted on the ground. Perform 3 sets of 15 reps and increase the number of reps and the weight as you find comfortable., A press machine can be found at most commercial gyms and will help with biceps, triceps and pecs. Start with a low weight and press the handles out until your arms are fully extended. Keep your back straight and feet planted on the ground. Perform 3 sets of 15 reps and increase the number of reps and the weight as you find comfortable.With the machine, it’s easier to slow your repetitions than with free weights. Slower reps will allow you to take on more weight., Find a cable machine and start with a low weight. You can perform cable flies standing, seated upright, or seated on an incline bench. Grip one of the cable handles in each hand by grabbing one at a time. Plant your feet shoulder distance apart and flex forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and abs contracted. You should be looking at the floor a meter or two in front of you. Then extend your arms wide out to the sides, keeping a slight bend in the elbow, and keep your palms facing forward. Reach your arms out to your sides and grip the cable handles. Then, slowly pull both cables in towards your chest at the same time and cross your arms over each other so they make an X. Perform 3 sets of 15 reps and increase the number of reps and the weight as you find comfortable.Remember that the cable height is set high when doing a standing cable cross over. You will need to reach for the cables one at a time and then carefully return them to their starting spots one at a time when you are done.
If you are using a bench, then the cables are set low, near the floor. You will need to reach down to get them.

, Dips strengthen your triceps, which will make pushups easier. Since pushups are great for building pecs, adding dips to your routine can be beneficial. Find a machine with dip bars. Keep your shoulders pulled down and back. Grab the ends of the bar handles and lift your legs off the ground. Start with your elbows bent, but keep them at angles greater than 90 degrees, and then extend your arms fully to lift your entire body up. Perform 3 sets of 15 reps and increase the number as you find comfortable.Try to keep your feet elevated and still throughout the dip. The higher you can lift your feet, the better.
Lean forward slightly as you do dips to maximize focus on your pecs. However, keep in mind that the main muscles you will be working are your triceps.
Do not lower yourself down enough to bend your elbows at 90 degree angles. This increases your risk of injury.

Work protein into your diet.,
Include good fats into your diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take supplements.",How to Build Pectoral Muscles3," A high protein diet is absolutely essential for developing muscle mass in any part of your body, pecs included. There are a wide variety of high-protein foods you can choose from.Eat lean meats like skinless chicken, eggs, and fish.
Nuts, cottage cheese, yogurt, and legumes like beans and lentils are all high in protein.

, Foods that are high in Omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fat are easily burnt off during your workout, giving you more energy. Olives, avocado, and fish have high concentrations of good fats.Good fat is only good if accompanied by exercise. If you eat good fat but don’t work out, it will turn into cholesterol and cause weight gain., Drinking water won’t directly cause muscle gain but will give your body the energy it needs to process protein. You should always be drinking 8 glasses a day but it’s even more important if you’re in the midst of a muscle-building workout regimen., There are a number of natural, over-the-counter supplements that will help you build more muscle mass. Creatine, Beta-Alanine, Whey Protein, Branched-Chain Amino Acid (BCAA), and Glutamine are highly popular, widely available products to help with muscle development.Always take as directed by the product’s packaging.

Target the muscles in your arms.,
Default to exercises that incorporate dumbbells.,
Work your arms and shoulders in one routine.,
Target your triceps with push-ups and dips.,
Include several bicep-specific exercises in your regimen.,
Use dumbbells to target the biceps.,
Incorporate the hammer curl with a twist.,
Focus on the forearms with specific routines as well.,
Change your arm workouts frequently.",How to Achieve Slender Arms2," Your biceps, triceps, and forearms can all be targeted by specific exercises. Each of these areas, as well as your shoulders, need to be repetitively trained with increasingly challenging resistance exercises in order to have more visual definition. In sum, resistance exercises will also help you reduce your body fat generally, but will also contribute to the growth of lean, well-defined arm muscles.Don’t be concerned that you’ll develop large, muscular arms. You can do specific exercises that will lead to lean, toned muscle that will actually facilitate a decrease in the circumference of your arm despite an increase in strength and definition.

, While barbell exercises are better for building strength, dumbbells will better help you tone the specific muscles you’re working. Dumbbells also allow for some creative, dynamic exercises that can work your biceps, triceps, and shoulders in one routine.For each exercise, use the heaviest weight with which you can safely complete that specific exercise. Increase both the weight and the number of reps for each exercise whenever you are able to do so.

, Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand and your arms extended straight out to the sides of your body. Keep your upper arms parallel to the floor and bend your arms at the elbow with your palms facing towards you. Extend your arms straight upwards from your shoulders, keeping the palms face towards one another. Finally, bend your elbows again, this time lowering the weights slowly behind your head as far as you can comfortably reach. Do the reverse to return to starting position and do 15 to 25 reps., Since fat tends to deposit on the back of your upper arm, your triceps is the most important part of your arm to focus on. Further, any triceps exercises also work other parts of the arms and shoulders, leading to a more slender upper body in general.Diamond push-ups are the crème-de-la-crème for working the triceps. Hold your body horizontal on your toes and hands. Position your hands as close together while still being able to complete five push-ups. Try to get the point where your pointer fingers and thumbs can touch each other, forming a diamond!
Dips are another incredibly effective exercise to target and tone your triceps. Sit on the ground just in front of the bottom step of a stairway, with your legs outstretched in front of you and the back of your heels pushing downward. Reach back with your palms on either side, and lift your weight off the ground. Work your way up to doing this, but from the height of a chair – this will isolate your triceps even better.

, Toning your biceps is tricky, in part because you’ve got to work three different muscle groups to sculpt the front of your upper arm—the biceps, triceps, and forearm muscles. Most bicep exercises involve bending the elbow. The classic biceps workout is the chin-up, which involves pulling yourself up to a bar with your palms facing towards you. While your back and shoulders are engaged, your biceps also get the most strenuous workout., Perhaps the best example of a biceps exercise with dumbbells is the dumbbell curl. To perform this exercise, stand with knees slightly bent and feet shoulder width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with arms hanging at your sides and your palms facing forward. Bend one arm at the elbow and curl the dumbbell almost to your shoulder. After lowering the dumbbell, repeat the move with your other arm.Keep your elbows near your sides while lifting and lowering the dumbbell.
Perform this exercise on an incline bench to increase the focus of the movement on your biceps.

, Simply add a twist of your wrist into the upward pull of a standard dumbbell curl so that the weight is positioned as though it is the head of hammer when it reaches your shoulder. This addition will include your forearms in the workout, and toning multiple parts of your arm in one workout.It’s easier to lose track of your posture with more dynamic movements. Remember to keep your head back and your spine straight. Squeeze your shoulder blades together to help stabilize your arms, and remember to keep your elbows against your sides.

, You need to add strength to your forearms, if only in order to keep up with the increasing weight and reps you’ll be able to do. Even simply walking around with weights in your hands and your arms hanging at your sides will give your forearms a decent workout as they have to maintain the grip.Step-up your forearm workout, and prepare yourself to be able to do more pull-ups, by performing a bar hang. Pull yourself half way up, so that your elbows are at 90 degrees, and hold the position as long as you can. You can even simply hang with your arms straight to develop initial forearm strength.

, There are countless different exercises that focus on your arms – learn a new one whenever one that you’ve been doing for a while becomes particularly easy to perform. This prevents your body from adapting to the workout, which can decrease the benefits from the exercise. Most importantly, you’ve got to work arm muscles frequently and consistently to see a significant change in their actual shape.Make sure to incorporate workouts with different grips to ensure you’re working all the specific muscles in the group that different exercises target.

Eat unsaturated fats!,
Stop eating trans fat and limit saturated fat consumption.,
Fill up on fruits and veggies.,
Reduce your sugar consumption immediately.",How to Achieve Slender Arms3," While it may seem surprising to read about the necessity of consuming fats, the important distinction when looking to slim down is ensuring that you’re only eating the right types of fats. In fact, there are many types of food that include a high amount of unsaturated fats that will likely help you lose weight! A few initial dietary changes may include:Switching to cold-pressed olive oil for use as an ingredient – especially in salad dressings – and for stovetop cooking.
Eat olives on their own too! Olives offer an especially interesting combination of nutritional attributes: they are high in healthy fats, but low in calories. Accordingly, olives are an ideal snack to make you feel full without undermining your effort to cut down overall calories. However, keep in mind that olives are also high in salt, so limit how many you eat.
Snack on avocados and nuts in moderation. Avocados and various types of nuts are not only healthy, they are flavorful and satisfying. Try swapping these for other snacks, such as wings and chips. The more you eat snacks like these, the more you’ll crave them.

, As you increase your physical activity and take other immediate steps to reduce body fat and tone your arms, you should make changes to your diet that will have an even longer-term impact on your mission to slenderize your arms. In particular, you need to become more aware of the amounts and types of fat that you’re consuming, as the wrong sort of diet will prevent your arms – not to mention the rest of your body – from becoming slender.Avoid eating processed meats and anything from a fast food restaurant, which contain immense amounts of unhealthy fats.
Vary your meat consumption generally by prominently including low fat meats like poultry in your meals. When you do eat red meat, opt for organic, grass-fed options. When consuming fattier cuts like pork chops or steak, trim off the fat and don't eat it!
The source of any saturated fat you do eat is important. For instance, a glass of whole milk, or a bit of butter with a serving of vegetables may lead to more filling and satisfying meals that may even lead to eating less overall.

, You don’t have to all of the sudden eat less food to start losing weight. You can eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and foods that are high in fiber. These are the foods most likely to give you the nutrition you need, satiate a craving, and even keep you feeling full for longer. You can even add to your meals by building up sandwiches or entrees with lettuce, tomato, greens, and avocado. In fact, add a whole course to dinner: eat a salad to help you fill up before getting to the heavier portions of the meal.If you’re insistent on embellishing your veggies with a bit of kitchen flair, steam them with herbs, spices, and olive oil, or a bit of butter.
Eat plenty of beans – garbanzo, lentil, black, etc. – as these have plenty of fiber too. Add them to salads or entrees to increase portion size while keeping nutritional quality high.
If you still need a midday snack between meals, eat carrots or another veggie with hummus. Soon, you’ll prefer healthy snacks to the chips and other tempting options that will keep you from losing weight.

, One of the most prevalent culprits of unnecessary calorie consumption is food that is high in sugar. Further, sugar actually makes burning fat harder, as eating lots of sugar reduces the efficiency of the enzymes that are capable of burning fat. If you’re serious about achieving a more slender body composition, you’ve got to eliminate the soda and sweets habit starting today.If you’re having sugar cravings, opt for a sweet fruit such as a mango. Before you know it, you’ll start craving fruit instead of candy bars.
High-fiber cereals, oatmeal, and multigrain breads make for a great breakfast. Add fruit to the meal if you favor sweetness, and keep yourself from eating sugary cereals or pastries.Just make sure that you check the label for added sugar.

If you want to get fit on any cloth you like, you must have a well build chest, shoulders and arms.,
Barbell Bench Press.,

Doing the barbell bench press.,
Experiment with the basics.",How to Perform a Proper Barbell Bench Press," Undoubtedly a fit body does wonders to our confidence. With the help of good work out and complete and balanced diet, we can also achieve that fit and well shaped chest and arms. In this post, we will be highlighting the most popular chest exercise – Barbell Bench Press. We will be talking about how it gets done perfectly, some warning, tips related to this exercise. Have a look.
, This is the most effective exercises for chest. It does wonders to your body and at the same time it can also disfigure your body, if you do it in the wrong manner. This exercise increases the strength and flexibility of the chest and arms. For better results, this exercise should be done at least thrice a week., First of all, lie on an exercise bench, facing upward. Then hold the barbell above the center of the chest. If you're a beginner, make sure you do not start lifting high weights in excitement. Start with 2.5 kgs each side. The position of your hands should be wider than arms width with elbows pointing out to the side. Grasp on the barbell should be in such a manner that your fingers hold the bar and thumb holds it around the front. If you do it incorrectly, the bar may fall down on your head, chest or neck and you can get injured. Once you're in an accurate position for this exercise, then it's time to perform it. First, push the bar upwards. When you push the bar upwards, inhale so that your chest gets expanded. Then pull it down and release the breath slowly so that your chest gets contracted. Make sure the bar doesn't touch your chest throughout this exercise., If you have crossed the beginner's phase, then you can experiment with the basics of this exercise. You can do this exercise with dumbbells instead of barbells. You can also place your feet on the bench instead of ground. Try adding more weights to the barbell.

If you're a beginner or a skinny individual, then start with 3 sets of 10, 8 and 6 reps each with no weights on the barbell.
If you're new into gaming, but healthy, then you can start with 3 sets of 15, 12, 10 reps each.
If you want to see the result of your hard work, then make sure you start adding weights and also increase the number of reps.
If you feel dizzy or pain in your chest while doing more reps or sets then stop it right there. Take a break and have some water. Then move on.

Set up your equipment.,
Place your feet or knees in the band.,
Grip the bar.,
Pull yourself up to the bar.,
Lower slowly.,
Pause in the hang position between reps.",How to Perform Assisted Pull Ups1," Choose bands of the correct length and secure them over the top of a pull-up bar. Adjust the length or the band so that it does not reach the ground when you are standing on it.You may have to adjust the length of the band several times to get it correct.
You should be able to hang off the bar and place your feet in the band without your feet touching the ground.
If you're looping the band around your knees, you'll need to adjust it so that it's shorter.;
, You can do band-assisted pull-ups either by standing inside the band or looping the band under your knees. If you loop the band under your knees, you'll need to keep your knees bent as you perform your pull-ups.You also can put only one foot or knee in the band, if this is more comfortable. The band may provide less assistance this way.

, To perform a pull-up, you want to use an overhand grip. Chin-ups are another exercise similar to pull-ups that use an underhand grip. Chin-ups are more difficult than pull-ups because the muscles used for pull-ups are larger and stronger.In hanging position, your arms should be completely straight with your elbows locked. Take care not to hyper-extend your elbow.
Grip the bar with your hands a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Your arms shouldn't touch your ears. Don't grip too wide, however, or you'll significantly decrease your range of motion.

, Take a few deep breaths, then pull yourself up in a slow, steady motion, driving your elbows towards your side in a pumping motion. The band will make it easier for you to lift your body weight.Avoid swinging or pushing from your hips. You should be pulling up your body weight, not using any momentum from your lower body.
You also want to avoid jerky movements. Your pull-up should be a relatively slow, controlled movement.
Raise your entire head and neck over the bar. Don't strain your chin or neck to reach over the bar – the work should be done by your arms, making sure to keep your shoulders down.
Keep in mind that the band will provide progressively less assistance as you pull yourself up.

, Once you've completed your pull-up, follow through with the rest of the exercise by controlling your movement when you lower so that your muscles are doing the work to actively lower your body.Simply allowing your body to drop after the exercise can put you at risk for injury.
Aim for your descent to take between three and five seconds.
The bands will assist you to some degree to control your movement and lighten your load as you lower your body.

, When you hang from the bar, lock your elbows. Breathe deeply and remain in this position for one or two seconds before you do another pull-up.Pull-ups are challenging exercises, so don't overdo it. A couple of sets of between 5 and 10 reps is sufficient.
If you're just starting out with pull-ups, do fewer reps at first. You can add reps as you get stronger and more skilled.

Develop a proper push-up technique.,
Do as many push-ups as you can.,
Rest between sets.,
Perform a second and third set of push-ups, taking the same rest between each.,
Chart your baseline.,
Wait two days.,
Try to increase the number in each set by one.,
Vary your push-up types.",How to Increase the Number of Pushups You Can Do1," In order to take accurate readings of the push-ups you do, you must first make sure you’re performing a proper push-up each time. A push-up in good form will work your chest, arms, shoulders, and upper body.You want to keep your arms just over shoulder-width apart and keep both your back and legs straight for every repetition.








For more information on proper push-up technique, you can visit: How to Do a Push-Up.
Remember that you only go low enough for your chin to touch the floor while keeping the rest of your body elevated.;
, In order to increase the number of push-ups you can do, you must first find out what that number is. Do as many push-ups as you can in good form until you feel the muscles shake and you simply cannot do another. You also want to time the amount of time it takes you to do your maximum number of push-ups.








, You want to allow yourself to rest for the same amount of time that it took you to do the first set of push-ups. For most beginners taking a baseline reading, this will likely be between twenty and thirty seconds.









Since you need to track your baseline and progress, take the rest time to write down the number of push-ups you did.

, One single set of push-ups alone will not work the muscle groups enough to see overall progress very quickly, so you want to perform at least three sets of as many push-ups as you can do. You want to continue timing each set, so you can take an equivalent-length rest between each set.









It’s perfectly normal to perform fewer push-ups until muscle failure with each subsequent set, so don’t allow that to discourage you. With practice, you’ll see increases in the number in each set you can do.

, Once you have done all three sets of your maximum amount of push-ups, chart your baseline for sets one, two, and three as well as the amount of time that each set took you.

, You’re likely to feel some ache in your muscles the day after your baseline, which is perfectly normal. You may be itching to get started on doing more push-ups, but this routine will offer the best results if you do it three-to-four times per week so basically, every other day.

, When the next workout day comes around, perform the same routine you did to find your baseline, but try to increase the number in each set of push-ups by at least one.









You likely will not be able to increase the number in each set every time you work out, but that’s okay. If you reach such a plateau, hold yourself to that number for three or four workout sessions, and then try to increase the amount after several days.
Continue charting the results, and you’ll begin seeing more push-ups performed in less time over several weeks.

, Once you’re comfortable with this routine, you can start working additional muscle groups by varying the type of push-up you do. Follow the same set structure, but try diamond push-ups for the first set, standard push-ups for the second set, and do the third set with your arms set slightly wider.









This will give you a more complete workout of the push-up muscle groups.
You’ll definitely notice that you’re capable of fewer overall push-ups with this variation, so take a new baseline measurement to start with.

Make sure the exercise ball is in a space that is large enough for your body to lay down in.,
Kneel so that you are facing the ball.

,
Carefully roll forward onto the exercise ball until only the lower half of your body is touching the ball, and the rest of you is supported by your hands on the ground.

,
Once you've reached this point, make sure your palms are flat on the ground and extend your legs straight out behind you so that the ball is directly underneath your shins.

Add weight to the machine.,
Stand or kneel on the platform.,
Use an overhand grip on the handles.,
Pull yourself up between the handles.,
Lower yourself in a slow and controlled way.,
Complete 10 to 15 reps per set.",How to Perform Assisted Pull Ups2," Unlike other weight machines, the more weight you add to an assisted pull-up machine, the easier the exercise will be for you. The machine counterbalances your weight with the weight you add to the machine.Start with more weight than you think you'll need, and experiment with different weight until you find a level that's challenging without being too much.
Generally, you should be able to do several reps with the weight, but no more. In other words, if you're planning to do 10 pull-ups, set the weight that is just enough to enable you to do 10 pull-ups.

, Depending on how the machine is designed, you'll start your pull-ups from either a standing or kneeling position. Check the resistance on the platform and make sure you're comfortable and well balanced.Make sure the platform is adjusted appropriately for your height. Your arms should be completely straight when you reach up to grab the handles.

, An assisted pull-up machine has two handles, one on either side of the machine. These handles are approximately the same width apart as your hands should be when using a pull-up bar.Due to the position of the handles, it would be difficult or awkward to use anything other than an overhand grip. If you attempt to use an underhand grip, you'll have to twist your arms in a way that your elbows won't bend to do a pull-up.
Your arms should be completely straight to begin your machine-assisted pull-ups, with your elbows locked.
Be careful not to hyperextend your elbows – you could injure yourself.

, When you're ready, pull yourself up using a similar form to the one you would use if you were doing a pull-up on a regular pull-up bar. You'll feel the weight kick in to assist you as you complete the motion.You should pull yourself up so that your chin is over the level of the top of the handles. Use a pumping motion, driving your elbows towards your side.
Don't strain or pull with your neck, and keep your shoulders down. Keep your hips and torso as still and straight as possible, without swinging or pumping from your hips.

, As you lower your body, keep your movements controlled and let your muscles do the work rather than either relying on the assistance from the machine or allowing your body to drop by force of gravity.Focus on taking between two and four seconds to lower your body back to your starting position.
When you've completely lowered yourself with your arms extended, lock your elbows and pause for a couple of seconds before you do your next pull-up.

, Generally, machine-assisted pull-ups won't help you progress towards unassisted pull-ups unless you take responsibility for the work and do multiple reps to build the strength in your muscles.However, you should take advantage of the assistance provided by the machine to do multiple reps that you might not be able to do with band-assisted pull-ups or unassisted pull-ups.
Doing 10 to 15 pull-ups on an assisted pull-up machine is a reasonable goal.
After you've finished your reps, make sure you're removing the weights and returning the machine to its default position so it's ready for the next user.

"
"
Do jump negatives.,
Work on your grip.,
Strengthen your back with rowing exercises.,
Gradually decrease the weight you add on machine-assisted pull-ups.,
Perform an advanced modification of band-assisted pull-ups.",How to Perform Assisted Pull Ups3," Jump negatives work on the eccentric or negative part of the pull-up exercise, when you lower your body after having performed the pull-up. This builds strength in your arms and will improve the quality of your pull-up technique and performance.To do a jump negative, start by standing on a stool and gripping the bar with an overhand grip.
Rather than pull yourself up, you're going to jump from the stool so that your chin is over the bar.
Then, lower yourself slowly, focusing on controlling your movement and resisting gravity as much as you can.
Try to go slowly enough that you can count to 10 before your feet touch the ground.

, Grip strength can be a key factor in many pulling exercises including pull-ups. Improving your grip strength will make it easier for you to do unassisted pull-ups, and also make you feel more secure when doing pull-ups – whether assisted or not.A variation of an exercise called the farmer's walk is one way to work on your grip strength.
To do this exercise, carry a pair of heavy dumbbells or another heavy object and walk a considerable distance – 50 yards or so can be one set. After that distance, rest for a minute before doing it again.
If you do two or three sets several times a week, over time your grip strength will increase.

, Doing rowing exercises or using a rowing machine can strengthen your back and shoulders as well as your arms. These are some of the same muscles you use when you perform pull-ups.Dumbbell and barbell rows also can help you build your back muscles.
Pick several exercises that you like and incorporate them in your regular strength-training sessions so you can work towards performing unassisted pull-ups.

, Assisted pull-up machines can be used to progress to unassisted pull-ups provided you regularly decrease the weight that you add the machine to assist you.For example, if you started doing machine-assisted pull-ups putting the same amount of weight on the machine as your own weight, consider decreasing this amount by 5 percent each week so that you're regularly decreasing the assistance you get.
You also could try doing one or two pull-ups with significantly less weight on the machine, then add weight to do additional reps.

, If you want to transition from assisted pull-ups to unassisted pull-ups, you can do a variation that gives you less assistance lowering your body than a normal band-assisted pull-up does.To do this modification, you'll have to loop the band around your feet rather than around your knees.
When you pull yourself up, lift your legs and tuck them towards your chest. Now you're out of the band, so as you lower yourself you won't get any assistance from the band.

"
"
Develop the proper push-up technique.,
Do as many push-ups as you can.,
Wait two days.,
Begin a daily regimen.,
Increase the number of push-ups each week.",How to Increase the Number of Pushups You Can Do2," As with the first step in the first method, you want to make sure that you’re performing correct push-ups for each repetition. You can find more information for push-up form at: How to Do a Push-Up.

, This method also requires a baseline measurement of how many push-ups you can do; however, you’re not going to do several sets. Perform just one set of as many push-ups as possible until you cannot do more.


As you’re doing the push-ups, keep a mental tally of how many you were able to do comfortably and where the push-ups become more difficult. This will vary greatly from person to person.

, Since you did push-ups to exhaustion while discovering your baseline, wait two days before beginning your daily regimen. This will give your muscles time to rest before you begin the larger project.

, Using the number right where your push-ups went from comfortable to more difficult during your baseline test, begin doing a single set of this many push-ups per day for a week. By doing a number right at the edge of your comfort level but not to exhaustion, you’re putting less strain on your muscles, which makes a more sustainable daily regimen.









Even within the seven day period, you can create smaller goals for yourself by trying to decrease the amount of time it takes you to do your push-ups.

, This method offers a more controlled way of increasing your push-up count by allowing you to gradually increase the number each week. If your number for the first week was ten push-ups per day, try increasing that number to eleven or twelve per day in the second week and so on across subsequent weeks.


Remember not to increase the number in such a way that you’re doing push-ups to exhaustion because that type of rigorous daily strain can damage your muscles and set you back while you recover.

Grip a pullup bar with your palms facing whichever direction you prefer.,
Pull your bodyweight up until your chin is just barely above the bar.,
Lower yourself until your arms are fully extended.,
Do another pullup.,
Try negative pull-ups.,
Do assisted pull-ups.,
Do jumping pull-ups.,
Do biceps curls.,
Do reverse pushups.,
Do pulldowns.,
Try chin-ups.",How to Do Pullups," In general, having your palms facing towards you is most efficient. When you pull yourself up with your hands facing this way, you give your biceps and lats a better workout. Pulling yourself up with your palms out is considered the most difficult way to pull up your bodyweight but also gives deltoids and pectorals a good workout. Start with your arms fully extended.






;
, You may have to strain, but keep pulling until you've lifted yourself up using your back and biceps.









In order to keep your bodyweight centered, you can cross your feet beneath you as you lift yourself up.
Remember kicking your feet to gain extra momentum isn't helping anything.

, Lower yourself in a controlled way to work the muscles harder and prep yourself for the next pull.








, Once your arms are almost extended, start pulling up again. Repeat for as many reps as you can. Don't let your number of repetitions bring you down; you can only get better. If possible, do 3 sets of 10 reps.








, These are similar to pull-ups, except you use a prop to help you get your chin up over the bar. The strength is gained when you slowly lower yourself back to starting position. After doing negative pull-ups for awhile, you'll find you get better at regular pull-ups.









Stand on a chair or a box, or have a spotter stand next to you.
Grip the pullup bar with your palms facing your preferred direction.
Pull yourself up with the assistance of the chair or your spotter.
Slowly lower yourself back to starting position.
Repeat.

, These are done using a bar that is lower to the ground, enabling you to build up strength by lifting only part of your body weight with each rep. These can also be done using elastic workout bands.









Sit under the bar and grip it with your palms facing out.
Straighten up and lift about 50 percent of your body weight, keeping your feet on the ground and your knees slightly bent. Keep lifting until your chin is over the bar.
Slowly lower yourself back to starting position.
Repeat.

, When you jump into a pullup, the momentum you gain with the jump helps propel your body up so you can lift your chin over the bar much more easily than you'd be able to otherwise. This is great practice for doing classic pull-ups.









Stand below the pullup bar and grip it with your palms facing out.
Jump and pull at the same time, lifting yourself over the bar.
Slowly lower yourself back to starting position.Repeat.

, You'll need a pair of dumbbells in a weight that you can lift 8 - 10 times before feeling muscle fatigue. Doing this exercise 2 times weekly will build up strength in your biceps and eventually help you get better at pull-ups.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the dumbbells at your sides.
Curl the dumbbells up to chest height, bending your elbows.
Lower the dumbbells back to your sides.
Repeat for 3 sets of 10 curls.

, This exercises simulates a pullup, but it's a lot easier to do because most of your weight is on the ground. It's an excellent way to start building up enough strength to do a pullup. You'll need either a dip bar or a sturdy mop or broom positioned across two chairs. Here's how to do it:


Lie down with your neck positioned under the bar or broom. Bend your legs and keep your feet against the floor.
Grip the bar with your palms facing out.
Lift your body toward the bar as far as possible.Lower back down to the ground and repeat.

, You'll need a pulldown machine to do this. It's another effective way to strengthen your upper body and make you better at pull-ups.


Stand in front of a pulldown machine and grip the bar.
Sit down and pull the bar down to your collar bones.
Repeat.

, This is like a pullup, but instead of gripping the bar with your palms facing out, they should face toward you. This position is generally easier and exercises the biceps and upper back. This position is a great compound bicep exercise, and a good exercise to do when you're training to become better at pull-ups.


Grip the bar with your hands facing you.
Pull your bodyweight off of the ground, crossing your feet beneath you.
Keep lifting until your chin reaches the bar.
Lower yourself back down.

Repeat.",How to Do Reverse Push Ups1," As you sit down, place your arms, slightly bent, on either side of you, with your palms flat against the floor. They should be directly below your shoulders. Your legs should be stretched out in front of you, with your heels pressing into the ground.If you are experiencing knee or back pain in this position, you might try bending your knees instead of keeping them straight.Make sure that your hands are facing forward. This will help prevent injury to your wrists.;
, Push up your body off the ground by straightening out your arms. As you do so, retract your shoulders to engage them as stabilizers. Hold this position for about 30 seconds before slowly lowering your body to the floor.


As you raise your body, you should keep your hands planted on the ground directly below your shoulders.

, For this exercise to be done safely and effectively, you want to do a few slow repetitions. Aim for one to three sets with eight to 12 repetitions in each set. Move slowly and with purpose — trying to do many repetitions as quickly as possible will not engage your triceps effectively and could lead to shoulder injury. Maintain proper form throughout, keeping your spine straight and your hands positioned beneath your shoulders.


If you are just starting out, you can start with four or five repetitions. Try one to three sets, and take 45- to 60-second breaks between sets. As you get better, you can do fewer sets with more reps.

Once you have rolled out your yoga mat, you can go ahead and kneel down at the back of your mat. If you like, you can do a few shoulder rolls to prepare for the arm circle planks, since the exercise can be quite hard on your shoulders.


To do shoulder rolls, pull your shoulders towards your ears on your inhalation. When you exhale, let your shoulders drop towards the ground. Repeat this movement six times.;
, Your hands should be directly underneath you and just a little wider than your shoulders. Imagine you are about to do a push up, since the starting position for a plank is the same. Like the name implies, the plank involves holding your body as straight as a plank.If you have sensitive hands or don’t feel ready for a full plank, you can start the plank pose with your forearms on the ground instead of just your hands.

, Avoid pointing your buttocks to the ceiling or letting them fall to the floor. You want to have your legs pointing straight behind you and your entire torso straight as a plank. You don't want to push your weight back onto your heels, since this will reduce the workout for your abdominal muscles. Squeeze your abdominal muscles and glutes in order to benefit from the exercise and avoid injury.Imagine you are as straight as a tall tree. You should feel very straight and firm in this pose. It should be challenging but also rewarding.

, Check that your head is in line with your back, rather than falling to the floor. To ensure your head is in the right position, let your gaze fall to the floor about a foot down from your hands while maintaining a straight but relaxed neck. Continue holding the pose for as long as you are able. If you feel quite comfortable with your plank, you can go ahead and move on to the arm circles.If you find your head falling to the floor, it may be a sign that you are already tired from the exercise and not yet ready for the arm circles part of the exercise.

, You can do arm circles with or without a weight. If you are doing this exercise for the first time, it is best to just use your body weight. If you have been doing the exercise for a while and it is getting easy, you could hold a water bottle while doing the arm circles or use a small amount of weight.If you are just starting with weights, you could start with a two-pound weight.

, With your body weight on the right hand and your core muscles engaged, make a circle with your left hand. Imagine you are doing a windmill pitch in a baseball game, since it is a similar motion. Start by pointing your fingers towards the front of the room. Then, gradually move your arm towards the ceiling. Then, move your arm behind you towards the back of the room, and then back into the starting position. The motion should be continuous, so don’t stop at any point in the arm circle.Make sure you aren't sending your weight back onto your heels, which will give you a leg workout but will not strengthen your abdominal muscles.Your hips should be level with your shoulders., Spread the fingers on your left hand so that they can support your body weight. Gently, shift your body weight over onto your left hand so that you are prepared to do the arm circles with your right hand., With your left hand and your core muscles supporting you, make a circle with your right hand. Point your right fingers towards the front of the room. Then, gradually move your right hand in a big circle until it comes back to the starting position. Once you have done an arm circle with both your right and left arm, you will have completed one repetition of arm circle planks.


Continue to engage your abdominal muscles. To avoid too much pressure on your hands, you should engage your abdominal muscles., While you are doing the arm circles, you want to maintain good plank form. Maintain good form by keeping your core muscles fully engaged and your head aligned with your back. You also want to make sure you are not pointing your buttocks towards the ceiling or letting them fall to the ground while performing the arm circles. If you find yourself losing your plank form, you should take a rest and try again another time.Avoid letting your buttocks point to the ceiling or fall to the floor.

, Instead of moving your arms in a big circle, you could make small circles in front of you. Starting from plank position, point your fingers in front of you and make five or six tiny circles. Then, return your hand to resting position. Complete the movement on both sides. Repeat five or six times., If you find your arms are getting sore while completing the exercise, you may inadvertently arch your back. Although this may provide temporary relief, it will give you a sore back and will not exercise your core in the proper manner. If this happens, widen your shoulders and make your palms wider. With wider shoulders and palms, you should then engage your core and keep your body straight as a plank., If you have been doing a number of arm circles and get tired mid-way through, you may find your hips want to lower to the floor. This is simply a sign of fatigue. However, letting your hips fall down actually defeats the entire purpose of the exercise, which is to tone the core muscles. If this happens, tuck in your buttocks and squeeze your glutes.If it happens repeatedly, you could also try widening the width of your stance so that your feet are a little further apart and more stable.
If you are simply too fatigued, take a break and try again later when you have more energy.

, If you point your buttocks to the ceiling like in the downward dog pose, you will not be working your abdominal muscles very well. The point of the plank is to have a straight torso and engage the core muscles throughout the exercise. If you find yourself pointing your buttocks to the ceiling, simply put your hips back down and engage your abdominal muscles., While doing the arm circles, you want your hips to be parallel to the floor. Avoid letting your weight fall to one of your hips, which will result in undue strain. The goal is to keep your hips in line with your shoulders and parallel to one another throughout the exercise. You want to work both sides of your body evenly."

Sit on the edge of a chair or bench.,
Lift your body up over the chair.,
Lower yourself.,
Repeat.",How to Do Reverse Push Ups2," If you are at the gym, you can do this exercise on a bench (this exercise is also known as a ""bench dip."" If you are home, a chair with a back that is at about hip-height will do. Sit on the edge of the seat, with your hands placed on either side of you on the edge of the chair. Your feet should be planted flat on the ground. , Gripping the seat of the chair with your hands at either side of your hips, slide your butt off the chair seat so that you are supporting your weight with your hands. Keep your feet flat on the floor., Bend your elbows as you slowly lower your body in front of the chair. You only need to lower a few inches. Keep your torso upright or leaning back slightly to keep your shoulders aligned above your wrists. Your feet and thighs should remain flat, and your arms need to be firmly gripping the chair. Pause for two seconds at the bottom, then slowly straighten your arms to lift your body back to the starting position.

, Start with sets of about 10 or 15 reps, resting for at least 40 seconds in between each set. If you are having difficulty doing this many reps, you can start with eight to 12 reps. Work your way up to higher reps per set.

Keep good posture.,
Position your hands beneath the shoulders.,
Squeeze your glutes.,
Breathe.,
Go slowly.",How to Do Reverse Push Ups3," As with a normal push-up, it is important to keep your spine straight during this exercise to prevent injury. Poor posture can harm your shoulder joint.

, You should not move your hands while rising or lowering in this exercise. Keep your hands planted beneath your shoulders at all times. Do not flare your elbows out to the sides., Squeezing your glutes (or butt muscles) has a number of benefits both for your performance and health. It can protect your lower back during exercise while strengthening your posture. It can also help you keep a neutral spine.As you rise in a reverse push-up, squeeze your glutes together. Release after you have lowered yourself to the starting position.

, It is important to breathe as you exercise, and proper breathing technique will improve your performance over all. Inhale as you lower yourself and exhale as you raise yourself. Do not hold your breath., While you may want to go quickly to increase your reps, it is more effective to practice slower movements. By going slowly, you can work out more muscles than by rushing through the exercise. It also helps you concentrate on your form.

Start in regular pushup position.,
Lift your hips towards the sky.,
Lower your torso.,
Flatten your torso to the ground.,
Raise back up to start.",How to Do Divebomber Pushups1," You need to master a full pushup before you can start doing the dive bomber pushup, which is an advanced variation of a regular pushup that challenges your entire body.Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders. Keep your back straight and avoid hunching your shoulders.
Separate your feet so that they are at least shoulder-width apart to get into the starting position for the dive bomber. You can have your feet out much wider than your shoulders as well. See what feels comfortable to you.;
, While keeping your arms and legs as straight as you can, lift your hips. As you do this, contract your abs and push through your trapezius (this is the area between the back of the shoulders). Your body should create an upside down ""V"" over the ground. This is considered the ""starting position"" for a dive bomber pushup, and the position to which you will return to do multiple repetitions of this exercise.Your back should be flat, shoulders not hunched up around your ears.
You should be standing on your toes or the balls of your feet. Lengthen your hamstrings by pulling down through your heels towards the ground. In other words, contract the front of your thighs, also known as your hip flexors.

, For the next movement in the dive bomber pushup, imagine a dot or target in between your hands. As you lower towards the ground, aim to place your nose on that invisible dot or target you've imagined.Flare your elbows out to either side as you lower. This part of the movement is what distinguishes the dive bomber from the Hindu pushup or a yoga pushup, in which you keep your elbows flat along your side.

, With your elbows still flared out, flatten your body, as though you were trying to slide under a fence. Ideally, your torso will be parallel to the ground but not touching it.At this point, you are roughly halfway through the exercise. The rest of the exercise consists of returning to the starting position so you can repeat the entire set of movements.

, What makes the dive bomber pushup different from other variations is that fact that when you return to the starting position, you flare your elbows out to the sides again as you did when you first lowered.First raise your torso, keeping your hips close to the ground without touching it. Then flare out your elbows and push back through, raising your hips. Practice until you can complete the dive bomber pushup in one continual movement.
You can do dive bomber pushups in sets of 10 to 20 repetitions, or you can do them as part of an interval. To include an interval of dive bomber pushups in your workout, set a timer for 30 seconds or a minute and do as many dive bomber pushups as you can with good form during that time.

It will be the hardest move in your routine, so you want your muscles to have all of their energy.Try a little cardio to warm you up first, then roll out your muscles with a ball or foam roller.;
, Some people prefer the palm to face toward you, which is technically more of a chin-up but makes the move a bit easier to execute.


You can stand facing the bar or turn so that the bar is next to your lifting arm. Try different techniques to see what feels comfortable.

, You will only need to do this the first few times, but it will help support your lifting arm and also give you a little extra lifting power.Think of your non-lifting arm as the ""support arm"" and only use it as needed. Try to rely on the lifting arm to do most of the work, but use the support arm to help pull yourself up.

, Instead of holding your wrist, or once you've accomplished a pullup using a supporting arm, swing your non-lifting arm a bit.


This will give your body momentum, which makes that first rep a bit easier., Bend your arm at the elbow and focus your lifting between your shoulder blades and across your arm muscles.


Lift all the way up, until your head passes the bar. Be careful not to hit yourself on the chin on your way down!
It can help to bend your legs under you, crossing your ankles. This gives your body more stability than if you let your legs flail.

, You won't be able to do many in the beginning-- maybe only one-- so go till your muscles won't do any more.Wait three minutes before trying another set.

, Before you can do regular pull-ups, and especially before mastering the much more challenging one-armed pull up, you need to build strength in your arms. There are many exercises you can do to help build muscle mass and strength in the arms:


Work on one armed lat pulldowns. You need to train on a lat pulldown machine to execute this move, which involves sitting on a bench and pulling a weighted handle down to your chest.Start at comfortable weight (which will vary depending on your fitness level), but work up to two to three repetitions using 20 or 30 percent more weight than your body weight. For example, if you weigh 150, your goal will be to accomplish 2-3 repetitions lifting 180-195 pounds.Be sure to work both arms equally at each training session.
Try the bench press. Bench pressing weight engages both your chest and your arms, which are both players in proper pull-ups. You can start with just the bar if you have no arm strength, or as much weight as you can manage. Gradually add more weight over the course of a few weeks to increase muscle mass and strength.Master push-ups. Push-ups engage your arms, chest, and back, and can help strengthen your arms for pull-ups. Once you've mastered regular push-ups, learn the one armed push up and be sure to master it with both arms.

, Contrary to what you might have heard, the arms are not the most important muscle group involved in executing a pull-up. In fact, the serratus anterior (SA) muscle, located on your back under your shoulder blades, holds all the muscles together that are needed for executing a pull-up. If yours is not correctly conditioned, your shoulder blades are out of position and pull-ups are next to impossible to execute, no matter how strong your arms.Soften the SA and surrounding muscles first, by using a lacrosse ball, tennis ball, or foam roller to release tension and get your muscles in the right position. Laying on a mat or rubber floor, or learning against a wall, roll the ball hard against your muscles across your pectorals (your chest), teres muscles (directly behind and in your armpits), and SA muscles. Roll gently at first, then increase pressure in tender spots.Strengthen your back and particularly your SA muscles by focusing on back exercises such as downward facing dog, push ups, reverse flys, and cable rows.

, You will need to be able to do more than 25 strict pull ups before you learn the one arm pull up. Using the proper form is crucial as you learn how to do this in order to avoid injury and maximize the benefit of the workout.


Using an overhand grip and keeping your hands about shoulder-distance apart, hang from a pull-up bar with your arms extended. Slowly raise your body by bending the elbows, bringing your chest as close to the bar as you can. Slowly lower yourself back to arms extended.Be sure to exercise different grips. You can do chin-ups, which are like typical pull-ups but with your hands slightly closer together and your palms facing towards you. You can also try widening your grip to engage the back muscles.
Once you've mastered regular pull-ups, introduce a new challenge by raising yourself with two arms but lowering yourself with only one, alternating arms at each pull. This gets you one step closer to full one armed pullups., You will probably never meet someone that can do over 20 pull ups who hasn't exercised weighted pull ups.


Start with a very small amount of additional weight (only one or two pounds) then gradually add more as you master each level. You can wear leg weights, attach weight to a belt, or even put it in a backpack.

, It takes a lot of dedication to start with a regular two arm pull up, which is hard enough for most people, and reach the one arm pull up.


Having a regular exercise schedule and a plan for increasing your weights and repetitions can be helpful. It can also be helpful to enlist a trainer or friend to motivate you and keep you accountable.

, Once you've mastered the basic one-armed pull-up, you can gradually train your muscles to handle even more pressure.


Start with just a bit of weight. One or two pounds makes a lot of difference with this difficult move.

, This will increase your arm strength beyond body weight exercises.


Make sure to use proper form and no swinging and to progress slowly with the weights. Do them with slowly with more time under tension.

, This will target your bicep long head. Make sure you do this with the full range of motion so you teach your bicep to work hard when its fully extended.

, This will activate your deltoids and upper chest which are used in the one arm pull up.

, Take all the exercises listed in previous steps and do them with heavier weight, except now let the weight down as slowly as you can.


This will train the muscles to be able to endure a lot of pressure with time under tension which is important in the one arm pull up/chin up.

, It is a great exercise to improve bicep strength and endurance that is needed in the one arm pull up.


Every person who can do at least a single one arm pull up will be tough in arm wrestling. It is not a coincidence. If you want to get better at either exercise, do the other one. Grab a friend or a relative who is stronger than you and practice.

Try wall-plank dive bombers.,
Do dive bombers on a BOSU ball.,
Combine dive bombers with renegade rows.",How to Do Divebomber Pushups2," Because your feet are at an elevation and there's a balance element involved, wall-plank dive bombers present your body with more of a challenge than the regular dive bomber pushup.Stand with your back to a wall and kick your feet up onto the wall. To start, you probably want to keep your feet pretty low on the wall. The higher your feet are on the wall, the more challenging the exercise.
Complete the dive bomber pushup with your feet on the wall. You won't be lowering your torso and hips all the way to the ground since your feet are on the wall, you'll just be lowering your hips to roughly the same level as your feet.

, A BOSU ball, which is half a stability ball with a flat surface on the other side, is a variation of the dive bomber pushup that adds a balance element.Instead of placing your hands on the floor, place the BOSU ball in front of you, ball-side on the floor, and grasp either side of the flat surface with your hands. Keep your arms straight and maintain balance and even weight distribution.

, When you add a renegade row to the end of each dive bomber push up you do, you build strength in your arms and shoulders while also working on your core and back.Choose dumb bells that are a good weight for you for rowing exercises (you may want to start lighter than you first think), and hold them in your hands from starting position. The dumb bells should be sitting on the floor, so if you have dumb bells that have hexagon-shaped heads you might want to use those so they don't roll around.
Do the dive bomber pushup like normal, but when you push back up to starting position, lift the weight with a rowing motion, first with one arm and then with the other. Stay in dive bomber start position with your stable arm straight, wrist directly below your shoulder.

Learn Hindu pushups.,
Move on to pike pushups.,
Improve your balance with the Spiderman pushup.,
Work your quads and calves with the corkscrew pushup.,
Build fast-twitch muscle with explosive pushups.",How to Do Divebomber Pushups3," There is a lot of debate in the fitness world over which variation is a better whole-body workout: the Hindu pushup or the dive bomber pushup. However, both are challenging variations and you can switch between the two to decide which one you like better.Unlike the dive bomber pushup, when you press back up to starting position with the Hindu pushup, you do not bend your arms outward. Rather, you keep your arms straight and lift your hips, pushing your torso backward.
With a Hindu pushup, you also want to keep your elbows to your side when you lower your body. You won't flay your elbows out to your side as you do with a dive bomber pushup.

, Pike pushups are a challenging workout for your shoulders. You also can use this exercise to help you transition if you gradually want to get into handstand pushups.Stand in a position similar to your starting position for the dive bomber push up, with your hips lifted toward the sky. However, your arms should be perpendicular to the floor, so your hands will be a little closer to your feet than they are when you're doing dive bomber pushups.
From this position, simply lower your head all the way to the floor, bending your elbows, then straighten your arms to raise back up to the starting position. You can do this exercise in sets of 10-20 repetitions, or you can do an interval of 30 seconds or a minute with continual movement.

, The Spiderman pushup works your obliques. This pushup is done from your standard pushup position on your toes and hands, with your wrists directly below your shoulders.As you lower, bend one leg at the knee and bring it up to your side, so that your knee is near your elbow.
From here, you can keep your knee out and do several pushups, then bring it back to start and do the other side. You also can bring it back to start immediately and switch legs with every repetition.

, This twisting variation on the standard pushup gives your obliques a good workout and helps with your balance, as well as getting your lower body into the action.Get in standard pushup position to start this exercise, with your feet together. When your arms are fully extended, your body should be parallel to the floor.
As you bend your arms to lower yourself towards the ground, bend your knees and twist your legs and lower body sideways, like you're a cork being twisted by a giant corkscrew. Come back to top center, then twist down on the other side.
You can do this exercise in sets of 10 to 20 repetitions (remember to keep both sides even), or you can do as many as you can with good form in an interval of 30 seconds or a minute.

, If you want to improve your speed and explosive power, explosive pushups can help build and strengthen the muscles that make that possible. Typically an explosive pushup is one combined with another movement, such as a clap or a jump.For example, to do an explosive pushup with a clap you simply push off with your hands so hard that your body is lifted off the ground. Clap and return your hands to the floor. Once you get more explosive power, you can work up to double claps or even triple claps.
Explosive pushups typically are better done in intervals because they are very intense and can fatigue your muscles quickly.

Raise your backside into the air.,
Inhale deeply.,
Bend your elbows and lower your chest.,
Arch your lower and upper back.,
Straighten your arms and look up.,
Return to the starting position.,
Repeat.",How to Do Hindu Pushups," To prevent injury, you should always start any type of exercise, including the Hindu push-up, with stretching. Stretching will loosen your muscles and enable you to do this exercise more fluidly.Start stretching by standing up, with your feet spread shoulder length apart. Then, bend to touch your toes on each foot, and hold for 10 seconds.
Alternatively, you can stretch sitting down. Sit on the floor with your legs spread, similar to a V position. Reach for your toes on the left foot, right foot, and then reach as far as you can in the middle, and hold for 10 seconds.;
, To start the Hindu push-up, get into a normal, starting push-up position. With your knees bent and touching the ground, place your hands on the ground directly under your shoulders (your arms should be straight). Then, slowly remove your knees from the floor and dig your toes into the ground to stabilize the lower half of your body. You should be in a high plank position.For beginners, place your hands and feet a little farther than shoulder width.More advanced trainees can keep their hands and feet closer together for a more intense workout., Once you are in the starting push-up position, begin to raise your backside up into the air. As you raise your backside into the air, keep your arms, legs, and back straight. At this point, your eyes should be looking at your feet. In this position, you will look like an upside down V.This V position is essentially the starting position, and you will return to this position after you complete each push-up.

, Before you begin the next movements of the push-up, remember to breathe in deeply through your nose., While breathing in, begin to bend your elbows outward and lower your chest to the ground. Your backside should be more level to the ground, but still pointing slightly upward at this point. You will feel as if you are in a flexed push-up position with your backside slightly pointed upward.

, As your chest gets lower to the ground, in a scooping motion, scoop your head upward while arching your lower and upper back. Exhale through your mouth as you do this motion. At this point, you are essentially at the “bottom” of the push-up.

, After scooping your head in a round, upward motion and arching your back, straighten your arms, lift your torso, and look upwards.Your hips should be down towards the floor, but not touching the floor.


At this point, you have pretty much completed the Hindu push-up, but you still need to return to the starting position.

, To return to the starting position, lower your torso and lift your hips to return to the V position; use your abs and gluteus, i.e., your butt muscles, to bring your backside up into the air. As you push back to the starting position, inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale through your mouth as you reach the V position.To return to the starting position, you do not need to reverse back through the sweeping, arching motion. Simply push back into the starting position.

, If you are a beginner, it is recommended that you do as many push-ups or repetitions as you are able to, for example, three or five repetitions is fine. If you need to rest during the exercise, take a break in the starting V position. As you become better you can add more sets and repetitions. For example, you can do two sets of three repetitions or push-ups. If you are more advanced, you can do more sets with more repetitions. For example, three sets with eight to ten push-ups or repetitions.These push-ups should be done seamlessly in a sweeping motion without delay between each part.

"
"
Make sure your form is correct.,
Breathe correctly.,
Start out easy.,
Add more push ups.,
Be consistent with your routine.",How to Build Muscle Doing Push Ups1," When performing the push up, your lower back must be straight, i.e., not sagging or arching, and your feet must be shoulder width apart. Your elbows should be tucked close to your body, i.e., at a 20 to 40 degree angle from your abdomen. As you go down, make sure your chest gets as close to the floor as possible.Make sure to tighten your abdomen, legs, and buttocks. This will prevent your back from arching and sagging.
Try not to let your hips touch the floor. They should be on the same level as your shoulders.;
, When you are performing the push up, make sure to inhale as you go down. Then exhale as you go back up.If it is hard for you to remember to breathe, then count out loud as you do your push ups. The act of talking will force you to breathe as you do your push ups.

, Start out by doing as many push ups as you comfortably can. This is called a set. Then do two more sets. Make sure to rest for at least 30 seconds in between sets. Practice this three to four times a week, or every other day until you are comfortable. For example, if you can only do seven full push ups, then start out by doing three sets of seven push ups every other day until you are comfortable.

, Once you can comfortably do your normal number of push ups, add three to five more push ups. Adding more push ups will challenge your muscles, enabling you to build more muscle.


For example, once you can do seven push ups comfortably, add three more push ups to make a total of ten. Make sure to do three sets of 10 push ups every other day to build your muscles further.

, Make sure to stick to your routine. If you find it hard to stick to a routine, then ask a friend to join you. Alternatively, you can hire a personal trainer to keep you on track as you strive for your goal. For example, if you have been doing push ups three days a week, then do not throw off your routine by reducing it to twice a week.
Depending on the intensity of your routine, you may see results in one to two months.

Assume a face-down prone position on the floor.,
Raise yourself using your arms.,
Pick the type of push up that works best for you.",How to Do a Push Up1," Keep your feet together. Your weight should be on your chest.









Position hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart. They should be about next to your shoulders, with your elbows pointed towards your toes.
If you are on a relatively cushioned surface, such as a carpeted floor, you may also support yourself on your fists between the first and second knuckles for a greater challenge. If you are on a less forgiving surface, consider investing in some push up grips, (they look like handles you put on the floor).
Curl your toes upward (towards your head). The balls of your feet should touch the ground.;
, At this point, your weight should be supported by your hands and the balls of your feet. Make a straight line from your head to your heels, and contract your abdominals to keep your hips from sagging. This position is called a ""plank,"" which is used for other various exercises. This is the beginning and the end position of a single push up.








, There are actually three types of basic push up variations that use different muscles. The difference is where you place your hands while in the plank position. The closer your hands are together, the more you will engage your triceps. The wider apart they are, the more you will engage your chest.


Regular: your hands should be slightly wider than your shoulders. This works both your arms and your chest.
Diamond: put your hands close together in a diamond shape, keep them directly under your chest. This will require you to engage your arms much more than a standard push up.
Wide-arm: place your hands a good way's out from your shoulders. This version mostly works the chest and requires less strength in the arms.

Find an elevated surface.,
Lean in with your feet spread apart.,
Lower yourself.,
Push upward.,
Repeat and change sides.,
Lower yourself to the ground on two hands.,
Extend your secondary arm outward.,
Lower and raise yourself.,
Try a “negative” one-armed push-up, alternately.,
Repeat and change sides.,
Assume the position.,
Lower your body with one arm.,
Push up from the floor.,
Repeat, if you’re up to it.",How to Do a One Armed Push Up," Elevated one-armed push-ups are a good way to start. The idea is that by using a raised surface, your legs take on more body weight and give you a mechanical advantage. The push-up is therefore easier to accomplish.Try a countertop, steps, couch, or wall at home. If you are outdoors, a bench or bar will do.
Keep in mind that the higher you angle your body, the more body weight your legs will support and the easier the push-up will be.
Don’t overdo it. Find a surface and inclination that suit your current strength level and work from there.;
, Besides inclination, your feet will also make a difference. Namely, the push-up will be easier if they are wider apart.Stand with your feet positioned a bit wider than your shoulders, and slowly lower yourself into push-up position on the elevated surface.


Some purists think that one-armed push-ups should be done with the feet together. You don’t need to follow this rule absolutely. You can also start wide and gradually move your feet inward as you progress.
It’s a good idea to start with your “dominant” arm. In other words, whichever arm you favor and that is naturally stronger. You can alternate arms, as well.
As you get in a starting position, let your free arm rest behind your back or against one leg.

, Slowly and deliberately lower your body until your chest almost touches the elevated surface. Your supporting arm should be bent at an acute angle of less than 90 degrees. If you want, hold this position for a few seconds.


Some people advise keeping your whole body tense during the downward motion. This is supposed to help you explode upward. It will also keep your spine straight and reduce the risk of injury.Keep your bent arm back and close to your body, not jutting out like a chicken wing. Flaring your elbow out can lead to shoulder and rotator cuff injuries.Brace your abs and clench your gluteal muscles — that is, the muscles around your torso and bum.

, Push away from the incline and back to the starting position in a single, fluid motion. The body tension you have generated before and during this move should help you to explode upward and finish the first “rep.”


Imagine that you are pushing the floor away rather than pushing yourself up. This image should let you generate more tension and engage more muscle groups., Repeat the above steps and complete a full set of reps. Then, switch to the other side. For instance, if you started with right-armed push-ups, try it with your left arm. Adjust your elevation height to suit any differences in strength.


Try to do about six reps comfortably in a set to start.In other words, you should be able to do the full push-up motion in good form.
If you are bold, try another set of reps after resting a few hours. Doing the reps while fresh will encourage you to use good form and build up greater power and endurance.Once you feel good at a certain level, lower the inclination and raise the weight resistance. Continue to repeat these steps until you have reached the ground.

, The next step in your progression is to do “self-assisted” push-ups. These are almost true one-handed push-ups, but with small cheats to let you build up more strength. First, lower yourself slowly to the ground with both hands. These push-ups are done level to the ground, rather than on an elevated surface.


Assume a position as if you were going to do normal, two-handed push-ups.
Again, make sure to keep your feet slightly wider than your shoulders.

, Reach out — up and to the side — with your secondary arm, i.e. the arm that will not be supporting your body. The idea is to let this free arm “assist” in the push-up by taking on a small amount of weight, but to rely on it as little as possible. Over time, you will build up strength and come to rely on it even less.You can also place the assisting arm on a slightly elevated surface.

, As before, slowly lower your body until your chest is nearly touching the ground and your supporting arm is at an acute angle. Then, try to explode upward in a single and fluid motion.


You may have trouble at first with raising yourself. That is OK. Simply shift some body weight to the assisting arm. You can also try widening your foot stance.
Again, keep your core muscles tight through the motion to create body tension and protect your spine. Keep your elbow in (no chicken wings), and pull your shoulder blades down and back

, Another move that can build up your strength and perfect your form is the “negative” push-up. This means focusing on the negative or lowering phase. At this point, you are nearly at the true one-armed push-up.Use one arm for this maneuver. Keep your free arm behind your back.
From the starting position, lower yourself to the ground. Move as slowly as you can and keep control over the movement.
When you reach the bottom, place your free hand on the ground and push up. Continue with your set.

, Whether you try the self-assisted or negative one-armed push-up, make sure to switch it up and use your other arm. You can also alternate arms for each rep rather than doing a full set.


It is important to use both arms to avoid creating muscle imbalances or differences in strength.

, OK, you know what to do by now. Take the standard push-up position: prone, feet apart, and hands on the floor just below your shoulders.Begin from the “up” position, i.e. with your body raised off the ground and supported by your arm.
Keep your feet apart. If you want to increase the challenge, though, feel free to move your feet in so that they nearly touch.
Take your off-arm and rest it on the small of your back.
In a resting position, the elbow of your supporting arm should be slightly bent, not locked.

, Let your body move toward the ground. Be sure to control the movement as much as you can. It should be slow and deliberate, not strained or jerky. Continue until your chin is about a fist’s width above the floor.


To maintain your balance better, Turning your torso slightly away from the supporting arm, form a sort of triangle with your arm and two feet, can help you keep your balance.Keeping your hips and shoulders square throughout the movement will be more challenging. Either way, do not let your hips sag.
If you’ve angled your body, your chin will be about where your free hand was before you started the exercise.
Remember to keep your elbow back and close to your body and do not allow it to flare out. Keep your shoulder blades retracted.

, Now, with all your might, push your body up from the floor to the starting position. Make sure to keep your back straight and to stop just before you “lock out” at the elbow. Congratulations! You’ve now done a true, one-armed push-up!Keep your muscle tightened as before, so that it is possible for you to “explode” upward.
Be careful to stop if you don’t think you can make it. You could injure yourself if your arm gives out.

, Ideally, your first true one arm will be the first of many. Try to do it with your other arm and see if you can manage a set of two, three, or more.


Continue to go slowly. Start with reps of one or two. Rest for several hours before trying again.
Over time, you should be able to work up to higher and higher rep numbers — repeat to exhaustion for an intense arm and chest workout!

Wear a weighted vest.,
Use a weighted backpack.,
Have a friend apply pressure onto your back.",How to Build Muscle Doing Push Ups2," Weighted vests are a great way to add resistance to your push up and build your muscles further. Strap the weighted vest on as tight as you can while still remaining comfortable. This way, you can prevent the vest from sagging and hindering your movements. Then do your normal push ups.You can purchase weighted vests from your local sporting goods store.

, This is a great alternative to wearing a weighted vest. Fill a backpack with books, bags of rice, or other heavy objects. The weight of the backpack should equal to 20 percent of your body weight. Then do your normal push ups.For example, if you weigh 120 pounds, then your backpack should weigh at least 24 pounds.

, While you are doing your normal push up, ask a friend to place their hand on your upper back. Tell them to apply pressure on your back as you raise yourself up from the push up.Make sure your friend applies consistent pressure for each push up.

Do an incline push up.,
Do a single leg push up.,
Try a diamond push up.,
Attempt a one-handed push up.,
Try a plyometric push up.",How to Build Muscle Doing Push Ups3," This type of push up involves elevating your feet. Start by elevating your feet about 10 to 12 inches from the ground. Then do a normal push up.Use a stack of books or another type of platform to elevate your feet.
The higher you elevate your feet, the harder the push up will be.

, Get into the normal push up position. Make sure your back is straight, your feet are shoulder width apart, and your elbows are tucked into your sides. Then lift one of your legs and perform a regular push up.Do a number you are comfortable with. Then repeat the push up, lifting your other leg.

, Position your hands in front of your chest on the floor. Press your thumbs and fingers together to form a diamond shape with your hands. Make sure your legs and back are straight. Then do a normal push up.Diamond push ups are great for working out your triceps.

, For this push up, place your feet wider than shoulder width apart. Place one hand more to the center of your chest. Place your other hand behind your back. Then lower yourself and push up. Make sure to keep your elbow close to your body as you do your push ups.If one-handed push ups are difficult for you, then start training your body by doing a regular push up, but with your hands close together like a diamond push up. This will help you progress from the regular, two-handed push ups to the more difficult one-handed push ups.

, Get into the standard push up position. Lower yourself to the floor as you normally would while doing a regular push up. As you extend back up, push up as fast as you can and with as much force as you can until your hands become airborne. Then go back to the starting position and repeat.Challenge yourself by clapping your hands while they are airborne in between push ups.

First you must get on the ground.,
Raise yourself by pushing the ground away from you.,
Repeat lowering and raising at a steady pace.",How to Do a Push Up2," Lay with your toes on the ground holding yourself up with your hands. Lower your torso to the ground until your elbows reach a 90 degree angle. Keep your elbows close to your body for more resistance. Keep your head facing forward. Try to have the tip of your nose pointed directly ahead. Keep your body in a flat plank—do not drop your hips, and do not have your butt hanging in the air. It is important to keep your body as straight as possible. Remember to breath as you lower yourself.









When doing push ups, your chest should come within inches of the ground each time you go down for a rep. Remember to keep your body at a flat level.

, Breathe out as you push. The power for that push will come from your shoulders and chest working in unison. The triceps (the muscle on the back side of your upper arm) are also contracted but they aren't the primary muscle group being used. Don't be tempted to use your rear end or your stomach. Continue to exert force until your arms are almost in a straight position again, make sure to not lock your arms.








, Each pair counts as a single push up. Do this until you finish your set or you hit your maximum.

, In the plank position, instead your hands together beneath you in the shape of a diamond. Now do the push up with your hands in this form. This requires significantly more strength in your arms. To add more pressure to the chest try squeezing your hands together on the floor. The point isn't too move them it so you can get activation of the chest.








, Begin to do a standard push up or a basic variation of the push up. When you finish lowering yourself, raise one leg off the floor bend your knee towards your back and to the side. Do individual sets for each leg, or alternate between legs.








, Do a standard push up or a basic variation of push up. When you finish lowering yourself, lift one leg off the floor and pull your knee to the side up to your shoulder. Do individual sets for each leg, or alternate between legs. If done properly, this should engage the core in addition to the upper-body.

, Spread your legs further than normal (for balance), put one of your arms on your back, and proceed with the push up using one arm.








, Instead of using the palms of your hands, put your weight on your fists, using the first two knuckles of each hand. These require more strength in the arms and wrists, and are a good way to condition your knuckles for boxing or martial arts.








, If you are very strong, you can try doing push ups using only your fingers, instead of your palms.

, You can increase the difficulty of your push ups by putting your feet up slightly higher.

Push up from your knees.,
Do push ups on an incline.",How to Do a Push Up4," If you aren't quite to the point of doing full push ups yet, try starting with your weight on your knees instead of the balls of your feet. Perform the push up as normal, and when you can do these easily start trying regular push ups.

, You can make push ups easier by performing them with your hands on a somewhat higher level than your feet. Find an incline like a hill or use a piece of furniture to start your push up training until you are ready for a level surface.

Find a spot.,
Get your footing and hand placement.,
Lower yourself against the wall.,
Lift yourself back up.,
Repeat.,
Gauge your progress.,
Progress to a lower surface.,
Consider doing bench presses.",How to Do a Wall Push Up," Before you start doing wall push ups, you should make sure the wall you've chosen can accommodate push ups. An ideal spot should be away from any corners so that you have a long, straight wall. Additionally, the wall you choose should be free from any objects or obstacles.


Make sure there is nothing hanging on the wall where you decide to do push ups. This includes picture frames, decorations, etc.
Choose a blank part of the wall that is also far from any potential hazards, like windows or kitchen ""pass through"" window holes (for a breakfast bar).;
, Proper stance and positioning is important for doing a wall push up. If you are too close to the wall, you won't get a proper workout and could potentially hurt your back. If you're too far from the wall, you could risk falling to the floor or hurting your back from arching it uncomfortably. Positioning yourself may require you to lean slightly, so make sure you're ready to perform the wall push up once you're in place.









While facing the wall, stand just over one arm's length away.For most people, a comfortable stance will probably be between 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 centimeters) away from the wall.Keep your feet shoulder-width apart.
Put the palms of both hands flat against the wall at shoulder height, approximately shoulder-width apart.

, Controlled movements are important in this (or any) form of push up. If you let yourself drop too quickly, you could lose your balance, yet moving too slowly could cause you to get tired out very quickly.









Keep your feet planted firmly on the floor. Do not lift or shuffle your feet at all while doing push ups.
Slowly bend your elbows and lower your upper body towards the wall (without hitting yourself against it, of course).
Lower yourself to a count of four. That is generally a safe span of time in which to drop down during a push up.
Breathe in while you are lowering yourself. It's much easier to inhale while you are doing the ""easier"" portion of an exercise motion and to exhale on the strenuous component.Keep your back and hips straight as you lower yourself.Pause when your chest and/or chin is touching the wall.One or two seconds should be sufficient.

, Once again, a slow and well-controlled motion is crucial during wall push ups, and that includes when you are lifting yourself back up. Don't rush it or you could hurt your back, shoulders, or elbows.









Exhale as you begin to push off the wall.Lift yourself up to a count of two. You shouldn't need as much time as you took lowering yourself, since there is not as much risk of hitting the wall while returning to your start position.
Continue to keep your feet firmly planted with your back and hips straight throughout the push up.The push up is complete when you have completely returned to your starting position. Make sure that you do not lock your elbows once your arms are fully extended or you could injure yourself.

, By now you've successfully completed a wall push up with the proper form and positioning. But you won't build any muscle by doing one single push up! It's important to work out in sets with a predetermined number of repetitions per set in order to get the most out of your workout.









10 to 15 push ups is a good number of repetitions in a given set.Rest for one or two minutes after finishing your first set. Then, if you're able to, try to do another set of 10 to 15 push ups.

, Doing wall push ups is a great way to strengthen your pectoral and tricep muscles.However, just because you can do a few sets of wall push ups, it doesn't necessarily mean you should move to the floor just yet.









It takes time and consistent effort to build muscle mass.
By some accounts, it can take anywhere from six months to a year before you build any noticeable muscle mass.Make sure you've adequately built some muscle before trying to advance your workout routine into anything more challenging.

, Once you've built some muscle from doing wall push ups and can comfortable do multiple sets, you may want to progress to something more challenging. Before you tackle traditional push ups on the floor, it's a good idea to work your way down to lower and lower levels (and build more muscle mass in the process).








First, try doing push ups off of a counter ledge. It's slightly lower than a shoulder-height spot on the wall, but still easy enough to execute the movements without much difficulty.
Progress to a couch armrest. The armrest of a couch will be slightly lower still than the counter. Just make sure your couch is sturdy - have someone sit on the opposite end if there is any risk of the couch flipping over on you.
Finally, after several weeks of training at each incremental height, you may be ready to try the floor. Doing a regular push up off the floor is difficult, though, so make sure you're ready for it.
There is no objective measure of when you're ready to advance your workout. Only you can decide when wall push ups (and each subsequently lower surface) become easy enough to do comfortably.

, Eventually, after many weeks or months of doing different types of push ups, your workout routine may hit a wall. As you get stronger and build up more and more muscle mass, push ups (off of any surface) won't offer you enough of a challenge. When this happens, you may want to consider a weight-lifting regimen like bench presses.








Bench presses work many of the same muscles as push ups, but have the added benefit that you can add more weight on once your current routine becomes too comfortable.
Remember that it's important to measure your progress and decide for yourself whether or not you are ready and able to advance your training to something more challenging.
Have someone you trust who is able to lift weights supervise (or ""spot"") you while you lift weights. That way, if anything goes wrong or if you can't lift the weights, your friend or gym buddy will be able to help you get the weights back on the rack.

Clap more than once.",How to Do a Clapping Push Up," Get into an arm-supported position with your hands positioned beneath your shoulders and fingers spread slightly, ready to push. Engage the muscles of the core and lower back by tensing the abdominals to keep your body in one rigid line. Poise on the toes or balls of your feet to maintain balance throughout the movement.In push up position, the body should be firmly locked into place, but not tense. It can help to keep the neck straight and the legs in line under the hips as if you were standing.;
, Bend the elbows to initiate the first part of the push up. Keep the elbows close the body and lower your weight in a smooth, controlled manner. The lowering portion of the push up should take between half a second to a full second; any longer will be using up strength and stability. Stop lowering yourself when your chest touches the floor, or just above it.








, Reverse the motion by pushing hard through the palms. Again, focus on speed here. Imagine that you’re attempting to push yourself all the way up to a standing position. Keep your force consistent through every part of the push up.








, Just as your arms reach full extension, pull your hands up off the floor. Timing of this part of the movement is crucial: if you time it right, you should feel like you’re floating for a brief moment. This is the interval during which you will perform the clap. If you find that you’re having trouble with your timing, continue feeling out the final part of the movement using the plyo push up.








If you lift the hands too soon or too late, you’ll lose the benefit of momentum and all height.

, Once you’ve pushed your body up and your hands are off the floor, bring them together in one quick motion in front of the chest. Ideally, you should clap the hands together while hovering in the highest position of the “jump,” and be ready to plant them back down by the time you begin descending. Separate the hands and place them back underneath your shoulders, catching yourself as you fall.








It’s okay to catch yourself somewhat low as you descend. This might make it tricky to begin the next clapping push up if you’re performing them in sequence, but it’s safer to land on bent, expectant arms. Landing in full extension may jar the elbows.

, A proper push up starts in a position in which your body is in perfect alignment from the top of your head to your feet, and your weight is supported by your toes and extended arms. The core should be kept tight to keep the lower back from arching or sagging. From here, lower your weight in a smooth, controlled motion until your chest just touches the ground, then reverse the motion by pressing with the chest, deltoid and tricep muscles until you’re back in the position from which you started.








When doing a push up, keep your elbows tucked close to your sides at about 45 degree angle instead of letting them flare out perpendicularly to your body. This will put you in a more natural position to utilize muscular leverage and prevent your shoulder joints from moving through angles that may strain them. Your elbows should track outward and slightly behind you, so that if viewed from above the position of your body would form the shape of an arrow rather than a “T.”, From a fully extended position, lower yourself until the movement of your body is stopped by the ground, then push back up. This is what is known as full range of motion, the distance through which your muscles and joints are able to move in a given exercise. Using full range of motion ensures that you build strength through each individual portion of the movement—at the bottom, where your leverage is weakest, in the middle “sticking point” where your triceps take over and at the top to lock out your arms.








Because our bodies are all different, range of motion will be slightly different for everybody. Some may not have the shoulder mobility necessary to descend all the way to the floor, while past injuries might make certain positions too painful to get into. Keep this in mind when training the clapping push up and don’t put yourself at any unnecessary risk. Go as deep as you can in the movement until you experience discomfort (or hit the floor).
Don’t actually lock out your elbows at the top. “Lock out” only means full extension, not over-extension. The arm should be in a straight line and held firm, with another inch or so of movement in the elbow. If there’s no room for movement in the elbow, you’re overextending.

, Practice the standard push up until you can do 5-10 consecutively. At this point, add multiple sets into your workout. Try to stay one or two repetitions shy of as many as you can do to save some energy for the next set. Begin a training regimen to work on your push up strength and work capacity several times a week.









Always take time off to rest every couple of days to give the body time to recover., Concentrate on the concentric portion of the push up (the actual pushing part) and try to lift your weight from the floor as rapidly as you can. The clapping push up is a plyometric maneuver, which essentially means that it relies on explosive strength to overcome resistance and move the body. Similar to jumping, the faster you’re able to get into a position of leverage and push, the more power you’ll be able to generate and the higher you’ll go.








Power = force X velocity. Put simply: push fast!Bottoms-up and plyo push ups are great ways to train force output. Bottoms-up push ups start from the floor rather than full arm extension and focus on building strength in the most disadvantaged position of the push up; plyo push ups are just like standard push ups, but rather than stopping at lockout, continue pushing so that the hands leave the floor in a quick “jump.” These also serve as a sensible precursor to clapping push ups.Once you're able to do multiple standard push ups with strict technique and explosive speed, you're ready to add the clap to the movement.

, Once you’ve trained to the point that clapping push ups become easy for you, add difficulty to the movement and continue building strength by linking together multiple clapping push ups. Rather than doing a set of regular push ups, try making them clapping push ups, aiming for about half the number you can do in a normal set. Performing consecutive clapping push ups is also a bit of a challenge in terms of rhythm, timing and stabilization strength, as it requires you to catch yourself and begin the next push up in a disadvantaged position.








There’s a lot of force passing through the shoulder joint during the push and the landing. If you’re not careful, injury can occur.

, Strap on a weighted vest or place a light weight plate in a secure position on your lower back and perform 1-5 clapping push ups this way. Increasing the resistance of the push up forces you to press through the movement harder and faster, which translates to major increases in strength. Keep the number of reps in each set relatively low; because the clapping push up is an explosive plyometric exercise requiring short, intense bursts of strength, your force output and work capacity will drop off rather quickly, eventually putting you at risk of exhaustion or injury., Regular push ups target the chest, shoulders and, to a lesser degree, the triceps. Shift emphasis to the triceps by placing the hands closer together under the body in the starting planche position, touching the forefinger and thumbs of both hands together to loosely form a “diamond.” Proceed to push up in the same manner, making sure to keep the elbows from flaring straight out. Diamond clapping push ups will add strength and mass to your triceps, which will in turn strengthen the upper portion of the push up.Balance will play more of a role in the clapping diamond push up. Because the hands are in a much more narrow stance beneath the body, you will have to actively work to maintain balance as you descend, push and catch.
Having the hands so close together in the starting position can make it hard to get a good clap. Some people prefer to bring the hands around and clap behind the back, instead, but this is a very advanced variant of the diamond clapping push up.

, Find an object 8”-12” in height and rest the feet on top of it before performing clapping push ups. As the angle of the body is raised, leverage is taken away from the pectorals, which forces the muscles of the shoulder to compensate. The frontal deltoids will get a very intense workout.Elevate the feet as high as you like. Theoretically, there’s no limit to how high you can raise the angle of your body, as long as you stay in alignment and the shoulders are strong enough to bear and manipulate your weight. At a vertical limit, the exercise basically becomes a clapping handstand push up.

, For the ultimate test of clapping push up strength, continue training the exercise until you can clap twice consecutively in a single push up. To do this, you’ll need to be able to achieve an impressive amount of height and hang-time from the push, which means having extremely well-developed pushing power. If you can clap more than 3 or 4 times after one push up, you may be in world record contention!


Don't cheat; make each clap distinct.

In the fourth week, you choose another exercise which you will perform 4-5 sets of(all to be followed with 45 seconds of rest between sets)
After the first 4 weeks, your program will change; now you pick three exercises, one exercise for each workout. Now you raise it to 5 sets, to failure, and 1 minute of rest in between sets. Every week you mix your program so it's never the same.
After the first 8 weeks, your program will once again change; now you will do all of the four exercises in every workout, but in every workout you do the exercises in a different order to keep the diversity in the training.
Take 3 days of rest and do another test, taking as many push-ups as possible' the progress you've made will be obvious. If you still haven't reached 100 push-ups (which most people won't have after the first time they finished the program), then repeat the cycle.

",How to Do 1000 Push Ups2," Warming up reduces the risk of injury and gets muscles ready to do a push up. You can actually lift/push/pull/etc more if you go through a proper warm up routine as compared to diving straight into the exercises. Make sure to stretch your arms and wrists - key joints in push ups.

, Keep your feet together!

, If you are on a relatively cushioned surface, such as a carpeted floor, simply support yourself on your fists between the first and second knuckles. If you are on a less forgiving surface, consider investing in some pushup grips (they look like handles you put on the floor.) Curl your toes upward (towards your head) so that the balls of your feet touch the ground.

, At this point, your weight should be supported by your hands and the balls of your feet. Make a straight line from your head to your heels. This position is called ""plank,"" which is used for other various exercises. This is the beginning and the end position of a single push-up.

, Keep your elbows close to your body for more resistance. Keep your head facing forward. Try to have the tip of your nose pointed directly ahead. Draw a breath as you lower yourself.

, Breathe out as you push. The power for that push will inevitably come from your shoulders and chest. The triceps (the muscle on the back side of your upper arm) are also contracted but the primary exercise for the triceps isn't the push-up. Continue the push until your arms are almost in a straight position (but not locked).

,, Proper stretching and cool down routines are just as important as the warm up, but, unfortunately, are quite often overlooked.

Uphill cardio, such as cycling uphill or hiking, are great ways to increase your lower body strength.


Running for long periods of time can give you slender legs. This does not mean you have to avoid cardio, however. Try running uphill, and do not run more than three hours a week.;
, When you go about your ordinary day, your leg muscles get a workout carrying you everywhere you go. They’re already used to being worked out all the time, so in order to encourage muscle growth you need to do high-intensity workouts that focus on the legs. During each workout, do two to three sets of eight to twelve reps. Use as much weight as you can while still being able to keep correct posture so that you feel the “burn.”


Add more weight after the first few weeks of exercising to increase the intensity.
Don’t overdo it; make sure you know the difference between pain and injury. Work with a trainer if you haven’t spent time lifting weights before.

, You might have been taught before that you should move through weightlifting exercises slowly. However, making explosive movements builds different muscle fibers than slower movements do. These fibers may not be as developed as other muscles in your legs.

, If you work out all of your leg muscles every day, they won’t have a chance to recover and grow larger. You also stand the chance of hurting yourself. Instead, focus on one group of muscles one day, then rotate to another the next day. The resting period is an important part of getting bigger legs.

, This doesn’t mean you should start gorging yourself at every meal; rather, make sure you’re getting plenty of calories from healthy food sources. When you’re working on building muscles you need a lot of calories to sustain yourself. Eat plenty of the following foods to keep your muscles growing:


Good foods to have in your diet include lean meat, tofu, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruits, and more vegetables and fruits.
Limit your intake of processed foods, sugar and white flour, fast food, and snack foods. These will leave you feeling tired instead of energetic and ready to work out.

, You need protein to build bigger muscles, so make sure you’re taking it in at every meal. Eat beef, pork, chicken, fish, and other lean meat sources. Eat tofu, beans, quinoa, barley, and eggs if you’re not a carnivore.

, Some people find that taking certain supplements can give their muscles an extra boost. Supplements should be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and plenty of water intake.


Creatine is a substance naturally produced by the body to aid muscle growth. It is considered to be safe to use in doses of 5 grams (0.18 oz) per day over a certain period of time.
Consult your doctor before taking any supplements.

, If skinny thighs are your problem, this exercise is for you. Doing squats is a good way to pump up your thighs, and adding dumbbells (or a barbell, if you’re down with that) makes the exercise even more effective. Start with dumbbells you can lift 10 times without needing to put them down. For beginners, 10-20 pounds is a good starting weight. Bodybuilders should lift more weight for bigger legs. Now squat using the following form:


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands grasping the dumbbells at your sides (If you’re using a barbell, hold it behind your head or at your chest).
Bend your knees and lower your butt towards the floor in a squatting position.
Keep your back straight and keep squatting down until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Your knees should always remain straight above your feet; do not let the knees go forward past the toes.
Push back up to your starting position.
Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 squats.

, This exercise works your glutes, quadriceps and hamstrings, giving you a full-leg muscle workout. You can do it without weights, but when you’re trying to build bigger muscles it’s important to step up the intensity.


Stand with your feet shoulder-length apart, and hold your dumbbells at your sides. If you want, you can hold them at your shoulders instead.
Take a big step forward with one foot, dropping your opposite knee toward the floor. So if you’re stepping with your right foot, drop your left knee toward the ground.
Keep your torso vertical to the ground with your knees aligned over your feet. Do not move the knee beyond your toes.
Rise back to starting position and immediately step forward with the opposite foot.
Aim to do three sets of fifteen reps. Once you have mastered this exercise, you might try increasing this to four or five sets of ten to twelve reps with heavier weights.

, This one works your calves, and you can do it with minimal equipment. You’ll need a sturdy box or exercise step that won’t slip when you jump on it. The taller the box, the more difficult the exercise will be. Don’t use dumbbells when you’re doing this exercise, since you might need your hands to catch you if you trip.


Stand in front of the box with your toes pointed toward it.
Jump explosively upward and land on the balls of your feet on the box.
Jump back down to starting position.
Work your way up until you are able to do three sets of fifteen. Eventually, you may be able to do four or five sets of ten to twelve reps.

, This one works out your hamstrings, putting you on the path to bigger, sculpted legs. Load a barbell with the amount of weight you can lift for 10 reps without stopping to rest. If you don’t have a barbell, you can use two dumbbells.


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place the barbell or dumbbells in front of you.
To pick up the barbell or dumbbells, bend your knees while keeping your back straight. Engage your abdominal muscles.
Once you have picked up the weights, stand while hinging your hips forward. Your back must be straight and your abs contracted as you stand. Once you have risen, the weights should be at thigh-height.
Bend again to lower the weight back to the floor.
Repeat 10-12 times for a total of 3 sets.

, If you’re serious about getting bigger legs, you might want to join a gym and start using the wide array of exercise machines available. Using exercise machines allows you to gradually add more weight, increasing the intensity of your workouts and promoting muscle growth. For each exercise, start with the amount of weight you can lift with your legs 8-10 times before you need to stop. Work with a trainer to determine the right weight for you. Here are a few exercises you can do at the gym:


Leg extensions. Find the leg extension machine. Start with a lighter weight than you would normally handle. Sit on the machine with your knees bent and your feet under the lower bar. To lift the weight, straighten your legs, but keep a slight bend in the knee. Hold until you feel the burn. Bend your knees to lower the weight back to starting position. Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.
Standing leg curls. Find the leg curl machine, which allows you to lift weights by attaching a cable to your ankles. Load the machine with the amount of weight you can lift for about 10 reps before you need to stop. Attach the cable to your ankle and hold the support bar with your hands. Bend your knee toward your butt to lift the weight, then straighten it back to starting position. Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets. Repeat with the other leg.

, This the quickest way to add a little bulk to your leg line. Choose pants that are tailored well but hang a little loose around your legs. There are plenty of styles to choose from that make your legs look strong without making you look like you’re drowning in fabric.


Boot-cut pants are another good choice. They hug the thighs and flare at the knee, making the legs look a little bigger.
Don’t wear skinny jeans. They’re made to make your legs look tiny, so pass them up if you want your legs to look bigger.

, Shorts, on the other hand, should be tailored and close-fitting if you want your legs to look bigger. Baggy shorts emphasize the small circumference of your legs.

, This look is always in style and it can add several inches to your legs. Choose boots that rise midway up your calves and wear a pair of boot-cut jeans over them.

, Look for bottoms that have wide horizontal stripes or bold patterns, as these can make your legs look bigger. Pastel colors--such as lavender, mint, powder blue, or light pink-- can also help."

In fact, you won't build muscle unless you take in plenty of calories to feed muscle growth in your legs. This doesn't mean you should go wild and eat everything you want, but when your aim is to get bigger legs, getting more calories is essential. Eating 3 regular meals plus snacks filled with high quality foods will also help you gain some healthy weight, adding shape and definition to your legs. Fill up on the following healthy foods:


Eat a lot of protein. Protein is essential to building healthy muscles, so you need to be taking it in at every meal. You can eat lean beef, pork, poultry, fish, seafood and lamb, or if you’re a vegetarian, tofu, beans, and eggs.
Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and nuts are also essential. These should be the mainstay of your diet.
Avoid empty calories like processed sugars and flours, fast food, cakes, cookies, chips, and other snack foods that will make you feel run down instead of energized.

Try supplements. Some people find that they can accelerate the process of muscle growth by taking supplements like creatine, a powder that supplements the body with a naturally-occurring acid that builds muscle. Creatine is considered to be safe in doses of 5 grams per day.;
, When your aim is to get bigger legs, running, power walking, and swimming aren’t going to do you many favors. These exercises use your energy stores to keep you moving for a long period of time. That means that you’ll have less left over to focus on high-intensity muscle building.Try substituting cardio exercises that can help build leg muscle like uphill cycling or hiking up hills.

, Weight training exercises focus your body's energy on the particular muscle you're working out, breaking down the fibers so they can build back up bigger and stronger. Doing weight training exercises focused on the legs will lead to the shapely legs you desire.

, Your leg muscles are used to carrying your body (and whatever else you’re holding) up and down stairs and everywhere else you go throughout the day. To make these muscles grow, you need to focus on doing workouts more intense than those you might design for parts of your body that don’t get as much exercise. That means every workout you do should get your heart rate up and cause the muscles in your legs to “burn,” so to speak. You need to break down the fibers and have them build back up stronger and bigger.


For each exercise, lift as much weight as you can lift using the correct form for 10 reps. If you can lift the weight easily for 15 reps, it’s too light. If you can’t lift it more than a few times without needing to stop, it’s too heavy.
Add more weight after a few weeks to keep up the intensity.
Use explosive bursts of energy, rather than slowly going through the motions. Exercising explosively builds the muscle fibers of the legs. Be slow on the eccentric motion, then explosive on the contraction.

, Don’t work out the same group of muscles day in and day out. If you’re focusing on your calves one day, do an intense workout on your quads the next. This way your muscles get a chance to rest and get stronger in between workouts. It also keeps you from plateauing by keeping your muscles in a state of ""shock,” putting them through the process of breaking down and building back up every stronger.


If you do a hard workout that includes squats, box jumps, and leg curls one week, switch to stiff-legged deadlifts, lying leg curls and lunges the next week.
Adding weight is another way to keep from plateauing. Add more every two weeks or so.

, These hug the thighs but flare out at the knee, making the lower leg look larger and adding flattering shape to the leg line. You don’t have to go for bell bottoms, unless you like that look. Even a slight flair will change your silhouette and make your legs look a little bigger., These are designed to make your legs look like matchsticks, so you’ll want to stay away from them if your goal is to have bigger legs. If you absolutely must buy skinny pants or jeans, look for some with whiskering around the thigh and knee areas. Whiskering breaks the leg line and creates the illusion that your legs are bigger.

, Go for floral, striped, polka-dotted, or tye-dyed tights and pants - the more colors, the better. When you wear patterned fabrics on your legs, they leave more of a visual impression. Wearing dark, solid colors, on the other hand, can make your legs look thin and small.

, Boots that come up to the knee can completely change the way your lower legs look. Choose slouchy, thick boots instead of skin-tight boots. Wear them over jeans or tights to give your legs a fuller appearance.


Wearing boots over pants adds a little bulk to your legs. Try wearing knee-highs over a pair of jeans for a fashionable look.

, If you wear skirts and dresses that are loose and billowy, your legs will look smaller by contrast. Wearing skirts and dresses that are cut a bit closer won't make it look like your legs are being swallowed by fabric.

, Wearing hemlines that fall an inch or two above the knees will make your legs look less small. Wearing very short skirts and dresses draws attention to your legs, while wearing hemlines that fall below the knees can emphasize the contrast between your skinny legs and the fabric you're wearing.

, This is the single best exercise you can do to help fill out your thighs, since it engages the most muscle fibers in the area. If you're a beginner you can do squats without weights. For more advanced athletes, hold a barbell bearing weight you can lift for 10-12 reps. If you’d prefer not to use a barbell, you can use two dumbbells instead. Here's how to correctly do a squat:


Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Bend your knees and squat, lowering your bottom until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep your knees aligned right above your toes.
Hold the position for 10 seconds.
Push back up to starting position.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.

, Do sets of 10-15 reps for each leg. Start with one set and build up to 3 or 4 sets. Try holding dumbbells at your sides to add resistance and help build more muscle. These work your glutes, quadriceps and hamstrings, and over time they can help you build muscle to make your legs fill out.


Take a big step forward with one foot.
As you step, drop your back knee toward the floor.
Keep your torso perpendicular to the floor.
Rise into starting position and lunge with your other foot.

, This is another great exercise you can do with minimal equipment, and it’s great for getting bigger calves. Stand in front of an exercise box or step that you can easily jump upon. The taller the box, the more difficult it will be. Start with toes pointed toward the box. Jump explosively and land on the box with the balls of your feet. Jump back down to the floor. Repeat.


Be sure the box you use is heavy enough that it won’t slide when you land on it.
It’s not a good idea to use dumbbells when you do box jumps; you might need your hands to catch yourself if you trip.

, For this exercise you will need a leg extension machine, which is standard in any gym with a weight room. Start with weights that provide light resistance and go for the burn.


Sit on the leg extension machine with your knees bent and your feet under the lower bar.
Extend your leg, keeping a slight bend at your knee even at the peak of the motion, then lower it.
Repeat 10 - 12 times for 3 sets.

, This is another exercise that requires a machine to complete. You'll need to use a leg curl machine that allows you to lift weights by attaching a cable to your ankle. Load the machine with as much weight as you can lift for 10 reps, between 20 and 50 pounds (or more).


Attach the cable to your ankle with the harness and grab the support bar with your hands.
Bend your knee toward your behind as you lift, then straighten your knee again.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets, then switch to the other leg.4

, This exercise focuses on your hamstrings, essential for building more sculpted legs. You’ll need a barbell loaded with weight you can lift for 10 reps without needing to stop.


Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, and hinge forward at the hips. Bend the knees as much as you need to to pick up the weight, then straighten the legs until you have a slight bend at the knee. From there, tighten your abs and with a completely straight back, lift your torso back upright while contracting the muscles of your buttocks and the backs of your thighs. Grasp the barbell with your hands.
Keeping your legs straight, lift the barbell to your thighs, then lower it back to the floor.
Repeat for 3 sets of 10-12 reps.

Stand with your back flat against a wall.,
Bend your knees and slide down the wall until you are in a squat position.,
Continue to slide into your squat until you are in a comfortable position without feeling any excess strain on the knee joint.,
Repeat the test two more times and use the highest reading achieved.,
Make a note of the length of time you were able to hold the squat position.",How to Measure Lower Body Strength1," Keep your feet about a foot away from the wall and shoulder width apart.;
, Be sure to keep the small of your back pressed firmly against the wall with no arching. Pay careful attention to your knees to make sure they are aligned properly over your toes.

, Hold this position for a goal of one minute or until you can no longer maintain proper form.

, Allow yourself adequate rest periods between tests to avoid over-straining the legs and to allow them to recover.

,


If you held a squat with proper form for under 20 seconds, your legs are considered relatively weak.
Remaining in the squat position for 20 to 35 seconds means your leg strength is average.
If you held for 35 seconds or longer, your leg strength is strong.

Start with the basic plyometric exercises.,
Start kicking up the workout.,
Use medicine balls.,
Work on your legs with box squat jumps.,
Do box jumps.",How to Start a Plyometrics Training Program," Depth jump-vertical, these are performed with a box. Stand on the box then drop from the box, immediately after touching the ground jump up as high as you can and reach up with one or both hands. The return to box to repeat.;
, Clap-push-ups are performed on the floor with your body prone. Push your body away from the floor like you are doing a regular push-up but you must push-up explosively enough to push your upper body high enough that your elbows are locked and your hands are many inches from the floor. Then clap quickly, return hands to shoulder-width position and land. Clap-push-ups are basic plyometrics but you can't perform them, try to train up to be able to do at least 35 regular push-ups. If you cannot perform them even if you can do 35 push-ups then try push-ups with your feet on a box to increase strength further. If you still cannot perform clap-push-ups then you can do explosive push-ups without clapping.

, Medicine balls are also used in plyometric exercises. Sit-up throws are performed in sit-up position (sit on floor with knees bent)with a medicine ball above your head and either a partner or a wall and something to secure your feet. As you lay down you should have your arms somewhat at a 45 degree angle and as you sit-up the angle of your arms should straighten which allows your to throw the ball harder. This exercise has some coordination so try to not get hit in the face or hit your partner in the face. Try to use a light enough medicine ball to throw.

, Box Squat Jumps are performed (obviously) with a box. Sit on the box then jump up and then squat down till you land back onto the box.

, Box jumps are performed with a box. Stand in front of a box and jump onto it, then jump off it rapidly. Lateral box jumps are performed with the box to the side of you. Place one foot on the box and jump using that foot. You have to get enough height for your feet to pass the height of the box and more. Then land with the opposite foot on the opposite side of the box and the foot you started off with on the floor. You can also do both feet together.

Stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking at least 8 to 10 glasses of water.",How to Get Thicker Thighs," Muscle growth happens when you exert your muscles so that the tiny fibers get broken down, giving them the chance to come back bigger and stronger. When you do exercises your muscles are already used to handling, this process doesn’t happen. Only when you push yourself to go all in – exercising until you feel that burn – do your muscles respond by getting bigger. You can start seeing improved growth right away by taking a more intense approach to your workouts.









Make sure you’re using enough weight to actually challenge your muscles. If you’re a beginner, you might do thigh-building exercises without any weights. If you find these to be easy, use dumbbells or a barbell loaded with enough weight that you have to stop after about 10 reps.
It’s important to recognize the difference between pushing yourself to the limit and pushing yourself to injury. If you are a beginner when it comes to strength training, it’s a good idea to work with a trainer to learn more about your personal limits.;
, Exercising “explosively” – using fast bursts of motion instead of slow, steady motions – has been shown to increase muscle growth.Keep this in mind when you’re completing your thigh exercises. Try incorporating a lot of jumping exercises, sumo squats, and skater lunges into your workout to get those explosive muscle fibers involved.








, Any given exercise isn’t going to lead to the results you want if you’re not doing it the right way. Work with a certified personal trainer to determine the right way to do thigh exercises. When you exercise, keep in mind that you should feel the burn primarily in your thighs. If you’re feeling it elsewhere, your form is probably slightly off.









Using the right form is also an important way to stay safe while exercising. If you do an exercise wrong over and over you could injure your muscles or joints.
You also want to make sure you aren’t using so much weight that it’s affecting your form. If your dumbbells are so heavy that you can’t fully complete an exercise, you need to be using less weight.

, As the weeks go by, your muscles will grow and soon become accustomed to the amount of weight you’re bearing. In order to make them continue to get bigger, you’ll need to increase the weight every few weeks. Do 10 reps with a few different weights. Stick with the weight that allows you to do all 10 reps without stopping, but makes you struggle some to complete the last one.

, If you focus on thigh exercises one day, work out your back, chest and arms the next day, then go back to thighs. The recovery period is just as important to muscle growth as the breaking down period.








, Mountain biking, hill cycling, uphill hiking, and sports that involve jumping, kicking or explosive running are all great for thigh muscle development. Avoid jogging for more than 3-4 hours per week because too much long distance running may burn down muscle bulk in the thighs.


If you suspect that cardio is preventing bulky muscle growth, don’t spend more than 20 minutes on cardio exercises three times a week.If making this change doesn’t make a difference, return to more frequent cardio to keep your heart and lungs strong.

, This is the quintessential thigh-building exercise, since it works out your hamstrings in the back and your quadriceps in the front. If it's not already part of your regimen, change that right now. You can do squats without weights or make them more challenging by holding dumbbells or a barbell.









Stand upright with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Have your toes pointing forward. Do not lock your knees.
If you're using weights, hold them with both hands in front of you at rib level. Place your weight from your stance in your heels, not the balls of your feet.
Bend your knees and push your bottom back and down, as if you were sitting in a chair, until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then slowly rise back up into standing form. Make sure your knees stay aligned above your ankles and never extend out past your toes.
Repeat this process 6-10 times in a row, take a break, and do it again, 2-4 more times. Do this exercise 2-3 times a week to build thicker, stronger thighs.

, This is another classic thigh exercise that can be done with two dumbbells to up the ante. Lunges help your calves get bigger, too. Use this form when doing lunges:









Stand with your weights at your sides.
Take a big step forward with one foot.
While you're stepping, bend the knee of the other leg so that it almost touches the ground.
Rise back to starting position, then repeat the exercise by stepping with the other foot first.
Repeat this process 6-10 times in a row, take a break, and do it again, 2-4 more times. Do this exercise 2-3 times a week to build thicker, stronger thighs.

, This exercise works out your hamstrings. To do it, you'll need two dumbbells, a weighted ball, or a barbell loaded with the amount of weight you can lift 10 times before needing to stop.









Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. The weight equipment you're using should be sitting in front of you.
Hinge forward from the hips, keeping your abs tight and your back straight. Bend your knees enough to reach the weights, then straighten your legs so that you only have a slight bend in your knees.
Straighten your back and lift the weights at the same time.
Bend again to place the weights back on the floor.
Repeat 10 times, then rest and do two more sets.

, You'll need a machine to do this exercise, but the results may be worth joining a gym for. Leg press machines allow you to adjust the amount of weight you use, so you can increase it as your thigh muscles get stronger.









Sit back on the leg press machine and place your feet against the footpads. Your knees should be bent. You can grip the hand grips for stability.
Push the footpads with your feet. Pushing on the machine causes the weights to lift. You should be able to feel it in your thighs.
Lower the weights back to the starting position by bending your knees.
Repeat 6-10 times, then rest and do 2-4 more sets.

, Building muscle takes the right kind of fuel. You may need to eat more than your standard three meals a day in order to see results.Consider whether you want to gain weight or just redistribute your current weight. Gaining requires consuming more calories. Some bodybuilders suggest eating 5 meals a day, with each meal including bigger portions than normal. It may not feel comfortable, but if you want bigger muscles, they need to be fed.


Eat before and after workouts. This will ensure your muscles are never low on fuel.Eat healthy carbohydrates before working out. Quinoa, brown rice, and whole grains are good sources of carbohydrates., Eating more doesn’t mean eating unhealthy food. Get your calories from healthy, whole, natural foods that aren’t loaded with salt, sugar and preservatives.


Try to eat home cooking as often as possible. Don’t rely on protein bars and power drinks to get your fuel. Eating real food is a lot healthier for your muscles.
Stay away from fast food, salty snack foods, and desserts – these will only leave you feeling fatigued, and it’ll be harder to get your workouts in.

, Protein is the building block of muscles, and it should be at the center of all of your meals when you’re concentrating on muscle growth. In addition to whole grains, legumes, and lots of fruits and vegetables, eat meat, fish, eggs, and dairy to get your daily protein.


Try to buy meat that is farm-raised and hormone free. If you’re loading up on meat, you don’t want to be loading up on hormones and chemicals at the same time.
If you prefer not to eat meat, try tofu, beans, and leafy greens that contain protein such as spinach and kale.

, Expensive protein powders probably aren’t worth the money. Do research to find out which supplements might be right for you.


Creatine is a muscle-building supplement that is considered safe when you take the recommended dosage.It’s important that you don’t rely on supplements to get bigger thighs if you aren’t putting in the work to exercise and eat right. Supplements can help you stay on track, but there are no miracle pills that will make your legs get bigger.

, This will help your body process protein and keep you healthy and active. Drinking plenty of water also gives you the energy to build thick muscles easier."

, Once you have warmed up a little bit by walking, you might want to transition to jogging. This may also be substituted by 10-15 minutes of skipping a jump rope.

, These are called butt kicks or kick backs . Do at least 50 times per leg. It may seem a lot but it's not as much as you think!

, This is called high-knee marching. Do two or three laps around a tennis court, running track, or around the block in your neighborhood.,, Cycling around is a great way to burn fat and substitute it with muscle mass. By some estimates, if you weigh 130 lb (59 kg), you can burn anywhere from 325 to 550 calories per hour, depending on your speed.This makes cycling a great way to lose weight. There are several ways to use a bike to get skinnier legs:


Biking around casually. Bike to the grocery store instead of driving. Bike to work instead of taking public transportation. If you bike casually, going about 11 mph (17.6 km/h), you can burn 275-450 calories per hour, depending on your weight.Use a stationary bike at home or at the gym. Because this is a lighter exercise, expect to burn anywhere from 250-450 calories per hour, depending on your weight.Do a spinning class. Spinning classes are butt-kicking but definitely worth it. The advantage here is that you burn a lot of calories: a 145 lb (65.8 kg) person might expect to burn about 750-1000 calories per hour of very vigorous spinning. On the other hand, spinning can be quite monotonous and you'll have to push yourself for maximum results.

, Leg rolls are easy, effective, and can be done in the comfort of your own home. These are not as effective as high calorie-burning exercise like spinning, but it's much better than nothing.


Lie on your right side and place your left arm on the floor in front of you for support and balance. With your left leg, raise it to your hip level. Pretend your leg is in a barrel and with your toes, lead the rest of your leg to trace the inside of the barrel. Your leg will go up, down, and around in circles. Do 50-100 circles, switch legs, and do the same number on the other side.

, Squats are very versatile. You can do a bunch of different kinds of squats, all with the same basic principle, and get different results. With squats, proper technique is important.


Do standard squats:

With your legs shoulder-width apart, slowly bring your butt down, bending your knees and keeping your arms outstretched in front of you.
Arch your back slightly but keep your torso erect.
Bring your butt down as far as you can, keeping the tension on the leg muscles. Make sure that your knees are aligned with your feet. Never let your knees go past your toes.
Exhale deeply and use your legs and hips, not your back, to lift out of the squat. Do three sets of 20 repetitions each.


Do split squats with a dumbbell or other weight:

Using both hands, hold out a weight.
Standing in front of a bench, lift your right leg back so that it is resting comfortably on the bench. Your supported leg should form a 90° angle.
Bend into a squat by lowering the left leg, so that the right knee almost hits the floor.
Explode upward. Do this 8 times, 3-4 sets each. Repeat using opposite leg.


Do jump squats

Go all the way down into a standard squat.
Instead of returning to starting position, jump into the air as high as possible, landing with both feet on the ground.
Repeat carefully, 15 times, 3-4 sets each. These squats can be more strenuous on the knees.



, There's a host of great exercises that you can do to help burn fat and build muscle. These exercises should be done two or three times a week for the best results. Here are just a few of them:



Lunges. With a 5 or 8-lb (2 or 4 kg) dumbbell in each hand, lunge forward with one leg and bring the opposite knee about an inch above the ground. Step back and continue with the opposite leg. Do eight to twelve repetitions on each leg.






Inner-thigh press. Lay down on a mat with your knees bent and the soles of your feet on the ground. Put a medium rubber ball (or a knotted beach towel) between your legs and squeeze for 30 seconds. Let go and repeat two to five times.






Hip extensions. Kneel on a mat with your elbows bent down on the floor. Lift your leg up and extend it fully behind your body. Bend your lifted leg and draw it in so that it lightly taps the back of your right knee. Extend the left leg out again. Repeat with other leg 10 to 20 times.

, Do some laps using the freestyle motion. Learn how to do a flip turn so that you won't have to stop when you get to the end of the lap. Swimming is an excellent way to burn calories and build up leg muscle, as well as a great cardiovascular exercise. Burn about 440-480 calories doing a moderate freestyle workout for an hour.Different strokes for different folks. Different strokes burn different amounts of calories. For most people, butterfly stroke burns the most calories, while backstroke burns the least.Keep in mind that the number of calories you burn in an hour will depend on your age, muscle tone, fitness level, weight, intensity of the workout, and other factors.

, The elliptical is that funny looking, stationary machine that you can run or jog on; it has arm supports that move when you walk/jog. A 140 lb (64 kg) individual doing a moderate intensity workout on the elliptical trainer can expect to burn roughly 300 to 600 calories in an hour.


If your goal is to slim down by losing fat in your legs instead of building muscle, then aim to keep your heart rate high while you're on the elliptical. You can also try interval training.

, Zumba is dance fitness program created by a Colombian dancer and choreographer. The average 140 lb (64 kg) individual can expect to burn about 450 calories after an hour-long Zumba workout.A dancer can expect to probably burn a little less than that, depending on the workout intensity — about 275.

, The gym is a good opportunity to band together with other like-minded, similarly-motivated people who are looking to have fun and burn weight. In order of most calories burned, the following sports are good for exercise:


Playing full-court basketball can burn up to 700 calories in an hour for a 140 lb/64 kg person, provided that they are moving the entire game.
Playing competitive soccer may be able to burn up to 650 calories in an hour if you are running and actively participating for the entire game.

Rollerskating can burn roughly 525 calories an hour while ice-hockey can burn around 450., It may sound boring, but the treadmill can be effective if that's the only exercise you choose to do. Walking on the treadmill at 4 mph (6.6 km/h), for a 140 lb (64 kg) individual, will burn about 175 calories.Running on a treadmill at 6 mph (10 km/h), for a 140 lb (64 kg) individual, will burn about 540 calories., To lose weight, you will need to burn more calories than you eat each day. To lose one pound of weight, you must burn 3,500 more calories than you take in as food. To make sure you that you are doing this, keep track of the calories that you eat as well as how much you exercise. You can use a diary or an online fitness tracker.


It is safe and realistic to lose one pound a week. Break this up into daily goals. For example, you might decide to cut 500 calories a day or set daily cardio goals to burn more calories.

, Protein is vital for building and maintaining muscle mass. Sources of lean protein include fish, chicken, tofu, and turkey.


Stay away from simple carbohydrates found in processed or refined products.These include:

Candy
Sugary, carbonated beverages, such as colas
Syrups
Sugars


Complex carbohydrates are acceptable to eat, although they should at most make up 60% of your total caloric intake.Complex carbs include:

Legumes
Starchy vegetables
Whole-grain breads and cereals



, Fruits and veggies provide you with dietary fiber, which can help reduce the amount of fat that your body stores. They also contain essential vitamins and minerals, and give your body a break from an otherwise monotonous diet.

, Many doctors recommend that males get 10-12 cups of water per day, which works out to 2.5–2.9 liters (0.7–0.8 US gal), while females are recommended to drink 8-10 cups per day, about 2.0–2.4 liters (0.5–0.6 US gal).Water will help your immune system stay healthy, keep your skin looking great, and give you more lasting energy to do the things you need to do during the day.


You probably already know this, but sodas, juices, and other sugary drinks aren't the way to go if you want to shed pounds off of your legs. Sugars, as mentioned above, are simple carbohydrates, an excess of which will lead to more calories. Reach for a glass of water instead! You'll see the difference.
(Unsweetened) green tea is another good substitute for sugary drinks. Green tea contains a good amount of antioxidants, meaning that it helps your body fight against free radicals, which enhance signs of aging in humans.If you are trying to eat less, drink of cup of green tea before a meal. You'll notice that you feel more full and won't need to eat as much.



, Common sense tells us that if we want to lose flab, we better cut out fats. Right? Not always. Getting the right kinds of fats into your diet gives us energy and helps us absorb vitamins, while getting the wrong kinds of fats will make it harder for us to shed those extra pounds.


Eat healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 is needed to regulate clotting, build up cell membranes and support cell health. Food high in omega-3 fatty acids include:Fish, notably salmon
Nuts and seeds, notably flaxseed
Leafy greens, notably kale and spinach


Avoid saturated fats such as butter, solid shortening, lard and fatback.Avoid trans fats, which are found in vegetable shortenings, margarine, cookies, snack foods and other foods containing or fried in partially hydrogenated oils., Make the most of your day by eating often, but little. Try eating five meals a day, with a couple meals being small snacks (sauteed vegetables or nuts make a great snack) in between.


Try eating more in the morning than at night. Ever heard the phrase ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper?"" That's because your metabolism starts slowing down during the nighttime as it prepares for bedtime, making late meals prime candidates for being stored as fat instead of burned as calories.Drinking water before meals can result in consuming less calories at those meals, which can ultimately lead to weight loss. Water makes you feel fuller, so you do not need to eat as much food to reach the point of satiety.

, The body converts fat into energy when it's exercising or low on food. Unfortunately, the body converts fat from wherever it wants, and not always where you want it to. It highly depends on your body type. Some people are bottom heavy, whereas other people can be top heavy.


Spot-training, or working one area of your body at a time, may help tone your legs but it will not slim them down. You will need to reduce your overall body weight.

, A lot of people who want to lose weight make this mistake. Their reasoning is that calories get stored as fat when the body doesn't use them; calories come from food; if they starve themselves, they'll get fewer calories; if they get fewer calories, there will be less fat to store. This is a misconception.


What happens when a person starves him/herself? The body realizes it is getting less food, your metabolism slows down to save energy, and you start consuming lean tissue instead of fat reserves because the body wants to prepare itself for a while without food.
If you do manage to lose weight by starving yourself (you did it the hard, painful way!) your body will gain all the fat back as soon as you begin eating again, and you should eat again. Why is this? Because your metabolism is still hibernating, and it needs to be kick started. How do you kickstart it? By eating the right types of foods in the first place.

, It can take three or four months before you start noticing results. Many people with really good intentions and strong discipline quit just before they start to see results. They work like crazy for a month, don't see any results, and throw their hands up in the air in despair. Keep at it!

, Most people who want skinny legs would like to be a bit skinnier all over. But some people who want skinny legs are perfectly skinny in their abs and arms — just not in their legs.


Exercise your full body, not just your legs. If your legs are abnormally muscled, that's a sign that you're working them a little too hard at the expense of the other muscles in your body.
Genetics can affect the size of your legs. Some people might store more fat in their legs than others. You can still be fit and have great legs even if they are not as slender as you might want them to be. Accept who you are and embrace it.

Stand in front of a chair with your back facing it and your feet shoulder width apart.

,
With your hands on your hips, squat down as if you are going to sit in the chair.

,
Lightly touch the chair and then return to a standing position again.,
Make a note of the number of squats you were able to do.",How to Measure Lower Body Strength2,",,


Repeat the squats squats until you are fatigued and can no longer do them with proper form.

,


If you did less than 10 squats, your legs are relatively weak.
If you performed 10 to 20 squats, your leg strength is average.
Your legs are strong if you are able to do 20 to 30 squats.
If you were able to perform over 30 squats, your legs are in excellent shape.
Recording how many squats you are able to complete will help you to determine how much your lower body strength has increased after working them out. Repeat this test periodically.

Determine your standing reach height.,
Stand approximately 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from the wall.,
Measure the distance between the standing reach height and the maximum jump height based on the distance between the 2 points.",How to Measure Lower Body Strength3," Stand with the side of your body facing the wall. Use the hand closest to the wall to reach up as high as you are able to and make note of the height.

, Using both arms and legs to help in projecting the body upward, jump as high as you are able to and touch the wall at the top of the jump. Note the spot where you touched the wall at the maximum height.

,


A distance under 8 inches (20.3 cm) signals poor leg strength.
If the distance ranges between 8 to 20 inches (20.3 to 50.8 cm), your leg strength is average.
Anything over 20 inches (50.8 cm) means your leg strength is strong.

Try squats.,
Do deadlifts.,
Include calf raises in your workout.,
Strengthen your stabilizer muscles using exercise bands.,
Use isolation movements to add tone.","How to Get Big, Masculine Legs1"," Squats are an excellent way to strengthen your quad muscles. Place your feet shoulder-width apart and then lower your pelvis so that your knees are bent. For proper technique your knees should never go past your toes while you are squatting.You can squat using just your body weight or add additional weights.
You can hold free weights in either hand at your side, or use a barbell with extra weight added.
If you are using a barbell, hold the bar across your shoulders and keep your back straight.;
, Deadlifts are one of the best ways to strengthen your hamstrings (back of your thigh) and glutes (butt muscles). To perform a deadlift, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell with your desired weight in front of you with your arms at your side.Then, slowly lower your arms so that the bar is midway down your calf. While you lower the bar make sure that your back remains straight.
Once the bar reaches the mid-calf range pull the bar back up to the rest position using your hips and legs.

, Stand on a slightly raised surface, such as a step or ledge. Place the balls of your feet on the ledge and let your heel hang off the back. Then, lift your body up onto your toes and hold this position for two to three seconds. Next, lower yourself back down slowly taking another two to three seconds.This exercise will strengthen your calves and will lead to muscle growth.
You can perform calf raises using just your body weight, or you can hold free weights for a more intense workout.

, The adductors (inner thigh) and abductors (outer thigh) are stabilizer muscles in the hips. When strengthened they can prevent injury and help with movement in the hips and pelvis. In order to strengthen these muscles, place exercise bands around your ankles, or below or above your knees.

Then, try lifting one leg to the side while the other one remains planted. Repeat with both legs.
Alternatively, you could bend your legs slightly into a squat position and then take small side-steps in one direction. Repeat the exercise while moving in the opposite direction.

, Most of your leg training should rely on free-weights, but you can use the leg curl and leg extension machines to help tone your leg muscles. Do not use too much weight because this could cause muscular imbalance or even petellar tendonitis. Instead, use a low to moderate resistance with high repetition. This will help to give your hamstrings and quads nice definition."

, Patients are advised to have adequate periods of rest to promote the body’s natural process of healing. The more you stay off your leg, the better it will feel and the quicker it will heal.


The only movements you should consider doing, at least initially, are exercises that have been approved by your doctor or physical therapist.
Using crutches or canes are helpful to act as a support, take pressure off your knee and promote healing.

, Stability of the injured area must be maintained to prevent additional damage to the area and its surrounding tissues. This can be done by putting a splint and bandages around the affected area.


Again, talk to your doctor about your options. He or she may recommend something so simple as KT tape or suggest a veritable splint or brace.During this time, you can address your future exercise plan, too.

, A cold compress can be placed over the injured area to promote the constriction of blood vessels; this reduces the risk of bleeding and swelling. It is especially helpful in the first hours of the initial injury.


It's advised to use ice packs 20 to 30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days or until the pain is gone.Use a cold pack or an ice covered with towel for your cold compress.
Compression also aids in stimulating the flow of lymph fluid, which carries important nutrients to the damaged tissues surrounding the injury. Lymph fluid also removes waste from cells and body tissues which is an important function during the tissue regeneration process., The injured area should be kept elevated at all times. This action aids in proper blood circulation that makes healing faster. With reduced blood flow, there will be less swelling, which allows your knee to resume functioning more quickly.Both sitting and laying down are acceptable; just make sure if you're sitting, that your knee is above your pelvis. A few pillows beneath your knee should do the trick.

, During consultations, doctors generally address first the most transparent symptoms: pain and inflammation. Prescription drugs are given to ease the sensation of pain and lessen the degree of inflammation, but you can also find suitable medication over-the-counter.


Painkillers may be classified as simple painkillers – commonly over the counter like Paracetamol – and stronger painkillers, which are only prescribed if simple painkillers do not reach the desired effect. Examples of prescription painkillers are codeine and tramadol.
Stronger types of painkillers must be taken in its proper dosage and properly administered to avoid addiction and dependence.

, This is an oral ""Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID). It's a type of drug that acts upon certain body chemicals to prevent the progress of inflammation during injuries. Examples of this medicine are Ibuprofen, Aspirin and Naproxen. Stronger NSAIDs are available through prescription.


Health practitioners, however, do not encourage intake of this drug for the first 48 hours of injury to let the body follow its natural course of healing., This is specific exercises done with a physical therapist that can help strengthen the knees and also involves things that can temporarily support your knee activities.


Individuals suffering from the condition are encouraged to try certain exercises that may help in strengthening the patella and keeping its normal function. These exercises can be utilized to divert sensations of pain and regulate proper circulation of blood to different parts of the body including the affected parts. The specific exercises will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

, A surgical procedure is recommended by doctors if other non-invasive measures fail. It is performed by specialists to link and restore the harmed tissues of the patella (kneecap) and recuperate its optimal purpose.


Arthroscopic surgery is performed using an arthroscope, a device that makes small incisions in the knee joints and contains a camera to view the inside of the knee to be repaired. This surgery uses small shavers or scissors to remove the tissues causing damage in the knee.

, You may not be able to fully stretch your legs because of the pain from your runner's knee. This exercise will support and help you stretch your legs. here's how it's done:


Using a rolled towel, place it on your heel to elevate it on the floor and let gravity strengthen your knee. You may feel discomfort, but try to relax your legs.
Hold the position for 2 minutes and repeat 3 times in one session. Do this several times a day.

, This strengthening knee exercise maybe painful so you should do it carefully and with guidance. Here's how to execute this exercise:


Sit on the floor with your legs stretch in front of you. Slowly slide the heel of the affected leg towards the side of your buttock and your knees reaching your chest.
After this process, go back to your original position. Do 2 sets of 15 in each session.

, Stand facing the wall with your hands on the wall at about eye level. Place your injured leg behind you with your heel on the floor and the other leg in front of you with your knees bent. Turn your back foot slightly inward; it should look like a pidgeon-toe. To feel the stretch:


Slowly lean on the wall. You are in the right position if you feel a stretch in the calf of your legs.
Hold the position for 15 – 30 seconds and the go back to your original position.
Repeat 3 times in 1 session. You can repeat it several times a day.

, First, find a doorway to perform this exercise. This is a great one as the doorway provides you stability and takes pressure off your arms and legs. Here's how to do it:


Lie on the floor on your back and with your uninjured leg stretch out through the doorway.
Raise your injured leg on the wall next to the door frame.
Keep your legs stretched. You have achieved the right position if you feel the stretch at the back of your thigh.
Hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 times in that session.

, Lie on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Bend your uninjured leg while keeping your heel flat on the floor. Tighten the leg muscle of your injured leg and raise it about 8 inches (20.3 cm) above the floor.


Keep your legs straight and thigh muscles contracted and then slowly go back to your original position. Do 2 sets of 15 in each session.

, Two types of squats are appropriate for runner's knee: the prisoner squat and the Bulgarian split squat. Here's how they're done:


For the prisoner squat:






Assume a standing position with your feet apart.
Place your fingers on the back of your head and stick out your chest.
Slowly move your body downward as far as possible while the knees are bent and the hips are pushed backward.
Hold the position and gradually return to the starting position.


For the Bulgarian split squat:






Position your left foot in front of the right foot about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart.
Lift the instep of the right foot on a chair or any support.
Then, pull the shoulders backward and your chest up.
Slowly lower the body as far as possible and maintain position.
Stop and return to your initial pose.



, This condition can be caused by several factors such as the following:Overuse. Too much bending of the knee can traumatize nerve endings of the kneecap. Over extension of the tissues connecting the muscles into the bones (tendons) can also strike the attack of runner’s knee.







A fall or blow. A forceful disturbance of the knee can irritate the surrounding tissue and can trigger the condition.







Misalignment. There are instances where certain parts of the body are not in their proper position or alignment, often due to trauma or injury. These circumstances post a greater stress to the associated area since weight is not equally dispersed. It can therefore be the basis of aches and damages to specific joints.







Foot problems. A condition known as flat feet causes the arches of the foot to crumple, thus extending the muscles and tendons of the leg. This may impact the progress of runner’s knee.

Fragile thigh muscles. Weakness or imbalances in these muscles can put too much weight in the knees that can be unbearable and may lead to the development of the ailment.

, Specific types of people are more prone to runner's knee. Here's who needs to look out for this ailment:Physical activity. Activities such as running and jumping or activities that require repeated knee bending can cause overuse of the knee. This can irritate nerves in our knees and can affect tendons, causing pain. Before doing vigorous physical activity, make sure you have properly warmed up and stretched to avoid injury.







Gender. Women are more at risk than men of having runner’s knee because their bone structure is different from men. They have wider hips, which can contribute to this condition.







Misalignment of the bones. Bones are part of our body’s balance. They need to be properly aligned in order for weight to be properly distributed.

Constant overuse of the knee. This can cause repetitive stress that wears away at the knee. Knees are, unfortunately, part of most activities that we do.

Foot problems. Flat-footedness is a condition of the feet where, literally speaking, the soles of the feet appear to be flat when stepping on the floor. This condition is common in infants and toddlers. With its impact regarding runner’s knee, as you make your step, it can stretch your muscles and tendons that are connected to the knee.

, Individuals affected by this condition may experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms:Pain. A sensation of pain may be due to damage of the cartilage under the patellar region. The pain is sharp and pulsating and usually felt behind or around the kneecap where the thighbone and kneecap meet. It flares up when squatting, running, walking and even while sitting. The level of pain will worsen if activities are not limited.







Swelling. Any trauma or irritation can cause inflammation to the knee and its adjacent tissues as this is the body’s compensatory mechanism to injury. The body’s immune system will release inflammatory chemicals in order to remove harmful stimuli, including damaged cells, irritants, or pathogens and begin the healing process.A popping or grinding sensation. If muscles are not properly conditioned prior to activity, it can stress the knee causing it to tremble or quiver. It can also tighten the muscles that can produce popping sensations, especially during sudden movements of the knee.

Avoid exercises that build too much resistance against your calves.",How to Make Calves Smaller1," If you have extra fat to burn, sixty minutes of moderate to high intensity cardio two to three times a week can help you slim down without necessarily building muscle in your calves. Here are some great exercises to do:









Taking long walks on flat roads
Endurance running in a flat area
Swimming
Biking on flat surfaces or on an exercise bike without a high-resistance setting
Using the elliptical;
, If your problem is that your calves lack definition, weight training can help you slim down over all. Muscle burns more calories than fat. Doing weight training with small weights may be able to help you build muscle and lose weight without becoming bulky. If you have already toned calves, then building muscle may not be your goal.








, Use your body weight as resistance. Stand with your feet hip distance apart, put your hands on your hips, and bend down at the knees, so you're toning your calves and thighs. For added effect for your calves, try to lean your weight into your heels, not your toes, so you'll be burning fat more and toning those calves less. Hold each squat for 2-3 seconds and come up again, standing straight. Do 10-15 squats at a time.








Adding extra weight when squatting can add bulk to calves.
For added balance, extend both arms directly in front of you with your palms facing the floor, parallel to the floor.
In conjunction with the proper exercise routine, this will help you reduce calorie and fat intake and increase positive muscle development.

, To do a calf raise, simply stand with your legs hip's distance apart and hold on to a surface like a chair or a table with your hands. Then, lift up your legs so you're just standing on your toes and the balls of your feet, lifting your heels in the air. Hold each calf raise for at least one second before coming back down on your heels, feeling your calves getting toned. Do a series of 20 calf raises at a time.







, To do the soccer kick, simply stand in front of a surface that is elevated about as much as a soccer ball. Put your hands on your hips and then kick one foot so that the toe is touching the surface of the area, or the ""ball,"" while the other foot is about a foot's length behind it. Then, kick so that the feet switch positions, with the other foot pointed at the other surface while the other is on the ground. Repeat this quickly, so you're not pausing in between kicks, and feel the burn in your calves.

, If you have toned calves already, then doing exercises that build resistance against your calves will make them even bigger. You should avoid any activity that makes your calves burn as they feel an increased pressure. Here are some activities that you should avoid unless you want to make those calves even bigger:Walking or running on hills. Though walking and running builds resistance against your calves, you shouldn't avoid these activities all together, but you should try to walk or run in a flat area whenever you can.
Climbing. Take it easy on the stair climber, walking up stairs, or even rock climbing.
Jumping rope. Jumping up and down on your toes is a great cardiovascular exercise, but it will also make for larger calves.
Calf raises. This is a quick way to increase the size of your calves if you already have toned legs.
Sprinting. Sprinters run on their toes, and this will bulk up those calves.

Make gradual improvements to your diet.,
Allow yourself a cheat meal every once in a while.,
Choose healthy foods.,
Master the art of portion control.,
Look for more action-oriented ways to do your chores.,
Do your housework to energetic songs that you love.,
Be that person that doesn’t try to stay in shape.,
Replace your office chair with a stability ball.,
Wear a weighted vest around your torso.,
Stand, instead of sitting.,
Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator whenever possible.,
Ride your bicycle instead of driving your car whenever possible.,
Park far away.,
Use a pedometer.",How to Get Smaller Butt and Thighs Without Exercising," It’s well-known that diet plays a huge role in a physically fit body. Don’t try and change your food choices overnight, though. Take small steps, and you’ll get there. Start eating more vegetables at first, for instance. Then cut out sugary sodas.After that, choose fruit over fattening desserts. Next, start eating whole wheat bread instead of white bread. Then, cut out eating candy at work. Overtime, these small actions turn into good habits.;
, Most people who have a low percentage of body fat still indulge in their favorite foods from time to time. Eating what you want every once in a while ensures that you don’t get bitter about having a healthy diet. It also means that you won’t end up binging on the foods you feel you’re missing out on. So enjoy that cookie or piece of chocolate from time to time. Just don’t let it become so frequent that you can no longer say to yourself that you have a healthy diet.If you’re eating the right amount of food for your body type and the right type of food, it’s only natural that the different parts of your body, like your butt and thighs, will eventually be in proportion to one another. The idea is not to diet but to make healthy eating a part of having a fit lifestyle., There are many choices about what to drink and eat. One of them, junk food, for instance, usually has added salt and sugar and is high in saturated fat. Probably one of the biggest issues with it, though, is that it often tastes better than healthy food. It’s okay to have junk food sometimes but the rest of the time, it’s best to eat more nutritious food. Some of the ways to make better choices include reading food labels and swapping junk food from the five food groups.These five groups consist of: legumes/beans and vegetables; whole grain foods; poultry and lean meats, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds; and milk and yogurt cheese.

, If you’re not into exercising, portion control is important. If you discipline yourself to do this, you can try a little of everything. It’s a way to eat better, yet you don’t feel that you’re sacrificing so much that it’s cramping your lifestyle., Use a push lawnmower instead of a riding lawnmower. If you are accustomed to using a riding lawnmower because of the size of your lawn, divide your lawn into sections and mow each section on separate days. Use a shovel instead of a snow blower. Use a rake instead of a leaf blower. Wash your car yourself versus taking it through the car wash.

, You can’t help but dance to it. Slow dancing burns approximately 3 to 4 calories a minute, and fast dancing burns about 8 calories a minute. If you dance while doing the housework, you’ll be in the mid-range of about 5 calories a minute. So dance your way to a smaller butt and thighs while getting your housework done more quickly., You do this is by building up a set of habits over the years that help you stay fit without putting in a ton of effort. This happens overtime by making good lifestyle choices. Pick weekend activities that keep you moving like hiking and bicycling. Don’t be a couch potato. Overall, sitting for too long is not good. Basically this means that whenever you can, get up and move., All the way around, sitting on a ball is much better for you. It requires good posture, and unlike sitting in an office chair, you can’t slouch. Also sitting on a ball activates the core muscles of your back, hips and abdomen. When one part of your body gets in shape, it means that the other parts of your body, like your butt and thighs, receive benefit, too., This is a perfect investment if you don’t like to exercise. You can wear it when you’re cleaning the house or washing the car. A vest gives you an additional 20 pounds of weight to hold. You can even just walk around wearing it for 30 minutes a day. It will help you build muscle and burn calories, all without exercising., Your metabolism and fat-burning enzymes are more active when you stand, and you’ll burn up a couple hundred extra calories, too. So the next time you’re waiting at the doctor or dentist’s office, waiting to get on the bus, talking on the phone, or waiting in line to renew your driver’s license, stand instead of sit and visualize your thighs and butt getting slimmer as you do so., Climbing the stairs is an easily accessible activity that fires and firms your glutes. For every 20 minutes of stair climbing, depending on your weight, you burn anywhere from 130 to 170 calories. The more calories you burn, the less fat your body stores, especially in fatty areas, like your butt and thighs., Because you are using the lower part of your body to pedal, it’s highly beneficial to both your legs and buttocks. Bicycling is also not hard on the body because it’s low impact. Most people who ride a bike on a regular basis say that there glutes are much tighter than they were before they started riding. The reason this area gets toned is because your butt muscles are engaged when you cycle., Many people when they can’t find a parking spot get really bent out of shape. Well next time, use this to your advantage by parking blocks away, and happily walk to where you need to go. You’ll not only be moving your butt, thighs and the rest of you, but you’ll be burning calories, too. Also it’s even more advantageous if you just ate because you store less fat after a meal if you walk afterwards. , Studies show that just by wearing a pedometer that you walk 27 percent more than usual. It usually ends up being at least 1 extra mile a day. Even if you’re not into exercising, it will just happen naturally that you’ll choose to walk more. Walking 1 mile a day takes about 15-20 minutes to complete, which adds up to burning about 8 pounds per year."

Go for a walk.,
Use a stationary bike.,
Try swimming.,
Join a dance class.,
Hit the elliptical machine.",How to Strengthen Knees with Exercise1," Running isn't a good exercise if you have weak or painful knees, because you'll end up increasing the pain and risk serious knee injury. However, brisk walking can give you a good cardio workout while also strengthening your knees.Make sure you have good walking shoes and try to walk on a relatively flat and even surface. You may want to go to a track at a nearby school, or use a paved fitness trail in a local public park.
If you're going to walk around your neighborhood, avoid areas that are especially hilly, as inclines can put additional stress on your knees.
Start with a 10-minute walk each day if you're new to exercising. This will enable you to get in the habit of being active. After a week, increase your time to 15 minutes. Keep adding time until you've worked up to a half-hour walk each day.;
, Cycling is good cardio exercise if you have bad knees, and with an upright or recumbent stationary bike you don't have to worry about balance. The exercise won't put much stress on your knees, but can strengthen your knees and improve their range of motion.If you're not a member of a gym, you might want to buy a stationary bike to use at home. You don't necessarily need one with all the bells and whistles – you can get a basic stationary bike new or used fairly cheaply.
Make sure your bike is set up properly and the seat is comfortable and at the correct height. When the pedal is at the bottom, your knees should have about a 15-degree bend, rather than your legs being completely straight.
Set the resistance level to mimic biking on flat pavement – you don't want it too loose, but you also don't want to set it as though you're going uphill.
Use a standard stationary bike rather than a recumbent bike to get the full benefit from this exercise.
If you're just starting out, try to bike for about 10 minutes each day. After you get used to this exercise, you can increase your time.

, If you have access to a pool, swimming is a low-impact cardio exercise that will work out your entire body as well as strengthening your knees. If you haven't had any training in swimming, you may want to take a class or swim with a more experienced friend so you can make sure your form is correct.Freestyle is the easiest swimming technique to master, and puts the least stress on your knees. You should avoid techniques that tense your knees, such as strokes that incorporate frog kicks.
To preserve your knees, don't push off from the wall. Remember that you're not in a race, so speed isn't important. Just start swimming and turn at each end of the pool rather than doing push-off turns.
Another activity that is good to do in the pool is walking the pool lanes. If you are having difficulty walking on a treadmill then you might want to try walking in the pool. This lessens the stress on your knees, while allowing you to exercise. This is good for those who are elderly or overweight.

, Most dancing is relatively low-impact, and can be a way to have some fun while also getting a good cardio workout. Apart from that, you're also learning a new skill that you can show off at parties or social events.Check your local dance studios to see what types of classes are available for amateurs or recreational dancers. For example, many ballet studios offer classes for adults or recreational dancers that teach you the basics of form. If you're a member of a gym, it also may offer fitness dance classes.
Don't worry if you don't have any dance experience. Most of these classes are designed for beginners, and you'll be learning in a group – not performing on a stage.

, If you're a member of a gym, you should use the elliptical rather than the treadmill if you have bad knees. You'll burn roughly the same amount of calories, but won't put as much stress on your joints.Since your feet never leave the pedals of an elliptical machine, this exercise decreases your risk of injury to your knees or back.
When you're just starting out, choose a slower speed and exercise for about 10 minutes. As you get more accustomed to the exercise, you can gradually increase the amount of time you spend on the elliptical.

Supplement with creatine.",How to Get Big Calves," This movement targets the soleus calf muscles. Sit on the machine with your toes on the lower portion of the platform and your heels extending off. Your lower thighs go under the lever pad, and your hands go on top of the lever pad to keep it in place. Lift the lever by pushing your heels up, then slowly lower your heels by bending at the ankles. Now extend the ankles as high as possible, contracting the calves, and hold.


Repeat at least 10 - 20 times.
Add weight to increase the difficulty of the exercise. You can also change the way in which the muscles are targeted by changing the angle of your feet. Perform a set with the toes pointed inward, then perform a set with your toes pointed 45 degrees outward.;
, You can do this exercise with a machine or a calf block. Stand under the machine or with the balls of your feet on the calf block, starting with your heels about 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the block. Raise up on the balls of your feet as high as you can, then contract your calf muscles at the peak. Hold the position, then lower yourself back to starting position.








, This exercise is also known as the donkey raise. Sit on a leg press machine. Hold the footplate with your toes and the balls of your feet. Press it by raising your heels and breathing out. Extend your ankles as high as possible as you flex your calf. Your hips and knees should remain stationary at all times. Hold the position, then lower your heels as you bend your ankles.









The key is to make sure all of the weight is put on your calf; be sure you don't bend your knees or use other muscles to press.
You can increase the difficulty of this exercises by adding weights.

, Place yourself in a position for a squat, holding your arms at your sides. Bend your knees to lower your body, moving to the balls of your feet and toes as you squat. Now jump upward explosively, keeping your hands at your sides. Land on the balls of your feet and squat again upon impact.


Doing this exercise frequently is a good way to build muscle quickly. The explosive movement is what encourages the muscle to build fast.
Don't use a barbell or dumbbells with this exercise. You need to be able to jump freely and explosively, and a barbell or dumbbells would inhibit this movement too much.

, Stand in front of an exercise box that you can easily jump upon. Your toes should be pointed toward the box. Jump explosively so that you land on the box with the balls of your feet. Jump back down to the floor, then repeat.


Be sure the box you use is anchored to the floor so that it doesn't slide and cause you to fall.
Don't use dumbbells during box jumps, since you might need to use your hands to catch yourself if you fall.

, Jumping rope is one of the easiest and fastest ways to get bigger calves.


For this to work, you have to push yourself to jump rope for long periods of time (about 5 minutes to 10 minutes).

, It's necessary to complete the full range of motion with every rep to engage the entire muscle. Your calves are already used to getting a little workout every time you climb the stairs or go for a walk. To make them grow, you need to put them through a workout they don't get on a daily basis.Most calf exercises entail maintaining a slight bend at your knees to lower your body and then straightening back up. Be sure you drop as far below horizontal as possible and rise up as high as possible to get a full range of motion on an exercise.

, You should be working on your calves two to three days a week for maximum gains. Calf muscles need time to recover,, Doing the standard calf exercises, over and over, is the best way to get bigger calves. The standard calf exercises - seated and standing calf raises, leg presses, and jumps - are designed to engage the muscles without injuring them. You can try other exercises if you become bored with the old standards, but you might just slow yourself down on your quest to get bigger calves.








, Calves won't grow unless you put them through some pain. Again, since you use your calves every day, especially if you are physically active, your calves are already used to having strain put on them. That means that when you're working out you need to go all in and keep exercising until they burn.


Some bodybuilding instructors advise that you shouldn't worry about counting reps when you're working your calves. For each exercise, do as many reps as you can before they burn too much to keep going.You can extend a set by shaking out your calves after performing several reps, then resuming., Training without shoes allows your feet, legs, and most importantly calves to engage in a greater range of motion. Without the aid of shoe padding and springs, your calves are forced to do more work.Going without shoes and socks also helps your feet get a better grip on the mat, so you won't be as prone to slipping when you're lifting heavy weights.If you are barefoot, look into exercising on a shock absorbent floor. Jumping or high-impact movements on a hard floor such as cement can lead to joint injuries.

, Bodybuilders who are big everywhere else often have the most trouble getting bigger calves. It can take months, and sometimes years, to build calves, especially if your legs are naturally on the skinny side. If you keep up your routine and make sure to get plenty of calories, you will eventually see the results you want. Don't give up too quickly.


Do take into account that genetics play a role in how large your calves can get. You can build muscle through exercise, but know that genetics might predetermine that you have smaller or larger calves. The important thing is health and function, not size.

, Building bigger muscles, no matter what part of the body you're targeting, requires fueling yourself with a balanced diet. Make sure you are getting your daily recommended amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and providing your body with fresh fruits and vegetables.


Avoid eating calories in the form of saturated fats and sugars. Don't eat a lot of fried foods, snack foods, fast foods, and desserts. Avoid white flour and sugar. Foods containing these will make you feel run down instead of energized.

, Protein is key to building big, healthy muscles. Make sure you're getting it by eating beef, chicken, fish, lamb, and other sources of animal protein. If you are a vegetarian, eat eggs, legumes, leafy greens, and tofu, are potential sources of protein.


Aim to get around 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight to help you build muscle mass.

, Creatine is a nitrogenous acid that is created naturally in the body and helps to supply energy to muscle cells. Taking a create supplement has been shown to have the same effect, and it is not harmful if you take the recommended dosage.Try supplementing your meals with creatine to get bigger calf muscles.


Creatine comes in a powdered form and is mixed with water just before you take it.
Read the directions on the creatine package and take no more than the recommended dosage of 20 grams per day.

Work out your leg muscles three times per week.,
Prioritize weight training over cardio.,
Train with heavy weights for fewer reps.,
Try single leg exercises to create balance.","How to Get Big, Masculine Legs2"," The frequency of training also contributes to muscle growth and development. If you want to get big legs, then you need to workout your leg muscles at least three times per week.Do not complete leg exercises daily because this could lead to overexertion and injury.
Always leave at least one rest day between leg workouts.

, Although cardiovascular activities, such as running, swimming, jump rope, and cycling will help to develop aerobic leg muscles, these will often appear lean. If you want to get the look of big bulging leg muscles than you should focus your training predominantly on weight lifting exercises.


You can warm up with 5 minutes of light cardio before you begin strength training.

, Try lifting 80% or more of your one rep max (the maximum amount of weight you can lift) for each exercise you complete. Then complete approximately 20 reps every time you workout. This will help you build muscles., Chances are you probably have one leg that is more dominant and stronger than the other. This not only impacts the appearance of your legs, but it can also increase your risk of injury. To make sure that you develop muscles that are equal in size on both legs, you should try modifying your workout to include single leg activities. Some exercises that you can do on one leg include:Calf raises
Lunges
Squats

"
"
Stretch your legs before and after a workout.,
Give your muscles time to rest.,
Foam roll your leg muscles.","How to Get Big, Masculine Legs3"," In order to prevent injury, you should always spend ten to fifteen minutes warming up your muscles by stretching. Do active or dynamic stretches before your workout in order to get your muscles moving. Some stretches to try include, straight kicks, hamstring stretches, inch-worm push-ups, and side shuffles.Following your workout you should also stretch out your legs to reduce muscle tightness.

, When you are training to build your leg muscles, it is very important that you give your legs a chance to recover and rebuild. Always leave a rest day between each leg workout day. If you still want to hit the gym, that is fine, but focus on a different muscle group, such as your back, arms, or abs.Be sure to have at least two complete rest days each week with no weight training.

, If your leg muscles begin to tighten, you can use a foam roller before or after your workout to help loosen your muscles and decrease muscle soreness. Roll the foam overtop of tight muscles for approximately 20 to 30 seconds."
"
Eat good quality protein before and after a workout.,
Consume a high calorie diet.,
Drink lots of water.","How to Get Big, Masculine Legs4"," Even if you have the best leg workout routine, you will not notice the results without eating a well-balanced diet. Protein helps to rebuild muscles. As a general rule, you should be eating one gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight (2.2g/1kg) each day.Some good sources of protein include chicken, lean beef, pork, milk, or cottage cheese.

, When you are trying to build muscle, you need to eat a high calorie diet. This will help you gain weight, and if you are eating healthy foods plus working out, the weight gain will likely come in the form of muscle growth. For example, to develop muscles and gain weight, you should consume 500 more calories than you expend each day. This will allow you to gain approximately one pound per week.It is important that these calories come from healthy proteins, fibers, and carbohydrates. Avoid eating unhealthy foods such as fried food, refined sugars, and saturated fats.

, Dehydration will make your workout extremely difficult and may cause your muscles to tighten and cramp up. A lack of water can also cause your muscles to weaken and lose some of their endurance. In order to build and sustain strong muscles, you should drink approximately one litre of water for every 1,000 calories expended each day."
"
Track your calories.,
Eat a low-fat diet.,
Introduce more fruits and vegetables into your diet.,
Replace refined grains with whole grains.,
Choose lean sources of protein.",How to Make Calves Smaller2," You cannot reduce the fat in particular areas of your body, but you can lose weight over all of your body, which will help reduce the size of your calves as well. To lose weight, you should consume fewer calories than you burn during exercise. To help you do this, keep track of how many calories you burn each day as well how much exercise you do.

You can use a fitness tracking app like MyFitnessPal or SuperTracker.
How many calories you need to eat a day can vary based on gender, age, activity level, and other lifestyle factors. You can visit a registered dietitian to find a diet plan that works for you.
Do not eat fewer than 1200 calories a day.

, If you have fatty calves and need to lose weight, then you can't really target the calves with a weight loss plan, but you can eat a low fat diet that reduces your overall weight. When eating fats, go for healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and olive oil.


Avoid products with trans-fats trans-fats like pastries, baked goods, margarine, fried foods, and snack foods like chips or crackers., A varied diet of fruits and vegetables will give you plenty of important vitamins, minerals, and fiber. All fruits and vegetables are good for you, but some really healthy choices include:

Leafy greens such as spinach, chard, and mustard greens
Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, kale, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts
Citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges, limes, and grapefruit, Whole grains are good sources of fiber, which will make you feel full faster. This will help you eat less. White or refined grains, in comparison, can make your blood sugar spike and then crash. This will both make you feel hungrier and more tired.Whole grains include whole wheat bread, oatmeal, brown or wild rice, whole wheat pasta, and barley.
Refined grain products include white bread, white rice, pasta, and most types of crackers and pastries.

, Protein is important for any diet, and it may help you feel fuller fast while giving you a boost of energy. This will help you eat less and burn more calories. Choose lean sources of protein instead of fatty ones like ribs or fatty steaks. Instead, look for:

Lean cuts of meat such as white chicken or turkey or lean beef
Legumes such as beans, lentils, and peas
Eggs
Low-fat dairy products like milk or yogurt

"
Step on your entire foot whenever you can.,
Avoid wearing heels.,
Stretch your legs.",How to Make Calves Smaller3," You may be walking in a way that is putting extra pressure on your calves. For example, you may be walking on your toes instead of stepping onto your heel and your toes. Try walking by stepping first on the heel and rolling forward towards the toes.You may not even realize that you walk on your toes. Ask a friend to observe you walking and get an honest opinion.
For an exaggerated motion, you can even curl up your toes a bit when you're exercising. For example, if you're doing squats, try to lift your toes off the ground and put your weight on your heels for an added effect.

, If you wear high heels frequently, you may have muscle imbalances in your legs that are causing them to look disproportionately large. You may want to stop wearing high heels until these imbalances are corrected.

Resistance exercises like lunges and squats might help correct the muscle imbalances caused by wearing high heels too much.

, While stretching will not slim down your calves, it can help maintain proper joint alignment. This may affect the way that your calves function. Some good stretches you can do for your calves include:

Touch your toes. Sit with your legs close together and slowly lean forward as you reach your hands toward your toes. Move towards your toes, as far as is comfortable, until you feel a burn in your calves. Hold for 15 seconds.
Wide stance stretch. Stand with one leg stretched in front of you with the other leg behind you, separating your legs as far as is comfortable. Bend your front knee and keep your back foot flat on the ground. Look straight ahead as you continue to elongate that back calf muscle. Hold for 10-15 seconds.
Step stretch. Stand with one foot flat on the ground, with the other foot flexed straight out in front of you, with about half your foot planted over the top of a stair. Lean forward and feel the stretch in the calf of the planted foot. Hold this pose for 15-20 seconds and repeat it on the other side.

Downward facing dog pose. Lie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders and your feet behind you. Use your hands to push yourself off the floor, shifting your weight to your heels. Your body should be making a reverse ""V"" shape. Hold for at least 25-30 seconds.

"
Warm up for 5 to 10 minutes.,
Do straight-leg lifts.,
Try single-leg dips.,
Strengthen your hamstrings.,
Add wall squats.,
Add resistance to your regimen.",How to Strengthen Knees with Exercise2," Before you begin any strengthening exercises, you need to warm up your lower body with a low-impact cardio exercise such as cycling or walking. A proper warm-up will decrease your risk of injury.Strengthening exercises are primarily concerned with the muscles that surround the knee, such as your quadriceps and your hamstrings. Making these muscles stronger reduces the stress on your knee joints.
If these muscles aren't warmed up prior to exercises, you put yourself at greater risk for injury, including cramps and muscle tears.
Stretching the muscles in the legs are also key to the warm-up before and after weight training. This includes hamstring stretches, quadriceps stretches, and calf stretches.

, Straight-leg lifts build the strength in your quadriceps. As you do this exercise, you should feel the burn in the front of your thigh. Make sure your form is correct and you have control over your movements.Start this exercise by lying on your back on the floor. One leg should be extended straight out, the other bent at the knee. Tighten your thigh muscles to slowly lift your straight leg off the floor. When it's about a foot off the floor, hold it for between three and five seconds, then slowly lower it.
Switch back and forth between legs, doing 8 to 10 repetitions per set. Try to do between four and six sets of this exercise. You can start with fewer and work your way up.
While doing this exercise, keep your upper body relaxed and your back flat. You can tighten your abdominal muscles to keep your lower back flat against the floor, which also engages your core.

, This exercise further builds the strength in your quadriceps, while also working your hamstrings and glutes. To set up for this exercise, you'll need two chairs with even backs of the same height.Set the chairs on either side of you with their backs facing your sides. Hold onto the tops of the backs of the chairs for balance, and lift one leg in front of you slightly. Bend your other leg to lower yourself down a few inches, hold for three to five seconds, then rise back up.
Do 8 to 10 repetitions of this exercise, then switch to the other foot and do 8 to 10 repetitions to complete one set. Aim for four to six sets of this exercise.
Make sure you're not using your arms or upper body to hold your weight – they should only be used to help you keep your balance.
As you lower yourself, lean back as if you are sitting in a chair, rather than letting the knee of the leg you're standing on go out in front of your toes.

, Your hamstrings run along the backs of your thighs and your knees. Building strength in your hamstrings is crucial if you want strong knees and a decreased risk of knee pain or injury.For hamstring curls, you will once again need a chair. Stand behind the chair with both hands on the back of it for balance. Lift one foot and bring the heel toward your buttocks. Hold that position for 3 to 5 seconds, then slowly lower it back to the floor.
Do this 8 to 10 times before switching to the other foot. Another 8 to 10 repetitions with the other foot equals one set. Try to complete four to six sets of this exercise.

, Wall squats predominately build the strength in your quadriceps. Using the wall provides you with additional stability and ensures that you're not putting additional strain on your knees, which is common with traditional squats.To start, stand up straight with your head, back, and hips against a wall. Step out until your feet are about two feet from the wall, hip-width apart. Slide down the wall until you are almost in a sitting position, then hold that position for between 5 and 10 seconds before sliding back up.
Do four to six sets of this exercise, with between 8 and 10 repetitions per set.
This exercise helps you learn the correct position for traditional squats, while providing support for your back and helping you maintain your balance. Don't slide so far down that your hips are lower than your knees, or allow your knees to move forward over your toes.

, Once you've become more accustomed to strength-training exercises with just your body weight, use barbells or ankle weights to gain further strength by increasing resistance.To build muscle, you should choose a weight that will allow you to complete your exercises, but that is heavy enough that you'll be struggling to complete the last few repetitions.
As you exercise more, you'll have to keep increasing the weight to get additional strength-building benefits. You also can do additional repetitions with a lighter weight.

Warm up before doing stretches.,
Do exercises to stretch the surrounding muscles.,
Try standing calf stretches.,
Add knee extension stretches.,
Stretch your glutes with the Figure Four stretch.,
Work on your knee flexion.,
Use an exercise band.",How to Strengthen Knees with Exercise3," If you're doing stretching exercises separately from strength-building exercises, make sure you've spent between five and ten minutes warming up before you start stretches to avoid injury.When you build the strength in the muscles surrounding your knees, you also make them tighter. The tighter your muscles are, the more prone they are to injury. Stretching makes your muscles less tight, and also can reduce muscle soreness after exercise.

, Since many of the strength-training exercises to strengthen knees focus on quadriceps and hamstrings, you need to be sure to also stretch these muscles.The quadricep stretch is something you've probably seen joggers or runners do frequently. Hold on to a wall or the back of a chair for balance and lift one foot. Bring your heel towards your buttocks, holding your ankle or the top of your foot. Squeeze your heel closer to your body and hold this stretch for 30 seconds. Then move to the other leg.
Be careful to keep your back neutral as you do this stretch. Don't bounce or pulse while stretching, just hold the stretch. Go only far enough that you can feel the stretch – don't push your heel so close to the body that it's painful.
For hamstring stretches, sit with both legs in front of you and your feet neutral. Stretch your arms out and slowly walk your palms down the floor toward your ankles, stopping when you feel the stretch. Hold it for 30 seconds, then slowly walk your palms back. Make sure your back is long and straight, not rounded.

, Tight calves can cause your knees to move inward. This can cause pain and put you at greater risk for injury. You can stretch your calves without any particular equipment – all you need is a curb or step.Start by standing on the edge of the curb or step. The edge should be roughly even with your instep, with the balls of your feet on the top. You can stretch both calves at once, or put one foot on the ground for additional stability.
Allow your heel to drop below the edge until you feel the stretch. Hold that position for about 30 seconds. If you were doing one leg at a time, you'll want to switch and do the other leg. If you're doing both legs at the same time, make sure you're holding something for balance.

, Knee extension stretches can be incorporated as part of your workout, or you can do them periodically over the course of the day. This can be beneficial particularly if you have an office job that requires long hours of sitting at a desk.You can do knee extension stretches sitting in a chair. Rest one foot on another chair so that your knee is slightly raised. Using only your leg muscles, slowly and gently push that knee towards the floor until you feel a stretch.
Hold the stretch for between 5 and 10 seconds, then move your leg back to where you started and switch legs. You should do each leg five times.

, The glutes and performs are muscles that rotate your hips. There aren't many stretches that specifically target these muscles, but keeping them loose can decrease the stress on your knees.To do a Figure Four stretch, lie on your back on the floor. Your feet should be flat on the floor, knees bent. Bring your right leg up and cross your right ankle over your knee.
Put your hands behind your left thigh and slowly pull towards your chest until you feel the stretch. Hold for about 30 seconds, then switch and do the other side.

, Knee flexion exercises can strengthen your knee joint as well as the surrounding muscles, and give you an increased range of motion. Knee flexion stretches are crucial if you spend extended periods of time sitting at a desk.All you need for knee flexion stretches are a chair and a rolled towel, such as a beach or bath towel. Loop the towel under your foot, and pull on the towel with both hands to bend your knee. Pull until your foot is between 4 and 5 inches off the floor, or until you feel a stretch.
Hold that position for between 5 and 10 seconds, then slowly release your foot back to the floor and switch sides. You should try to do this stretch at least five times on each side.

, There are a number of stretches you can do using an exercise band that will help strengthen your knees and give you more flexibility. Many of these stretches are prescribed by physical therapists as rehabilitation following a knee injury or surgery.For example, you can add an exercise band to any of the other stretches you've been doing, such as quadriceps stretches, to add resistance and get some increased stability.
To do the quadriceps stretch with an exercise band, you want to lay on your stomach with the exercise band looped around your heel. Pull the band over your shoulder and tug it until you feel the stretch in your quadriceps. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then switch to the other leg.
Most gyms have exercise bands available for members to use. You also can buy a set of exercise bands fairly inexpensively. You also can use a belt in a pinch, although they don't typically have the same level of elasticity that exercise bands do.
Exercise bands are used by Physical Therapists to rehabilitate, and help the patient achieve stronger muscles, tendons, and joints. This will help the patient with joint stability, while allowing you to be more sure on your feet.

Stand with your back flat against a wall.,
Walk your feet out about about 2 feet in front of you, feet spread about 6 inches apart..








,
Slide your back down the wall, bending your knees until they are bent at about a 90 degree angle.,
Hold this seated position for 20-60 seconds, contracting your abdominal muscles.Your thighs will start to burn after 20 seconds, but try to stick it out for the full 60.

,
Straighten your legs and come back to a standing lean against the wall.,
Change the angle of your bent knees to change the intensity of the exercise.",How to Do Wall Sits1,",, Your thighs should be parallel to the ground and it should appear that you are sitting in an invisible chair.








Your knees should never extend past your ankles--they should be straight above your ankles. You may need to slide further up or down on the wall to get into this position.This position strengthens your quadriceps on the front of your thigh and your hamstrings on the back of your thigh, which can help prevent damage to your knees. These muscles are necessary for everyday actions like standing and walking, so it's important to keep them in good shape.,,









Rest for 30 seconds, then repeat. Try to do 5 sits at 60 seconds each, or until your muscles become too fatigued to hold the sitting position.If a trainer or doctor has instructed you to do a different number of sits for a different length of time, follow their orders. This is simply a guideline to get you started.

, Instead of repeating the move and bending your knees to 90 degrees each time, first slide down the wall only a couple of inches. The next rep, slide a little bit further down, and so on.

Start with toe raises.,
Use a resistance band.,
Use a cuff weight.,
Try isometric exercise.,
Progress to smith machine reverse calf raises.,
Add other weight-training exercises.",How to Exercise Tibialis Anterior1," This exercise strengthens your tibialis anterior and other tendons and muscles running along your shins. If you have extremely weak shins, or are recovering from a recent injury, this is one of the first movements you should do to exercise your tibialis anterior.Initially, do this exercise from a seated position. Find a chair you can sit in with good posture and your feet firmly on the floor in front of you. Slowly raise your toes and the front of your foot off the floor toward your shins, digging your heels into the floor.
When you've raised your toes as far as you can without pain, hold the position for a couple of seconds, then slowly release your foot to the floor. Try to do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise. You can do each foot individually or do them both at the same time.
After you've been doing seated toe raises for a couple of weeks, try standing toe raises. Make sure you have something to hold onto so you can balance and stand with good posture.
You can use resistance bands to make this exercise even more challenging and further strengthen your tibialis anterior.;
, You can strengthen your tibialis anterior muscle specifically with an elastic resistance bands. If you're currently in physical therapy for an injury, you may be able to get one from your physical therapist. Otherwise, you can buy them at any sporting goods store, typically for less than $20.To exercise your tibialis anterior with a resistance band, tie one end of the band around a heavy, stable object, such as a table or sofa. Loop the other end of the band around your foot and tie it to secure it.
Pull your toes and foot up and toward your shins, keeping your knee straight. Go as far as you can without pain. Hold the position for a couple of seconds, then slowly move your foot back to your starting position.
Do 10 repetitions of this exercise, or until you can no longer do it without pain.

, Cuff weights provide resistance when doing toe raises to further strengthen your tibialis anterior. You can also do this exercise with a resistance band if you don't have access to cuff weights.Cuff weights are available at most sporting goods stores. They typically have removable sand bags so you can customize the amount of weight you're using, and secure around a limb using velcro.
Sit in a chair and wrap the cuff weight around your foot. Flex your ankle, moving your toes and foot up toward your chin.
Go as far as you can, then hold your foot there for a couple of seconds before slowly lowering it back to starting position.
Try to do 10 repetitions, but stop if you can no longer do it without pain.

, With isometric exercises, you contract the muscle you want to strengthen without moving your joint. This exercise can strengthen your tibialis anterior and increase the range of motion in your ankle without putting any stress or pressure on the joint.Start isometric exercise of your tibialis anterior by sitting in a chair or lying on your back on the floor with your legs out in front of you.
Cross one leg over the other at the ankles. If your tibialis anterior is weaker in one leg than in the other, you want to start with that leg on the bottom.
Push the top of your lower foot into the sole of your other foot. Take care not to flex your ankle as you do this.
Press your feet together for five seconds, then slowly release. Repeat between 10 and 15 times, then re-cross your ankles and do the other leg.
Varying the position of your ankle enables you to strengthen your tibialis anterior in relation to other ranges of motion.

, If you have access to a gym with weight training equipment, you can use that equipment to further strengthen your tibialis anterior and the rest of the muscles in your lower leg, including your calves.To start this exercise, go to the smith machine and stand under the bar with your heels on the platform.
Rise up on your heels to contract your tibialis anterior. Hold the position for a couple of seconds, then slowly release back to your starting position.
Do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise to exercise your tibialis anterior as well as the surrounding muscles in your lower leg.

, The reverse variation of any calf exercise will engage and strengthen the tibialis anterior, as well as exercising the rest of your lower leg. Once you've sufficiently strengthened your tibialis anterior so it is in balance with the rest of the muscles in your lower leg, use these exercises to maintain and continually build strength.The best way to do this is to do a reverse variation of any calf exercise in your routine. For example, if you do calf raises, you should also do reverse calf raises. This ensures you maintain balance in the muscles in your lower leg.
These weight-training exercises often are done on weight benches using free weights, or on exercise machines. If you don't have access to a gym, you can do similar exercises at home with dumbbells or resistance bands.
Start with just your body weight, and slowly add weight or resistance every week or so to continuously challenge and build strength in your tibialis anterior.

Warm up before stretching.,
Start with shin stretches.,
Do towel calf stretches.,
Add standing calf stretches.",How to Exercise Tibialis Anterior2," Before you do any stretches, make sure you raise your body temperature a couple of degrees with a low-impact, cardiovascular activity. This will stimulate increased blood flow to your muscles and help prevent strains or other injuries.Walking at a brisk pace for five to 10 minutes is a good overall cardiovascular warm-up.
Squats and lunges also are a good warm-up before you do stretches or strength training on your lower body. Move slowly, but try to do these exercises in fluid motion, so that you're always moving.
If you have limited space, you also might try jumping jacks or jogging place for five minutes, although these activities involve a little more impact and stress on your joints.

, Provided you have never had any ankle injuries, you can do a seated exercise to stretch your tibialis anterior and the other muscles in your shins. These muscles typically are difficult to stretch.Kneel on the floor with your shins flat on the ground. Your toes and feet should be pointing behind you. You can rest your hands on the ground beside you.
To start the shin stretch, slowly lean back to sit on your heels, stopping when you feel the stretch. If you have to, you can put your hands on the ground behind you so you can lean further back.
Hold the stretch for a couple of minutes, then slowly raise up to release the muscles.
You can also do a standing shin stretch. Cross your left leg in front of your right, so the tops of the toes of your left foot are resting on the floor. Bend your right knee to press your toes further into the floor until you feel the stretch in your shin. Hold the stretch for a couple of seconds, then slowly release and switch legs., When your tibialis anterior is weak, it can keep you from being able to fully flex your foot. Over time, this can cause your calves to become shortened and tightened, which can exacerbate any lower leg problems.You also can do this exercise with a resistance band, but using a rolled towel allows you to better control the level of resistance.
Sit up straight with your legs out in front of you. Wrap the towel around the balls of your feet, then pull the ends of the towel toward you so that your foot flexes up.
Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds, feeling the stretch in your calf. Then slowly release.
You can safely do this stretch three to five times a day if you have particularly tight calves.

, Standing calf stretches are a more intense stretch than the calf stretches you do while sitting, because you are working with your body weight and gravity as resistance.Start your standing calf stretch by standing a few feet in front of a wall or other stable vertical surface. Place your hands on the wall about shoulder-width apart and drop one leg behind you.
Push the heel of your rear leg into the floor, keeping your back and leg straight. Your front knee should be bent.
Without bouncing, push your heel down into the floor until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, then release slowly and switch legs.
You also can do calf stretches on stairs. To do a standing gastrocnemius calf stretch, which stretches one of the two muscles in your calves, place one heel on a step and extend your knee. Your other foot should be flat on the floor. Grab the toe of the front foot and pull your toes toward your shins. You should feel a pull in your calf. Hold for a couple of seconds, then slowly release and do the other leg.
Stand on a step with the balls of your feet firmly on the step and your heels over the edge. Make sure you have something to hold onto for balance, and lower your heels as far as you can without pain. Hold for a couple of seconds, then slowly raise your heels back up.

Run barefoot on a grassy surface.,
Run or walk on an incline.,
Jump rope.,
Walk or skip on your toes.,
Walk on your heels.",How to Exercise Tibialis Anterior3," Running or walking barefoot on an uneven, grassy surface can evenly strengthen and condition all five muscles in your calves and shins simultaneously.You should only do this when it's relatively warm outside. Keep in mind the ground is often going to be colder than the outside air temperature, and you lose a lot of body heat through your feet.
Make sure the surface is relatively well-maintained and free of debris. Athletic fields or golf courses can be good options.
Start slow, going no more than a half-mile (about 800 meters) to start. This will give your legs, feet, and ankles time to adjust to walking or running barefoot.

, Incline and hill work exercise your tibialis anterior to a degree that running or walking on a flat surface cannot, because your toes are higher than your heels. Since you're running or walking at a slower rate of speed, you also decrease your risk of injury because you have more control over your form.If you live in a relatively hilly area, adding incline work to your cardio routine can be as simple as making sure your walking or running route includes several hills.
In a gym, increase the incline on a treadmill to simulate walking or running on a hill.
Make sure you warm up your muscles by walking or running on a flat surface for 5 to 10 minutes before going into any incline or hill work.

, Jumping rope is a good conditioning exercise that works your entire body as well as conditioning the muscles in your shins and calves, including your tibialis anterior. A fitness jump rope is a relatively inexpensive exercise tool that you can find in any sporting goods store.You can add jumping rope to your overall regimen and do it for five to ten minutes, then rest for a minute or two.
Another option is to add jump-rope intervals of 30 seconds to a minute in between strength-training exercises. These can be especially beneficial to continue to condition the muscles in your lower legs even while doing upper body exercises.

, Walking or skipping on your toes works all the muscles in your lower leg, particularly your calves. This conditioning exercise also gives you a good cardiovascular workout, and can be used as a warm-up before lower-leg strength training or stretching.If you're adding this exercise as an interval to your workout regime, you can go for a set period of time (such as 5 or 10 minutes), or for a set distance (no more than 20 meters or about 65 feet per interval).

, This activity provides intense exercise for your tibialis anterior, as your feet are in the same position they would be in if you were doing toe raises to strengthen your shin muscles.As an interval, do this for 5 to 10 minutes in between other strength-training exercises. Try to place a heel-walking interval between exercises that don't focus on your lower legs.
You also can add heel walking to your regimen as an exercise in and of itself. Try to walk on your heels for about 20 meters or 65 feet to start, increasing your distance incrementally with each workout session.

Get your doctor's permission to exercise.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury1," Before attempting any exercise after a leg injury, consult your doctor. The healing time will depend on the type of leg injury you sustained, and some injuries take longer than others to heal. If you begin exercising too soon after an injury, you may cause additional damage to your leg and increase the healing time required.;

Make yourself comfortable.,
Place your feet and knees together.,

Use your hands to increase difficulty.,
Check your form.,
Be conscious of any pain the exercise induces.,
Alter your rhythm.,
Hold the curled position.,
Do sit ups in intervals.,
Add resistance by using a medicine ball.",How to Do Straight Leg Sit Ups," Doing straight leg sit ups can put a lot of pressure on your rear end so you may want to choose a fairly soft surface such as a yoga mat, carpeted floor or a grass covered area in your yard. This will be the “down” and rest position for this exercise. You can adjust this down position to compensate for any injuries or limitations you may have.Ensure the surface you do your sit ups on can support your weight and won’t fall over.
Too much cushioning can compromise your ability to effectively execute the movement, so keep cushioning limited if you use it.
If you have issues with sciatica pain in your back, you may find turning your feet or bending one knee slightly will relieve it.;
, When you lay down to do your straight leg sit ups, extend your legs straight out as though you’re laying at the position of attention. Your knees should be completely extended and locked.


Make sure both your knees and feet are touching one another.
Your legs will remain in this position for the duration of the exercise, so make sure they are in a comfortable position while outstretched.

, Although it may be common to see people placing their hands behind their heads when doing sit ups or stomach crunches, doing so creates the risk of applying pressure to your neck with your hands. To avoid this, cross your hands over your chest like an “X”.If you have difficulty crossing your arms over your chest, simply lay your arms and hands down on your chest in a comfortable way.
It’s important that you not use your arms to assist you as you execute the sit up movement, so if you have limitations that prevent you from placing your hands on your chest, simply ensure they are out the way.

, Without moving your legs at all, engage your core muscles to lift your abdomen off of the floor. Keep your back straight, as though your waist is a hinge and your upper body is a door. Sit up until your body reached a ninety-degree angle. This is considered the “up” position for this exercise.









You should be able to do this without any pressure on your feet, but some people may need a partner to put pressure on their ankles to prevent them from lifting off the floor.
Your abdominal muscles are engaged during the up movement, but are not once you reach the up position.

, Reverse your previous motion by lowering your back and shoulders to the floor. Be sure to keep your back straight, as rounding or arching your back can limit the effectiveness of the exercise and even cause back pain.








Your shoulders should come into contact with the floor first.
When completely lowered, you should find yourself back in the down position.

, Once you have mastered the traditional straight leg sit up, you may want to make it slightly more difficult by applying more pressure to your core muscles. You can do this by changing the placement of your hands.








In the down position, hold your hands straight up, perpendicular to your body, with your fingers extended.
As you sit up, rotate your shoulders so your hands continue to point straight at the ceiling.
Reverse that movement on the way down, until you find yourself in the adjusted down position.

, Use a mirror or ask a friend to make sure you aren’t falling victim to any of the common mistakes people make when executing straight leg sit ups. By failing to utilize the proper form, you can reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or even injure yourself.Make sure you don’t use your arms to assist you in any way when sitting up.
Ensure your feet do not lift up off of the floor at any point.
Be sure to sit all the way up to a ninety-degree angle.

, Straight leg sit ups should not create any significant pain to execute. If you find yourself experiencing pain during the exercise, you may want to seek guidance from a trainer or discuss it with your doctor.


Straight leg sit ups can exacerbate lower back injuries by placing pressure on your lower lumbar. If you feel pain in your lower back, you may want to see a doctor.
If it hurts to conduct this exercise, you should stop doing it until you have an opportunity to discuss it with a trainer or coach, to ensure you are executing the movement properly.

, You can alter the difficulty of straight leg sit ups by utilizing different rhythms. You can change the speed in which you do the entire exercise, but depending on your fitness level, it may be in your best interest to alter the speed in which you go up and down independent of one another.Beginners should go both up and down slowly until they develop the core strength to move on to more difficult rhythms.
Intermediate level people should go up fast, then lower themselves down slowly.
Advanced athletes can try going up fast and lowering themselves back down quickly as well. Lowering yourself quickly is difficult, because your abdominal muscles must prevent you from impacting the floor too hard. Do not simply drop back to the floor.

, You can make your straight leg sit ups significantly more difficult by pausing halfway up, and then completing the exercise. This will force your core muscles to hold you in place and increase the amount of time they are engaged with each sit up.Begin to sit up just like normal, but pause briefly halfway before completing the movement.
Try counting to five at the mid-point to increase the difficulty further.

, Instead choosing to do a number of sit ups and stopping when you reach that number, try challenging yourself by doing sit ups in time intervals. Try to do as many sit ups as you can within each interval.Do as many sit ups as you can in 60 seconds, then allow yourself to rest in the down position for 60 seconds.
Do as many sit ups as you can in 45 seconds the second time, then rest for another 60 seconds.
Repeat the process with a thirty second interval to complete the workout.

, Holding a medicine ball in your hands while executing straight leg sit ups can dramatically increase the difficulty of the exercise. Choose a medicine ball that is the right weight for you and hold it over your chest. You can replicate this using other forms of weights that you can hold comfortably on your chest as well.

Intermediate athletes should hold the medicine ball in place on their chest as they execute the exercise.
Advanced athletes can press the medicine ball out from their chest until their arms are extended on their way up, and bring it back in on the way down to further increase the difficulty.

Stand erect with your feet approximately one shoulder width apart.,
Push your hips back, slowly bending your knees to a 90 degree angle.,
Keep your back straight and eyes looking ahead.,
Slowly rise to starting position.",How to Do Squats and Lunges1,"


From there, you can widen or narrow your stance depending on which muscles you are targeting — a wider stance works the hamstrings and glutes, while a narrower stance works the quads.
Point your toes slightly outwards, as this helps to stabilize your stance.
Keep your arms extended in front of you.;
,


Rather than squatting straight down, you want to hinge your hips so that your butt moves backwards, almost as if you were sitting in an invisible chair.
Keep bending until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Your knees shouldn't extend beyond the tips of your toes.
Your body weight should be concentrated on your heels rather than on your toes. This will allow you to squat deeper.

,


It is very important to keep your back straight while squatting, otherwise you could put unnecessary pressure on the spine which could lead to a pulled muscle or a herniated disc.
Keeping your chest up and your eyes pointing straight ahead will help you to keep your back straight as you squat. Also try to keep your stomach muscles engaged as you perform the exercise.,


Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat, then slowly rise back to your starting position. Keep your back straight and push up from your heels.
Squeeze your glutes in tight when you reach the top of the squat.

Talk to your doctor about managing your knee pain but still staying active.",How to Do Leg Workouts with Knee Pain," The importance of an adequate warm-up should never be underestimated. In fact, it doesn't just prevent injuries, but it can help you get better results out of your workout. Start with some joint rotations, some light jumping jacks (if your knee can tolerate them), and some push ups to get your body prepared for your actual work out. Here's what a warm-up can do for you:Warm-ups help increase blood flow to your leg muscles
Warm-ups can loosen up stiff muscles and increase your flexibility
Warm-ups prepare you physically and psychologically for the intense workout ahead;
, Stretching and deep breathing is a great way to warm up your overall body. It should start with head and neck stretches and work its way down. This will keep you systematic and prevent you from skipping a muscle.


If you'd like, use a foam roller to avoid pulling your knees too much. Proper tracking will also be maintained when you use foam rollers.

, Walking is the most fundamental exercise for your legs. While it involves knee bending, it is still considered minimal compared to other forms of exercises. Overall, it does not put too much stress on your knees. If you can tolerate regular walking, try brisk walking for added intensity.


Make sure that you are walking on smooth and even ground. This will put even pressure on your knees, feet, and legs as a whole.
Walking 30 minutes is said to achieve the same result as jogging for 30 minutes. Even if you do it in 10-minute chunks, you're doing your entire body a huge favor.

, Swimming is a great cardiovascular exercise that does not put too much stress on the knees. In the water your weight is evenly distributed through your body and not just to your knees only.Swimming can be done 30 minutes a day, 6 times a week to help you maintain physical fitness.
However, avoid swimming drills that will force you to flex your knees, such as the breaststroke.

, Step ups are full of cardiovascular benefits while able to develop your quads at the same time. This exercise should not put too much weight on your knees, but if you feel pain, stop immediately. Here's how to do a step up:With the use of aerobic step bench, staircase or any raised platform with 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) height, step up with your right foot.
If you'd like, do these with dumbbells in your hands placed at your shoulders. This makes the step up more of a full body workout.
Raise your left leg and briefly tap it on the platform, then lower it back to the ground.
Perform 20-30 reps for each leg with 3 sets.

, This exercise will improve the strength of your hamstrings and quads. Since the exercising knee is not bent, it does not provoke pain. Here's how this exercise is done:Start by lying on the right side of your body. Your legs should be straight and laid together, while your right arm supports your head.
Lift your right leg while keeping it straight to your body. Do it slowly until you reach a 45-degree angle.
Slowly bring back your right leg to the starting position.
Perform 12 repetitions for each leg and complete 3 sets.

, This exercise will develop your gastrocnemius, or calf muscles. The knees are kept straight during the whole duration of the exercise. Here's how to do calf raises:Use a table or chair for balance. Stand in front of a table and hold it with your hands.
Stand with your feet 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart with your toes facing ahead.
Lift your heels off the floor until your toes are the only ones left touching the floor. Do this slowly.
Slowly lower your heels again. Do 12 repetitions of 3 sets.

, Another exercise that you can do is the one leg barbell squat where one leg (the hurting leg) is rested on a bench forming a 90-degree angle with your other leg. You can stretch out as far as you can manage.This is done to strengthen knee joints and to enhance the strength of your hamstrings and gluteal muscles.
This exercise will make your legs wobbly so it is recommended that only two sets should be done.

, Just like it's imperative you warm up, it's important to cool down your muscles, too. Going from 60 to 0 in nothing flat will jar your muscles, stiffening them and reducing your flexibility.


When you're finished, take 5 or 10 minutes to stretch out your entire body. This can mirror the stretches you did beforehand, too. It's just enough to let your body know the workout is over and it doesn't have to keep pumping as hard as it was.

, When your knee pain is just starting, adequate rest is needed so that the pain felt will not be aggravated. After an intense workout, take a day off to let your muscles repair themselves. Your overall healing time will be shortened if you take adequate care of yourself.


If possible, learn to refrain from doing weight bearing activities such as jogging or running. Keep the weight off your knees as much as possible. Stick to the leg workouts suggested above until the pain subsides.

, If your knee starts hurting, grab an ice pack or some ice wrapped in a towel and apply it to your knee for 15 minutes every hour. This will help the swelling and pain subside. For the next couple of days, apply the ice at least four times every day.


Make sure there is a barrier between the ice and your skin. If ice is directly placed on your skin, it could cause tissue damage.
Do not hold the ice on your skin for more than 15 minutes at a time. Longer will numb the area and you will lose the ability to tell if your skin is freezing and getting damaged.

, Another way to reduce swelling is to keep your knees raised as much as possible. Before you go to sleep, put two pillows under your knee. This is to ensure that elevation takes place and is constant.


Do this whenever you can. If you're on the couch just watching TV or surfing the Internet, elevate your knee. A reduction in swelling can make all the difference for your pain.

, You can also wrap your knees with an elastic bandage or KT tape in order to provide support to the area and to reduce swelling. Braces can also be used, especially if you are in the middle of rehabilitation. And of these will help stabilize your knee and will act as a means of support as well.


Make sure that circulation is not cut off during wrapping or bandaging. Keep the bandage snug but not tight. Check out How to Wrap Your Knee or How to Tape a Knee for more information.

, Since you already have knee pain, you likely know that plenty of exercises will aggravate the pain. For this reason, it is important that you take note of those exercises to better protect your knee from pain. Here's what to keep in mind:


In general, exercises that will bend your knees will lead to knee pain. As you flex your knees, you are putting more pressure on the bones, ligaments and tendons around your knee. Examples of exercises that involve knee flexing will be lunges, leg presses, and full squats.
Some type of sports may also lead to knee flexing. These are soccer, basketball, tennis, hockey, football, just to name a few. Anything that will suddenly move your knee joints will put undue stress on your knee.
Exercises that involve jumping should also be avoided. Remember that jumping involves slight bending and as you land; your knee will bear 2 times your body weight because of gravity. Hopping or very light jumping can be tolerated.

, Each individual has different levels of pain tolerance and different types of pain they experience. Therefore, one person may successfully perform an exercise routine while others cannot. Because of this, it is important to know your fitness level and what you're capable of doing safely.


From there, progressively work yourself up to a more intense workout. Increase your workout about 10% each time if you find yourself capable of and pain-free from your last session.

, Many people feel pain and decide to charge through it, believing that it's weakness. This is detrimental to their performance and will eventually take them out of the running. At all times, avoid continuing with an exercise that causes pain to your knee (or anywhere else for that matter). This will lead to bigger problems in the future.


It does not mean that you have to quit working out – it simply means you have to find a new exercise to do. When you feel pain, grab some water, take a short walk around for a breather, and pick up a new exercise.

, In cases of obesity, the knee is forced to bear much more weight than it should. Increased weight leads to an increased chance of knee pain.If you're overweight or obese, consider a weight loss plan to reduce your pain.


Talk to your doctor about what a healthy weight for you is and what he or she thinks an appropriate diet and exercise plan may be. There is no one diet that is perfect for everyone and he or she will take into your habits and lifestyle to come up with a regimen you can stick with.

, However, you may wish to stick to the low-fat variety of dairy products to keep your fat intake down.


Also include vitamin D in your diet for maximum calcium absorption. This can be done by taking your walk outside in the sun or by taking a supplement – vitamin D isn't found in food.
Stay away from caffeinated or carbonated drinks because they are thought to reduce or inhibit the absorption of calcium. They are also just empty calories and sugar that aren't good for you and your entire body anyway.

, When the knees or the legs overall are not regularly exercised, they will undergo atrophy (muscle wasting) which then leads to weakness.This is, quite obviously, a condition that needs to be avoided. See your healthcare provider to discuss the best way of managing your knee pain.


If your knee pain is moderate to severe, your doctor will likely prescribe medication or open up a dialogue about possible surgical correction. In the meantime, he or she will give you a regimen to follow to stay as healthy as possible, too.

Increase circulation to your legs after a leg injury.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury2," Simple exercises with small movements can increase circulation and prevent blood clots, especially right after surgery. These exercises can be done on your back while lying in bed.


Rotate your ankle or move your foot up and down to increase circulation.
Contract your buttocks and/or thigh muscles for a few seconds and then release the contraction. This will promote blood flow to those areas.
Bend your knees to your chest slowly.
Raise your leg a few inches above the bed or floor. Keep it straight and move slowly to prevent further injury.

"
Increase your range of motion after a leg injury.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury3," Most physical therapy programs for leg injuries focus first on flexibility. Gentle stretching is the most effective way to increase range of motion.


Increase ankle flexibility by moving your ankle toward you and away from you.
Write the alphabet on the floor with your foot, which incorporates full motion in the foot and ankle.
Lean forward and slowly reach your fingertips to your toes. If you can't reach your toes, just stretch as far as comfortable. Flexibility and range of motion will improve with continued stretching.

Do exercises to improve your balance.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury4," Balance training improves posture, athletic skill and coordination, which results in greater stability and fewer injuries as you age.


Balance on 1 foot (0.3 m). When you can bear weight on your legs, try balancing on 1 foot (0.3 m). Stand on the injured leg as long as possible, and try to increase the time daily.
Place 1 foot (0.3 m) in front of the other in a heel to toe pattern, as if walking a balance beam or imaginary tight rope.

Strengthen your muscles after a leg injury.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury5," When you are strong enough to stand independently and put weight on your leg, try some exercises to increase muscle strength. When first attempting standing exercises after a leg injury, hold onto a sturdy object or surface like a wall or piece of furniture for extra support.


Do several repetitions of knees raises, in which you lift your knee toward your chest no higher than waist level.
Strengthen your hips and legs. With the foot, knee and hip pointing forward and your knee straight, lift your leg to the side and slowly lower your foot back to the floor.
Do toe raises. Roll onto the balls of your feet so you are standing on your tiptoes. Hold the pose for a few seconds and return your heels to the ground.
Sit with your back against a wall and slide down the wall so your thighs are at a 45 degree angle. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds.
Do mini squats. With your feet shoulder width apart, slowly bend between 60 and 90 degrees at the knees and then return to a standing position.
Use weights to build muscle strength. Try simple squats and lunges while holding weights to build muscle strength in your legs. Start with light weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger.
Use a resistance band to strengthen your injured leg. Resistance bands are lightweight and come in several resistance levels. Exercises with resistance bands can help you target specific muscles, such as the thighs, calves or buttocks. For example, you can loop a resistance band around your ankles and then lift 1 leg to the side and lower it back to the floor. The extra resistance in the band helps to strengthen your ankles and lower legs. Ask your doctor about resistance band exercises appropriate for your leg injury.

Resume low-impact exercise with a doctor's permission.",How to Exercise After a Leg Injury6," Whatever type of exercise you choose, it is important to start off slowly and gradually work back up to your pre-injury activity level.


Choose walking an effective low-impact exercise. Because walking does not put pressure on your legs like jogging or other aerobic exercises, it often is recommended as a low impact exercise alternative after a leg injury. Begin walking slowly and gently, and gradually pick up the walking pace. Add distance to your walking exercise as your healing permits.
Select swimming as a low-impact exercise following a leg injury. Swimming and water aerobics are gentle exercises that strengthen the entire body.
Opt for stationary biking, often called exercycling. Biking helps strengthen muscles and improve hip mobility. As you become stronger and can pedal for at least 15 minutes, gradually increase the tension on the stationary bike.
Resume jogging only if you can walk 2 miles (3.2 km) without pain. Rather than jogging long stretches, try incremental walking and jogging. Using an incremental walking and jogging technique, you walk briskly for several minutes, jog slowly for several minutes and then go back to walking. Continue the incremental walking and jogging to slowly build your strength, endurance and fitness level after a leg injury.

Start with a low weight.,
Position the bar correctly.,
Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat.,
Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up.",How to Do Squats and Lunges2,"


The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form.
Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves.,


Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders.
When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad.

,


Place your feet slightly wider than a shoulder width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards.
Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor.
Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead.
Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights.
Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight.

,


Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even black out.
Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going.
If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.

Squat with dumbbells.,
Do jump squats.,
Try a one-legged squat.,
Do a barbell stiff squat.",How to Do Squats and Lunges3,"


Take two dumbbells of your chosen weight and hold them in front of you, against your shoulders, as if you were about to do a press up.
Hold the weights in this position as you squat, using the same technique described above.
If you want to make this a total body exercise, press the dumbbells straight into the air when you reach the top of the squat — this allows you to work your legs, core, back, shoulders, chest and triceps in a single exercise!

,


This variation can only be performed with body weight squats, not with weighted squats.
Place your hands on the back of your head and squat down as normal. Rise quickly out of the squat and jump straight up into the air.
Immediately squat down again when you land.,


Hold your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder level and lift your right foot off the ground.
Do a one legged squat, lowering your body as far down as possible, while still keeping your right foot off the ground.
Slowly raise yourself back up to the starting position, then repeat with the other leg.

,


This squat is the same as a normal weighted squat, except you complete the entire exercise while balanced on your toes, with your heels lifted as high off the floor as possible.
It can be somewhat difficult to balance during this exercise, so make sure you have your basic weighted squat technique down before you attempt this.

Stand erect with your feet about one shoulder width apart.,
Take a large step forward with one leg.,
Return to starting position.,
Alternate with your other leg.",How to Do Squats and Lunges4,"


Put your hands on your hips, keep your back as straight as possible, relax your shoulders and keep your eyes facing directly ahead. Engage your core.
Lunges should be performed on solid, even ground, not on an exercise mat. An exercise mat will simply throw you off balance.

,


The length of your step will depend on your height, but it will usually be somewhere between 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9 m).
As you step forward, lower your hips and bend your knees until they both form 90 degree angles.
Your front knee should not extend over your toes and your back knee should not touch the ground.

,


Pause at the bottom of the lunge for up to five seconds.
Push off the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position.

,


Repeat the movement, this time with your opposite leg.
Remember to keep your muscles tight as you perform the exercise."

Choose your weight.,
Get into lunge position.,
Straighten your legs, but don't step backwards.,
Switch legs.",How to Do Squats and Lunges5,"


Weighted lunges can either be performed with a dumbbell in each hand or a barbell across the back.
However, barbell lunges should be reserved for more advanced athletes who have very good balance.
As with most strength exercises, you should start with a low weight and work your way up.

,


With the dumbbells in your hands (by your sides) or the barbell resting on the trapezius muscles (the muscle below the neck and between the back of the shoulders), step forward with one foot into a lunge position.
Both knees should form a 90 degree angle. The front knee should not extend beyond the toes and the back knee should not touch the ground.

,


With the weighted lunge, your feet remain in the same position as you complete the desired number of repetitions. You simply need to bend your knees up and down to perform the exercise.Remember to keep your back straight, your shoulders back and relaxed, your chin up and your core engaged as you complete your repetitions.

,


Once you have completed the desired number of repetitions, switch legs and repeat the exercise on the other side.

Do reverse lunges.,
Do bicep curl lunges.,
Do walking lunges.,
Do side lunges.",How to Do Squats and Lunges6,"


Reverse lunges involve the same movement as regular lunges, except they involve stepping backwards into the lunge instead of forwards.
Moving backwards instead of forwards requires greater skill and balance, forcing you to to perfect your technique.

,


Take a dumbbell in each hand and hold your arms down by your sides.
As you step forward into the lunge, bend your elbows and raise the dumbbells towards your shoulders to complete a bicep curl.
Lower the dumbbells as you step back into the starting position.

,


Instead of returning your front leg to the starting position after completing a lunge, walking lunges involve walking around a room, lunging with each step.
This exercise requires very good balance, so you should only attempt it after you have mastered the regular stationary lunge.

,


Side lunges offer the same benefits as forward lunges, but they work the hips, glutes and thighs in a slightly different way, making them a good variation to incorporate into your routine.
Start with your feet and knees together then take a large step out towards the side with your right foot.
Bend your right knee until it forms a 90 degree angle and keep your left leg as straight as possible.
Push off your right foot to return to the starting position, then repeat with your left leg."

Start in downward-facing dog.,
Work on warrior I.,
Try warrior II.,
Move to triangle.,
Try big toe pose.",How to Do Yoga for Leaner Legs1," Downward-facing dog is a good place to start for working your legs because you can move into a number of leg-working poses from it. From your hands and knees, push your arms out forwards, palms flat on the ground. As you do, lift your back end into the air, shifting your feet from being sole-up to being sole-down. Your heels may lift off the floor slightly. Make an ""A"" shape with your body, with your torso/arms and legs forming the sides of the A., From downward-facing dog, place your right leg up between your hands. Push yourself upward until you're mostly standing, but your right leg should be bent at an angle. Your left leg should be extended out behind you, with your foot slightly turned inward. Reach up to the sky with both arms to complete the pose.Hold it for five deep breaths, then try it the other direction, too.

, Warrior II is much the same as warrior I. Your legs will be in the same position. You can move from downward-facing dog to warrior II or from warrior I to warrior II, though moving from downward-facing dog will work your legs more.To create warrior II, stretch your right arm straight out in front of you with the palm down, looking towards that arm, and your left arm out behind you, palm down.
Hold this position for five breaths, then move to the other side.

, You can move from warrior II to triangle. Essentially, you straighten out your right leg, so that both of your legs are straight. Lean your right arm downwards towards your leg, lifting your left arm into the air. Look towards the arm that's in the air, trying to keep your torso straight, aligned with the rest of your body.Once you've tried it on one side, move to the other side.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend over, keeping your legs straight as you do. Wrap your first two fingers and thumb of each hand around each of your big toes. As you breathe in, straighten out your arms, and lift your sitting bones, hollowing out your back a bit. Lift up your torso as if you were to stand up, but don't actually do it. Contract the front of your thigh muscles as you do so. Hold for a few breaths, then move back down towards your feet.Make sure you aren't putting pressure on your neck. Your neck and forehead should feel comfortable.

Lie flat on your back with your legs stretched out in front of you.,
Bend your knees and raise your legs.,
Straighten your legs until your feet are pointed at the ceiling.,
Slowly lower your legs.,
Slow it down if this exercise is too easy.,
Repeat 3 sets of 10-20 leg lifts.",How to Do Leg Lifts1," Your legs should just be a toe's width apart. Make sure to keep your hands down flat on the ground near your sides, with your palms down.


You can use a yoga or exercise mat for extra support and comfort.
If you experience occasional back pain, you can roll a towel and place it under the arch of your back, just above your hips.
Additionally, if you lay on a workout bench instead of on the floor, it will improve your range of motion and allow you to lift/lower your legs farther.;
, Your calves should be parallel to the ground, while your thighs are perpendicular.You should keep your toes pointed while you do this, drawing your abdominal muscles toward your spine. Your thighs should be perpendicular to your body, while your shins should be parallel.









Be sure to contract your abdominals to push your lower back into the floor; there should not be any gap between them. This helps you target the abdominal muscles while protecting your spine.
Keep your eyes and face directed at the ceiling and avoid the temptation to strain your neck to look at your legs. This will help you avoid pain in your neck. If you feel that your head and neck are moving forward too much, lift your chin up a bit more.

, Keep your toes pointed and raise your legs as slowly as possible. Remember not to let your lower back arch off the ground, or you may injure yourself and you won't be getting as good of a workout.









If you can do Step 2 easily while keeping your back flat on the floor, give yourself a harder workout by skipping Step 2 and raising your legs to the ceiling without bending them.

, Bring them down as far as you can while keeping your back flat against the floor. Your eventual goal is to reach about an inch off the floor. Don't just let gravity work for you -- make sure you're in control. Hold your arms in the same place, but use them for strength and support as you lower your legs.









Resist the temptation to let your feet touch the floor if you want the best workout you can get.
Keep your lower back pressed into the floor to engage your abdominals and protect your spine. This will get harder the closer your feet get to the floor, so only lower as far as you can while not arching your back. If you feel your lower back arching up off the floor, don't lower your legs down as far. As your abdominals get stronger, you will be able to lower your feet closer to the floor using proper form.
Most importantly, don't forget to breathe! A lot of people freeze up when they do this exercise.

, For even more of a workout, you can lift your straightened legs all the up on a count of ten, and then lower them down while counting to ten again. This will definitely give your abs a great workout, but it is a bit more of a challenge.









For yet another challenge, you can also practice raising your feet about 20%, holding for one second, raising them 20% more, holding for one second, and continuing this until you get them as high as they need to be. You can lower them in increments in the same way.

, Start with 3 sets of 10 and build your way up to 3 sets of 20.

Lift the leg behind you into the air. At the same time, bring your torso forward. Your leg and your torso should end up in a straight line. You can continue to stretch your hands above your head (meaning out in front of you now), or you can move them to your side.Try holding this position for eight to ten breaths. Don't forget to do the other side, too.

, Bring your left knee up to your chest. With your right hand, grab your left foot. It's best to grab your left foot on the outer side. Use your left arm for balance by extending it backwards, then bring your left leg out in front of you. Go as far as you can, and hold for five breaths. Switch to the other side., For this position, you start in a squat. You knees should be far apart, but your toes should be touching. Place your hands flat on the floor in front of your feet. Using your inner thighs, put pressure on your arms with your thighs. Don't forget to keep your back straight.For an extra challenge, you can move into an arm balance, maintaining the squeeze on your arms, while you push your weight up onto your hands.

, Using an exercise or medicine ball can add some extra resistance to your workout and will make it even more challenging. Just place the weight in between your feet, get a firm grip on it, and then begin to lift your legs up until they are perpendicular to the rest of your body. This is the vertical leg lift with an added weight.








, The slower you go, the more you resist gravity and force your muscles to maintain control. This is a great workout for your abdominal muscles, though it can take a bit more effort than regular leg lifts.








, Since these exercises are a bit harder, you should start off by doing fewer of them until you feel ready for more. Then, you can move to doing 3 sets of 10-20 leg lifts with the added weight.








, If you like lifting the ball with your feet, then you can lift up your legs with the ball in them while reaching toward the ball with your arms.









Raise your arms and legs up at the same time, so you can grab the ball in your hands and then move it all the way up behind your head. Then, lift your arms and legs up in the same way again, and shift the weight between your arms and your legs.
Move the weight down to the floor with your feet and raise them up again to transfer the weight to your arms once more. This advanced leg lift is certain to get your abs -- and your arms -- burning.

If you're at a gym, the bar may have extra handles to support your hands.

, Keep your toes pointed as you do this. You may not be able to get them as high as you want them to be at first. Keep your back straight and avoid the temptation to hunch over or to curl in toward your legs.








, Once your legs have reached their maximum height and you feel that slow burn in your core, gently lower them down. Try going as slowly as you can to work your muscles even harder.









Make sure you lower your legs slowly so that you are doing the work instead of relying on the momentum of your legs dropping., As you get more comfortable, you can increase to 3 sets of 20 hanging leg lifts.









The hanging variation of the leg lift exercise is better for people with back problems because it does not put the same amount of pressure on your back as it does when you do them lying down.

, If these legs lifts are too challenging, you can raise your legs with bent knees instead. For this variation of the exercise, bend your knees and keep your legs together while raising your knees as high as they can go, nearly up to your chest. Then, lower your legs and start again. This exercise is a bit less strenuous for the abdominal muscles.

Start with lunges.,
Progress to jump lunges.,
Try single-leg glute bridges.,
Add squat thrusts and mountain climbers for aerobic exercise.,
Run or sprint.",How to Do Single Leg Exercises1," Lunges are perhaps the most basic single-leg exercise you can do, and you can do them anywhere without any fancy equipment. For those reasons, they're a good place to start your single-leg training.From a standing position, step one leg forward. As you step forward, lower your hips until both knees are at a 90-degree angle.
If you've not done lunges before, it may help to start in front of a mirror so you can make sure your form is correct. Your front knee should be directly above your ankle with your lower leg straight up and your thigh flat. The knee of the leg behind you shouldn't touch the floor.
Push back up, keeping your weight in your heels as you return to your starting position. Do this 10 times to make a set. If you do multiple sets, make sure you include a rest in between.
You also can do reverse lunges, in which you step backwards instead of forward.;
, If you've mastered lunges, jump lunges make the exercise more difficult while also adding an aerobic element. Like regular lunges, you can do jump lunges anywhere without weights or additional equipment.To do a jump lunge, start in the same position you would if you were doing regular lunges.
Lower yourself into the squatting position, then jump. As you jump into the air, switch your legs.
When you land, you want to land with your knees bent at 90 degrees, as when you've completed a stationary lunge.
Repeat 10 to 20 times before switching legs.

, This exercise works out your gluteal muscles and hamstrings, which are often neglected in other workouts. The single-leg glute bridge technically is an advanced form of the regular glute bridge, so attempt with caution if you're a beginner.To do a regular glute bridge, lie on your back on the floor with your arms out to either side for stability and your feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle. Slowly raise your hips off the floor until you've created a straight, flat bridge from your knees to your shoulders. Release to the floor, then repeat.
With a single-leg glute bridge, you're going to do a regular glute bridge, except with your hips raised you want to lift one foot off the ground and extend your leg until it's straight. The effect is to create a longer bridge from that ankle all the way to your shoulder. Release to the floor, then repeat.
As with many of the other single-leg exercises, you can do sets of 20 in which you alternate legs, or you can do a straight set of 10 reps that focuses on one leg, then do another set using the other leg.

, When you're building your single-leg exercise routine, interspersing lunges with squat thrusts and mountain climbers give the workout an interval-training quality.To do mountain climbers, start in a push-up position with your body forming a straight line from your shoulders to your heels. Lift one foot off the floor and raise it slowly until your knee is as close to your chest as possible. Then return to the starting position.
A squat thrust is much like a Burpee, and combines a squat with a push-up. To do this move, lower yourself down in to a deep squat, bring your hands to the floor, jump your legs backwards into a push up position, lower your chest to floor, push yourself up, step your legs back in towards your chest, bring your hands off the floor, squat, and stand up straight. You can do these in between other exercises, or use 10 or 20 quick reps as a good whole-body warm-up before you start your workout.
Alternate these exercises with either leg, doing sets of 20 reps (10 with each leg), or do 10-rep sets that focus on one leg only, and then follow up with the other leg.

, When you run, one leg is off the ground as the other does the work to propel you forward. For this reason, running and sprinting technically are single-leg exercises – even though both legs do eventually come into play.To have running work as a single-leg exercise, focus on short sprints rather than jogging for longer distances.
You can incorporate brief sprints into your overall workout as aerobic intervals between strength-training exercises such as lunges.

Talk to your doctor.,
Hold a hip bridge.,
Do jack splits.,
Do scissor legs.,
Try side-lying double leg lifts.",How to Do Leg Exercises1," Before beginning a new exercise program, you should consult your doctor and ensure your exercise plan meets their approval. If you have any concerns, previous health conditions or past injuries, you should also discuss these with your doctor. Leg exercises in which you are lying down are often good options if you have joint or spine problems that prevent you supporting your own body weight (e.g. hip or knee replacement), or if you are unable to do high-impact activity.;
, A hip bridge is a great exercise for strengthening your upper legs while protecting your joints, since you remain lying on the ground. This move will mainly target your glutes and upper thighs. A hip bridge can also be done as a warm up or cool down stretch before and after high-impact exercise.Lie down on your back with your knees bent and facing upward.
Plant your heels into the floor and lift your toes towards your shins.
Lift your bum off the floor until there is a straight line from your knees to your shoulders.
Hold the hip bridge for two to five seconds and then lower.
Repeat this exercise 15 times.
There are variations of the hip bridge you can try such as raising one leg at a time while in the bridge position.

, This exercise strengthens your legs as well as your abs and chest.Lie on your back with your legs out straight.
Raise your arms straight out above your head and interlock your thumbs together.
Lift your upper body off the floor and reach forward with your arms.
At the same time, raise your legs off the floor in a V-shape, spreading your feet out wider than your hips. Your arms should go through the V and only your bum should be touching the floor.
Slowly lower back to the starting position.
Repeat the jack split 20 times.

, This exercise works your legs as well as your abs while allowing you to keep your upper body on the floor. By resting your arms and chest, you can focus your strengthening efforts on just your lower body.Lie on your back with your hands placed under your hips and your palms facing down towards the floor.
Straighten your legs and point your toes.
Lift your legs up in the air until they form a right angle with your upper body. Your legs should be completely vertical.
Slowly lower your right leg down towards the floor while keeping your left leg up in the air. Don’t allow your right leg to touch the ground; it should only hover near the floor.
Bring your right leg back up to the vertical position.
Slowly lower your left leg towards the floor this time. This completes one rep.
Do 20 reps of this exercise.

, his challenging move will target your inner thighs and obliques while you lie on your side.Because the exercise is challenging, complete the steps to the best of your ability. Take your time to ensure you are using the right form and targeting the correct muscles.


Lie on your right side, keeping your body in a straight line. Support your head and neck by bending your right arm at the elbow and resting your head on your hand. Support your chest by placing your left hand on the ground in front of you.
Stack your legs, with your left leg resting on top of the right, your toes pointed straight.
Pull your abs in toward your spine, squeeze your inner thighs together, and raise your right leg. This will also lift your left leg, which is resting on top and acting as resistance.
Keeping your legs together, lift as high as you can. Hold for one to two seconds, then lower.
Repeat 20 to 30 times on your right side and then switch to your left side and repeat another 20 to 30 times.

Use a stability ball or BOSU balance trainer.,
Work with a box or step-up board.,
Stand on a platform.,
Do reverse lunges on a slide board.,
Jump rope on one leg.",How to Do Single Leg Exercises2," A stability ball or BOSU balance trainer (which is basically half a stability ball with a flat base) can increase the level of difficulty of your single-leg exercises by adding a balance element.For example, putting one foot on top of the round side of a BOSU balance trainer will increase the difficulty of a single-leg glute bridge. Your muscles are forced to work harder because the angle is much steeper than it would be if your foot was on the floor.
Stand on the flat side of a BOSU balance trainer to add a balance element to single-leg squats.

, You can incorporate boxes or step-up boards into virtually any exercise. When you increase the height, you increase the difficulty of the exercise and target your muscles more efficiently.For example, you can do single-leg box jumps using a box or step-up board that's shin- or knee-high. Keep in mind that the higher the box, the more difficult the exercise. Balance on one leg, squat slightly, then jump onto the board in a partial squat position. Step back down to the floor and repeat. Do 10 reps per set, with two to three sets for each leg.
Step-ups and calf raises are other exercises you can do with a box or step-up board. If you don't have this equipment, you can also use stairs to do the same exercises. However, avoid doing jumping exercises on stairs as this could lead to injury.
With any of these exercises, you can add dumbbells or ankle weights to increase resistance.

, When you start a single-leg exercise while standing on a raised platform, you're working ""from a deficit."" It increases the range of motion, meaning it takes more effort to get up to the platform level than it does to complete the exercise on flat ground.You can do any of the basic single-leg exercises, including lunges, from a deficit. Keep your weight-bearing leg on the platform.
Do 10 to 20 repetitions in a set, alternating legs after each completed movement.
Increase resistance and difficulty by adding resistance with barbells or dumbbells.

, The slide board helps you do your single-leg exercises correctly by ensuring that the leg you're not using provides as little assistance as possible to your weight-bearing leg during the exercise.To complete this exercise, start in front of the slide board facing forward with the board behind you. Your weight-bearing leg should be off the board.
Then slide your other leg back. Keep going until your knee is almost touching the floor. Use your hips and the quadriceps of your weight-bearing leg to bring the other leg back up to the starting position.
Don't over-extend your leg, or push your knee forward over your toe while doing this exercise.
Do 10 to 15 repetitions to make one set, then switch legs. You should do two or three sets with each leg.

, Jumping rope is a simple and versatile move you can do that combines conditioning and aerobic exercise. All you need is a jump rope of appropriate length and enough space to use it.Jumping rope can be done in 30-second intervals in between your other exercises to transition from one strength-training exercise to another.

Do lunges with barbells or dumbbells.,
Use Bulgarian split squats to improve hip strength and stability.,
Try one-leg Romanian deadlifts with barbells or dumbbells.",How to Do Single Leg Exercises3," Adding barbells or dumbbells will increase the weight resistance and build the strength in your leg muscles by making the lunge more difficult. This also works out your core and upper body, although your legs are doing most of the work.If you're using a barbell, use an overhand grip on the barbell as you complete your lunges. With dumbbells, you can hold them up in front of you or straight down at your sides.
To add upper-body exercise to your lunges, do curls with the dumbbell in conjunction with your lunges. When you're in lunge position with your knees at 90 degrees, do the curl and release the dumbbell to your side. Then move forward from that position with the dumbbell by your side.

, With a Bulgarian split squat (or supported single leg squat), you'll need a barbell or dumbbells. Elevate one leg and squat with the other leg. Barbells provide more stability than dumbbells, and you can use the weight bench to elevate the leg you're not using.Complete 10 to 20 reps with one leg before switching to the other leg. Incorporate this move into your workout by doing between one and three sets with each leg.

, Romanian deadlifts (RDLs) are more advanced strength-training exercise favored by weightlifters and body builders. Attempt this exercise with caution. Make sure you have mastered the deadlift and single leg deadlift first before you try this exercise. If you are a strength-training novice, it's a good idea to have an experienced weightlifter or certified trainer with you.If you don’t feel comfortable doing this exercise, then you can try doing weighted bridge instead.

RDLs with barbells create additional weight-shifting that you must control due to the width of the barbell. This makes barbell RDLs more challenging than doing the same motion with a single dumbbell.
Stand tall on one leg, holding your barbell or dumbbells with an overhand grip. Bend your non-weight-bearing leg slightly and raise it behind you as you lean forward at the hips.
Think of your torso and legs like a hinge that you are closing. Lower your torso to the ground, letting that rear leg hang in the air behind you with your arms forward in front of your weight-bearing leg. Then slowly raise back up, squeezing your glutes as you do.
Do 10 reps with one leg, then take 30 seconds rest before switching to your other leg. This is not an exercise that you need to do alternating immediately from one leg to the other.
Keep your back flat and straight throughout the exercise, and don't move the weight too far out in front of you.

Draw your abdomen in towards your spine to engage your muscles as you do this exercise., Whichever leg you are not working will be in front. With the thigh extending straight from the hip, bend the knee at a 90 degree angle. The front thigh should be extended straight from your hip. It needs to rest completely against the floor., The back leg will be the one that is lifted. Pull back the leg behind your hip and bend it. The back knee must stay behind your hip at all times. Resist bringing it forward to be parallel with your hip.When you are in position, your legs should be almost in the splits.

Find a sturdy wall in your home or gym to do wall squats.,
Stand away from the wall to begin calf raises.,
Stand with your feet hip-width apart to do a lunge.",How to Do a Leg Workout Routine1," Lean your back, butt, shoulders and head against the wall, and move your feet forward approximately 1.5 feet (46 cm). With your knees hip-width apart, bend your knees and lower yourself until you are in a chair-like position.


If you are just beginning to exercise, then hold the position for 3 seconds and slowly rise up again until your legs are straight. Do 2 sets of 10 repetitions. If you are more experienced, hold it for 10 seconds and do 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. For an extra challenge, hold the seated position for 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
Make sure your knees never go over your toes, when you are in the seated squat position. If they do, then move your feet further away from the wall.;
, Slowly raise yourself up onto your toes and pause for 1 breath. Slowly lower yourself down onto your heels.


Feel free to use a wall for extra stability. This exercise tones the calves, but also helps your balance. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
Once this becomes easy, hold a 3 to 5 lb. (1.4 to 2.27 kg) weight in each hand. Keep your hands at your sides, close to your thighs. Then, do the same calf raise exercise.

, Place your hands on your hips, and step 1 leg forward. Lower your body and your back shin until it is almost parallel to the ground.


Hold the position for 3 seconds and then slowly rise up again. Do the same motion with the opposite leg. Do 2 sets of 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg.

Squat.,
Lunge.,
Jump.,
Do leg lifts.,
Do calf raises.",How to Do Leg Exercises2," Squats are a great exercise that not only target your legs but your entire body. Squats are often called the ""king of exercise"" because they target so many major muscle groups and are easy to do at home without equipment.Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart.
Bend slightly forward, hinging at the hips and keeping your upper body upright.
Keep your weight on your heels and dig your feet into the ground.
Lower your body as if you were going to sit on a chair. Make sure that your knees do not extend past your toes.
Pause when you get to a squatted position and then return to standing.
Repeat the squat exercise 20 times.
There are lots of variations to try once you’ve mastered the basic squat, such as a jump squat where you jump into the air from the squat position instead of simply standing upright.

, Lunges are a great exercise that target all parts of the leg. This is another exercise in which there are many variations.Stand with your feet hip-width apart.
Step forward with your right leg.
Lower your body until your left knee almost touches the floor and your right thigh is parallel with the floor. Keep your upper body upright — your torso should be in alignment with the back leg. The positioning of your upper body will effect whether you are mostly engaging your legs or your glutes.
Ensure that your right knee does not extend past your right toe. If you are unable to lunge low enough without your right knee extending past your right toe, take a larger step forward.
If you have the space for walking lunges, step forward with your left leg and repeat the lunging action. If you don’t have space, return to standing and then step forward with your left leg.
Repeat the lunge exercise 10 – 20 times per leg.
To mix it up, try the reverse lunge, in which you step backward instead of forward, or the side lunge, in which you lunge to the side.

, Jumping is a good way to strengthen your leg muscles and increase your cardio. Jumping can even be incorporated into squats and lunges to combine two exercises and make a bigger impact.Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart and toes facing forward.
Lower your body into a squat or seated position so that your your thighs are parallel with the ground.
With as much power as possible, jump as far forward as you can.
Resume the squat position and repeat the jump 20 to 30 times.
To get the best results and to get your heart pumping, repeat the next jump immediately after you conclude the last one.

, Also known as a single leg squat or a pistol squat, this exercise targets your quadricep muscles, the muscles on the front side of your thighs. This move does require some stability and balance, so ensure you hold your core tight to help you stay standing straight.Stand with your feet hip-width apart and toes facing forward.
Raise your right leg straight out with a pointed foot. Raise it to about the height of your left knee. Pointing your foot isolates your quads and intensifies the work for the front of your thigh.
Slowly bend and straighten your left knee so that your right leg is being raised and lowered in the air.
Bend and straighten your left knee 10 – 15 times and then switch so that your right leg is on the floor bending and straightening and your left leg is in the air. Repeat the exercise with your left leg in the air 10 – 15 times.

, This exercise can be done in many ways, with a machine, dumbbells, or just your own body weight.


Stand on the edge of a stair or step, with your heels hanging over the edge. The balls of your feet should be be solidly on the step. Make sure there's something nearby you can grab if you begin to lose your balance, such as a wall or hand-rail. If you're using a step-aerobics platform, place a chair in front of the step so you can grab onto the back to stabilize.
Lift your heels, shifting your weight to the balls of your feet. You should be standing on the tips of your toes.
Hold for two seconds, then slowly lower your heels, being careful to keep your balance.
Repeat 20 times. Do not bounce — move slowly through your full range of motion.
If you choose to add dumbbells, perform this exercise with your feet flat on the ground, not on the edge of a step. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and simply raise up on your toes, lifting your heels off the ground. Hold, then lower.

Do barbell squats.,
Do dumbbell lunges.,
Do leg curls on an exercise ball.,
Do an inner thigh squeeze with the exercise ball.,
Use gym machines to exercise your legs.,
Join a class or team.",How to Do Leg Exercises3," This intense squat targets your quadricep muscles located at the front of your thighs. Ensure you choose a barbell weight that is not too heavy or too light. If you’re doing 10 barbell squats and the exercise becomes challenging at the 7th, you are probably using a good weight. If it becomes challenging before that, lighten your weight, and if it isn’t challenging at all, increase your weight.Stand with your feet hip-width apart.
Support the barbell along your trapezoid shoulder and neck muscles behind your head. Firmly grasp the barbell with both hands.
Keep your chest up and head facing forward. Your upper body should remain upright throughout the barbell squat.
Lower your body by pushing your butt backwards, as though sitting in an imaginary chair. Keep your knees in line with your toes.
Once your thighs are parallel with the floor, pause and slowly straighten your legs, squeezing your glutes, to return to a standing position. Remember to keep your back straight throughout the exercise.
Remember that the weight you use and the number of reps you perform depends on your goals. If you wish to build strength and larger muscles, then you want to use heavier weights and fewer reps, working until muscle failure or exhaustion. If you don't want to bulk up, but are looking to tone and increase your endurance, then you want to use lighter weights and do more repetitions.

, Like regular lunges, dumbbell lunges are enhanced by adding the weight of the dumbbells and require more strength and stability. If you have problems with balance, use a lighter weight or skip the dumbbells all together and stick with regular lunges.Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart holding one dumbbell in each hand.
Step forward with your right leg.
Lower your body until your left knee almost touches the floor and your right thigh is parallel with the floor. Keep your upper body upright.
Ensure that your right knee does not extend past your right toe. If you are unable to lunge low enough without your right knee extending past your right toe, take a larger step forward.
Return to a standing position and step forward with your left leg repeating the lunge exercise on the other side.

, This exercise will work both your legs and abs. If you have an exercise or Swiss ball, you can use it in a lot of leg exercises and exercises that target other parts of the body. An exercise ball is a great versatile piece of equipment that you can even use as a chair at home.Lie on your back on the floor with the exercise ball underneath your calves.
Raise your hips into the air and keep your knees straight. Your body should form a straight line from ankles to shoulders.
Bend your knees while rolling the exercise ball towards your body. Continue to keep your hips elevated.
Roll the ball back out away from your body until your legs are straight again.

, Another great exercise you can do with a Swiss ball targets your inner thighs. Modify this exercise to accommodate your fitness level.


Place the ball between your knees and squeeze.
Repeat the squeeze, anywhere from 10 to 100 repetitions. You can also modify the length of time you squeeze the ball — try holding the squeeze for 15 seconds, or work up to a longer squeeze of a full minute.

, Many gyms will have machines dedicated to strengthening your legs with specific instructions for use pictured on the machine. If you are unsure which machines to use or how to use them, ask a gym employee.


Good machines to look out for include the leg press, leg curl, leg extension and thigh abductor/adductor.

, Classes at your gym, such as spin or yoga, and sports teams, like soccer or volleyball, are all great ways to exercise your legs while having fun. The movement you'll do during the class or sports game will work out the different muscles in your leg and increase your overall level of cardio.

Raise the back ankle.,
Lift your back leg.,
Stretch before switching legs.,
Repeat for each leg.",How to Do a Pretzel Lift2," To begin, start by lifting your ankle so that your heel is above your hip. Hold it for a few seconds before lowering the leg. Repeat a few times. As you do this, squeeze your thighs and glutes. “Pulse” these muscles by squeezing and releasing them in quick succession.If this part is difficult for you, you may want to practice it a bit more before progressing with the rest of the exercise. Do it for two minutes on either side a few times a week. When you are more comfortable with it, you can advance to the full lift.

, Lean forward and lightly rest on your fingertips. Lift the back leg just an inch or two off the ground. Start moving the leg up and down in this position; do not let it touch the ground. These movements are small, slow, and controlled.As you do this movement, the rest of your body should remain absolutely still. Keep your spine long and straight.


Do not let the back leg travel forward while doing this motion. The thigh and knee should remain behind the hip at all times.

, After about ten reps, you will want to switch legs. Before you do so, however, you should stretch the worked leg. This will relieve tension in that leg and help you transition safely to the other leg.You can return to a normal seated position, with your legs straight in front of you. Lean forward to touch your toes with both arms.
You can also do a side stretch, by keeping the front leg bent in front of your body. Stretch the worked leg out to the side, and lean over to touch your toes.

, You should try to do two sets of ten repetitions each for each leg.However, if you cannot do this many at first, try doing more sets with fewer reps, and rest for 10 to 15 seconds in between.

Press back to increase difficulty.",How to Do a Pretzel Lift3," Instead of lifting your whole leg, press your knee into the ground, and raise your ankle above your leg. Reach back and grab your ankle. Gently bring it forward until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. This can help open up your hips, and it will help you slowly build up strength to do the lifts., If you feel a cramp or pinching in your back during this exercise, you can relieve the tension by shifting your alignment. Place your hands in front of you. The hand opposite to the worked leg should be placed slightly farther out to the side. Lean to the opposite side of the worked leg, and continue the workout. As you get stronger, you can begin to lift yourself back to center., If you’re having difficulty raising or keeping your leg above the ground, lower yourself onto your elbows and forearms. You should still be leaning forward with your spine straight and your abs lifted., If you want to increase the difficulty of this move, you can press the leg back instead of up. While in pretzel form, lift the back leg, and instead of lifting it up, move it backwards slightly. You do not need to press back more than an inch or two."

Use lifting straps for the right exercises.,
Avoid using lifting straps for the wrong exercises.,
Select the right lifting straps.",How to Use Lifting Straps1," If you are looking to increase muscle size and strength in your upper back, trapezius, and hamstring muscles, lifting straps may be right for you. They allow you to lift more weight to work these muscles than your natural grip might allow. Specifically, they are good for the following exercises:Dumbbell or barbell rows
Shrugs
Deadlifts
Romanian deadlifts
Rack pulls;
, First, it is important to note that lifting straps are not allowed in power lifting competitions. If you are training to power lift, don't use straps all the time, because you need a strong natural grip.Make sure to do at least some reps with your natural grip, even if it means you can't lift as heavy a weight.
Additionally, these straps are only helpful for lifts in which gravity is working against your ability to hold on to the weight. Lifting straps do not aid in bench presses or similar exercises. Using them for these lifts may result in ridicule from other weight lifters., Lifting straps are sewn from heavy-duty cotton, nylon, or leather.The varying materials and styles of these straps provide different advantages to the lifter. Here are some guidelines in choosing straps.









Make sure they are well stitched and strong.
Cotton and nylon straps are firmer than leather straps and are less easily bent out of shape. Leather straps have a little more give. This makes them a better choice if you plan to wear them to clean, though many weightlifters don't believe straps should be used for this lift anyway.Nylon straps allow you to release the dumbbell the most quickly.Olympic/speed straps are shorter. These allow for easier and faster release of the barbell, but a less firm grip, because the strap wraps around the barbell fewer times.
Although you can buy padded straps, straps with hook-and-loop fasteners, and weightlifting gloves with straps or hooks built in, these don't offer much improvement in function or comfort and are more expensive. Further, hook straps don't fit all barbells and can negatively affect your technique for some lifts."

Do pull-ups.,
Do crunches.,
Do push-ups.,
Run or jog.,
Swim.,
Walk.,
Use a medicine ball.,
Dance to music.,
Do anything else that gets your heart pumping faster or you sweating.",How to Work out Without Weights," Pull-ups are a great way to build back strength. You just need a bar that is high enough. Alternate between close grip pull-ups (biceps) and wide grip pull-ups. (lats) Add an easy set of flyes or rows for high repetitions and a low weight such as a 12 oz bottle of cola, but omit this if you have swimming in your routine.;
, Crunches strengthen your abs. Find a friend to hold your feet, or stick your feet under your couch and do them. Alternatively, crunches are safer and more effective, but can be harder to do correctly.

, Push-ups help build your chest muscles.

, Running and jogging are great for your breathing, leg muscles, and arm muscles, and builds density in the lower bones. You will get in much better shape from running or jogging as well, if you are working out to lose weight. If you have trouble with pain in the side try breathing out when your left foot hits the ground.

, Swimming is great because water supports any weight and you can do a lot of exercise without becoming too warm.

, While it may not seem like much, walking can do wonders for your body. It's a very good place to start if you are starting a workout routine.

, Using a medicine ball can have many of the same benefits as lifting weights. Try one out. Consider this your lower back exercise. Use in place of a medicine ball a cloth sack, tote bag or backpack filled with household items.

, Just turn on the radio or stereo and start dancing. Or use your iPod/mp3 player. It doesn't have to be good dancing, just get your heart pumping!

, Anything that does either of these is working out.Also try to do wall pushups and lots of resistance training, which is use another person to push on your arms as you are trying to push them up or pull them over your head or push on your legs as you put them up. There are also leg lifts which you hold on to the persons legs and lift your feet and have the person shove them down. Make it so that your feet don't hit the ground. Do them in the direction of left, right, forward 15 reps each. This really helps with the bottom half of your six pack.

Jump rope for two to three minutes.,
Perform 50 jumping jacks.,
Do Lunges five times on each leg.,
Perform a minute of high knees and high lateral knees.,
Perform 10 to 20 pushups.,
Perform ten rocking ankle mobilizations.,
Talk to a personal trainer.",How to Warm up for Weight Lifting Exercises1," Jumping rope before you lift weights can increase your blood flow and prepares your heart and nervous system for physical activity. It's important that you don't jump rope for more than three minutes because you don't want to deplete your glycogen stores and reduce your energy before you lift.Find a space like on a padded floor to jump rope, so you don't but any unnecessary stress on your ankles.

A jump rope can often be purchased for under $5.
Get a jump rope that is nine feet or longer if you are over six feet tall.Jumping rope will loosen up your muscles and increase your blood flow.;
, Jumping jacks work out your legs, core, and heart. Start by standing with your feet together, hands by your side. Jump while pushing your feet apart and bringing your hands together straight over your head. Return to the start position by jumping.Continue to do this 50 times or enough times to build a sweat but not get fatigued.

If you tire yourself out too much before having to lift, lactic acid will build up in your muscles and make your weight lifting routine less efficient.You don't want to tire yourself out before you start to lift, so if 50 jumping jacks get you tired, consider reducing the amount.

, Lunges help stretch out your hip flexors and activate your legs, glutes, and hip muscles.To perform a lunge, step forward with one leg and lower your hips until both legs are bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep your back straight and shoulders back. Your front knee should be above your ankle, and not pushed out too far, and your back knee should not be touching the ground. Come back to a standing position and alternate with each leg.Twisting your hips at the end of a lunge can also help stretch your upper and middle back.
Lunges are great when you are warming up for exercises like the deadlift.

, High knees will improve flexibility and power in lower parts of your body like your hips and legs. To do high knees, start in the standing position and lift and bend your leg to your hip, then return to the standing position. Alternate legs and pump your arms while you perform the exercise.

This warm up will prepare you for exercises like squats or the leg press.
High knees and lateral knees work out your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and abductors., Pushups warm up your chest, shoulders, and triceps. To do a push up, place your hands flat on the ground, directly under your shoulders. Flatten your back so that your weight is centralized on glutes and hamstrings. Lower your body by lowering your shoulders and tucking your arms into your body. Push back up and repeat the steps.A standard pushup uses 50%-60% of your body weight as resistance.
Pushups are great warm ups for upper body exercises like the benchpress or curls.

, Protecting your ankles is necessary for leg exercises and standing lifts, such as the deadlift. To carry out a rocking ankle mobilization, start in a push-up position. Push your hips up higher above your torso so that your body looks pitched. Place one foot planted on the ground while resting your other foot on the planted foot's ankle. Rock back and forth so that your heel touches the floor then lifts off of it. Switch legs and repeat the process.You may have to perform more reps if one ankle is tighter than the other.
It's important to have stable ankles for exercises like the leg press and deadlift.

, Hundreds of other exercises exist and can help aid you in your weight training and help prevent potential injury. A personal trainer can help you target the parts of your body that you want to develop. They may also be able to assist you in other things like your diet.

Other popular weight training exercises used to warm up include foam roll exercises, leg swings, spiderman steps, and hip extensions."

Get into position.,
Get ready to lift.,
Execute a row.,
Finish your row.",How to Perform Bent over Rows1," Set the barbell on the ground. Stand so that your shins (not your toes) are about six to ten inches (15 to 25 cm) away from it. Set both feet directly below their corresponding shoulders.Bend your knees a little bit.As you do, make sure your shins remain perpendicular to the floor. Now bend over from your waist until your upper torso is more or less parallel with the ground.


Keep your chest up as you bend over, so that your back is as straight as it should be when standing upright with good posture.;
, Squat until your hands are able to reach the barbell.Take hold of it with an overhand grip (also known as “pronated”), so that your palms face downward toward the floor or inward toward you.Spread your hands apart so they are a just a tad wider than your shoulders. Now straighten your hips and knees, lifting with your legs, until they are back in your starting position.


Keep your arms straight held straight down as you rise.

, First, draw in a breath. Then, without moving your legs or upper body out of position, pull the barbell with your forearms toward your lower chest. Exhale as you do so. As you lift, bring your elbows up and behind your torso, rather than sticking them out to your sides like wings. When the barbell reaches your torso, use the muscles in your shoulder blades to finish drawing it up the rest of the way., Continue holding the barbell to your chest for a second or two once you reach the top of your lift. Then draw in a breath and reverse the motion. Carefully lower the weight back to your starting position (not the floor).Don’t hand it over to gravity and let it drop. Use as much control over the lowering of the barbell as you used when raising it.

If using loop straps, thread the ends of the straps through the loops.,
Put the straps on.,
Wrap the ends of the strap around the bar (or bars) holding the weight.,
Place your hands over the straps.",How to Use Lifting Straps2," This will form a circle at one end of the strap. If using another type of strap (e.g. hook-and-loop straps or Olympic straps), skip this step.








, Slide your hands through the circles or attach the straps with the hook-and-loop fasteners so the end of the straps hang down along your fingers. Pull on the ends of the straps or adjust the fasteners until the straps fit snugly around your wrists.







, Start by going under the bar from back to front, and then wrapping the strap over the top and under again. Wrap the strap completely around the bar.








Some weight trainers prefer to wrap the straps in a figure-8 configuration. This can lead to a better grip on the barbell, but some people complain that after many reps, it can make the bar less comfortable to hold on to or even lead to friction burns.

, Close your palm and fingers over the area where the straps are wrapped around the barbell. This is what holds them in place. When you let go, they should slide off easily.If you're uncomfortable, re-wrap the straps to tighten or loosen as necessary.








"
"
Roll the bar toward you.,
Lift the weight.,
Strengthen on your grip.",How to Use Lifting Straps3," Rolling the bar will tighten the strap. Do this until the straps pull on your wrists. Do not start lifting before the straps are tight--you will not get the full benefit of using lifting straps and may increase the risk of injury.







, Take care not to force your wrists to hold the entire weight as you lift. The lifting straps should let your wrists assist you in maintaining your grip on the bar, not do all the work.









You can injure your wrists by relying too heavily on them to lift the weight, so use your grip as well., Use a hand grips, squeeze the barbell during reps, do fist or fingertip push-ups, climb ropes, or hang from the pull-up bar to strengthen your grip so you don't have to rely too much on your lifting straps.








Lifting straps often cause weight trainers to ignore the need to strengthen their grips. This can be a real problem, especially if you compete in a sport that doesn't allow you to use straps.

Lift 70% -75% of your workout weight five times.,
Lift 80% 85% of your workout weight three times.,
Lift your workout weight once.,
Determine your one rep max.",How to Warm up for Weight Lifting Exercises2," Resting in between sets will allow your body to adjust and decrease the amount of fatigue that you'll feel. It's important that you keep up a decent tempo, but that you also don't tire yourself out. Test out different times and determine the right amount of time for your workout.On your last lift, you should give yourself an adequate cool down period of a minute or two before starting your actual routine.

, Determine the type of routine or muscles that you are going to work out and do a very light warm up of those muscle groups by performing the exercise at a light weight. For example, if you are going to use a bench press, use the bar to warm up. Do not start off a high rate or repetitions that exceed eight or you may tire yourself out before you can start your real weight routine.The only exception to this rule is if you are performing deadlifts. At many gyms, you'll need to use at least 45 lbs (20.41 kg) on each side to begin the lift at the right height.If you are using barbells, use a low weight like 10 lbs (4.5 kgs) to start., At this point, your workout should still be somewhat explosive with the lower weight.Increasing the amount of weight and decreasing the number of reps is known as ""ramping up."" Doing so will allow your nervous system and your muscles to adjust before you begin your actual workout.

Ramping up also increases the range of motion of your muscles and joints and can decrease the chance of injury.Exercises  like the kettle ball swing, seated box jumps, and medicine ball reactive throws can help with your explosiveness., Continue to increase the amount of weight onto your bar. Remember that at this point you should not be tired because these are just the warm up lifts. If you do find your muscles to be excessively tired, consider reducing the weight for your warm up routine., Once you get to your fourth set, you should start to lift with a moderate tempo. Typically, the lighter the load, the quicker your pace needs to be for your lifts to be effective in warming you up., Once you do this, you've finished your warm up routine and can start working with your actual weight. Make sure that you don't feel fatigued or tired. The point of the warm up is to acclimate your body to lifting so that you can lift heavier weight for a longer period of time during your actual warm up., Figuring out your one rep max will help you ramp up because you'll be able to calculate how much weight you should lift during a warm up. To determine your one rep max, divide the max weight you can lift by the number of reps you can do as a percent. For instance, if you can lift 250 lbs (113.39 kg) for eight reps, then you divide 250 (113.39 kg) by .80 to get 312.5 (141.75 kg) one rep max. You can also determine your exact one rep max by using an online calculator and plugging in the amount of weight and reps you can usually do in a regular workout.

For example, if you can lift 150 lbs (68 kgs) 10 times, your one rep max would be 200 lbs (90.7 kgs).There are also apps available that can help you determine your one rep max."
"
Try a Pendlay row.,
Do a Yates row.,
Switch your grip.",How to Perform Bent over Rows2," Instead of holding the barbell just above the ground as your starting position, start with the barbell resting on the ground. Place your hands a few inches wider apart than you would with a standard row. Since your arms and back won’t be as active as they would be during the standard starting positioning, compensate with a more explosive lift. This will force the muscles along your spine to participate more than they do during a standard row.Set the barbell back on the ground to finish each lift. If you continue to hold it in the air between lifts, you’re back to doing standard rows.

, Keeping your back straight, squat to take hold of the barbell. Grip it with an underhand grip (also called “supinated”) so that your palms are facing upward or outward, with your hands placed a little wider apart than shoulder-width. Extend your legs until you are standing upright with your arms held straight down toward the floor. Bend your knees a little. Then bend forward from your waist, but only until your upper torso is at a roughly 70 degree angle toward the floor.Instead of rowing to your chest, lift the barbell to where your hips and lower torso form a crease
This technique utilizes your biceps more than standard rows do.

, Although the standard row is typically performed with an overhand grip, feel free to switch it up. Use an underhand grip instead to utilize more of your lats and biceps when executing standard or Pendlay rows. Also favor the underhand grip if you tend to feel sharp discomfort in your shoulders during overhand rows."
"
Use a hex bar instead of a standard barbell.,
Strengthen your grip.,
Mind your back.,
Find a trainer.,
Start small.,
Warm up first.,
Get a physical.",How to Perform Bent over Rows3," A standard barbell is just a straight bar, while a hex bar is shaped like a hexagon, allowing you to step inside of the hex shape. If you are new to weightlifting, opt for the hex bar if possible. Stand directly between the hex bar’s weights to keep their combined weight aligned with your body. Treat yourself to an easier lift that feels less cumbersome than the standard barbell., Be aware that your grip on the barbell is just as important as the rest of your body’s ability to lift them. Expect the Pendlay and Yates rows to tire your hands out even more than standard rows.Avoid the injuries that might come from losing your hold. Develop a more powerful grip with longer endurance by buying a pair of grippers. Squeeze them repeatedly, an equal number of times per hand, during your off time.Remember: just because your back and arms crave more rows doesn’t mean your hands are fit enough to keep going.

, Keep your spine and neck relaxed before, during, and after each row.At the same time, pay close attention to your form so you don’t end up slouching.As you perform each row, ignore your arms and concentrate instead on how your back is reacting. Do not attempt bentover rows if you are having any issues with your back.

, Learn how to lift weights properly from a professional whose business is to know. Rely on their expertise to learn how to adopt the right stance, breathing, and lifting techniques. Although advice from your acquaintances may in fact be correct, take what they have to say with a grain of salt, since they may have adopted bad advice as wisdom from an unreliable source somewhere along the way.Allow your trainer to help you devise a program with specific aims, especially if they determine that you need to concentrate on other exercises before you’re ready to do bent-over rows.
If you decide against a trainer, always have a spotter on hand in case you have trouble or injure yourself.

, Don’t attempt to lift more than you’re able to. Use light weights in the beginning, or even just the barbell without any added weight at all. Concentrate first on adopting the proper form for bent-over rows (or any other lift) before worrying about how much weight you can lift., Go for a walk, take a jog, or do some calisthenics for five to ten minutes.Get the blood flowing so you are nice and limber for your lift. When you’re done, start your workout by using less weight than normal for each type of lift. Give your body a chance to warm up to it before challenging yourself with more weight.Don’t forget to cool down afterwards. Spend another five to ten minutes stretching after each workout.

, Before starting a new weight-lifting routine, visit your doctor. Ask for a physical and alert them to your plans. Find out if your body has any issues that may lead to injuries, or if your doctor advices easing into weight-lifting through any other form of exercise.

Make dumbbells from plastic water bottles.,
Make arm weights with water bottles.,
Make a weighted medicine ball from a basketball.,
Make wrist weights from socks.,
Use packets of rice or beans.,
Cut bicycle tire tubes into hand weights.,
Make a weighted vest.,
Use paint cans.",How to Make a Homemade Weight Set1," Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug with water, sand, rocks, or concrete. Make sure that the jug has a handle; you will use this to complete your exercise reps. Use the handles to lift and lower the jug like you would any hand weight or dumbbell.With milk jug hand weights, you can do bicep curls, tricep exercises, and shoulder raises.;
, Canned goods that fit into your hands work well as simple hand weights. This is especially good if you are starting out and trying to build muscles slowly. Use larger canned goods as heavier weights or medicine balls.

, Instead of recycling your plastic water and soda bottles, refill them with water, or put pebbles or sand in them instead. When filling them, make sure to weigh them so the weights are the same for both hands. Lift the bottles like you would any dumbbell., Instead of using the water bottles for hand weights, this method attaches multiple bottles to your arms like wrist weights. Before you put them on your arms, fill them with sand. For heavier weights, add water after you fill them completely with sand.


When they are filled, scotch tape the plastic bottles all the way around your forearm. The tape does not touch your skin; it only touches the bottles to hold them together. You can also use duct tape, just don't attach it to your skin. Place the bottles just tight enough so they do not slide off your arms.

, Take an old basketball and drill a hole into one of the black stripes. The hole should be big enough to funnel in the weighted material. Place a funnel in the hole and fill with sand or pebbles until you have achieved the desired weight. Use a bike tire patch kit to fill the hole. You can also use duct tape if you don't have a tire patch kit.The repurposed ball can now be used just like a medicine ball.

, Fill a clean sock with dry beans. Alternately, use pebbles or small craft rocks for a heavier weight. Sew or glue the open end of the sock closed. Then, sew the ends together, or sew Velcro onto the ends so you can remove it easily.


Use a scale to adjust the weight. Fill the sock as full as you want based on weight and then cut the excess fabric. If you want to make heavier weights but the inside material won't fit, use a larger sock.
When choosing a sock, make sure to choose one long enough to wrap around your waist. If the sock is too long, fill it until it will wrap around your wrist, then cut the excess fabric before closing the end.

, These packages are great for mini-weights if you are a beginner. You can use them right from the cabinet for bicep curls and other small weight-lifting moves.

, Take a bicycle inner tube and cut it into equal lengths. Secure one end of the tube with duct tape, then fill the tube with sand. Close the other end with duct tape. You can either leave them flat or bend them into circles until the two ends are touching and secure the ends together with duct tape.This is a great method for making weights of different sizes. Start with 1 or 3 pounds. You can also try 5 or even 8 pound weights. Use a scale to weight out the weights before you close them.

, Get a fishing vest or a vest with multiple small pockets. Fill plastic bags with sand or concrete and place in all the pockets. Run, do pull ups, push ups, or go walking while wearing the weighted vest., Hold paint cans in your hands by their handles. Most paint cans are a little heavier than plastic bottles or cans of food, so you can use them as you build muscle. The handles allow you to use the cans like dumbbells.


You can also try using paint cans as a kettlebell.

Use 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets.,
Make a barbell with water bottles.,
Find old tires lying around the yard.,
Build a slosh tube.,
Use a duffle bag to make a sandbag.",How to Make a Homemade Weight Set2," Fill a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with sand, rocks, concrete, or even water. Use it to do curls or attach two of them to a bar or board and use as a bench press.

, Take 2 packs of 6 bottles each and duct tape them symmetrically to an iron bar you can grip easily. This barbell will be good for any exercise you do with a barbell, like lifts and presses.


If these 2 packs are too much, don't use half filled bottles. Half-filled bottles will slosh around and shake the bar. Instead, tape individual filled bottles to the bar.
If 2 packs aren't enough, use four or six packs of bottles taped to the bar. Alternately, tape individual bottles to each end of the bar. First line them horizontally along the bar side by side, then stack them on top of each other. Make sure to leave plenty of room for your hands to grip the bar in wide and narrow grips.
The taping must be functional. Make horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rounds to wrap the packs to the bar.

, Tires are used in many workout and bodybuilding routines. You can add additional weights to regular tires when doing workouts, or you can go to a junkyard and find tractor tires. Flipping them and tying a rope to them to pull behind you are only two ways you can use a tire as a weight., Slosh tubes are long plastic tubes filled with about 40 pounds of water. But the workout benefits come from the uneven, sloshing water, which makes you use muscles as you try to keep the water balanced as it goes from one end of the tube to the other. You can make your own slosh tube with a PVC pipe. The pipe should be about 4 inches in diameter and 9-10 feet long. Place a cap on one end, then fill the pipe halfway with water. Cap the other end., Sandbags are similar to slosh tubes in that they are unstable, shifting weights that require you to engage more muscles. To make an easy sandbag, fill 5 or 6 gallon freezer bags with sand. You want the sandbag to be around 50 or 60 pounds. Double bag the bags so they don't break, and then tape the end. Place the bags into the duffle bag. Zip up the duffle bag, and you are ready to work out!An alternate way to make a sandbag is to use an old army/navy rucksack or canvas laundry bag. Use contractor garbage bags to fill with pea gravel. You can fill them with 10, 20, or 25 pounds. Fill 5 or 6 bags with gravel, and secure them with duct tape. Add them to the bag until your desired weight.Add and remove bags of sand or gravel for different weights. Use a scale to determine how heavy the bag is before you start working out, and add or remove weight accordingly. If you don't want to change the weight, you can add the sand or gravel directly into the bag. You cannot easily remove the weight or add weight if you do this.
Make sure to leave some room in the interior bags so the sand or gravel can move around.
If you are adding a large amount of weight, use a sturdier duffle bag.

Use a milk or juice jug.,
Use dumbbells and rope.,
Make a kettlebell out of a potato sack.,
Use PVC pipe and old basketballs to make a kettlebell.",How to Make a Homemade Weight Set3," Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug or 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle with water or sand. Make sure that the jug has a handle; this is needed to complete kettlebell exercises.

, Another technique for making homemade kettlebells is to wrap a rope around each end of the handle of a dumbbell. The thicker the rope, the more this will work your grip. Grab the rope in the middle so the dumbbell hangs below your hands evenly. Now you can do swings and presses and have the displaced weight effect of kettlebells. When you need to adjust the weight, simply use a different size dumbbell.


Be careful when swinging a dumbbell. It will swing and fly more than a traditional kettlebell. Be careful not to hit yourself with the dumbbell.

, Purchase a potato, rice, or sugar shipping sack, which can be found at most grocery stores. Fill the sack with sand until you have reached the desired weight. At the top of the sack, tie a loop for your hand. Use rope or duct tape to secure the loop so it doesn't detach. You can reinforce the sides and bottom of the bag with duct tape.You can use this method to make multiple kettlebells of different weights. Use a scale to measure out how many pounds you are putting into the sacks before tying the top of the sack.

, Buy a 1""x 24"" PVC pipe, secure one end with duct tape, and fill with sand. Secure the other end. Place the PVC pipe in the oven at 450 degrees for 10 minutes. You want the plastic to become pliable, not melt. You are going to shape the plastic into the kettlebell handle. Watch the pipe carefully.


Remove the pipe from the oven, and bend the pipe into a handle, bringing the two ends together. Tape the ends together. Dip the pipe in cold water to help set it.
Cut a slit into a basketball with the two handle holes at each end. Stick the handle inside the ball to make sure you have cut the holes wide or narrow enough for the handle to be at the height you desire.
Mix quick mix concrete in a separate container, then scoop the concrete into the ball. Add the handle towards the end. Let the concrete set for two or three days before using."

Do double-leg calf raises.,
Practice single-leg calf raises.,
Try to do donkey calf raises.,
Do box jumps.,
Jump rope.,
Exercise your front calf muscles.,
Create a calf workout schedule.",How to Build Calf Muscle Without Equipment1," This is a classic exercise for toning and strengthening the calf muscles. This workout utilizes your own body weight instead of a weight machine to help build muscle mass. It strengthens both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. To start off, you will need to stand near a wall to balance yourself, if needed, and your feet should be hip-width apart with your ankles, knees and hips vertically aligned.Push your body upward on the balls of both feet. Make sure that your abdominal muscles are engaged so that your back remains straight instead of shifted forward or backward.
For a more intense workout, you can place the balls of your feet on a step so that your heels are on the lower level. Push up with the balls of your feet to lift your heels as high as you can off the floor. Then, slowly lower your heels back down to the floor. Repeat.
Additionally, you can add weight to strengthen your calves further, such as holding milk jugs, cans, a heavy backpack or something else while you do the exercises.;
, The intensity of the calf raise exercise is enhanced when you do one leg at a time. This is because your full body weight must be lifted by one leg instead of two. Again, stand near a wall in case you need to balance yourself, and put your left leg behind you. Ensure that the ankle, knee and hip of the right leg are all aligned vertically.


Push your body upward on the ball of your right foot. Make sure that your abdominal muscles are engaged so that your back remains straight as you are lifted up.
For a more intense workout, you can place the ball of your right foot on a step so that your heel is on the lower level. Push up with the ball of your foot to lift your heel as high as you can off the floor. Bring your heel down.
Repeat with the left foot.
Additionally, you can add weight to strengthen your calves further, such as holding a milk jug, a can or two, a heavy backpack or something else while you perform the single-leg calf raise.
If you need to, hold something heavy with one hand and place the other hand on the wall to help balance you.It is important to work each leg equally to avoid one calf becoming thicker than the other.

, To do this exercise, you will need a bench or some other sturdy object and a partner--but no equipment is required. Bend over and grasp the sturdy object or bench with your hands. Your toes should be facing forward, and be sure not to lock your knees.Have your partner climb onto your lower back near your tailbone. The heavier the person, the harder the workout.
Raise your heels off the floor by pushing up on the balls of your feet. Pause, then lower your heels back to the floor, and repeat.
You can add more weight by having your partner hold something heavy like a backpack or milk jug while you do the exercise.

, Box jumps can strengthen your calf muscles and make them more powerful. When you practice this exercise regularly, your muscles are trained to react and contract quickly. This not only builds muscle but allows you to jump and spring in different directions much more quickly.


Get a box that is high enough for you to get a workout but not so high that you might strain or hurt yourself. You may need to build up from a lower level box to a higher level one over time.
Stand in front of the box. Use the balls of your feet to jump onto the box, landing on the balls and toes of your feet. Jump back down to the floor, and repeat.
Do this 8 -10 times per set. As with calf raises, the more often you do this, the easier it will become. At that point, it will be necessary to challenge yourself with more reps.
It isn’t a good idea to hold weights or anything else when you do box jumps so you can still catch yourself if you fall.

, When you use a jump rope, your calf is constantly engaged. This helps build muscle, provides a good cardiovascular workout and makes you quicker on your feet as well. Do this exercise regularly, and see why you don’t need weight equipment to tone your calf muscles.To jump rope effectively, hold your hands out to your sides, and make small, fast circles with your wrists to spin the rope. Jump an inch or so off the ground over the rope as it moves under your feet.
Jump rope at least 3 times a week. Start out doing just 1 set for 2 minutes and then advance to several sets.You should strive for 15 minutes per session at minimum. If you don’t have a jump rope or find this activity difficult, run on your toes in the same spot instead.

, It is also important to exercise the tibialis anterior, the muscle that runs along the outer front of your calf and alongside the shin. To exercise this muscle, try walking on your heels or simply standing on your heels and turning your toes up toward your shins., You will want to work your calves several times a week, giving them a rest between workout days to repair and build muscle. If you have not worked your calves before, follow a beginner's workout schedule. If you have been working on your calves for a while, consider an intermediate or advanced workout schedule.For a beginner's workout, do double-leg calf raises for 2 sets of 12 reps.
For an intermediate workout, do double-leg calf raises for 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps, then single-leg calf raises for 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps.
For an advanced workout, do box jumps for 1 set of 5 reps, then double-leg calf raises for 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps, then single-leg calf raises or jump squats for 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps.
You should feel a sore strain in your muscles when you finish your sets. That feeling is the feeling of your muscles tearing and newer, stronger and larger ones replacing them.
With every calf workout week, try doing a few sets more.

Do yoga.",How to Build Calf Muscle Without Equipment2," Calf muscles need to be stretched regularly to keep the muscle from becoming short and tight and restricting your movement. It is important to utilize stretching as a part of your calf building regiment after your workout. Breathe slowly in through your nose and out your mouth as you stretch.Hold your stretches for at least 20 seconds. As your calf muscles become more flexible, you will be able to hold stretches for longer. Aim to reach a single 60-second hold or 2–3 sets of 20 seconds each.

, Use the same step you use to workout your calves with or a curb works too. Put the ball of your foot on the higher step or ledge, and slowly lower your heel down to the lower level. You will feel it stretching your calf muscles as you try to touch your heel to the ground.


You may need to do this next to a wall or something else to balance yourself if needed.
Don’t force your heel all the way down if it hurts. It may take some time but you will be able to do this with practice., Sit down, and put your legs straight out in front of you, keeping your back straight. Wrap a towel around the ball of your right foot and hold each side of the towel with one hand. Slowly lean back, and pull on the towel until you feel a slight burn in the calf muscle. Hold the stretch for 20 seconds, and switch feet.The towel pull stretch works best with bare feet.

, This is a commonly performed stretch that is great for your gastrocnemius muscle. To do the stretch, keep your back straight, and extend your arms. Place both palms against a wall or other sturdy object, while you extend your right leg behind you, heel pressed to the ground. Move your left leg into a forward lunge and, bending your elbows, slowly lean forward.To stretch the soleus muscle deeper in your calf, place your toe up against the wall with your heel on the ground. Lean into this with a bent knee so the top of your foot flexes toward you., Stand with legs straight and at hip-level. Bend forward at the waist so your fingers reach the floor. While touching the floor, move your hands slowly in front of your body, supporting more weight on your hands as you do so. Then move your hands back to your starting position.

, Sit down with your legs in front of you. Flex your toes toward you, then reach out and grasp the balls of your feet. Pull your toes toward you until you feel a slight burn in your calf. Hold for 30 seconds or up to 1 minute.

, The tibialis anterior is the muscle that runs along the outer front of your calf, alongside the shin. Try a couple simple techniques to stretch this muscle:

While seated on the floor, stretch your legs out in front of you and point your toes.
While seated in a chair, tuck your feet back under the chair and rest the tops of your feet on the floor, with your toes facing behind you.

, While yoga is most well-known for its relaxation and stretching benefits, it can also help build and tone muscles. One pose that is particularly effective at working out and stretching your calves at the same time is Downward-Facing Dog. While you don’t need any special equipment to do this pose, you will need a space with enough room to do it.


Get into a pushup position with both your hands and toes on the floor. Lift your hips, keeping your hands and toes on the ground, until your body is shaped like an upside-down “V”.
Hold this position for 2 seconds, while lowering your right heel onto the floor. Lift your right heel back up, and lower your left heel for 2 seconds.
Do 2 sets of 10 reps. Rest between each set for at least 30 seconds. As time goes on and you get better at doing this pose, you can increase the number of sets that you do and the length of time that you hold the pose."

Run, walk or hike.,
Participate in sports.,
Take an aerobics step or dance class.,
Swim.,
Cycle a lot.,
Maintain a healthy diet.",How to Build Calf Muscle Without Equipment3," These activities all require your calves to carry your body weight while doing a more intense activity for a longer period of time than you normally do. This is especially true of running and hiking uphill. Your calves have to work very hard to get your body over steep hills, so consider using uneven terrain to maximize your calf workout.You can use an elliptical to build your calf muscles and protect your joints at the same time. Many ellipticals have an incline feature that will work out your muscles further while still being comparatively low-impact.
If you do walk, run or hike on uneven ground, pay attention to your footing so you don't trip and hurt yourself.

, There are many activities that you can engage in regularly that are fun and will help you tone and build your calf muscles. Consider sports activities that require you to run, jump and push off of your calf muscles for quick acceleration or directional changes. These include soccer, basketball, tennis, kickboxing and other sports that mainly utilize your legs., Step and dance classes require you to use your calves a lot. When you move on or off a step, bend your knees or push off the balls of your feet, you will be working your calf muscles. Check online or in your local phone book for ballet, jazz, hip-hop or aerobic step classes near you., If you are recovering from an injury or cannot participate in high-impact activities because of certain medical conditions, consider swimming. When you swim, you use your leg muscles, including calf muscles. It is easy on the joints because there is no impact involved, and is a fairly safe way to make your calves stronger., Technically, a bicycle is a type of equipment--but it's one common to many households. If your climate and weather conditions permit, take your bike out for a spin. It's a great way to target the muscles in your calves. Another advantage of biking is that there are many ways to challenge yourself.


Switching gears can heighten the intensity of your bicycle workout as well as biking over hills and rougher surfaces like grass instead of pavement.

, Eating fruits and vegetables will give you the energy you need to workout hard. Protein filled foods such as beans, lentils, quinoa, eggs, white meat, white fish, nuts and cheese, as well as protein supplements that can be added to shakes, will help to increase your muscle growth. Don't forget to drink plenty of water.


If you are a man, eat at least 60 grams of protein every day, while women should get at least 50 grams.
Drinking plenty of fluids is essential to any workout. Drink at least 64 ounces of liquids a day, preferably water.

Short hip flexors and ankles that are compressed cause lower back pain and reduce leg strength. This is so important to all Equestrian Athletes, due to the Range of Movement needed about the ankle for rising or sitting trot, canter and for that matter every phase and transition.;
, This will lessen the compression in the joint.

,, The exercises are designed to be worked in the home environment but as with all things in life, you only get back what you put in. As the workouts are shorter, this enables the rider to make the most of the time allocated to their training session and psychologically it becomes both more manageable and achievable. This is in turn creates an increased feeling of self-control and the ability to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. ‘Sticking to it’ and not being distracted will yield phenomenal results.

Get to know basic knee anatomy.,
Be aware of common knee injuries.,
Understand how other parts of the leg affect the knees.,
Stretch your IT band.,
Do rehabilitative exercises after surgery.,
Work out your quadriceps.,
Strengthen your hamstrings.,
Exercise your hips and glutes.,

Be careful with jumping.,
Add anti-inflammatory foods to your diet.,
Make sure you get enough vitamin E. Vitamin E is believed to hinder enzymes that break down the cartilage in the joints.,
Eat more calcium.,
Stop doing activities that hurt.",How to Strengthen Your Knees," The knee is the largest joint in the body, and is made up of the lower end of the thigh bone (femur), the upper end of the shin bone (tibia), and the kneecap (patella). These bones are connected by ligaments and cartilage, including the meniscus, which cushions the area where the femur and tibia meet.


Degrees are used to measure the range of motion in your knees certain activities require. You need 65° range of motion to walk, 70° to pick up something from the floor, 85° to climb stairs, and 95° to sit and stand comfortably.;
, As one of the most heavily used joints in the body, the knee is subject to a range of injuries. The more you know, the better prepared you will be to avoid circumstances that lead to or exacerbate injuries.The iliotibial band, or IT band, is the area of thicker tissue that runs from the outside of the pelvis to the outside of the knee. The IT band helps to stabilize the knee during physical activity. It can become inflamed and painful when it is overused, leading to iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Runners, hikers, and other active people often experience this injury.
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is commonly torn during activities like running, jumping, and landing from a jump. Other ligaments may be torn as well.
The meniscus, which acts like a shock absorber to protect the knee joint from impact, can be easily torn during activities like twisting, pivoting, or decelerating.

, The knees are supported by the other muscles in the legs, especially quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Keeping these muscles strong is crucial to having strong knees and preventing injury.


Muscles like the quadriceps, hamstrings, hips, and glutes act as stabilizers for your knee. To help improve your stability, you should exercise and stretch these muscles., Spending some time stretching and warming up your IT band before diving into a strenuous activity is a good way to keep your knees strong.Stand with your left foot crossed over your right and stretch your arms above your head. Lean your upper body as far as you can to the left without bending your knees. Repeat with your right foot crossed over your left, leaning your upper body to the right.
Sit on the floor with your legs stretched in front of you. Cross one over the other and pull your knee as close as you can toward your chest, holding it in place for a few seconds. Repeat with your other leg.
Take a brisk walk before launching into a more complicated exercise to give your IT band a chance to loosen up.

, If you have had knee surgery or a knee replacement, you may need to do certain exercises and stretches to increase your range of motion. Follow your doctor's instructions on when to start stretching after surgery. Some general moves you can try include:

Seated knee flexion: Sit on a firm chair, and slide one foot back under the chair as far as you can. Your thighs should remain firm on the chair. Hold for five seconds before sliding back forward. Repeat with the other leg.
Seated knee kick: sit on a firm chair with your legs bent. Raise one leg slowly until it is completely straight. Hold for five seconds before lowering the leg. Repeat on the other side.
Straight leg raise: Lie down with one leg bent and the other straight against the ground. Raise the straight leg up slowly before lowering it back down. Repeat on each side ten times., The quadriceps are the muscles in the front of your thighs. Strong quadriceps will help improve strength and mobility in your legs. Try exercises that target these muscles.


Thigh squeezes may help those who have had long-term knee problems or knee surgery. Lie down with your legs straight. Squeeze the muscles at the front of your thigh, and hold it for five seconds before releasing. Make sure to do this with both legs.Do lunges to work on your quadriceps. Stand upright with your hands on your hips. Take a big step forward with your left foot, and lower your body toward the floor until your left leg is bent at a right angle. Your back knee will lower until it is nearly touching the floor. Repeat this exercise several times, then switch to the other side.
Low-impact exercise machines such as a stationary bike or elliptical machine can help you work out your quads with minimal or no impact. These are safer activities for someone who has arthritis or a previous knee surgery than running is., The hamstring is located at the back of the thigh. Doing hamstring stretches once a day and exercises twice or more a week can help relieve knee pain and improve mobility.

Touch your toes. Stand straight, and bend forward while keeping your spine straight and your abs contracted. Straighten back up. If you are having trouble reaching your toes or ankles, place a chair in front of you. Bend forward to try to touch the seat of the chair.Heel lifts might also help. Start by either standing feet parallel and facing forward. Lift your heel back to try to touch your buttocks.
Try donkey kicks. Stand behind a chair, and place your hands on the chair back. Raise one foot behind you, with the knee bent. Lower the foot back down to the ground. Repeat with both legs.
To do a bridge, lie down with your knees bent. Squeeze your glutes as you slowly lift your hips a few inches off of the ground. Hold for a second before slowly lowering yourself back down. This exercise will not only work your hamstrings but also your hips and glutes., The hip flexors and glutes are both involved in the movement and mobility of the leg. Keeping them strong can prevent putting too much strain on the knee. As a bonus, many exercises that work the hips and glutes also help the hamstrings.

Try a clamshell. Lie on your side with your knees bent. Lift the knee of your top leg, but keep your feet touching. Hold for a second before lowering. Repeat ten or twelve times before switching to the other leg.Squats with a short range of motion are good even for people with knee problems. Stand upright and simply squat to the ground, bending your knees and keeping your back upright. For a less strenuous version of this exercise, practice standing in front of a chair, sitting, and standing again.

, If your leg muscles aren’t strong, your knees won’t be either.


Yoga is a low-impact activity that tones your leg muscles.
Swimming is another great way to build leg and knee strength and flexibility because it is a no-impact activity.
Walking and biking keep your legs and knees in shape for more strenuous activities.

, Jumping exercises, such as jump rope, can help build the muscles in your leg, but if you do them improperly, it can injure your knees. If you do decide to jump, learn to do it properly. Landing on straight knees puts too much pressure on your joint, and can eventually lead to injury. For stronger knees, practice landing in a half-squat position with your knees bent and your shins vertical. If you cannot land with your shins vertical, then you may have alignment issues. Avoid jumping in this case., Joints become weakened and painful when they are inflamed, so adding foods that are known to be anti-inflammatory to your diet may help keep your knees strong. Fish, flax seeds, olive oil, avocados, and whole fruits and vegetables are said to have anti-inflammatory properties.

, Spinach, broccoli, peanuts, mango and kiwi are excellent sources of vitamin E. , Bone health is also important for knee strength, so take measures to prevent osteoporosis. Cow milk, yogurt, soy, cheese and goat milk are good sources are calcium. Leafy greens are also beneficial.

, If you experience a lot of knee pain doing certain activities, chances are you aren’t strengthening your knees by continuing. Try lower impact exercises for awhile to give your knees a rest. After a few months of focusing on leg muscle strength and flexibility, you may find you’re able to do your favorite activities without pain.

Load the bar.,
Step inside the bar.,
Grip the bar.",How to Use a Trap Bar for Deadlifts1," You can practice deadlifts with a trap bar without any weight on it to get a feel for the apparatus. Then, you can add light weight when you feel ready.If you’ve done other sorts of deadlifts before, you should know the mass you’re comfortable lifting. Standard size trap bars weigh 35 pounds, classic trap bars weigh 45 pounds, and XL trap bars weigh 55 pounds.If you’ve never done deadlifts of any sort before, start with a small amount of weight like, for instance, five pounds on the right and left side of the bar, or just lift the bar alone.Slowly add weight in small increments (five pounds, for instance).
When you are tired after lifting a given amount of weight 12 times, you are at your current maximum weight limit.;
, The trap derives its name from the fact that unlike a traditional barbell, using a trap bar for deadlifts requires you to step into the hexagonal or diamond-shaped space between the weights (thereby “trapping” you). Place your feet in a position equidistant from the front and back of the bar, as well as from the left and right edges of the bar., The trap bar has two handles attached to it, one on the left and one on the right. Using a trap bar for deadlifts requires grabbing these handles. Lower yourself into a squatting position and straighten your back. Check your posture in the mirror to be sure you are really straight-backed with no rounding of your spine anywhere. This requires flexing your core muscles. Keep your head forward and chest up.Use your right hand to grab the handle on your right and use your left hand to grab the handle on your left.Your palms should be positioned near and facing the sides of your calves.

"
"
Lift the trap bar.,
Perform one set of repetitions.,
Avoid quad dominance.,
Decide if you want to abandon regular deadlifts.",How to Use a Trap Bar for Deadlifts2," Stand up by pushing off the ground with your feet and straightening your legs. Push your hips forward slightly. Squeeze your gluteal muscles (the muscles in your hips and butt) and your abdominal muscles (the muscles of the stomach). Avoid rounding your back.To set the bar down again, lower yourself to the ground by bending at the knees and tilting forward slightly. When it is safely on the ground, release the trap bar and stand.

, While you may think you need to do multiple sets of a particular exercise to see results, a single set of 8 to 12 repetitions is sufficient to gain the benefits of a given exercise.Just make sure to be consistent and perform the set once or twice per week as part of your strength training regimen. Perform 8 to 12 trap bar deadlifts in a row, then move on to a different exercise., Quad dominance refers to the act of shifting your weight forward and using your quads – the muscles in your thighs – to lift the trap bar. To avoid quad dominance, keep your body in a proper deadlift position and move your hips from back to front as you lift. Do not bend your knees any deeper than necessary after you’ve gripped the trap bar.One way to troubleshoot your lifting technique is to lower the amount of weight you’re lifting. This alone might solve the problem. But if it’s a firmly-ingrained bad habit, you’ll need to practice lifting a lower amount of weight and then adding more weight over time once you’ve corrected your quad dominance.
You might also benefit from visiting your local gym and working with a professional trainer to show you how to perform a trap bar deadlift properly.

, If you have a history of back injuries or are concerned about injuring your back (especially your lower back), doing all your deadlifts with a trap bar is a good idea. But if you’re interested in using deadlifts to strengthen your back and hamstrings to their maximum, stick with the straight bar deadlift or use both the traditional and trap bar during deadlifts.If you wish to abandon the straight bar deadlift altogether, you can continue to build back and hamstring strength using other exercises like kettlebell swings, hip thrusts, and glute raises.

Add resistance to the trap bar.,
Perform a deficit deadlift.,
Try a semi-stiff leg deadlift.,
Try a bent-over trap bar row.,
Do a standing trap bar overhead press.",How to Use a Trap Bar for Deadlifts3," Loop one end of a stretch band around both the right and left ends of the trap bar. Connect the other end of the stretch bands to a heavy weight. Repeat on the other side of the trap bar, being careful to connect the stretch band to a weight of the same value as the one used to secure the stretch band on the opposite side. When you lift the trap bar again, it will be more difficult and require you to exert more force when lifting.After adding resistance to the trap bar, exercise extra caution during your descent. Carefully lower yourself back down, since the stretch bands attached to the trap bar that slow your upward movement will accelerate your downward motion.
A variation on this variation is to loop one end of the stretch band around the left arm of the trap bar and loop the other end beneath the trap bar and around its right arm. Step on the middle of the stretch band before beginning your deadlift., A deficit deadlift allows you to increase your range of muscular motion by increasing the height from which you begin the deadlift. Just place a step one to three inches (two to eight centimeters) tall beneath you before beginning the deadlift. From there, proceed as normal. The slight increase in your starting height will cause you to bend more than you typically would.Contract your core, tightening the muscles all around your back and waist, keeping the shoulders pulled back slightly by tightening the muscles between your shoulder blades.

, Also called the Romanian deadlift, in this variation, you will situate yourself inside the trap bar, then bend at the waist, leaning over to grip it instead of squatting. This lift makes the trap bar useful because you do not have to bend over as far and your hamstrings are not fully lengthened. This makes the move safer for you.


Squat to grab the handles of the bar and flex your core muscles tight.
Keeping your back straight, carefully straighten your legs, but do not lift the bar yet. Once your legs are straight, hinge at your hips and straighten your torso. The movement of this lift is all about hinging at your hips, so your back must be kept straight throughout the movement.This lift is not advisable for beginners and should only be attempted with the assistance of a personal trainer to ensure proper safe technique.

, In this exercise, you start in a high squat position, which is the same way you would start when performing a Romanian trap bar deadlift. However, instead of straightening your legs and standing up with the trap bar after gripping it, simply pull straight up with your arms. Bend slightly at the knees, keep your back in a straight horizontal position, and stick your butt out slightly after gripping the bar. Lift the bar straight up. When your arms reach a 90 degree angle, slowly lower the bar back down., In this variation, start with the trap bar in a racked position at about the level of your shoulders. Pass under the trap bar and grip the handles (which should be positioned beneath the trap bar). Move the trap bar away from the rack and extend your arms straight up, then bring them down slowly.If you have narrow shoulders, this exercise can be difficult because the handles on the bar dictate how wide your grip must be. Try dumbbells instead!

Do squats.,
Try squat jumps.,
Try the curtsy lunge.,
Do dumbbell lunges.,
Use resistance bands.,
Use the leg press machine at the gym.",How to Tone Your Thighs1," Squats are a great way to build lean muscle and tone your inner thighs. Keeping your feet shoulder width apart bend your knees to a 90 degree angle. You can do this up against a wall or not, and keep your shoulder blades and lower back pressed up against the wall. Stay in this position for one minute, take a 30-second break, and repeat. Do about ten reps a day. , Squat down, keeping your back as straight as possible and your eyes straight ahead. Touch the ground with your fingers. The lower you get the better, but don’t let your knees come in front of your feet. Now jump straight up, keeping your core centered beneath you. Do as many as you can, then take a one-minute break, then do three quarters of whatever number you just did. Do exercises like this three or four times a week if you can. , Lunges are great for your thighs and target the muscles directly. Step one leg back behind and across your backside, bending the front leg 90 degrees to lower yourself closer to the floor. Keep as much weight as possible on the front leg. Return to an upright position with your feet side by side. Repeat. Do this exercise on both sides., Lunges are a great way to build muscle and burn fat. Begin by standing with your feet shoulder width apart, with a 5-10 pound dumbbell in each hand. Step forward with one foot and make sure the front thigh is parallel with the ground. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Repeat with the other leg. Do about 20 lunges a day. This is an exercise that you can do at home if you have dumbbells available, or try it without dumbbells, which is still a really good body-weight exercise.


If lunging with dumbbells is too difficult, try doing them without weights.

, You can use resistance bands to tone your thighs as well. Try using resistance bands to make certain exercises hard, such as by doing leg extensions while sitting in a chair. You can loop the resistance band around the chair legs, and then loop the ends of the bands around your ankles and alternate extending your legs.

Try doing squats with a resistance band.

, You probably don’t have a leg press machine available at home, but you can usually find these at a gym. This machine is great for working on your thighs and butt. Sit in the chair and choose a comfortable weight. Starting with half your body weight isn’t too ambitious, and you can move the weight up if it feels too easy. Place your legs on the rack and start with your knees at a 90 degree angle, and your ankles lined up with your knees. Now push! This exercise will lead to great results. "

It will also help you shed fat which will make your thighs look even more toned. Running is good for your heart, your lungs, and even your brain. It’s a great habit to get into.


Remember that running can be stressful on your body, especially your knees and feet. Start slowly and try to run on softer surfaces whenever possible. If you haven’t run for years try going on a ten minute run at a comfortable pace. Don’t push yourself until you feel like you will collapse, otherwise you’ll never want to run again. Pay attention to your body.

, The great thing about taking a class is that you have a lot of other people to support and push you. It’s much easier to stay diligent if you are working out with a lot of other people. Kick boxing is a great way to target your thighs, and you can even approach the instructor and tell him or her about your goal.


Both Zumba and kickboxing are forms of cardio that will help burn fat and tone your thighs.

, If you have access to a pool, then swimming is a great option. Trimming down in general is a great way to make your muscles look more toned. Sometimes this can work even better than just targeting a specific muscle group. The great thing about swimming is that you will work out your thighs and get your cardio workout at the same time. If you think you could shed a few pounds this is a great option.

, If you go to the gym, spending about 60 to 90 minutes on the elliptical will help tone your thighs. The elliptical machine specifically targets your thighs even more than running does because of the motion of the machine.


The stair climber is also a great option.

, Bike riding provide a shockingly high caloric burn of about 500-600 calories an hour, making it one of the best exercise for reducing body fat. However, you will only burn this many calories if you work up a sweat and get your heart rate into the range of 70 to 85% of your maximum.

, Lay flat on your back with your legs on the floor. Put your arms out beside you on the floor. Bring your knee up to where the highest part of your profile is. Then, with your other leg, kick it as high as it will go. Return it to the floor. Do 60 of these kicks, then switch sides and do 60 more.

, Lie on your right side and place your left arm on the floor in front of you for support and balance. With your left leg, raise it at hip level. Pretend your leg is in a barrel and with your toes, lead the rest of your leg to trace the inside of the barrel. Do 60 circles and then switch and do 60 more.

, Rebounding uses a lot of calories and you have fun at the same time. It also exercises your muscles leading to a more toned appearance.

, Lunges are a great way to tone your legs. Try to include lunges into your strength training routine twice per week. To do a lunge:Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and take a big step forward.
As you step forward, bend your knees and lower yourself down until your front knee is at about a 90 degree angle.
Make sure that the knee of you front leg stays over your ankle.
Hold for a second and then step back into the starting position.
Repeat the exercise on your opposite side. Do three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions on each side.

, Squats will tone your buttocks and legs, so this is another great strength training exercise to include. Include squats into your strength training routine twice per week as well. To do a squat:Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder width apart.
Then, slowly lower your buttocks towards the ground as if you are going to sit down. Extend your arms out in front of you as you do this to help you balance. You can even place a chair behind you to help you practice.
Do not allow your knees to go past your toes as you do this exercise.
Hold for a few seconds when you reach the deepest squat you can comfortably achieve.
Then, slowly raise yourself back up.
Repeat the exercise 10 to 15 times and do three sets.

, Go to a public pool when it's not too crowded. If you are a newbie to swimming laps, start out small. As you get better, do more laps. Try to do this 1-2 times a week. Swimming helps you gain muscle and burn fat.

, While lying on a mat or bed, place the ball in front of you. Place your legs on top of the ball, lift your hips up, and slowly roll the ball in towards your hips. Do this until you can no longer go anymore and make sure your hips don't fall to the floor.

, Using an incline can build calf muscle. Keep the resistance low.

, Protein is filling and good for maintaining muscle tone. Make sure to include fish, chicken and turkey in your diet.

, Fruits and veggies provide you with dietary fiber, which can help reduce the amount of fat that your body stores.

, You should be drinking 8-10 glasses per day. Water not only helps flush out accumulated toxins in your body, but also keeps your skin hydrated, smooth and glowing in summer.

, Foods like cookies, ice cream, cake, and chocolate are not only full of empty calories that don't provide you with energy, but will simply store themselves in your legs.

, These types of foods prevent your skin from remaining hydrated. Examples include peanuts, potato chips, popcorn, and most microwaveable foods.

, The body converts fat into energy when it's exercising or low on food. Unfortunately, the body converts fat from wherever it wants, and not always where you want it to.


Spot-training, or working one area of your body at a time, has its advantages (toning) and disadvantages (frustration when fat doesn't magically disappear). Don't expect leg exercises to give you suddenly-skinny legs without seeing a reduction in your overall body fat levels.

, A lot of people who want to lose weight make this mistake. Their reasoning: Calories get stored as fat when the body doesn't use them; calories come from food; if I starve myself, I'll get fewer calories; if I get fewer calories, there will be less fat to store. This is a misconception.


What happens when a person starves him/herself? The body realizes it is getting less food, your metabolism slows down to save energy, and you start consuming lean tissue instead of fat reserves because the body wants to prepare itself for a while without food.
If you do manage to lose weight by starving yourself (you did it the hard, painful way!) your body will gain all the fat back as soon as you begin eating again, and you should eat again. Why is this? Because your metabolism is still hibernating, and it needs to be kick-started. How do you kickstart it? By eating the right types of foods in the first place.

, A lot of people with really good intentions and strong discipline quit just before they start to see results. They work like crazy for a month, don't see any results, and throw their hands up in the air in despair. Try to remember that slow and steady wins the race. It is reasonable to lose one to two pounds per week. At this pace, your muscles will begin to be visible at around eight weeks into your program. Go slow and try to embrace any changes you make as lifestyle changes.

, Some people have bigger legs because of genetics and you cannot change that. Whatever exercise, diet, or fad you do cannot change you because that's the way you were born. Instead of fighting the world and running after a fool's errand, accept who you are and embrace it. It sounds cheesy, but you'll be happier in the end. Anybody who genuinely cares about you won't care one bit if you have skinny legs or not.

Perform ankle turns.,
Perform an alphabet range of motion.,
Tap your toes.,
Roll your ankles.",How to Strengthen Your Ankles1," Ankle turns are one of the easiest exercises you can do to strengthen your ankles. While sitting on a chair, slide a jump rope or exercise band under one foot. Pull on the left side of the band or rope so that your ankle is pulled left. Then push against the force of the band and turn your ankle slightly to the right. Then reverse the motion so that you pull on the right side, pulling your ankle to the right as you push left.


You can repeat this multiple times for each foot.
Be careful not to pull too hard on the rope or band – if you do, you run the risk of pulling a muscle in your calf.
If you don’t have a jump rope or exercise band, you can use an old T-shirt.;
, Using your ankle, “write” the letters of the alphabet. While sitting down, cross your left leg over your right leg, resting the middle of your left calf on your right thigh. Using your big toe as a writing instrument and moving your foot from the ankle, trace the letters of the alphabet from A-Z.


Cross your right leg over your left and repeat “writing” the alphabet with your right ankle/big toe., Sit in a chair with your back straight and your heels on the floor. Keeping your heels on the floor, tap your toes up and down. You can exercise one ankle and then move to the other, or you can alternate feet with each tap.


Aim for one minute of continuous, steady tapping per ankle, increasing the time and speed of your tapping each time you do this exercise.
This is a good way to exercise while sitting at your computer.

, Rolling your ankles is another exercise you can perform easily anywhere you're sitting. Cross your right leg over your left, resting your right calf on your left thigh. Slowly rotate your right ankle clockwise in big circles. Then rotate the same ankle again, this time counterclockwise. Switch your legs, resting your left calf on your right thigh, and repeat the exercise for your left ankle.

Try toe raises.,
Perform heel drops using your body weight.,
Try weighted ankle lifts.",How to Strengthen Your Ankles2," Stand with your feet parallel to one another, about shoulder-width apart. Raise your heels off the ground so that you are standing on the balls of your feet, and then slowly lower yourself back down.If your ankles feel particularly weak, or if you have balance issues, you can perform this exercise with your back against a wall.
For a bit more resistance and a slightly more difficult work exercise, hold free weights in your hands as you perform the exercise. Don't use anything overly heavy, particularly if you are just beginning to work on strengthening your ankles.
This will also strengthen your calf muscles.

, Stand at the edge of an exercise step deck or a large book, with your heels over the edge and the balls of your feet on the step. Slowly lower your body so that the balls of your feet stay on the book but your heels touch the ground. Raise your body back up and hold the position for a few seconds before you lower yourself back down again.Your heels might touch the ground depending on the height of your step, but be sure to control the lowering of your body and avoid smacking your heels when you reach the bottom of the stretch.

, Tie a belt or a similar sized piece of rope around both ends of a light dumbbell so it forms a triangle when you hold it by the center of the belt or rope. Sit on a counter and insert your feet (covered by shoes) into the triangle, resting the rope just below your toes. Lower the weight by pointing your feet slowly downward. Then using your ankles, lift the weight back up.

Stand on one foot.,
Squat on a wobble board.,
Bend and reach.",How to Strengthen Your Ankles3," Raise your left leg, bending it at the knee, and stand only on your right foot. Hold this position for as long as you can and then switch legs. Since you don’t usually stand on one leg, forcing your body to do so will strengthen your ankles (and your calves).To add difficulty, close your eyes. This makes balancing harder and will force you to more thoroughly engage the muscles around your ankles and in your calves to stay upright.

, Stand on a wobble board – or a pillow if you don’t have a wobble board – with your legs slightly closer together than shoulder width. Then slowly squat down, controlling the speed of your squat. Then slowly return to a standing position.You should perform about 10 squats per set. Repeat the set up to the three times, depending on the strength of your ankles.

, Stand on your right leg and slowly reach toward the floor, bringing your left leg up and out behind you, making sure to bend at your hips.You might not have enough flexibility in your hamstrings to do this with your legs straight, so it's okay to bend at the knees if you have to.
You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by placing objects in front and to the side of you. As you bend forward, reach out to touch each of these objects before coming back to standing.

Stretch your calves.,
Flex your toes.,
Point your toes.",How to Strengthen Your Ankles4," Place both hands on a wall at about shoulder height, and then prop the ball of your right foot against the wall. Lean toward the wall until you feel the pull in your right calf. Repeat this exercise with the ball of your left foot against the wall., Lie on your back with your arms relaxed and next to your sides and your legs evenly spaced apart. Flex both of your feet, trying to point your toes toward your face. You’ll feel a stretch in your calves.


You can repeat this exercise as many times as you’d like, but be sure you aren’t overextending your ankles. If you feel pain (and not just a stretch) in your calf, don’t flex as far. , Lie on your back with your arms relaxed and next to your sides and your legs evenly spaced apart. Point your toes away from your face. You’ll feel a stretch in your calves but you should not overstretch, so stop if you feel actual pain."

Get in the starting position.,
Extend your arms forward.,
Lower your body by bending your knees forward.,
Return to the starting position.,
Complete five repetitions.,
Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.,
Do two more sets.",How to Do 3x5 Squats1," Stand with your feet shoulder length apart. Your hips should be over your knees and your knees should be over your ankles.As you won't be lying on the floor at any point when you're doing squats, they are okay to do on any surface. A mat is not necessary unless you're doing other activities afterwards.;
, Roll your shoulders backwards so they're behind your ears. Then, raise your arms forward. Hold them in a straight line so they're parallel to the ground., Inhale and bring your hips back slowly. As you bring your hips back, bend your knees to lower your body to the floor. As your bottom sticks out, strive to keep your chest and shoulders straight. Lower your body as far to the floor as is comfortable for you., You want to launch your body upwards using your heels. Return to the original position, with your arms parallel to the floor and your feet about shoulder length apart., Three by five squats means you will do three repetitions of five squats. After you return to the original position, do four more squats to complete one set of five., You should not do your sets too close together, as this can cause strain. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between squats. You can count in your head or set a timer., After repeating one set, do two more. Remember to rest in between sets for 60 to 90 seconds."
"
Do single leg squats.,
Jump when you squat.,
Add a weight across your back.,
Pause with the weight.",How to Do 3x5 Squats2," If one of your legs seems stronger than the other, you can build leg strength in one area by doing single leg squats. To start, get in the squat position. Then, lift up the leg you're not going to be strengthening.For example, say you want to build muscle in your right leg. Hold up your left leg. Hold slightly in front of you or slightly behind you, depending on what helps you maintain balance. Then, do a squat with only your right leg and return to the starting position.
Remember to lower your body as low to the ground as possible when doing a squat. Stop if you feel uncomfortable.

, Adding a jump to your squat adds some cardio and forces you to work your muscles harder. To jump when you squat, get in the squat position. Then, lower yourself downward like you're doing a regular squat. When you're about halfway down, propel yourself upward and jump so both of your feet are in the air. After you land, return to the starting position and repeat.For added variation, you can swing your arms in the air when you jump.

, To add weight, you will need a dumbbell. Start with only a light amount of weight, such as five pounds, to avoid straining yourself. You can add more weight with time. Place the bar across your back, holding your shoulders firm for support. Then, do your three by five repetitions as normal. Adding a little weight can increase muscle definition.Be conscious of keeping your back and shoulders tight the entire time if you choose to add weight.

, If you increase the time you're holding a weight, this will build more muscle. When lifting with a weight, pause at the bottom of your squat. Hold the position for two to six seconds before returning to the starting position. Do this for your regular three by five repetitions.Only pause for as long as is comfortable for you.

Talk to your doctor before you begin a weight training regimen.,
Make sure you're using proper techniques.,
Have rest days between the squats.,
Listen to your body.",How to Do 3x5 Squats3," You want to make sure weight training is safe for you given your current fitness level. Make an appointment with your doctor to talk over weight training to find a safe routine for you given your current health. This is especially important if you have any underlying medical issues.

, It may be a good idea to talk to a trainer in your gym or watch videos online of people doing squats when you're starting out. It can take awhile to get the hang of the movements. If you're using improper technique, this can cause strain or injury.If you feel very sore after doing squats, you may be using improper techniques. Try consulting a trainer at your gym for guidance.

, Squats are a form of weight training. It's best to engage in weight training only two to three days a week. You should always have rest days in between. Do not do squats two days in a row, as this can cause injury.If you have very intense workouts, that incorporate intense aerobics in addition to squats, only opt for light activity on rest days. Go for brief walks, for example, but try to take it easy overall.If you only engage in light exercise, you can do more intense workouts on weight training rest days. For example, you can play sports outdoors or go for a light jog.

, You may not be able to complete a full three by five routine at first, especially if you're new to weight training. If you feel very sore or strained during a routine, stop. You should pay attention to your body's signals.If you feel pain when squatting, this is not normal. You should stop if you feel pain and rest for a day before trying again.

"
Take any supplements you use regularly.,
Stretch.,
Do light exercises for about five minutes.",How to Do 3x5 Squats4," If you're on supplements for your workout routine, you should take these prior to your workout. This will help you gain the strength you need to complete your squatting routine. Make sure to refer to the instructions on your supplement for any specific guidelines regarding how soon to take them before a workout.You should always consult a doctor before beginning a supplement routine.

, You never want to engage in squats without doing some light stretching first. To start, do some slow moves like burpees and downward dog yoga poses.To do a burpee, raise your hands over your head. Then, lower your body to the ground. Place your weight on your hands while stretching your legs and feet backward, like you would before doing a pushup, and lower your body to the ground. Return to the starting position and repeat.
To do the downward dog pose, place your hands flat on the floor and make a triangle shape with your body. Hold the pose for as long as is comfortable. This should stretch your body for squats.

, Five minutes of light exercise is recommended before weight training. You can try something like five minutes on an elliptical machine or five minutes of light walking or jogging."
"If you might lose your balance/fall back, use a spotter, or place a strong, armless chair behind your standing position, and squat to near the chair seat level.,Do not lower your thighs to below parallel to the floor to avoid stress or injury to your knees.,
Stretch: Use static versus dynamic stretches.,
Start with no weights at all—or just an unloaded barbell, if you're new to squats and weight training.",How to Improve a Squat1,",, Static stretching is typically an exercise where you hold a position for a certain amount of time (usually 15-30 seconds). Dynamic (active) stretching involves controlled movements through various ranges of motion. Dynamic stretching is sometimes recommended because warming up by moving may offer less risk of injury. Shoulder rolls, light kicks, sumo squats, twists are all good examples of dynamic stretching exercises.
, Work up to adding weights."

Place your feet hip width apart or very slightly wider.,
Lift your toes up.,
Sit back like you are going to sit in a low chair.,
Keep your knees in line with your toes.,
Pick a point on the wall to watch as you squat.,
Keep a proud chest.,
Notice the arch in your lower back.,
Inhale as you squat down and exhale as you return to standing.,
Do an assisted squat to improve form.",How to Improve a Squat2," Start with your feet facing forward, and then turn them out to the side by approximately 10 degrees.Turning your feet out slightly will open up your hips and allow you to squat lower.;
, Your body weight should rest in your heels as you sit back. Lifting your toes will force your body to compensate.


As you rise from your squat, imagine your feet are spreading wider as you drive the heels into the floor.

, Most people don’t distribute their weight back far enough. To train yourself, you can squat down onto a low chair or a box.In this position, you lean slightly forward to distribute your weight into your hindquarters. As you move your butt lower, your torso should lean forward in a straight line.

, Start your squat parallel to a mirror, so that you can view whether your knees go past your toes. If they do, squat less deeply and hold the squatted position longer until you develop strength.

, Never drop your head down or look up at the ceiling. Keep a faraway focal point and never break your gaze.

, This is especially important if you are using a bar and lifting weights as you squat. As you place the bar across your shoulders, make sure you are pulling down until your elbows are just below your shoulders and it will help your chest stay lifted.


Your upper body should never round forward. A rounded back can cause a lower back injury.

, You should never overarch your back; however, keeping a slight arch, similar to the amount that remains when you stand, will help distribute the weight. Keep your lower abdominals pulled in and up during the duration of the exercise to keep the lower back steady.

, Use the breath to handle the resistance of the weight. Always follow this rule and reset your breath for each repetition., Form your squat position in front of a pole or bar. Hold onto the bar and let it absorb some of your body weight so that you can go into a low squat.


Move slowly until your hamstrings are parallel to the ground or slightly lower. If you have knee problems, don’t go further than parallel.
Repeat in three sets of 10 every other day for a few weeks. Then do squats without assistance.
If you can place your pole near a mirror, watch yourself as you make each of these changes so that you can confirm your form. Pay attention to how it feels so that you can replicate it without assistance.

, Lay on an exercise mat with your knees bent. Lift your hips to form an inverted plank and hold for one minute.


Do repetitions after you do your hold. Lower your glutes and lift them, holding a bridge for three seconds. Then, slowly lower your hips down.
Do three sets of 10 repetitions.
Then, make the movement smaller, lowering one inch down and one inch up for one minute.
Hold another hip bridge for one minute at the end for added effect. Repeat every other day.

, Most people’s quads are much stronger, creating an imbalance and potential for injury. Your hamstrings will lift you out of your lowest squatting position.


Lay back on your exercise mat. Place a small rubber ball, called a physio ball, underneath your feet. Do a hip bridge, like you did to strengthen your glutes.
Try to stay as steady as possible in your torso, as you pull your heels in toward your butt. The ball should come slightly closer as you continue to lift your hips.
Return the ball. Repeat with three sets of 10 reps.

, Lie on your stomach and tighten your ab muscles. Lift your hands and feet to reach the four corners of your exercise mat.


Tighten your abs and glutes and lift them above the ground.
Alternate your right arm and left leg up an inch. Then, lower them slightly as you raise your left arm and right leg. Repeat this slow swimming motion for one to two minutes.
Rest for one minute, then return to the position where your arms and legs are lifted toward the corners of the mat. Do slow jumping jacks, move your arms and legs out and in for one minute.

, Even out the weight in your feet by holding dumbbells to your sides and resting one leg back on a weight bench as you do a single leg squat. Stop bending your knee when you feel a deep hip flexor stretch in your raised leg.


Repeat in two to three sets of 10 on each side., If your shoulders are too tight, you won’t be able to keep your chest up. Place a medicine ball against the wall and lean your shoulders onto it.


Roll it around to break up tight muscles before you squat., Do the butterfly stretch by sitting up with your legs bent and soles touching. Try to gather your toes in toward you and lean forward.


A low lunge with your hands on the floor inside your forward leg will also stretch your hip flexor. Hold for at least one minute before switching legs.

Lower your body as low as you can go without letting your knees touch the wall.

, Hold a dumbbell vertically as if it were a wine glass. Do deep squats, increasing the weight so that you can only do three sets of eight before reaching muscle fatigue.

, Hold a barbell with weights over your shoulders and complete your squats. This is the traditional squat used by weight lifters. Find your one-rep max by asking for assistance from a friend.


Find the amount of weight that you can carry over your shoulders and lift in proper form a single time. This is the one-rep max.
Only do squats every other day, so that your muscles get plenty of time to rest and rebuild.

Determine your time commitment.,
Consider the type of gym equipment you have access to.,
Consider how much leg strength you'd like to build.,
Start with a warm up.,
Begin with the basics and customize them.,
Be consistent.,
Maintain good form.,
Check your progress over time and modify.,
Always stretch your muscles at the end of a workout.,
Eat healthy to help build muscle.",How to Get Stronger Legs," How much time will you be able to do a leg workout on a consistent basis each week? Your available workout time will help you narrow down which leg exercises will be the most effective for you. A solid, 15 minute leg workout done on a consistent basis can yield results possibly as good as a 30 minute or 1 hour leg workout.






;
, Before you start creating a leg workout plan, think about whether or not you will have access to a treadmill and other gym machines, or if you will be focusing on a simple home workout set up. Equipment like free weights and an exercise mat, if you don't already own them, are relatively cheap alternatives to a gym membership. And there are several leg exercises that do not require access to gym equipment.







, If you are an athlete trying to build muscle strength, your workout may be more intense and high-impact. If you're looking to tone and shape your legs through basic strength exercises, your workout may be less intense. As well, if you're looking to target a specific muscle (say, your butt, or your thighs), make sure you include exercises that focus on those specific muscles.









Keep in mind the physique of men and women are biologically different, so each gender will naturally build muscle differently. A big misconception is that women can end up with bulky, ripped legs if they do too many leg exercises. In fact, women don't tend to build big muscles because of their lack of testosterone.So, take your physical build and gender into account and set reasonable, healthy goals in terms of your custom workout plan.

, If possible, always start your workout with a five to 10 minute cardio and/or stretching warm up. A warm up of some kind, whether it is on a treadmill or going for a jog or quick run outside, is beneficial to help you mentally and physically prepare for your leg workout. Running or jogging twice a week can also improve fat burning and sculpting of your legs.As well, warming up will help to heat up your leg muscles and allow for deeper flexibility and range of motion.Remember, never work out or stretch cold muscles, as this can lead to injury.








, Basic exercises like squats, lunges, deadlifts, and calf raises work leg muscles the most effectively.However, there are a lot of great variations of these basic exercises that you can do, using just your body weight or barbells and








Basic squats using your bodyweight are a great start to any leg workout.From basic squats you can move on to jump squats,split squats,and barbell squats.Lunges are also another great way to tone your quad muscles. Try skater lunges, alternating curtsey lunges with a barbell, and a three way lunge.Deadlifts can be done with free weights or your own body weight. Make sure your workout plan includes a variation on deadlifts, including stiff leg deadlifts, single leg deadlifts, and deadlift squats.Calf raises are simple but effective. You can do them on the bottom step of a staircase, with the assistance of a chair, or if you have access to gym equipment, with a step machine.
Try different inner and outer thigh exercises, such as bridges, and lying hip adductions.

, It may seem obvious, but the best way to build strong muscles is a consistent workout. Do each exercise in sets, starting with lower sets of each exercise and building yourself up to higher sets.Try to commit to a leg workout several nonconsecutive days of the week, as you should give your muscles time to rest. Always be careful not to overtrain or overwork your body.







, Quality, not quantity, will lead to better results. Focus on keeping your back straight, and do not hyper extend your leg muscles as this can lead to injury. Use a mirror to check your posture and your form as you do your workout.







, Keep track of your progress in a workout notebook or on your phone or computer with one of the many fitness tracking Apps available.Consider adjusting and adding to your existing workout plan. Maybe you have stuck to the same exercises, are starting to see results, and think you can increase the number of sets for a particular exercise, or you may want to add in more intense exercises with a barbell or dumbbell.







, Stretching will prevent injury, increase blood circulation, and help with muscle fatigue. It's a vital step in your workout plan that should not be skipped.








To properly stretch your muscles, focus on major muscle groups (calves, thighs, hips, lower back) and always stretch both sides of your body, doing the same stretch on one side (or leg) that you did on the other side.Stretch in smooth motions. Do not bounce when stretching as this can cause injury. Make sure you breath during stretching and hold each stretch for 30-60 seconds minimum.A good rule of thumb for how far and deep to stretch is: slight discomfort is fine, but you should never feel pain. You may experience feelings of tension as your muscles slowly release but if you experience any pain or hurt, back off until you find a comfortable stretch., Beyond committing to a consistent workout, eating well will ensure you are getting a good dose of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients every day. A balanced diet also means you'll have more energy to complete your workout plan, giving you the right fuel to tone and strengthen your body.









Balance is key. Try to eat from each food group — grains, protein foods, vegetables and fruits, and dairy. Listen to your body, and eat when you're hungry. Stop eating when you feel satisfied.Go for variety. Aim to eat different foods in each food group. For example, don't reach for an apple every time you choose a fruit or a carrot every time you choose a vegetable. Eating a variety of foods each day will help you get all the nutrients you need.Eat moderately. Don't have too much or too little of one thing. All foods, if eaten in moderation, can be part of healthy eating.Even a cookie or some ice cream can be okay, as long as it's balanced out with other, healthier foods!

Practice this exercise sequence twelve to fifteen times in a row.",How to Do Calf Raises2," It's always a good rule of thumb to start with lighter weights, and work your way up to heavier ones. Get two dumbbells of the same weight, and stand with your feet about shoulder width apart.








, If you have trouble with your balance, it's a good idea to have a chair nearby with the back facing you. You can also perform this exercise while facing a wall.

, Make sure that your arms are below your shoulders, and keep a firm grip on the dumbbells.








, Shift your weight onto the balls of your feet while keeping your legs straight. Continue to keep your arms alongside your body.









There is no arm movement involved, as the weights are meant to train your calf muscles.
While your legs should be straight, it's a good idea to keep a micro bend in your knees to avoid locking them up.

, Do this movement with as much control as possible.









You should feel a nice stretch and little tension in your lower legs, particularly your calves.

, That's an adequate number of repetitions for most people, and should gradually strengthen your calf muscles.

Start with a lighter weight.,
Stand with your legs one in front of the other.,
Hold the plate weight to your chest with both hands.,
Bend the front knee, with the knee over your ankle.,
Raise your front heel.,
Repeat this exercise.",How to Do Calf Raises3," For best results in this method, you'll need a plate weight, like you would find at the gym. Resist the urge to start with the heaviest weight you can manage. It's better to start with a lighter weight and work your way up.

, In other words, your legs should be scissoring out, resulting in about a foot distance between both feet.








, This is the time to decide if the weight is too little or too much. Err on the side of caution, and go with a slightly lower weight than you might be able to hold.

, Take a step back with your back knee so that the back leg is almost straight. Then, lift your back heel so that you're on the tippy toes of your back foot.








, Both feet should now be on their tippy toes. Lower the heel of your front foot slowly until it's back on the floor. Keep the back heel lifted the entire time. Lift the front heel, hold it for a moment, then lower it back to the ground.








, Ideally, you should strive to practice this method of the calf raise a few times per week.

Do wall shin raises.,
Do single leg raises.,
Do heel step-downs.,
Do a seated shin stretch.,
Do some heel drops.",How to Exercise Your Shin Muscles1," These are simple exercises to stretch your shins while resting your back against a wall. As long as you have a solid background for support, you can do them just about anywhere.Stand with your shoulders, back, and butt up against a wall. Place your feet away from the wall, with your heels about one foot-length in front of you.Keeping your heels on the ground, raise your toes upward. Stretch as far as possible. This is called dorsiflexion.
Slowly lower your toes back toward the ground, but don’t let them touch the floor.
Repeat the exercise with 10–15 reps. Once you have finished the reps, let your feet back on the floor for a quick rest, then do one or two more sets.;
, This exercise is very similar to the wall shin raise, but using only one foot at a time. It is a big more difficult because you will only be supporting yourself on one leg. This is a good exercise to build to after regular wall shin raises.Stand with your back against the wall, and rest one foot lightly against the wall.
Dorsiflex with the foot on the ground for 10–15 reps. Once you are finished, switch your feet and repeat on the other leg.
Because you are only using one leg at a time, you don’t need to rest between switching your legs.

, This is a simple exercise that you can do without a wall. You’ll be doing the same kind of dorsiflexion as the wall stand, but this time while simulating a walk.Stand up straight, not leaning against anything, with your feet about shoulder-width apart.
Take a step forward, making sure only your heel plants. The step should be a normal size, so about how long you would take while walking.
Hold your toes in the air, making sure the ball of your foot doesn’t get any closer than an inch to the floor.
Step back to the starting position.
Repeat this step with the same foot for 10–15 reps, then switch to the other leg.
One variation on this exercise is to try walking around the room on your heels. Just make sure you walk very slowly, and maintain your balance. If you start to feel like you are losing your balance, rest your toes on the ground to settle., This is a simple stretching exercise you can do anywhere. You’ll probably want to be on a softer surface since you are on the floor.Get on the floor, resting on your knees. Stretch out your feet so that your toes are pointed behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor.
Gently lean backward, pushing down on your heels to stretch out the front of your leg.
Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeat three times.
If you want to increase the stretch, do one leg at a time to increase the weight. You can also try lifting up your knees to further increase the resistance.

, These are simple exercises that use a ledge, like a step, to provide some resistance to your foot. This is probably best to do on the bottom of a staircase, or on a small platform, rather than using a step on the top of your stairwell.Stand with your toes on the edge of a step. Make sure you have something nearby to balance yourself.
Shift your weight on to one leg (say the right), then lift the other foot (the left) off of the step.
Lower your right heel downward, making sure your toes point upward.
Return to your starting position, then switch legs and repeat with the other foot.

"
"
Do toe curls.,
Do calf stretches.,
Do a shin resistance exercise.,
Do a monster walk.",How to Exercise Your Shin Muscles2," These are simple exercises you can do with a towel on the floor. Just make sure your feet are firmly planted on the floor. You can hold on to something for balance if you need it.Stand at the edge of the towel with your feet hip-width apart.
Use the toes on one foot to gather the edge of your towel and pull it toward you.
Push the towel back into position.
Repeat with your other foot.

, This exercise uses an exercise band to help pull your toes toward you. This action strengthens the shin muscle. You can also use a towel in place of the band if you don’t have one.Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you.
Loop the exercise band around the bottom of your feet, near the arch.
Gently pull the band back into dorsiflexion, that is raising your toes upward toward your shins as far as possible, and hold that position for 10–15 seconds.
Repeat two to three times on the same foot, then switch to the other leg. You can switch legs between reps, but it will probably be quicker not to keep swapping the band around each foot.
The exercise band you use for this and other shin exercises should be a strip design, which will wrap around your foot and ankles. When purchasing your band, consider the resistance based on your current fitness level. If you are already active, and working on your shins to improve your current workout, you’ll want to consider bands with heavy resistance, for average untrained men or active women, or extra-heavy resistance, for active men and strong women., This exercise uses the band and a fixed object to help extend your lower leg. Your foot will use the band as resistance to pull against when flexing. All you need is the exercise band and something solid you can wrap it around.Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. Make sure your toes are pointed up toward the ceiling.Loop the exercise band around the top of your foot and a stationary object. This can be a table leg, or anything else that will stay securely in place.
Dorsiflex your foot against the resistance, pulling your toes back against the band.
Repeat for 10–15 reps, then switch legs. For increase the resistance, you can build to using a heavier band, or doubling your reps to 20–30 per leg.

, If you have a little bit more space to do some walking, you can use the resistance band to stretch by taking steps. This will help stretch your shins and hip abductor muscles.Stand up, placing your feet shoulder-width apart.
Wrap the resistance band around your ankles or thighs.
Step forward and to the right with your right leg. Then bring your left leg forward so that it is even with the right.
Take a step backward toward your original position, then bring your other leg back to even.
If you have the space, you can take several steps forward before going backward. Just remember to alternate your lead foot for each forward step.

Give your body time to adjust to a weight-training regime methodically.
Examples of attainable fitness goals can include wanting to get stronger, becoming more flexible, or even being able to play longer with your kids/grand-kids.;
, Gyms are typically a safer lifting environment than your home because there are personal trainers who can guide you through weightlifting exercises, mirrors to receive instant feedback on your form, and qualified medical staff that can respond to injuries quickly.

, You will want to get a physical from your doctor before you begin lifting weights.  Make sure you let your doctor know what you are planning on doing by telling him your fitness goals.


Some gyms will offer a free fitness assessment where a personal trainer will work with you to determine how strong and flexible you are.  Take advantage of offerings like this.  It will greatly aid your start to lifting weights safely.

, Utilizing your gym's personal trainers will help you plan a workout regime that will help you attain your workout goals.


There are also many free online sources that you may utilize to create a workout regime.
bodybuilding.com
muscleandfitness.com

, Tracking your progress on the exercises contained in your regime will allow you to gradually increase the weight you lift so that you do not overextend yourself and make yourself more susceptible to injuries.


You can track your weightlifting progress by recording the day of the workout, the time, exercises you complete, repetitions and weight, and how tired you were.  You can use a notebook to record your workouts in or you can use one of the numerous phone applications to track your workouts.

,


Eating well will contribute to your overall health giving you the focus, energy, and confidence to lift weights safely as a part of a lifestyle decision rather than a fad workout.

, Start with some cardio and stretches:


Cardio - doing 2-3 minutes of light, low-impact cardio such as riding a stationary bike or getting on an elliptical increases your circulation which will help your muscles become easier to stretch and loosen up.
Ballistic Stretching - Before you workout you want to make sure that you are doing what is called “Ballistic Stretching.”  Ballistic stretching incorporates movement and is more effective as a pre-workout stretch than static stretching.  Static stretching can sometimes cause your muscles to overstretch and reduce your strength for a workout.

, No matter how much weight you are moving around it is an absolute must to squat to pick it up, keep your back straight, and then lift with your legs.


Many preventable gym injuries do not actually occur during an excursive but when weights are being lugged around improperly from a rack to the exercise area.

, Lifting with the correct form is the easiest way to be safe while weightlifting.


The greatest hindrance to lifting with proper form is lifting more weight than you can handle.
Start with a weight that you know that you can lift properly and over time you can increase that weight.

, Both beginner and experienced weight lifters will need a spotter from time-to-time.


For lifts where you are moving a heavy amount of weight ensure that you have a workout partner or you ask someone in the gym to come and give you a spot.
The last thing that you want to do is to drop heavy weight on your chest, back, feet, or hands.

, Wear a weight belt, braces, or wraps for lifts that put tremendous stress on your joints, knees, or back.


Some of the most severe knee and back injuries can be prevented just by wearing the proper support equipment.

, This is critical to safe weightlifting.


Your feedback sources should at least be looking at your form and your body language (i.e. are you energetic or exhausted?).
Feedback can be given by your workout partner or a personal trainer.  Don't be afraid to ask someone in the gym to give you feedback on a certain weightlifting exercise.

, When weightlifting you will most likely be in an area where other gym members are lifting, sometimes hundreds of pounds of weight.


Keep your eyes open and be aware of their location so that you might avoid dropped weights, running into someone, or running into a weight machine.
Gyms with mirrors will allow you to be more aware of your surroundings.

, Always keep a water bottle with you when you work out and drink plenty of fluids.


Dehydration will lead to cramping and sap your energy.

, A key to lifting safely is to know when your body has had enough activity for one day.


Push yourself to your limit, but do not overtrain.
Over training can lead to decreased strength, poor form, increased chances of injury, and a demoralization of confidence.

, The prime time for static stretching is at the end of your weight training session.


Stretching after lifting will increase your mobility and allow your muscles to recover faster all of which will decrease your chance at an injury.

, weightlifting is strenuous on your body.  You will be burning many calories.


Eating an easily digestible food such as a granola bar, whey protein shake, or even gummy bears will allow your body to recover its energy quickly.

, Sleep deprivation will hamper the recovery of your muscles which will increase your chances of injury or may lead to a lack of focus as you are lifting leading to improper form.

, Your muscles need time to recover.  In general, it is a good idea to give a muscle group at least 1 day off before working it out again.

"
"
Make sure to warm up with very light weight for the muscle group you are about to train, maybe get ten easy minutes on the treadmill.,
Practice perfect form.,
Know that the eccentric (resisting phase) of the movement is the most important one and the concentric (pushing/pulling phase) is secondary when it comes to results.,
Start slowly to allow your body to adapt.,
Breathe.",How to Exercise With Weights," This gets blood into the area's connective tissue and muscle, better preparing it for a good session of lifting weights. It would benefit you even further to do a couple light sets of each movement you're about to perform- with weight that will allow you to do 20+ reps with no struggle. This warms up the connective and muscle tissue very effectively.;
, This means not using momentum to move the weight through its normal range of motion. Not only will you get better results and learn to ""feel"" the muscle contracting and stretching, it is much safer. Momentum tears muscles. Do not let this be you.

, Muscles are stretched during the eccentric phase, forcing them to enlarge and get stronger. The same goes for the connective tissues.

, You can start slowly by performing a circuit routine or full-body routine, for example a set of ten repetitions of squats, resting for 2 minutes then doing a set of bench presses. Think of muscle as a multi-functional armour for our internal organs and skeletons- it protects both and does a very good job. In addition it burns fat around the clock making you LEANER.
Weight training is stressful, and much like your skin reacting to the sun. The skin creates pigment to protect from UV rays passing. Weight training creates stress, the body reacts to this stress by creating more muscle to protect against the trauma of the weights. The joints and supportive tissues are also strengthened, making them more prepared to handle stressful loads as well.

, Inhale on the resistance phase and exhale on the push phase. You need more 02 rich blood to push or pull the weight back to the starting position for another rep.

"
"
For endurance, work your way up to 100 bodyweight squats, 100 Hindu squats, 100 lunges, 100 reverse lunges.Jogging a mile wouldn't hurt either.,
For Strength, do Pistol squats(single legged squats) and horse stance (isometric squat position).

,Work your way up to 20 pistol squats

,
As for Horse stance you must train that until you can do it for 20 minutes.

,
For explosive power, Sprint for 1–10 miles (1.6–16.1 km) each day.,
Remember to only do 1 set of each exercise.

,
Drink at least 2 cups water a few minutes before and after your leg workout.

,
If you have access to weight equipment doing weighted squats would also improve your speed and strength at the same time.

,
In 1-3 months you should have strong horse-like legs.

",How to Get Strong Legs Like a Horse,";
,,,, You don't have to do all the miles (or mile) at once you can split it up into yards if you want. It would also be a lot more challenging if your sprint up a hill or in 1 foot (0.3 m) pool of water. Do 10-50 Jumping squats for even more explosive power

,,,,"
"
It all starts with what you already have: If you are already somewhat muscular, are in decent shape and have all the equipment you need, very good.,
Make sure you haven't eaten 30 minutes before you start exercising, or you might end up with cramps.,
Do a warming up before you start exercising.,
After you are done with your warming up and stretches, it is time to grab your weights.,
Try to work out for at least 30 minutes.,
After you are completely done, take a hot shower and/or bath.,
Try to make a routine that you follow.,
After about a week, you will notice that it has become easier to do the same exercises with the same weights.",How to Lift Heavier Weights," If not, try to get in shape as soon as possible and buy some basic equipment like dumbbells or join a gym.;
,


Do make sure you aren't exercising on an empty stomach either, or you won't have the energy to perform them. Have a meal 40 minutes prior to exercising, and just a little snack 10 minutes before you start if you are hungry again.

, This will get more oxygen in your bloodstream and to your muscles. It also prevent -or at least reduce- muscle soreness after your workout.


Try to do the same warming up every time, because it will eventually become natural for you.
A typical warming up routine is 5 push ups and 7 sit ups, after you have done both, rest for 30 seconds. Then 15 of each, rest 1 minute again. 30 of each, rest. Then work down to the 15 and 7. After that, stretch your torso and do squats and stretch those muscles again. This is just an example of what you could also do, but feel free to make your own warming up schedule. The main goal should be to get your blood flowing and increase your heart rate and to prepare your body for a workout.

, Get a weight which you can comfortably handle, but is still heavy enough so you can train your muscles.


Get the weight heavy enough where you can 'only' do a max of 15-20 reps. Then do pyramid sets with the weights (this means that for example you do one set of 5, rest. Then 1 set of 10, rest. 1 set of 15, rest and then work your way down to the 5 again.)
An example of a workout could be to bench press 50 kilos 7 times, rest 30 seconds. Then 14 times, rest. 20 times, rest. 14 times, rest. 7 times. After this one pyramid set, rest for 1 minute (don't rest after your last reps, this rest is included in the minute of rest you get.) After the minute, do another pyramid set that trains the same muscle groups with the same amount of reps and rest, like a pectoral fly if you are training your chest. After this set, go back to the exercise you did before it (in this case the bench press) and do another pyramid set. After these three sets, you move on to another muscle group, your biceps for example.

, After your workout, do a cool down stretch. This could be just stretching, or the same like your warming up. The goal is to gradually lower your heart rate again and prepare your body for a rest.

, It really has to be hot, but still within your comfort zone. This will help you relax and will also make your arteries in and around your muscles expand, which allows oxygen to flow in more easily and let the acids that developed in your muscles flow out easier.

, For example:


Monday: Concentrate on Biceps.
Tuesday: Concentrate on Legs and Back.
Wednesday: Concentrate on Triceps.
Thursday: Concentrate on Abs.
Friday: Concentrate on entire torso.
Saturday: Rest.
Sunday: Rest.

, Continue with these exercises and weights until the end of the week, making sure you are doing it with the right form. After this week, add some weights to what you were already using. It shouldn't be too much, just enough to make it just as tough as your first week. So just to make it clear:




You will want to make a schedule for an entire week which says on which days you train what.
You will want to use weights which are still comfortable to use, but heavy enough to 'only' let you do 15-20 reps.
You use the same weights for a total of two weeks, doing the same exercises.
Add some more weights, and use these for the next two weeks, doing the same exercises.
Repeat.

Prepare the barbell.,
Set your stance.,
Sit back.,
Check your grip.",How to Do a Deadlift1," Place the barbell on the ground in front of you and add plates according to your strength and fitness level. If it is your first time performing the deadlift, start lighter. It is always easy to add weight later. You want to perfect your form before you test your physical limits.


Secure the plates tightly onto the barbell with clips to keep them from slipping around.
Beginners usually start lifting just the barbell, since a typical barbell weighs between 25 and 45 pounds on its own. In this case, you'll want to prop the bar up so it's as high on your shins as it would be if it had plates (approximately 6-8 inches). Otherwise, you'll be bending too far down to pull the barbell right off the floor and could injure yourself. When you prop the barbell, be carefully that it can't easily roll off.;
, Step up to the bar so that your feet are approximately shoulder width apart, your toes are pointing forward or slightly outward, and the barbell is at the midpoint of your foot (as if it's dividing the front and the back of your feet in half).

, Pretend there's a short stool behind you; bend your knees and hips and sit back as if you were going to sit on that stool, while you reach down to grab onto the barbell (hands shoulder-width apart). Actively push your knees out; don't let them collapse in. Keep your back as straight as you can. Bend from the hips rather than from your waist. Bend your knees and hips just enough to reach and grab onto the bar. This is the starting position for the deadlift.


Your shins should be pretty vertical and touching the bar.
This is a hard position to stay in. As you figure out your form and check all these criteria, sometimes you'll straighten your legs and allow your back to curve to take a little break from this position. If you watch people deadlift, you'll see them do this between deadlifts. Just make sure you get back into this position before you actually lift.

, Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, just outside of your legs. Keep your arms straight. Your palms should face your body, and be equally far from the ends of the barbell.It's not uncommon for people to use a mixed grip as they move onto heavier weights, as it affords a stronger grip, but it's generally better to keep things simple as a beginner.
For Olympic lifting, some people use the hook grip, which is more secure but is painful at first. It is similar to the overhand grip, except that instead of the thumb over the remaining fingers, it is hooked underneath them.
The underhand grip alone is not recommended because it can lead to the rupture of bicep muscle and connecting tendons, especially in people who do not have full flexibility in the elbow joint.

"
"
Set your starting position.,
Stand up and bring the bar up with you.,
Lower the bar.",How to Do a Deadlift2," ""Setting"" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint.


Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not.
Some people hold their head in line with their back, others look straight ahead, and some people look up at the ceiling.

, Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift.


Begin the movement by pushing through your heels and straightening your knees.
The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it.
Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight.
Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up.

, Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under.


Release the weight after it is on the ground.

"
Place two dumbbells on either side of your body.,
Position yourself properly.,
Squat down and grasp the dumbbells.,
Keep your core strong while you stand up.,

Squats may be the most effective total lower body exercise you can do.Stand with your feet under your shoulders and slightly pointed outward. Keep your back straight and your eyes forward. If it helps, find a spot on the wall in front of you to focus on. Look at this spot throughout the entire squat.Breathe in and start bending at the hips while pushing your butt back. As your knees start to bend keep pushing your hips back.A proper squat should feel somewhat like sitting on your heels. Focus on keeping your knees lined up with your toes.To execute a proper squat, make sure your hip joint is lower than your knees. Once you feel comfortable squatting, try to go deeper than this for a more intense workout.Breathe out and drive your feet into the ground to bring yourself back up. Squeeze your glutes and push your hips forward until you're back to the starting position.If you're knew to lifting, try working with just the bar to get a feel for the form. You can even do squats with just your body weight. These are ""air squats,"" and are an excellent way to warm up.Once you start adding weight, aim for an amount you can lift for 5 full ""reps,"" or repetitions. Each time you squat and come back up is a full repetition.;
, As with squats, keep your back straight and find a spot in front of you to focus on. Relax your shoulders. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. Find a comfortable weight to hold in each hand.Take a step forward with one leg until your knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep this front knee in line with your ankle. The knee of your back leg should also be bent at a 90-degree angle. Do not let it touch the floor.Pushing off with the heel of your front leg, return to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.Try reverse lunges. Set up the basic starting position for lunges. Instead of taking a step forward, step backward. Keep your back straight as you would in a forward lunge. This requires a little more balance than the forward lunge. Make sure you're comfortable with your form before attempting a reverse lunge.Lunges are a good lower body exercise, but they can put a lot of strain on your knees. Take smaller steps if you feel pain in your knees. You can always work to increase your range of motion., Find a small platform or step stool. Holding a dumbbell in each hand, and standing up straight, place one foot onto the platform. Pushing with your lead foot, lift the rest of your body onto the platform.As you lift the rest of your body onto the platform, breathe out.Place your lead leg back on the ground. Move your body off the platform until you are standing back in the starting position. As with lunges, you should alternate which leg you start each rep with., Deadlifts are a compound exercise. They will work out your lower body, but they also help with core and back strength.Stand up straight in front of a barbell with weights. Your feet should be under your shoulders and the bar should be over the middle of your feet.Keeping your back straight and your hips in place, lean down and grab the bar. Your hands should be a little further apart than your legs. Once you have a good grip on the bar, lower your hips and bend your knees slightly.To lift the weight off the ground, drive your feet down into the ground and pull up until you are standing upright. Inhale as you lift.Keep everything tight as you lift the weight off the ground. Squeeze your butt, engage your core, and don't lean back.Once you've lifted the weight off the ground, do not just drop the bar. To set the weight back down, reverse the movement you used to lift it. Keeping everything tight, push the hips back and begin bending the knees. Focus on a spot in front of you and move your entire body down at the same time. Do not lean forward and do not round your back., Some exercises that require weights can be done without weights. If you don't have time to hit the gym, you can do calisthenics almost anywhere.


To do an air squat, set up as if you were in front of the squat rack at the gym. Put your feet a little more than shoulder width apart, with your toes facing outward. Using the same form you would in weighted squats, lower your hips and push your butt back. To help keep your balance, push your arms out in front of you as you lower down.Lunges can be performed without weights very easily. The form is exactly the same with or without weights.
To do a glute kickback, set up as if you were going to do a push-up, but stay on your knees. Lift one leg off the ground until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Keep your shin perpendicular to the ground and push your leg up. Lower you leg slowly and repeat with the other leg., To do a short bridge, lie flat on your back with the bottoms of your feet on the floor and your knees at about 45 degrees. Keep your shoulders and arms on the floor. Push up using your heels and raise your hips up as high as possible. Hold at the top for two seconds. Slowly lower your body back to the ground.Once you've mastered the short bridge, try doing a straight bridge. The straight bridge is a lot like a reverse push up. Sitting up with your legs straight in front of you, place your hands near your hips. Push your torso up and squeeze your butt. Hold for a few seconds before lowering back down.To do a full bridge, lie flat on your back. Bend your knees and place your hands by your head. Lift your entire body off the ground and arch your back. Push your hips into the air and squeeze your legs, butt, and core. Take a deep breath and make sure you give everything a good stretch. Hold for a 1-2 seconds and then lower yourself back down., Lie down on your side and rest your head on your bottom arm. Place your other arm palm down in front of you body. Keep both of your legs straight and lift your top leg about 1 foot off of your bottom leg. Lift your bottom leg to meet your top leg. Slowly lower both legs to the ground.Another variation is to lie flat on your back with your legs straight in front of you. Slowly lift your legs off the ground to a 90-degree angle. Hold for one second and then lower your legs taking care not to let them touch the ground., Running is a great way to tone your legs and butt. Any kind of running is likely to improve your lower body, but sprinting might be the best way.For an added challenge, run up a hill. Hill sprints will improve your glutes by putting more stress on your hip flexors.Running is a high impact activity and may not be good for your joints. If you can't run, try using an elliptical machine or a stationary bike.

, There are numerous exercises that workout your glutes and lower body. Do some research and find some new exercises to incorporate into your routine. Some people find that adding new exercises keeps them motivated to keep working out.


You could also try joining a yoga class. Yoga is an excellent way to strengthen your muscles, increase flexibility, and tone your body., A large part of getting a better butt, and a better body in general, is diet. If you don't combine exercise with healthy eating, you won't get good results.To get the best results, calculate your recommended caloric intake. You need energy to work out. If you want to lose weight, consume fewer calories. If you want to gain weight, consume more. Either way, make sure you are balancing your work out with the amount of calories you consume., You need protein to gain muscle, but you need carbohydrates for energy. Don't focus too heavily on one or the other. To get the most out of your diet, make sure you know how much of each you need.About 15% of your daily caloric intake should come from protein, and about 55% should come from carbohydrates.Lean proteins, such as chicken and fish, are better for you than red meat. Incorporate a vegetarian meal two or three times a week to mix things up.Eat whole grains, sweet potatoes, and whole wheat breads for a good source of energy., You need a certain amount of healthy fats to maintain good health. Good fats are usually liquid at room temperature. Fats such as olive oil, flaxseed oil, and safflower oil are good. If a fat is solid at room temperature, such as butter, avoid it., Water is necessary to keep the body hydrated. Aim for a glass of water for every 20 minutes of exercise., When searching for a way to build a better butt, keep in mind that there are three muscles that make up the butt. Consider each of these muscles when creating your workout plan.The gluteus maximus is the largest of the butt muscles, as well as the largest muscle in the body. When you rise from a squat position, or do any kind of thigh extension, this is the muscle you are using.The gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus have similar functions. When running, they stabilize your leg as it hits the ground. They also help with thigh rotations., Don't focus too much on achieving a certain type of butt. As with the rest of your body, it is largely genetic.Whether you have a large set of glutes or a particularly small set is probably the result of heredity. You can still work your butt muscles and make them stronger, but you may not be able to change their shape., The best way to build a better butt is to workout all three muscles with a variety of exercises. Don't rely on just squats to get your butt in shape.The glutes respond to both strength and endurance training. Some of the muscles are ""fast-twitch,"" meaning they respond to bursts of power. These muscles get worked out during exercises such as the squat.The glutes also contain ""slow-twitch"" muscles, which respond to aerobic exercises and running."

Squeeze your back muscles to help pull your shoulder blade toward the center of your back.,
Return to the starting position.

",How to Do a One Arm Dumbbell Row2," Use a controlled motion and especially at the lowest position to protect your elbow and shoulder.


Do a full range motion with your upper arm going past your body with light weights to exercise middle upper back muscles.
With medium to heavy weights, pull the weight to the level of your body. The prime mover here is the latissimus dorsi muscles and muscles can only contract, so once your upper arm goes past your body the muscles used will be the rear shoulder and upper middle back muscles.
For most exercise, including calisthenics, the turnaround at the bottom should be with control. For this exercise, do not drop the weight and let your elbows ""snap"" or your shoulders ""slump"" from the falling weight. Use control at the bottom position of this lift.

, Do not' twist your body or allow your back to round/your shoulders to hunch. Form is everything in this exercise.

, Use the one that allows you carry out 1-3 collections with 10 reps providing a half in order to one minute remainder between collections. That implies beginning with one collection as an amateur, and also raising as much as 3 sets due to the fact that you become more boosted in your weightlifting regular.

, Your muscles need to rest or you can have a serious injury.

"
Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position.,
Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar.,
Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting.,
Rack the bar and add weight.,
Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight.,
Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight.,
Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set.,
Rest according to how you feel between sets.",How to Bench Press1," Make sure that you are not holding your shoulders in an awkward position. Be sure to have a natural spinal curve. You do not want to have your lower back flat on the bench, but you do not want to force it to curve too much either. Instead, opt for a comfortable and natural position.









You should have your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your shoulders touching the bench.
Do not lift on a ""cushiony bench"" if you are a heavy lifter. When the bar and plates weigh more than 200 pounds plus the weight of your upper body, your shoulders will disappear into the bench and cause neck strain.
Choose a proper bench that fits your shoulder width. A narrow bench is unstable and a wide bench prevents the upper arm from bending back.;
, This is where you should position your hands. They should be about shoulder-width apart. Use the smooth rings in the bar as a reference for even hand placement.









Where you position your hands will affect which muscle group you work most. Widen your grip slightly to increase the amount of pectoral muscles involved in this exercise, and bring your grip in slightly to increase your triceps involvement. For a standard bench press, opt for the normal grip.

, Lift the bar off the rack and position it directly above the middle of your chest. Inhale as you lower it down, gently touching your chest — the middle of the sternum — with the bar. Do not bounce the bar off your chest, as this can cause serious injury and promotes bad form. Begin to exhale as you push the bar up and away from your body. Extend your arms to just under full extension. Repeat this for eight repetitions as your first set.









Lift with a bar that has a little flex but is not ""whippy"". A stiff bar can be uncomfortable to lift with. All bars are made of metal and relatively stiff, but a bar with some flex feels better on the joints. The salesperson at the store will give you the right bar for your bodyweight, based on the formula for bodyweight and bench press. Generally, a beginning or intermediate lifter is not going to lift over his bodyweight plus 50%.
Examine your goals when choosing a bar. For setting a personal record or a state record and above, use a bar with a standard diameter of 1 1⁄16 inches (2.7 cm). If not concerned with records, a thicker bar does not dig into the palms and is more comfortable. A thicker bar increases the distance of the lift and decreases the amount that can be lifted. A 1/8 (or 1/16) inch increase in bar diameter has a noticeable difference in feel and stability.

, Always use weight clips to prevent the weights from sliding off the bar in the event that you lift unevenly, do not lift without them. The bar by itself weighs 45 pounds. You will want to increase by five to ten pounds at a time until you find a comfortable weight.









Practice extra caution if tall. Tall lifters with wide grips should use care not to crush their hands when racking the bar. Weight benches were made for someone tall (6 feet tall and not for a lifter 6 feet 8 inches tall). Tall lifters should not use an extra wide grip. An extra wide grip strains the wrist with excessive radial flexion. Close and wide grips can make the wrist more prone to injury.
Avoid using the thumbless grip. If the bar slips off your hands, it would be disastrous. When being spotted by spotters and by a spotting device the thumbless grip is not as dangerous, but the spotting device has to be very, very solid. The thumbless grips is easier on the wrist and conducts power to the bar more directly (you can lift more). Use chalk with both grips. There are lifters who will use the thumbless grips despite the possible danger.

, You never want to drop the bar on yourself. You also want to be able to max out and be able to recover when you no longer can lift the bar. A spotter will be able to help you recover from your final press.








, It's easier to bend your wrists, bounce the weight off your chest, and exhibit other ""no-nos"" when trying to lift big. You'll gain more muscle and strength lifting the right form and lower weight than you will lifting with higher weight and the wrong form.









Lifters generally do between 8 and 12 reps (also called ""repetitions"") and 3 to six sets (one set is the maximum numbers of reps you give yourself).

, Water will help you stay hydrated and allow your muscles to function at high capacity, giving you an overall better workout.








, Some guides say the ideal rest time between sets is 90 to 120 seconds.While this is perhaps a good general guide for increasing muscle mass, it may not be ideal for you as an individual. You probably don't want to overshoot the 2-3 minute range, but you don't want to rush yourself into lifting thin.









If your ultimate goal is gaining muscle and mass, you're going to want to shock your body. How you do this is up to you. It can mean cutting down on rest time, increasing poundage on lifts, supersetting, etc. As long as you manage to keep pushing your body physically, you will notice a difference.

Hone your technique.,
Tone your back and triceps.,
Eat better and more to gain muscle.,
Make sure both arms are roughly equal in strength.,
Switch it up around the chest.",How to Bench Press2," It's been said before, but it's worth repeating. Poor form and more weight won't get you lifting more; proper form and less weight will. Here is a short list of several things you should pay attention to while you bench:


Squeeze the bar tightly to activate your triceps. Activating your triceps will ultimately help you lift more.
Use your legs to create a solid base. Think of yourself as driving your back and traps into the bench, giving your chest and arms a foundation to push off against.
Lift the bar up and down in a straight line. If lifting causes you to wobble back and forth when you bring the bar up and down, you are probably lifting too much weight. Switch to lower weight and practice proper form.

, Muscles in the body are interconnected. That means that to fully tone your chest with the bench press, you need to pay attention to your triceps and back. One reason lifters often reach a plateau in weight is that they forget to work out their triceps, which help power the bench press.


To tone your triceps, make your grip smaller on the bench press. Also try to work out the triceps with dips, skull-crushers, and overhand cable extensions.To tone your upper back, try barbell rows, which happen to be the exact opposite of the bench press. With good form, this exercise should strengthen your back significantly.

, The secret to gaining muscle mass is working out and eating right. Take your body weight in pounds and multiply that number by 18. This is the number of calories you should try to get into your body over the course of your day. Remember also to get a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Shoot for 25-40% calories from protein; 15-40% calories from fat; and 35-45% calories from carbohydrates.

, If you spend any amount of time watching others bench press, what you'll notice is that most people are a bit stronger with one arm — usually their dominant. What keeps many people at a plateau is their weak arm or side, as you can only lift as much as this arm will let you. To overcome this temporary limitation, work out your weak side more than normal. When either arms or sides are strong enough to work in tandem while bearing equal weight, watch your bench press skyrocket.

, If the only chest exercise that you perform is the bench press, your body will adapt quickly. To take your bench press to the next level, you are going to have to find different exercises for your chest. Try them out to see what works for you. Even slight differences in exercises can yield drastic results. Here are some additional chest exercises that you can try to max out your bench press:


Dumbbell flyes
Barbell incline/decline
Pushups
Chest press (incline or regular)
Cable extensions

If you have had back injuries in the past, it is probably best not to try this exercise. At the very least, ask your physician if he/she would recommend this exercise and reduce the amount of stress on your back by lessening the amount of time you hold the position.;
, It is critical to always stretch thoroughly before attempting any physical activities. This will help you avoid common injuries like pulled muscles. You will want to pay special attention to your back when stretching before this exercise. To learn more about how to properly stretch your back, click here.You may wish to lay down a mat or rug to avoid laying directly on the floor.
You can also place a pillow or towel under your head to decrease the amount you must lift yourself.

, To begin, you need to lay flat on your stomach with your face towards the floor. When getting into position, keep your arms straight along your sides., Extend both of your arms out in front of you. Keep your elbows slightly bent. Make sure to stretch your arms as far out as you can while still keeping your elbows bent and position your arms so that your palms are facing the floor.







, Lift your legs and arms off the ground as if you are flying. You want to keep your core in the stationary position. Make sure you lift your arms and legs simultaneously to maximize the effectiveness of the workout.









If you find lifting both arms and legs too difficult, you can lift alternate legs and arms at one time. In other words, lift your right arm while lifting your left leg and vice versa. To work all the muscles in your back, you will need to alternate., You want to lift your chest up off the ground using your back muscles to keep your arms and legs elevated. Raise your chest so that your head is no more than 8 inches (20.3 cm)off the floor. Using these lower back muscles will help make them stronger and more flexible.

, Hold this position for one minute or two to five seconds per set, depending on how many sets you intend to do. Keep your body completely rigid and don’t relax your muscles at all. Holding the position is when your lower back muscles get their greatest work out.

, After you’ve held this position for the predetermined amount of time, release it. You want to relax your muscles completely. This will give your muscles a break while also preparing them to undertake another set.







, Repeat this process of lifting and releasing. You should try to do at least three sets if you are holding the position for one minute. If you are holding for 2-5 seconds, repeat the process at least 5-10 times.








, To make this exercise more challenging, try lifting just your right leg and right arm at the same time. Hold and then alternate, lifting your left leg and left arm. This helps to target more specific muscle groups on the sides of your back.








, In order to start seeing or feeling the results, aim to do 3 sets, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. For faster results, increase the number of sets or times per week you do this exercise.

Not all personal trainers are willing or qualified to train for the sole purpose of building bulk.
A prospective trainer should also be made aware of your expectations. If you have a specific deadline you’d like to meet (for an upcoming competition, for instance), tell the trainer your deadline and desired training schedule.

, Not every bodybuilder is going to want a personal trainer, nor is every bodybuilder going to need a 24-hour gym. Find a gym that suits all of your needs, including business hours, training equipment, training instruction, and membership fees.

Bodybuilding does not have to drain your bank account, but it easily can. Make sure you keep your personal budget in mind when joining a gym, enlisting the help of a trainer, and paying competition fees and purchasing competition apparel.

, If you want to get into competitions, then it is important to know your body’s strengths and to be aware of what judges will be looking for. Look into the federation’s guidelines and attend a competition to see what the competitors look like.This will help you to design an effective training program along with the guidance of your trainer., If you have enlisted the help of a personal trainer, go to your first session and do exactly as you’re told. If you are following an exercise program, follow each of the instructions to the letter, and do each exercise to the best of your ability. Getting started is arguably the most difficult part of bodybuilding.If you are using a trainer, listen to their advice and follow the training plans they’ve set. These are likely to be difficult, but are set in a specific order and pattern to help your body build sustained, useful muscles.
Expect to start with basic exercises, such as squats and bench presses. These exercises allow you to gradually add more weight and provide significant gains.

, Track your progress via progress photos (ideally taken in the same lighting and clothing each week), weight gains, and measurement gains. Keep all of your gains and observations in a notebook or folder on your phone or computer so you have easy access and can check in with your progress any time.This may not seem like an important step, but being able to see physical changes in your body is an excellent way to keep your motivation high.
If possible, use the exact same pose in each of your photos, as well, as this will give you a more concrete visual of any possible changes.
Tracking your progress will also give you a window into which exercises and routines are effective, and which do not provide as many muscle gains.

, If you’ve managed a certain set of weights for a week, don’t immediately add another 20 pounds, as this could cause injury and could actually set your training back. Up your weight limits gradually, and stop if you feel any sharp pain or you are in danger of dropping your weights.Under the supervision of a trainer or partner, you might want to try dead lifting and similarly challenging lifts. If this is the case, be aware that these should never be done solo, and should not make up the bulk of your training.

, Although you might be tempted to train seven days a week, or even multiple times per day, this will actually slow down your progress and damage your muscles. Aim for four to five training times per week, varying the types of exercises you do. The human body is highly adaptable, so keeping your muscles guessing is a key aspect of bodybuilding and weightlifting.Although you should not do intense training regimens seven times per week, you should be in some way active each day, even if it something as simple as walking up stairs instead of using an elevator, or taking a walk around the block.

, Although you don’t have to contort yourself into a pretzel following each training session, you should stretch your body thoroughly, for at least 5 to 10 minutes., When aiming for four to five days of training per week, make sure you add some recovery time. One to three days, you can go for a leisurely walk or a relaxed jog. One out of the two to three days, you could swim or practice yoga. Make sure you set aside time for your body to rest and heal.Do not, under any circumstances, skip rest days. Your body will not be able to build muscle effectively if it does not have time to heal and repair itself. Because building muscle means creating tiny tears in muscle fiber, which then heals, failing to give your body adequate time to repair and rest will mean few gains and the risk of serious injury.

, Before you make any drastic changes to your diet, it is important to consult with a dietitian who has experience working with bodybuilders. They will be able to develop an eating plan for you that will help you to reach your goals., Highly processed, high-sodium foods will not give your body the energy required to maintain heavy weightlifting and exercising. If you want to steadily build muscle and eliminate body fat, you must say a firm “goodbye” to processed foods., If you avoid processed food, but still consume sugar or artificial sweeteners, you are also doing yourself a disservice. If you must sweeten your items, use natural sugars such as fruit, honey, and maple syrup. Make sure to use sugar sparingly.Whenever possible, opt for fresh over pre-made. Use meal prep such as chopping your food beforehand, or creating weekly lunches to encourage healthy eating habits.

, Protein is required to build and maintain muscle. Eating a low-protein diet will not allow you to build muscle mass and may actually lead to the loss of muscle mass and fatigue. While you do not need to eat a steak at every meal, you should incorporate meat, beans, dairy, eggs, and nuts into your diet.Eat protein wisely. A pound of bacon is not going to provide your body with the same nutrient content as a pound of lean, grass-fed beef.
Make sure you consume plant-based protein as well, through nuts, nut butters, soy, legumes (such as kidney beans, chickpeas, and lentils) and other plant proteins for a well-rounded diet.

, Although a high-protein diet is a must for bodybuilding, you should not eschew carbs altogether, as your body needs carbohydrates to build and process energy. Instead, make sure you are eating carbs wisely; a doughnut and a bowl of quinoa are not equals. When implementing carbs, aim for whole-grain, high-quality carbohydrates, including grains such as quinoa, brown rice, oats, and barley., While protein and carbohydrates often get most of the focus where bodybuilding and weight training are concerned, you absolutely need the vitamins and minerals found in fruits and vegetables. Make sure you are including a generous helping of fruits and vegetables in your diet, including at least one fruit or vegetable in each meal.

The best rule to follow when eating fruits and vegetables is to eat the rainbow--that is, to eat a wide variety of colors in both your fruit and vegetables.

, Throwing back a protein shake every morning is not a guarantee that your body will build muscle mass. Although protein shakes are not inherently bad, they are also not a magical means of building muscle. If you decide to implement a protein supplement in your diet, make sure the ingredients are high-quality (i.e. not riddled with sugar and empty carbs).While protein supplements can do a lot for a bodybuilder, they are not strictly necessary; while it may be difficult, it is possible to get all of the protein you need through a healthy diet and wise food choices.

Interlock the fingers of both arms.,
Lean and shift your weight to turn your body into a work of art.,
Pay attention to your walk.",How to Show off Your Muscles Without It Seeming Intentional1," Is it a little bit hot out today? Wipe your face with the bottom of your shirt to show off the ab muscles. Make sure you have them flexed before you lift your shirt. Be careful you don't get a lot of sweat on a cotton tee-shirt or else everyone will notice a big wet spot when you lower your top!


This move works well in the gym when you don't have a towel handy.
Be sure that your target audience is nearby and in your line of sight.
Make the motion quick but deliberate so it doesn't seem rehearsed.;
, Slowly fold your arms across your chest and push your wrists upwards a little bit.


This move accentuates both your biceps and, if you're wearing short sleeves, your forearms.
An arm-fold is a strong body language move. It conveys confidence!
It's also a movement that can be held for several minutes without seeming intentional.

, This also shows off all the muscles in your arms. Because it's such a quick motion, save it for moments when you want to get the maximum effect from whoever is watching.

, If you're wearing a T-shirt or tight-fitting top, interlock your fingers while facing the target audience. For extra flexing, keep your fingers interlocked and flip your hands around so that your palms face outward.


This pose shows off a combination of muscle groups in the upper body and makes you appear larger than normal.
It can be performed while standing or sitting down.
For added effect, raise your arms and turn the move into an overhead stretch.

, Lean against a wall with one arm fully extended and the palm of your hand flat against the surface. Bend your hips just a little bit.

, When you land on your left foot, your left leg should be straight and supporting most of your weight. At the same time, your right leg should be naturally bent. It may take some practice to make this look natural and unrehearsed.


When done right, it makes your quad muscles tense just before you land on your foot, causing your leg muscles to bulge when you walk. If done wrong it just looks awkward and jerky.
This works best if you are wearing knee-length shorts, or tight pants in a thin material or light color.

Dress to show off that bod while you're out on the town.,
Maintain your image to complement your physique.,
A confident attitude may be the most subtle yet powerful way to show off your muscles.",How to Show off Your Muscles Without It Seeming Intentional2," A suit, shirt, and tie can make even the fittest man look boxy and shapeless. A few easy tricks can show off your physique in the office without resorting to a pricey tailored suit:


Remove your jacket and hang it on the back of your chair. That's one less bulky garment between your build and your coworkers' eyes.
Long day at the office? Roll up the sleeves of your button down shirt to show off a bit while you get work done.
Men's' jeans and slacks of come in different cuts and styles. Find a pair that is your size but will show everyone your muscular thighs. Ditch the straight leg and relaxed fits for a boot cut or tapered leg.

, When you go out with friends or on a date, it's best to strike a balance between comfort and a fit snug enough to get attention. Avoid clothes that are so tight they look painted on. Not only are they less comfortable, but it could also look like you're trying too hard to get noticed.


Wear a tee shirt that's a size lower than what you usually wear. If you're a large, go for a medium. V-neck tees are also a good way to show off your chest definition.
Tank tops are a good way to put your arms, shoulders, and chest on display. Even in colder weather, wear a tank top under an open button-down shirt to show off a little chest definition.
If you've really been hitting leg days hard, show off with a short bathing suit at the beach. Board shorts are popular but don't show off anything above the knee. Try some shorter, square cut trunks instead.
Does cold weather gear make you feel bulky in the worst way? Keep the heavy winter coat around for the dead of winter, but in cool autumn weather just layer your upper body with some long sleeve tees or thermals.

, You may have the muscles, but other features can distract from your bulk if left unchecked. Make other features complement, not compete. Do your best to keep your image clean cut.


Intensify your level of hygiene, especially if you work out all the time. Shower every day and shave as often as you need to.
Some scruff is okay, but keep beards neat and trimmed. Unkempt facial hair will draw attention away from your build.
Get a haircut. Hairstyles come and go, but short or trimmed hair is usually a look more associated with athletic guys.
Get some new eyewear. Instead of staring at your guns, people might be starting at your thick Coke bottle glasses. Contact lenses or Lasik eye surgery are options if you're tired of glasses.
A well-placed tattoo on a bicep or shoulder is a feature that will help draw eyes toward your arms.

, Body language speaks volumes. Don't shrink your body by slouching. Stand up straight and pull your shoulders back. Look people in the eye when you talk to them. When combined, these small actions let others know that you are someone worth noticing!

Put in extra time working on muscles that stand out.,
Blast your triceps.,
Build up your chest.,
Tone your calves.,
Strengthen your back.",How to Show off Your Muscles Without It Seeming Intentional3," If there's a feature of your build that you want to accentuate, really focus on it at the gym! The quickest and most effective way to really build up a specific muscle is to target it with isolation exercises.An isolation exercise uses one muscle group almost completely. The movements isolate one muscle so it is doing all of the work to lift a weight.


Isolate a muscle that you're already proud of and would like to pump up even more!
Isolation exercises are the opposite of compound exercises, which require the use of multiple muscles and joints at once.Most experts recommend starting a workout with compound exercises first, followed by isolation exercises that zero in on one specific muscle.Focus on isolating one muscle group at a time. Devote about 4 weeks per area to really see results.

, When it comes to big arms, biceps get all the glory. But a double bicep flex is also an obvious, over-the-top way to show off your muscles. Biceps and triceps are opposing muscle groups; when one is working and flexing, the other is relaxed.The secret to noticeable arms is your triceps - when you stand with your arms at your sides, triceps are the ones doing the flexing! Work them hard in the gym with dips:


Grasp each parallel dip bar with one hand, palms facing inward.
With your feet suspended in the air, slowly lower your body by bending your elbows. Stop when your upper arms are parallel to the ground.
Press upward to raise your body back to the starting position where your arms are fully extended. That is one repetition, or rep.
Perform 4 sets of 6-8 reps.

, A ripped chest is a physical feature that is noticeable with or without a shirt. You'll see a lot of guys in the gym waiting in line for the bench press just to get those perfect pecs. It's a time honored compound exercise, but fly's are a chest isolation exercise:


Lie with your back flat on a bench with a dumbbell in both hands. Hold the dumbbells over your chest with your arms fully extended.
Slowly lower the dumbbells toward your sides, keeping your elbows bent. Stop when your elbows stick out in an ""L"" shape away from your torso.
Raise the dumbbells back up until your arms are fully extended over your chest. That's one rep.
Perform 4 sets of 6-8 reps.
Changing the slope of the bench while doing dumbbell fly's will isolate different areas of the pectoral muscles. Use a bench with an adjustable angle.

, Your legs have a lot of different muscles, but most people only see them below the knee when you're wearing shorts. Your calves are the most visible part of your legs during warm weather and in the gym. Get them toned and defined for next summer by doing calf raises:


Sit on a bench, box, or chair holding a dumbbell on top of each knee.
Keep the dumbbell still and slowly raise your knee until your lower leg is on tiptoe.
Lower the knee until your foot is flat on the floor again. Repeat the motion with your other leg. That's one rep.
Perform 3 sets of 10-12 reps per leg.
Unlike a lot of other muscle groups, for best results you only need to devote one exercise in your workout to calves., Back muscles don't often get a lot of whistles and second looks, but they serve a crucial role. The best back exercises have a positive effect on your posture.A strong back will help you stand up straight and show off a lot of other muscles in the process! Good posture also makes you appear more confident to others. Try this classic barbell row:


Lean forward with feet shoulder width apart and knees slightly bent. To help keep your back flat, raise your head and look forward.
Hold a barbell in an overhand grip with your hands about shoulder width apart.
Slowly pull the barbell upward until it touches your belly. Do your best to keep your elbows tight against your body while you pull.
Lower the bar back down to the starting position. That's one rep.
Perform 4 sets of 6-8 reps.

Grow a beard.,
Stay lean.,
Dress up.",How to Look Hot Without Muscles1," Studies show that women tend to find men with beards more masculine and attractive. However, a long beard often suggests that the man is of a low socio-economic status. Women are most attracted to light beards or heavy stubble. In other words, grow a beard, but keep it nice and trimmed.Electronic trimmers designed for beards are available at most drug stores. These have settings that are adapted to keeping a short beard, close to the face.;
, Even if you don’t want to build muscle, you should aim to stay thin. Walk daily and consider jogging. Cut down on the number of calories you eat, while increasing how much protein you consume.


Avoid eating late dinners and try to walk after you eat to help metabolize your meal.
You’ll be less likely to overeat if eat breakfast and snack throughout the day. Snacks should be high in protein, low in sugar.
Eat whole grain breads and cereals instead of processed white breads. Such products should list “whole wheat” flour on the ingredient list, rather than “enriched” or “bleached” flour., Your clothes are important for showing off your physique and establishing your social status.It is important to find something that both fits your body and suggests that you are a person with status.


V-Neck sweaters are a good mix of causal and classy. Although they look less intimidating than a full suit, they have a studious and serious look to them.
A button up shirt with dress pants and a tie is also a professional, but semi-casual look that can be adapted to many environments. Rolled up sleeves create a more casual look and show off your forearms. Your shirt should be tucked in and your belt should match your shoes.
For a really casual look, try a white t-shirt with jeans. Both should be tight enough to show off your body, but not so tight that they are uncomfortable or show too much."

Look strong and inviting.",How to Look Hot Without Muscles2," Women have been shown to find men more attractive when they smile, but how you do it also counts. Men who flashed a quick smile were perceived as less honest. A smile that grows slowly over time is perceived as more authentic and hotter., Women find men more attractive when they are part of a group. If you go to the bar with a group of friends--or at least post pictures of yourself with other people--women are more likely to perceive you as socially successful (i.e. ""cool""). Furthermore, women will be less attentive to your undesirable physical features because they will focus on the group as a wholeAlong the same lines, refrain from taking selfies. Men who post selfies receive fewer responses on dating websites. Even if you can't find a good picture of yourself, at least try for a picture that was obviously taken by someone else., Men have been found to be considerably more attractive when they are interacting with a baby or walking a dog. Men who seem to get along with babies are more likely to be perceived as good caretakers and potential fathers. Men with dogs are also perceived as good caretaker and your canine friend can be a great conversation starter., Studies show that when men spread out, with their legs wide and the arms stretched out, they are perceived as sexier. This sort of posture conveys dominance, which women tend to appreciate., To project strength, maintain keep your back straight and your shoulders squared. Keep your legs open, more than shoulder width apart, and don't put your hands in your pocket. To project availability, keep your arms and legs uncrossed. Refrain from looking down at the ground.

Live an outdoorsy lifestyle.",How to Look Hot Without Muscles3," Evidence shows that attractive women often gravitate toward less attractive men with wealth and status.You should make your accomplishments obvious. Studies have shown, for example, that women find men considerably more attractive when they are driving a fancy car., The “halo effect” suggests that attractive people are considered better in all areas of their life.However, it also seems to work the other way. That is, if you exhibit positive personality traits, like kindness, people will be more likely to see you as attractive.Try volunteering for non-profits or pursuing a career that helps people. If you have trouble committing the time to those things, just aim to be nice in your daily life. Hold doors open for people, help people with bags, or show people how to get around when they are lost.

, Women are more likely to find men attractive when they open up to them and appear vulnerable. When you are open about your feelings women will feel closer to you, making you more attractive both emotionally and sexually., Men are often initially regarded as a threatening. To put women at ease you should take a cautious stance: speaking and moving slowly, using small gestures, and leaning away. Once she suggests that she is at ease by leaning in, making eye contact, and smiling, you can change your posture. Act more energetic, speak faster, make broad gestures, and lean forward., Women are attracted to leaders, particularly when men are in charge of a group that they are part of. Not everyone can be the CEO of a corporation. But if you have a leadership role in a club, campus organization, or political group, women will be more likely to see you as a leader., Humor is a sign of intelligence and social skill. Women look to men who are funny as both people of status and someone whose company they will enjoy. Cultivating a sense of humor is important to establish relationships.Pay attention to comedians you enjoy, think about what makes them funny, and consider whether you can imitate their style. Read and watch TV to stay informed so that you have things that you can make jokes about. Work on some funny stories that you can tell people you meet., Playing hard to get works; women find men more desirable if they think that they’re unobtainable. They also, however, enjoy knowing that someone likes them. The way you make the best of these two facts is to make it seem like you are generally difficult to get, but that you are super into whoever you are with., When a woman is excited around you, she will transfer those feelings to you, even if you are not actually responsible. Take her to a scary movie or a roller coaster; try something new with her like zip lining. Just being with her when these things happen will build positive associations and make you seem exciting., Because of evolution, many women still have a primitive desire for men who can live the hunter-gather lifestyle. Learn how to fish, hunt, chop wood, start fires, or swim in the wild. These sort of traits make you seem more brawny, and, in a way, like a capable provider."

Warm up before you work out.,
Stretch the muscles you plan to exercise.,
Evaluate your workout environment.,
Check your form and technique.,
Work on your posture and flexibility.,
Shorten the duration of your workout.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps During Exercise1," Muscles that aren't sufficiently warmed up before you start working out may have the tendency to cramp more. Particularly if you're about to engage in strenuous or endurance-based exercise, adequate warm-up is crucial to preventing muscle cramps.The type of warm up you do depends on your overall workout. For example, if you're going for a run, walking for five to 10 minutes before your run is a good warm-up.
Jumping jacks or jogging in place are good warm-ups for other aerobic activity.
For strength training, do five minutes of arm and leg circles, shallow squats, and knee bends, kicking your foot forward and back. Follow this with some slow sit-ups, side bends, or push-ups.;
, If you're doing light, casual exercise, additional stretching typically isn't necessary following a warm up; however, before engaging in strength training or vigorous activity, do active stretching to engage the active muscle groups.It is important to note that stretches should be dynamic (moving through a range of motion) and not static (lengthening the muscle and holding while you are at rest). Static stretching can lead to injury and impede your performance.


For example, if you're going for a run, you want to stretch your leg muscles, particularly your hamstrings, calves, and quads. Try hip circles, walking lunges, butt kicks, and legs swings.On the other hand, for upper body strength training, you want to stretch your shoulders, neck, chest and back. Try big arm circles, arm swings, and chest openers.

, Where you work out is just as important as what you do during your exercise routine when it comes to preventing muscle cramps. Your muscles are more likely to cramp if you are exercising in extreme conditions.Your environment is particularly important if you're exercising outside. Significant changes in temperature or humidity can affect how your muscles perform.
If it's significantly hotter or colder than it normally is when you exercise, shorten or adapt your routine accordingly to account for the fact that your muscles will not be working to their full potential.
Generally, the hotter it is, the more you'll sweat. Dehydration and depletion of electrolytes in this environment can overwork your muscles and lead to cramps.
Even if you're in peek physical condition, running outside in a hot and humid environment can lead to cramps.

, If you consistently have the same muscles cramp up, your form may be to blame. Exercises done incorrectly can cause muscle cramps. To check your technique, work out in front of a mirror or call on a personal trainer.Particularly if you're a runner, you may be getting cramps because of the position of your foot as you're running. This typically isn't something you'll notice on your own, especially if it has become habit.
A certified personal trainer can observe your exercises and give you advice on how to tweak your technique. Even a relatively minor ""cheat"" in form can have significant consequences.
You may not be able to afford to work out with a trainer every day, but if cramps are a continuous problem and nothing else you've done seems to eliminate them, hire a trainer for a single session to diagnose your problem and offer solutions.

, Joint misalignment due to tightness may also be the cause of your cramping. This is often a result of poor posture or injuries not properly healed. Regular stretching can help. Consider taking a yoga class a few times a week to help increase your flexibility and posture.


One quick trick to improve your posture is to imagine there is a string attached to the top of your head. Imagine this string is gently tugging you upward. This should cause you to lift your head and bellybutton and pull your shoulders back.
As we get older our connective tissues are less elastic. People use tools such as foam rollers to “iron out” those tight spots.
Massage therapy may also help with recurring muscle cramps.

, More often than not, muscle cramps are caused by muscle fatigue. Your muscles may become fatigued if they're overworked, or if you're pushing yourself too hard during your workouts.This is an easy fix if you notice that you always cramp up at roughly the same point in your workout.
For example, if you try to go on 45-minute runs, but usually get a cramp around the 30-minute mark, you probably should shorten your runs to 30 minutes for awhile.
You also may be able to prevent muscle cramps during exercise by decreasing the intensity of your workout routine.
Once you make the adjustment, stick to the shorter or less intense routine for a few weeks, then gradually build up to your goal.

Hydrate yourself.,
Consume a healthy diet with plenty of Carbs.,
Consider taking creatine to get the most of your workout.,
Be sure to fully recover after each set during your workout.,
Train progressively.,
Fuel up after your workout.",How to Maximize Your Bodybuilding Workout," You should drink a minimum of two glasses of water (about 16 ounces) prior to your workout as well as throughout. You will know if you are properly hydrated by the color of your urine (darker means improperly hydrated). If you don’t properly hydrate yourself before and during your workout, you will get dehydrated and the result can be a less effective workout –studies show that performance can decrease up to 15-20%. Don’t risk it—get and stay hydrated.;
, While cardio workouts require a relatively empty stomach beforehand, a bodybuilding session is the opposite—athletes need to fuel up with carbs and protein before their workout. If gaining mass is what you are aiming for, you need to take in plenty of fast-digesting carbs like white rice, bagels, bread or protein drinks. Combine the carbs with some protein and you are fueled up to have the energy you need to maximize your workout session.

, Creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is generated in the body and is a key to building the big muscles body builders are striving for. It comes in powder form, which you take an hour before and mix in with a fruit or protein drink or a faster-absorbing liquid form, which can be consumed about 20 minutes before your workout. You can purchase both powder and liquid form creatine at a reputable online supplement retailer.

, Less-experienced body builders tend to rush through sets but to fully get the benefit of each set, you need to give the muscle (s) adequate time to recover so it can give you the best results from your workout session.

, This means to increase weight when you are ready and do it gradually—one to two pounds at a time not five or ten pounds. You want to stress the muscle so it continues to grow otherwise you will lose motivation and development will be stalled. It helps to record your workouts so you can see the progression.

, Plan ahead what you will be eating after your workout. Your post-workout meal should include protein, carbs and healthy fats. For optimal recovery, choose easily digested proteins like whey protein drink, egg whites and fish for immediate recovery and then add some slower digesting protein sources like whole eggs, chicken or mean about an hour later. If you have carbs, choose more complex carbs and include good fats like olive oil, avocados, fatty fish like salmon and olives.

After you are completely done, take a cold shower and/or bath.",How to Lift Weights," When you're first getting started lifting, it's difficult to know how much weight to lift. You don't want to start with too much and max out after only a few reps, because multiple repetitions are the proper way to build muscle. Likewise, you don't want to lift weight that is too light for you. To choose the proper amount of weight will take some practice.


Figure out how many reps are appropriate for the routine you're working on. If you're doing bench presses, you'll want to do more than 3 or 4 reps to build muscle, so you'll need to find an amount of weight you'll be able to lift 10, 15, or 20 times before you experience muscle failure.
Muscle failure is the point at which you physically cannot perform another unaided rep. The more you lift, the more familiar you'll become with your muscle failure point, and the more you'll be able to push it.
Ideally, muscle failure will occur immediately following your last intended rep. Choose the heaviest weight that you can lift for the intended number of reps.;
, Getting a workout done quickly isn't the best way to maximize the good effects of lifting. Don't rush your way through your lifts, which risks injury and ends up being a waste of time. Doing fewer reps slowly and properly is better than maxing out on super-heavy lifts and getting done in record time.









For a good workout, set aside at least an hour. Don't work out more than a few hours, and try to work out for a solid thirty minutes to ensure a healthy routine.

,


Do make sure you aren't exercising on an empty stomach either, or you won't have the energy to preform the exercises. Have a meal 1 to 2 hours prior to exercising, and just a little snack of fruit 15 minutes before you start if you are hungry again.

, This will get more oxygen in your bloodstream and to your muscles. It also prevents -or at least reduces- muscle soreness after your workout.









A typical warm up will move all of the joints that you plan to work out through their full range of motion. For example, if you are working on your shoulders, you might do shoulder rolls and jumping jacks.
A warm-up should also elevate your heart rate, so that there is an increase in the blood supply to both the connective tissues and muscles.

, This should stretch the muscles you just worked out. The goal is to gradually lower your heart rate again and prepare your body for a rest.








, The bench press is probably the most popular work out move, and it involves lifting weight straight up from your chest while laying on your back, usually on a weightlifting bench. It's a smart idea to use a spotter to help you rack and unrack the weight, especially if you're new to lifting and haven't gotten a good sense of how much you can lift yet.








Grab the bar firmly, shoulder width apart. You need to hold the bar quite tightly to create tension and flex in your biceps, shoulders, and torso muscles. Take a deep breath, driving your arms upwards and pulling your shoulder blades back and down into the bench.
Plant your feet. Move the bar directly over your chest and keep your muscles tight.
Without dropping it, lower the weight in as straight a line as possible, slowly and evenly, until it reaches your chest. Without allowing your chest to collapse or losing any tension, push up with your arms, driving the bar to its ""up"" position.
Start with an amount of weight you can easily lift to practice developing your form. Always use a spotter, especially in the beginning as you're just getting started.

, Dumbbell presses involve a similar technique to the bench press, but involve lifting a single dumbbell in each hand, rather than lifting one weight with both hands together. This is an excellent way to build muscle balance between your left and right sides. While your strong arm can compensate for the weaker one while doing the bench press, the dumbbells work both arms equally.









Take a dumbbell of an appropriate weight in each hand and lift them straight up from your chest in a reclined position. Lower them slowly and steadily until each dumbbell touches your chest between your shoulder and nipple. Bring them back up until they touch again, straight up above you.
For a different but similar work out, do some chest curls by keeping your arms perfectly straight and lowering them out to your sides. The dumbbell press is more like a push-up while the curl is more like you're flapping your wings.
To work a slightly different muscle group, also consider doing both bench and dumbbell presses on an inclined bench. The technique will be basically the same, but you'll lift at a different angle to your body to make the bar or bells go straight up, which will work different muscles.

, To build your biceps, do curls from a standing or seated position. With an appropriate amount of weight, let the dumbbell hand down at your side, one in each hand and bring it up to your chest by flexing your bicep.









The dumbbell should be parallel to your side. To bring it up to your chest, rotate the dumbbell so your palm faces your chest as you lift it.
You can either alternate arms or you can do several reps with each arm before switching.

, Dumbbell rows are a smart exercise to round out your arm workout. They will work the sides of the back as well as the backs of the shoulders. This exercise involves lifting dumbbells with each arm up from the ground toward your chest in a kneeling position. Work one arm at a time.









Get onto your hands and knees, either on the ground or kneeling on a weight bench.
Take a dumbbell of appropriate weight in your hand and lift it from the ground up to your chest before lowering it. Continue for one set of 8 to twelve reps. Switch sides after you finish the set.

, Most gyms will have squat stations available for you to work out your quadriceps, the large muscle group in your legs. This is another exercise that's important to have a spotter on hand for, especially when you're first starting out. Using the same kind of free weight involved in the bench press, take the weight onto your shoulders in a standing position.









While the weight is still racked, put your hands in the same positioning as you would for a bench press, and duck under it, putting the bar across your shoulders and behind your head. The bar should rest on the fleshy trapezius muscles immediately below the back of your neck and between the shoulders.
Lift the weight from off the rack and take a steady step backward. Place your feet shoulder-width apart and keep your head forward. It's important to keep your back very straight during this exercise or you can risk straining it.
To perform the squat, bend your knees and hips, taking your thighs parallel to the ground. Pause for a second before pushing yourself back up into a standing position.
When doing the squat, make sure you can always see the tops of your shoes. If you can't, your knees are moving too far forward. Your ankles and knees must line up vertically.

, Start this exercise with a lighter weight than you used for the squat. Using a similar technique to the squat, take the bar on your back, in front of a box, sturdy bench, or a raised platform.








With your feet hip-width apart, raise one knee up and plant your foot down onto the box. Your thigh should be parallel to the floor. Step up and bring your other foot onto the box or the raised surface.
Reverse the motion by bending your leading knee and and hip and carefully stepping back with your leg.

, Doing a basic lunge exercise while holding dumbbells as if you were about to do a bicep curl can be a great exercise for your whole leg. Keep your back straight, your torso flexed, and your head and feet forward to do a lunge with the proper form.









To perform the lunge, step forward with one foot, heel first.
Lower yourself slowly, until your legs are bent at 90 degrees.
Push back with your lead foot and straighten your legs. Stand up straight to complete the rep. Do the same number of reps on both sides.

, Try to make a routine that you will be able to follow, and that you'll be excited to work on. For example, you might structure your week this way:










Monday: Concentrate on Back and Triceps.

Tuesday: Concentrate on Legs.

Wednesday: Concentrate on Chest and Biceps.

Thursday: Concentrate on Abs.

Friday: Concentrate on Shoulders.

Saturday: Rest.

Sunday: Rest.

, After about a week of lifting, you will notice that it has become easier to do the same exercises with the same weights. Continue with these exercises and weights until the end of the week, making sure you are doing it with the right form. After this week, add some weights to what you were already using. It shouldn't bee too much, just enough to make it just as tough as your first week.









You will want to use weights which are still comfortable to use, but heavy enough to 'only' let you do three or four sets of 8-12 reps each.
You use the same weights for a total of two weeks, doing the same exercises.
Add some more weights, and use these for the next two weeks, doing the same exercises.

, Get the weight heavy enough to do a maximum of 12-15 reps. Then, do pyramid sets with the weights, doing a set of 5, then 1 set of 10, 1 set of 15, before working your way down again. Rest between your sets for 30 seconds to a minute.









After the minute of rest between sets, do another pyramid set that trains the same muscle groups with the same amount of reps and rest. After these three sets, move on to another muscle group.

, This will help you relax and will also make your arteries in and around your muscles expand, which allows oxygen to flow in more easily and let the acids that developed in your muscles flow out easier.

Use caution if you are on a low-carb diet.,
Have a carbohydrate snack before exercising.,
Ingest carbs during lengthy or intense exercise.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps During Exercise2," There are many diets out there that like to paint carbs as the enemy; however, if you're engaging in strenuous exercise on a regular basis, your muscles need carbs to recover.Your body stores carbs for your muscles to use as fuel. Casual exercise, such as brief walks, typically don't deplete these stores significantly.
However, intense strength training or long-distance running or biking will burn through your carbohydrate stores, particularly if you're on a low-carb diet.
Speak with a doctor or a nutritionist if you're on a low-carb diet and want to begin intense training or endurance activities. They can help you tweak your diet to ensure you're consuming the carbs you need.

, While you typically shouldn't exercise less than two hours after eating a larger meal, a small snack rich in carbohydrates a half-hour or so before you start your workout provides sufficient fuel for your muscles.A banana is a good snack to have before exercising. Bananas not only have a sufficient amount of carbohydrates, they also are high in potassium. Potassium reduces inflammation and can help prevent muscle cramps during exercise.
Yogurt or dried fruit also provides the nutrition you need in a pre-workout snack.
A number of companies market energy or nutrition bars for pre-workout snacks. If you decide to go this route, check the ingredient list carefully and make sure the bar has what you need. Avoid energy bars that have a lot of added sugar or fat, which you don't need.

, Particularly if you're engaging in an endurance sport such as marathon running or long-distance biking, you should ingest carbs between the 60- and 90-minute mark of your race or training session.Generally your body will wipe out its carbohydrate stores within an hour of intense or strenuous exercise. Failure to replenish these stores can result in muscle cramps.
To prevent muscle cramps, have a banana or a carb-rich energy bar during your exercise. If solid food is difficult for you to consume in the midst of your workout, bring along a carb-rich shake or sports drink that you can have.

Start your workout well-hydrated.,
Measure your fluid loss.,
Rely on your thirst during workouts.,
Drink high-sodium sports drinks or electrolyte-enriched water.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps During Exercise3," If you're already dehydrated when you begin your workout, it won't really matter how much water you drink while you're exercising. Drink between 17 and 20 ounces (500 and 600 ml) of water two to three hours before your workout starts.You also should follow up with another 7 to 10 ounces (200 to 300 ml) of water within 10 to 20 minutes before you start exercising.
Plain water typically is best for pre-exercise hydration. You may want to use energy drinks if you are about to engage in endurance sports such as marathon running or long-distance biking.
For endurance sports, you want to retain water, which means you need the sodium that sports drinks provide.

, To get an idea of how much fluid your body loses during your workout, weigh yourself before you begin exercising and again when your workout is over. The difference between those two numbers is the amount of fluid you've lost.Losing too much fluid during your workout may be a reason your muscles are cramping. Keep your fluid loss in check by drinking water or sports drinks while you're exercising.
If you drink sports drinks, remember to water them down, as they are often packed with sugar. Experts say 6 parts water to one part sports drink, but even half and half is better than the full concentrate.
Generally, you shouldn't lose more than 2 percent of your body weight in fluid while exercising. If the number is too high, you may need to adjust the duration or intensity of your workout.
Another way to decrease fluid loss is to exercise in a different location. If you're exercising outside, you'll sweat more during the hottest months than you will when it's cooler. If you're sweating too much, shorten your workout during hot conditions or move your workout inside.

, The easiest way to make sure you're drinking enough fluid is to bring water or a sports drink with you when you exercise. When you feel thirsty, go ahead and gulp some water. While you might think gulping water would cause cramps, it may actually be preferable — gulps of fluid may leave the stomach more rapidly than water that is sipped.Water bottles for exercise usually hold between 16 to 34 oz (500 ml to 1 liter).
Ideally, you should drink enough to quench your thirst and then stop. Give your body time to absorb the water before you drink again.
Serious athletes may need to drink around 50 oz (1.5 liters) of water for every hour of exercise.

, If you're engaging in strenuous activity or endurance sports, water alone may not provide everything you need to rehydrate your body completely.While most of sweat is water, you do lose some electrolytes through sweat. Sports drinks are a good way to replenish these lost electrolytes as well as those that you burn through exercise.
When purchasing sports drinks, avoid those that contain significant amounts of added sugar. Plain water infused with electrolytes can be a better choice if you're trying to stay away from sugar completely.
The key electrolyte in sports drinks is sodium, which encourages your body to retain fluid. This helps ensure your muscles are well-hydrated and can prevent cramps during exercise.

Heavier weight training is best left for puberty, when hormonal changes make for optimum muscle growth. If you're a late bloomer, get ahead of the game by strengthening and toning your muscles now!
Work out for periods of 30-45 minutes. That should be enough time for at least a few different exercises.
Work out 2-3 times per week for 4-6 weeks. Give yourself 1-2 days off between workouts to allow your muscles to rest, recuperate, and grow.
The simplest exercises use body weight as resistance to strengthen your muscles.Check out some examples below.;
, Stretch out your body face down on the floor. Put your palms flat on the floor close to your shoulders. With your legs straight and your toes touching the floor, push your upper body up and away from your hands until your arms are nearly extended. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position. That's one repetition, or rep.


Complete a set of 6-10 reps. Rest for 1-2 minutes, then try to complete another set of 6-10 reps.
Try to keep your body as straight as you can, with your back, butt, and legs all in a line.
Push-ups are a classic exercise to strengthen the muscles of the shoulders, arms, and chest. Proper form also helps stabilize the abdominal muscles.

, Lie flat on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground next to each other. Cross your arms over your chest. Keeping your legs still, bend up from your stomach until you are looking straight ahead at your knees. Slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position. That's one rep.


Complete a set of 8-12 reps. Rest for 1-2 minutes, then try to complete another set of 8-12 reps.
For an extra challenge, hold both hands behind your head as you sit up.
Sit-ups focus on strengthening the abdominal muscles, also known as your core.

, Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Hold your hands a few inches in front of your chest for balance. Keep your back as straight and vertical as you can while slowly bending your knees. Lower your body until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor, then push yourself back up to a standing position.


Complete a set of 10-15 reps. Rest for 1-2 minutes, then try to complete another set of 10-15 reps.
As you bend and straighten your legs, try to keep your weight balanced on your heels instead of your toes or the balls of your feet.
Squats help strengthen the leg and butt muscles.
Squat exercises are a fundamental part of weightlifting, so it's a good idea to perfect your form early on with this exercise!

, Dumbbells aren't the only type of portable workout equipment. The right tools can add more resistance to your body weight workouts and expand the number of exercises in your workout repertoire! The following items can be bought at most fitness stores and are much cheaper than weights or machines.


Medicine balls come in a variety of sizes and weights. Hold one against your chest for extra resistance while you do sit-ups.
Grip strengtheners are basically springs with a handle on each end. Hold one with your thumb around one handle and your four fingers around the other handle. Slowly squeeze the two handles together to perform 1 rep. Start with a set of 10-15 reps with one hand, then do a set with your other hand.
Take your squats to the next level with a resistance band!Stand with both feet shoulder width apart on a resistance band, and hold the ends in front of you at shoulder height. Use the same form and range of motion as a body weight squat.

, Yes, you'll want to save your everyday clothes from becoming a sweaty, smelly mess. But to properly develop strength and promote flexibility, exercises should always be performed through a full range of motion.Wear loose, breathable clothing that won't restrict your movements. Light shorts, sweatpants, and tee shirts are ideal.

, Ask a trainer or an assistant there to give you some advice. No beginning weightlifter should exercise without some guidance or supervision! Everyone is different, and an expert will help you figure out a weightlifting routine that is appropriate for your age and experience level.


School gyms often have teachers or other staff that will provide you with input or even personal training at no cost to you! They are there to help you, so take advantage of their expertise!
Make staff aware of any health conditions you might have. Such details are often covered on waivers and other entry forms used by the facility.
If you have already been working out at home using body weight or light resistance, let them know. Someone may ask you to demonstrate a few exercises in order to check your form and offer pointers.

, Because of the hormonal changes that take place during puberty, teenage bodies are primed for a lot of potential muscle growth. Take advantage of growth spurts with compound exercises that require the use of multiple muscles and joints at once.Here are three of the most fundamental compound exercises in the weight room:


Bench Press
Squats
Deadlifts
Combine them with lighter strength training exercises like pushups, pullups, and sit-ups to challenge your body with a broader range of movement.

, Focusing your effort on certain muscle groups during one gym session gives other parts of your body time to rest and recover. There are different ways to split things up:


A workout based on different body parts. For example, work chest muscles Monday, legs Wednesday, arms Friday, and back muscles Sunday.
Workouts that pair muscle groups together. Work out abs and legs on Tuesday, back and biceps on Thursday, chest and triceps on Saturday.
Over the course of a week, you should be able to work every muscle group in your body at least once.

, Pulling motions work the back muscles and the biceps muscles in your arms.


Pushing exercises include bench presses and pushups.
Pulling exercises include different types of rows.
Alternate ""push"" and ""pull"" days at the gym.
Core exercises and cardio can be given their own day in the gym, or thrown in with any of the specific muscle group days.

, Progress through your workout routine by regularly increasing weight, the number of sets, or the number of exercises. Muscle fibers can only get bigger by continually pushing them to new limits.This is called muscle hypertrophy.


In the first four weeks, spend each workout performing 3 sets of 4 exercises for a total of 12 sets. Then add a 4th set to each muscle group exercise for maximal gains.For the best muscle gains, do 8-12 reps per set.Do fewer reps than you would for light strength training.
Start out with a comfortable weight and slowly increase the weight for each set. When you can perform 8-12 reps with no trouble, your muscles have gotten used to that weight. It's time to add more!
Keep a log of your workouts so you can accurately increase the weight each time.

, Muscles groups are challenged week to week by increasing the weight of each rep, or the number of sets your perform. But even if you increase weight, your body still becomes used to the overall routine you've been doing. Hypertrophy should also be a long-term goal if you want to get bigger, so it's best to change up your workout routine every 12 weeks.


It's okay to keep a couple of exercises from your last workout plan, but try to choose as many new exercises as you can.
You can also try a different split routine. If you have been working every body part on a separate day, pair them up.
Many exercises have variations that can be done using dumbbells, machines, or resistance bands. Shoulder presses are a good exercise to modify in this manner.
To give all muscle groups time to recover, add a few days of extra rest between your old and new workout routines.

, Keep your body supplied with a constant source of fuel, especially when you're going to be shocking your muscles by building strength and muscle mass. Don't skip any meals!


With main meals and snacks, try to eat an average of 5-6 times a day for maximum muscle growth.
Prepare snacks and quick meals ahead of time to keep your diet on track.
To re-fuel your body and repair your muscles immediately after a strenuous workout, keep a post-workout protein bar or shake handy.
Many different protein bars are available in stores if you need a last-minute snack. Check labels for details on protein content and other nutrition information.

, 55% of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates, 25% should come from protein, and 20% should come from healthy fats.That may seem like a lot of carbs, but they're your body's main energy source. You need a lot of carb energy to ensure that your body doesn't have to start consuming muscle-building protein for fuel.


Healthy carbs come from fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain cereals, breads, and oatmeal.
Protein in meals comes from chicken, lean red meat, and fish.
Healthy fats come from seeds, nuts, avocados, olive oil, and peanut butter.

, Supplements are meant to bolster the amount of protein and other nutrients that your body uses to repair and build up hypertrophic muscles. Use supplements in addition to a good meal, not as a substitute for one!Always discuss supplement usage with a coach, trainer, or parent before making them part of your muscle building regimen.

Protein shakes are a good way to ingest extra protein and other nutrients between meals. Protein powders can be purchased at any health food store or online.
Vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids are just as important to muscle building as protein. Multi-vitamins pack a lot of essential nutrients into a daily tablet. Tasteless fish oil pills are a good source of healthy fatty acids.

, Calorie counting is not a diet, but a way to keep track of the amount of energy that comes from food and the amount of energy used by your body.There are several ways to count calories. Many fitness websites and apps have built-in calculators to help you.
If daily calories from food total more than the daily number of calories you burn, you will gain weight.
To build noticeable muscle mass, try to increase your daily food intake by 300-500 calories per day.If daily calories from food total less than the daily number of calories you burn, you will probably lose weight. Never lower your calorie intake if your goal is to add muscle mass!

, Adolescents are constantly growing and so their metabolism can take more punishment than the average adult's. As long as you stay true to your workouts and maintain a balanced diet, chowing down on some junk food from time to time won't derail your muscle man goals.

, If you don't, you can spend all your free time in the gym and just end up looking like a bulky nerd. Believe it or not, there really is a middle ground between Clark Kent and Superman! Change your bookish style to complement the body you want.


Intensify your level of hygiene, especially since you plan to exercise on a regular basis. Shower after every workout.
Shave as often as you need to. Some scruff is okay, but unkempt facial hair is a nerdy look to be avoided.
Get a haircut. Hairstyles come and go, but short or trimmed hair is usually a look more associated with athletic guys. Ask a stylist or barber for advice.
Pay attention to small grooming details like keeping your nails neatly trimmed.

, Clothes make the man! Use trial and error to find styles that you're comfortable wearing but that will also make people stop and look twice at your physique.


Get some new eyewear. Contact lenses or Lasik eye surgery are options if you're tired of glasses. Otherwise, try going with a glasses frame that is in style.
Don't ditch the tee shirts. Tees with pop culture prints are a very popular style. Plus it can be fun to see how much better you fill out a shirt that used to hang off of you!
Match colors appropriately. An easy rule is to always match the color of your shoes and belt. Don't mix black shoes with a brown belt, or vice versa.
You may need new threads out of necessity as much as style. If your goal is to pack on the muscles and you're still a growing adolescent, be prepared to go through at least a few shirt and pant sizes.

, It's great that you want to make positive changes in your life, but be careful not to go from one extreme to the other. Don't give up on who you were, add to who you are!


Make sure to stay focused on schoolwork and not slack off. Be proud of your good grades and non-athletic talents. They're part of you who are.
Explore how exercise and science overlap. If you like to work out, the field of kinesiology could be a great career option for you!
Working out is a great way to socialize and meet new people. Good friends can start out as workout buddies you met at the gym.
Lead by example. Your fellow nerds may want to put on some muscle or try a sport but are afraid to. Maybe some jock at the gym is afraid to talk about his love of books. Your journey could be a source of inspiration to others who want to break out of their niche.

, Sure it's great to look in the mirror and see muscles where none were before. But think about how your new routine makes you feel. Are you more confident? Do you have more energy? Think about how working out change your self-image for the better.

Be aware of the types of resistance bands.,
Find your ideal resistance level.,
Look for recognizable brands when buying a resistance band.",How to Work out Pectoral Muscles With a Resistance Band1," Resistance bands are not expensive and are easy to buy online or in stores. However, it’s important that you find a resistance band that is made of high-quality materials that will not break or snap when you use it. There are two common types of resistance bands:


Basic resistance bands: These resistance bands are made of one long wide piece of rubber. They come in different lengths and have different resistance levels.
Tube resistance bands: These resistance bands are made of rubber or cord and vary in length. Most of these bands come with attachments or cuffs on each end for different workouts, with foam or plastic handles. Foam handles are ideal as the foam will act as cushioning against soreness or blisters after an intense workout.
You should purchase a resistance band with comfortable, padded handles if you are planning to do exercises that require a firm grip. Bands without handles are useful if you want to wrap the band or double it up for greater control over the resistance level.;
, Most resistance bands will be color coded to correspond with different resistance levels. However, not all manufacturers follow a color coded system so check the specifications on the resistance band before you buy it. The resistance levels are usually organized into four main categories: light, medium, heavy, and extra-heavy. Each level has a different amount of tension that can be accessed by the user while using the band during an exercise. Over time, you can move up to a higher level of resistance as you build muscle tone and body strength.


Light resistance bands are ideal for people who are just starting to work out, as well as elderly users or users who have suffered an injury and need light resistance as they recover. Light resistance bands allow the user to access three to six pounds of resistance. These bands are often color coded yellow or pink.
Medium resistance are good for users who have an established workout and want to integrate resistance band training into an existing exercise routine. These bands offer eight to ten pounds of resistance and are color coded green or red.
Heavy resistance bands work well for users who work out regularly and have a relatively strong muscle mass. These bands offer users 12 pounds or more of resistance and are color coded purple or blue.
Extra heavy resistance bands are ideal for experienced users who have used resistance bands before and are doing intense training. These bands can supply over 16 pounds of resistance and are color coded grey or black.

, If you are buying a resistance band in stores, you should try out several levels of resistance before purchasing one. Ask the salesperson for a recommendation on resistance level, based on your exercise routine and your fitness level. Often, recognizable sports brands will be a good indicator of high quality, though you should always try out the resistance band to make sure it is comfortable for you.


If you are buying a resistance band online, read the reviews of the product before you purchase it. Note how the product is rated for quality, durability, and comfort. You should also make sure that buyers are satisfied that the product is as advertised and comes in a resistance level that is suitable for their fitness goals.

Find a stable object that is tall and narrow.,
Do a standing pectoral fly.,
Try an incline pectoral fly.,
Do a decline pectoral fly.",How to Work out Pectoral Muscles With a Resistance Band2," Before you do pectoral fly exercises, you will need to find a workout area that has a tall and narrow object, like a pole or a pipe, that you can loop the resistance band around so it stays in place. The idea is to have the resistance band at chest level so you can work your pectoral muscles properly.


Make sure the object you choose is a stable and attached to the ground and/or the ceiling. You will be using it to help create resistance for your body to work against so you want to make sure it will not shift or move as you do the exercises.

, This is a good introductory exercise that will strengthen your pectoral muscles in two simple movements. This exercise is a good alternative to the pectoral resistance machines found at the gym.









Start by looping the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object. Hold each end of the resistance band in each hand so it is spread out to the distance of your arms. Make sure your arms are straight but your elbows are not locked. Your arms should be just below shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward so your hands meet in front of your chest. Try to keep a small bend in your elbows and your arms straight.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

, This is a variation on the standing pectoral fly where your arms stretch out and in at a 45 degree angle, instead of a 90 degree angle. You may need to find a stable object that will hold the resistance band at a lower angle, such as the bars in a stairwell or a doorknob that is secured well to a door.








Loop the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object at a 45 degree angle. Hold each end of the resistance band so it spreads out to the distance of your arms. Your arms should form a 45 degree angle and sit at just below your shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward, towards your head, so your hands meet in front of your chest at a 45 degree angle.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

, In this variation, you will moving your arms towards the ground, rather than towards your head. It may be easier to do this exercise if you kneel on the ground. You can use the same object you used for the incline pectoral fly. Make sure you loop the resistance band around the stable object well so it stays in place as you do this exercise.








Kneel down so you are on your knees facing away from the object and loop the resistance band so it is around one side of the stable object at a 45 degree angle. Hold each end of the resistance band so it spreads out to the distance of your arms. Your arms should form a 45 degree angle and sit at just below your shoulder height.
Breathe in as you bring both arms forward, towards the ground, so your hands meet in front of your chest at a 45 degree angle.
Breathe out as you return to the starting position with your arms straight on both sides.
Repeat these motions, breathing in and out, doing two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

Challenge yourself with military push ups using the resistance band.",How to Work out Pectoral Muscles With a Resistance Band3," To do this exercise, you will need to have access to an exercise bench that you can lift. If you do not have an exercise bench, you can use a regular bench as long as you can lift it and it can accommodate your body weight.Loop the resistance band so it is under the bench leg or legs closest to your head or upper body. Lie down on the bench and hold the ends of the resistance band in each hand. Your elbows should be bent and pointing away from you.
Breathe in as you extend your arms so they are straight above you. Then, breathe out as you pull your arms back in so your elbows are bent and pointing away from you.
Repeat these movements for two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

, This exercise is great if you have limited gym equipment and are looking for a way to work your pectoral muscles. You will need access to a stable object that you can use as a point of resistance during this exercise.Loop the resistance band around one side of the object so it is at a 45 degree angle. You can also do this exercise with the resistance band at a 90 degree angle if you cannot find a stable object with a low bar.
Hold both ends of the resistance band so the handles are facing horizontal in your hands and your elbows are tucked in close to your body.
Breathe in as you extend your arms so they are straight in front of you. Then, breathe out as you pull your arms back towards you so your elbows are bent and tucked close to your body.
Repeat these movements for 10 to 15 reps.

, Try this exercise if you are a beginner at resistance band use and are looking to build your pectoral muscle mass. Doing push ups on the ground can be difficult if you are just starting to work out, so try standing pushups against a wall or a door first.


Loop the resistance band around your body so it is under your shoulder blades against the mid area of your back. Hold the resistance band handles so your hands are just under the handles and place your hands against a wall or a door. Stand with your legs straight behind you and close together. Your body should form a slight angle with the door or wall.
Breathe in and push your hands against the wall as you lower your body towards the wall. Breathe out as you lift your body away from the wall.
Repeat these movements for 10 to 15 reps.

, Once you feel comfortable with the push up position on the wall, move to a push up position on the ground using the resistance band.Loop the resistance band around your upper body so it sits just under your shoulder blades. Hold the resistance band handles so your hands are just under the handles and place your hands shoulder distance apart on the ground. Keep your legs straight behind you, with your feet close together.
Breathe in as you press your hands against the ground and lower your body towards the ground. Breathe out as you press your hands against the ground and lift your body away from the ground.
Repeat these movements for two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps.

Dance to a song...the whole song. Do this, even if you have to finish it by walking in place.






Walk around the neighborhood...your cul-de-sac, to the mailbox, anything like that.






The intent is to set an objective, accomplish it and know that you did it.

Pick a faster or longer song.
If that's too easy, try adding swinging arms to your job.

Familiarize yourself with the benefits and potential risks of the exercises you are considering.,
Spend most of your time on regular aerobic exercises.,
Do include strength training exercise, as well.,
Work up to exercising at least 30 to 45 minutes per day, 4 or 5 days per week.,
Know approximately how many calories you are burning.,
Avoid eating extra snacks or treats and telling yourself ""it's ok, I exercised earlier"" if your goal is to lose weight.,

Remember always think positive.

",How to Use Exercise to Help You Lose Weight," Choose activities that you like, exercise at convenient times of the day, and have a variety of exercises to chose from to avoid getting bored.;
, You will want to know approximately how many calories are being expended, what muscle groups are being used, and how long you should perform the exercises.

, Remember that regularly exercising is best for weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight. You can burn many calories in doing aerobic exercise 4-7 days per week, and you will continue to increase your metabolism even after training, by doing strength training exercises 2-3 times per week

, Building muscle mass is important - especially since dieting can cause loss of muscle mass. Muscles burn more calories than fat over the long term, so consider strength training to be an investment in long-term weight maintenance.

, Depending on your level of fitness, you may want to work up to that gradually. Lesser amounts of exercise are adequate if your goal is longevity or a healthy body and mind. If your goal is to lose weight, you need to work towards exercising most days.

, Many exercise machines give approximations and you can find lists of estimates online. Those numbers are never going to be exactly correct, but you never really know how many calories you are consuming either, so consider it an estimate.

, It is much easier to eat 200 calories than to burn it off with exercise. A small snack could negate the entire workout.

, You can sluggishly make it through any exercise routine, but if you put a lot of energy into it you will burn a lot more calories.

, If your exercise routine is feeling, well, routine, then it is time to shake it up a bit. Try increasing the intensity, duration, or try some new exercises.

, Walk a little extra; don't take the short cuts; find excuses to move. Fidget in your chair. Park further from the door. Take the stairs. Don't count this towards your total exercise time, but consider it little bonus fat blasts.

, Talk to your doctor if you have any reason to be concerned about exercising.

, When doing yoga and some forms of aerobics, balance is key.

Decide on a specific goal you want to work towards.,
Choose an author whose approach you think will motivate you best.,
Choose an autobiography written by an athlete you most admire and/or want to emulate.,
Turn any audio book into a motivational tool.",How to Use Audio Books to Get the Best from Your Workout1," Are you primarily concerned with establishing or maintaining a regular exercise routine, becoming healthier overall, or losing weight? Are you training to run a marathon next year or dreaming of becoming an Olympic athlete one day? Whatever your goal is, look for an audio book written with this or a similar goal in mind.


You probably have several goals. Choose the most important one, or the smallest goal working towards a larger, long-term one, like doing cardio every day as one step towards making your heart healthier.
Start researching the internet for titles related to your interests. Check out user reviews to be sure the book is helpful.;
, Motivation comes in many forms and methods, and choosing one is an individual decision. Even two people with the goal of losing 20 lbs, for example, may have differing reasons why they want to do this. You will likely end up with a list of several books about losing weight, for example, that all seem relevant and get great reviews. Compare how each author approaches the subject and decide which would motivate you the easiest.


In the past, have you felt psyched to go out and exercise after reading personal weight loss success stories in magazines or internet blogs? Drop Dead Healthy: One Man’s Humble Quest for Bodily Perfection, by A.J. Jacobs, might be an interesting choice.Does learning nutritional facts and human physiology make you want to eat healthier and exercise more? Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, written by psychiatrist John J. Ratey, might be your first book.Use past personal successes, even if in other non-health-related areas of your life, to lead you to the title you think will be most helpful.

, Get double the payout by turning listening to an audio book into a reward, as well as motivation. Create rules for yourself, such as you can only listen to it while you walk on the treadmill.If the gym is a bit of a drive, let yourself listen to it during the car ride also.


Suspenseful novels or period dramas work great as incentives to exercise daily because you will be waiting for the chance to find out what happens next.

, These audio books are sure to keep you laughing through your workout, and are often narrated by the author. It might be the second best thing to seeing them perform live.


A great recent one is Yes Please by Amy Poehler. She also happens to be pretty empowering overall, especially as a role model for young women and girls.
Try I Can Barely Take Care of Myself by Jen Kirkman for a hilarious account of how adults without kids have a totally different perspective without constant influence from little ones., Harry Potter fans rave over the audio versions of these fun novels.If you love Agatha Christie, listen to your favorite series to experience the suspense on a whole different level.Even if you have read them a thousand times, the voice actor’s perception of the character might be completely different than yours. Hearing it read by actors chosen by the author may change your understanding of events in the story since emotions and individual speech characteristics are less open to interpretation in your head.
Murder mysteries and detective stories may include not just character’s voices, but background sounds to accompany indirect action that add to the suspense. Think of them like listening to radio shows in the 1940s, before TV replaced radio entertainment.

Don't be mean to yourself.",How to Stop Being a Yo‐Yo Exerciser," If you haven't been exercising much, don't expect to go out and swim 40 laps at the pool. You need to start smaller. Try starting with just what you can do each day. That is, when you find yourself wearing out, stop. Tomorrow, you'll be able to go a little bit more. Plus, going slowly can decrease your chances of an injury., Some people don't like to exercise because they find it painful or too strenuous. However, you shouldn't be in pain while exercising. If you are, you should talk to your doctor. You may also need to find a different exercise that's more comfortable. Swimming is a great exercise for a wide variety of body types and exercise levels, so it might be a good place to start., Goals can help encourage you to keep going. Your goals should be small, measurable, and concrete. That is, you may have an ultimate goal of running a marathon, but you need smaller goals that you can use to work up to your larger goal, such as starting by running 10 minutes a day for 4 days. Then, you can increase as needed.Measurable goals are important because you can actually achieve them and hold yourself accountable. That is, making your goal ""I will run more"" isn't really helpful because it's not measurable. ""I will run for 10 minutes a day 4 days this week"" is.
Try working up to 150 minutes a week, broken up in 10-, 15-, or 30-minute increments., If you just try to fit your exercise in when you feel like it, you're less likely to do it. A better plan is to exercise at the same time every day or most days. For instance, you could get up a bit earlier in the morning to do your exercise or try to fit it in right after work. Scheduling it as part of your week makes it easier for you to stick to it., One of the best ways to motivate yourself is to have someone who can help hold you accountable. If someone is expecting you at the gym in the morning, you're more likely to drag yourself out of bed than if someone's not there. Therefore, try to find someone with a similar schedule who wants to work out at the same time. You can even try making a friend at the gym who always seems to be there at the same time.You're also less likely to stop going with someone else there, which means you won't slip into the non-exercising part of yo-yo exercising.

, Some companies offer discounts or even free gym memberships. Another option at some companies is an on-site health class during or just after work hours, such as yoga.Check to see if your company has a program like this one. If it doesn't, talk to your boss about what you could get started. Companies like to see their employees healthy, so they can work harder.


Some companies even allow workers to take a bit of time off during the week to go to the gym.
Having a workplace that's friendly to a healthier lifestyle can encourage you to be more vigilant about exercising.

, You can find a wide variety of exercise apps for your smartphone. They can help track how many steps you take in a day, and many let you set goals and then note when you've achieved them. It's a good way to have an outside accountability source for your workouts.


An exercise app will be a constant reminder to keep going, which can keep you from sliding back into the inactivity part of yo-yo exercising.
You can also get devices, like fitness watches, that connect to the app. These devices can be good because they can track your steps even when you don't have your phone on you, as well as keep track of your heartbeat and other health stats.

, If you miss a day, you may think your goals for the week are ruined, and you may decide not to exercise anymore that week. However, it's important to remember that even some exercise is better than none, particularly because if you completely miss a week, you're less likely to start up again. If you miss a day, get up the next day and go. Don't beat yourself up; just move ahead with your goals.

, Even if you find something you love, you're going to burnout if you do it all the time. Try to switch up your exercise routine. For instance, try yoga one day, swimming the next, and running the third day. Of course, you still want to stick with exercises you mostly enjoy, but adding variety can keep you interested.In addition, changing up your routine will work different muscle groups, so you'll get a better workout overall., Getting help from a trainer can help make your workouts more interesting and more efficient. For one, a trainer can show you new exercises to try, as well as help you figure out different pieces of equipment. Plus, a trainer can show you how to do exercises properly so that you're getting the most out of your workout.Most gyms have trainers available for an extra fee. Some even have them available for free.

, If you find yourself bored with your routine, try joining an exercise community online with fitness experts. You'll get ideas for new exercises, and you may even find a new exercise that you absolutely love. Stay open to new possibilities., Having good background noise can help you keep going longer. For instance, listen to high energy music to keep you engaged and to pump you up. You might also like listening to audio books because then you have to go exercise to hear what happens next.

, Sometimes, you need a break between exercise days. That's perfectly fine, even healthy. If you push yourself too hard, it could lead to injury. It could also lead to burnout more quickly. Therefore, make sure you take time to rest, as it can help keep you on track.In fact, you don't even need to push yourself that hard when you work out. Even moderate activity is beneficial. That means that you just need to breathe a little heavier, such as still being able to chat but not sing. You also should feel a little warmer, but you don't need to sweat a lot.Listen to your body. It will tell you when you need a short break., One of the problems yo-yo exercises have is they tend to overdo it when they're ""on."" In other words, you may find that you want to exercise 2 to 3 hours every day. The problem with that is that you will burn yourself out. That type of lifestyle isn't sustainable for most people, so make sure you stick to what you can handle. That way, you'll be more likely to keep going., While you do need to take rest days, you can't let that stretch into days on end in a row, or you'll lose momentum. If you find yourself saying, ""I'm too tired,"" remember that working out can actually boost your energy, even though it doesn't feel like it when you're trying to wake up in the morning to go workout., If your only reason for exercising is losing weight, you're more likely to yo-yo exercise. Instead, think of it as changing your lifestyle. That is, you're not exercising more. Rather, you're creating a healthier lifestyle. The change in mindset can help you stick with it because then exercising becomes part of your routine., That is, if you know you always forget your workout clothes on the way to work, make sure to stick them in a bag by the door. If you know that once you get home, you won't get out again, try to go to the gym before or after work instead., Rewards can help motivate you to stay active. However, they only work if you just use them after you workout or achieve a goal. Try to skip food rewards, though you could do something like have a cup of coffee. You could also spend some time reading or doing an activity you enjoy., While getting to the gym or setting aside special time for exercise is good, adding more physical activity to your everyday life can also be helpful. For instance, try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator.You can also park farther out in the parking lot when you go to a store.
Take up gardening, as that's good exercise.
Walk in place while you talk on the phone instead of sitting.

, It can be tempting to kick yourself while you're down, when you miss a workout routine, for instance. You may also not be at the level of fitness you want when you're first starting out. However, the more you get mad at yourself, the more likely you are to quit. Instead, try to stay positive.For example, instead of saying, ""You're so lazy for missing that workout this morning,"" you could say, ""Yes, you missed your workout this morning, but you'll get back on track tomorrow.""

Create playlists of music that inspire you to move.,
Play music at the hardest part of your workout.,
Distract yourself from pain using music.",How to Use Music for a Better Workout1," You can gain energy from music, which will motivate you to get moving! Choose upbeat, happy songs that make you feel like getting going. You could try: “Walking on Sunshine,” “It’s A Beautiful Day,” or “Born This Way.” Aim for at least 30 minutes of songs on your playlist.;
, Save your playlist for when you start the moderate or intense aspects of your workout. A song such as Walk The Moon's ""Shut Up and Dance"" would do the trick! Another good option is Jason Derulo's ""Talk Dirty."" Do both your commute and warm-up without music, and then switch it on when you are ready to do the intensive cardiovascular-focused parts of your exercise.

, Save your favorite songs for the moments when your heart is at its highest beats per minute (BPM). Unlike reading and watching television, which can lower the intensity of your workout, songs with high beats per minute have been shown to distract you while also making your workout more intense.Remember that music should not be used to distract you from chronic pain, but instead from the uncomfortable feeling of working out at high intensity. Do not ignore signs of acute pain or dehydration. Stay hydrated!

Warm up with songs that have approximately 110 beats per minute.,
Increase your cardiovascular moderate workout with music.,
Use music for specified workout routines.,
Increase the volume of your music as your workout gets more intense.",How to Use Music for a Better Workout2," Try out some Justin Bieber, LL Cool J, or Tove Lo for a high-energy workout. If you choose to listen to music during your warm up, start with a slower song. Go to bpmdatabase.com to find songs that are around 110 beats per minute.Songs at around 110 beats per minute are also good for pilates moves and weightlifting, where you are in a stationary position. You should still aim to choose songs with a good beat that helps you count out your seconds as you hold muscle sustaining positions.
Use the songs' structure and tempo for interval training. Workout at a slower pace during the verses and then workout intensely during the chorus or parts of increased tempo., For this, select music that has at least 120 beats per minute. You may want to choose songs that slowly increase in BPM, working up to 180 BPM, such as ""In Da Club"" by 50 Cent. You can also try out the song ""Hold Up"" by Beyonce. Aerobic intensity increases as the tempo of your music increases., In workouts such as kickboxing, music is used to encourage and strengthen. Whether you love jamming to Carly Rae Jepson or Kanye West, you should be able to find a high-energy beat that works for you., For most people, their heart rate is higher at the end of a moderate workout or during intervals. Keep your music at a lower level until your heart rate is high and then increase the volume. The song ""Timber"" by Kesha makes for a great option, as it will get your heart racing and adrenaline pumping!

Take dance classes.,
Try a fitness class that incorporates music.,

Most gyms hold Zumba classes inspired by fun, energizing music.If you are embarrassed to dance in public, rent or buy a Zumba workout video. They are also available on instant streaming on Netflix or through many public libraries. Put on good cross-training shoes and do the routines. You may find that you workout more intensely if you raise the volume on your TV.

, Anything from jazz to hip hop to salsa dancing classes use high BPM music in their routines. The warm up usually includes learning the moves. Near the end of the class, you do the routines in succession, creating a fun and successful aerobic activity., Many gyms offer classes that use music to motivate participants and keep up everyone's energy. Check out options such as spinning classes, barre, and yoga. Spinning will use high-energy music, while a yoga class will most likely use more soothing and meditative tunes. If doing yoga by yourself at home, give Dermot Kennedy's song ""Glory"" or Drake and Rihanna's ""Take Care"" a listen., You can learn hip hop or salsa routines through the Internet or workout videos. Learn several dance routines and do them to your favorite music, combining both mood-boosting and strategic music use."

There are lots of sports teams open to students with different levels of talent. You don’t need to be a star athlete to try out, and practicing with the team will develop your skills. These activities will not only allow you to enjoy some healthy competition, they’ll also keep you fit!While your coaches will want you to strive for excellence, try not to worry too much about winning. Instead, focus on the fun you can have being on a team with friends, and the health benefits you’re getting from the activity.
Consider trying one or several popular sports usually offered at schools, including football, soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, tennis, field hockey, or lacrosse.
For lesser-known alternatives that may or may not be offered at school, try sports such as dance, figure skating, rock climbing, horseback riding, golf, skateboarding, roller skating, fencing, and rowing.;
, If your school is especially passionate about having a winning team for a particular sport, they may be more selective with their players. It might be difficult to be chosen even for their freshmen and junior varsity teams. If you want to play this sport, however, don’t give up! Play on your own, and ask the coach if you can observe team practices.


Ask friends who are on the team to help you get better.

, You may not want to play a sport at your school. Maybe excessive school spirit isn’t your thing, or you don’t want to do tryouts. Many local community centers will have more informal team-sports offerings that could introduce you to a new set of friends while helping you stay active.


Community centers may offer sports that schools generally don’t provide, including kickball, wiffle ball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee.

, Some people don’t enjoy the kind of competition that comes from playing as a team. If you’re unenthusiastic about team-oriented sports, such as football, basketball, soccer, and other sports like them, consider options that allow you to focus on your individual talents.Consider track, swimming, cross-country running, skiing, or sailing.
If you play these sports for your school, be aware that you’ll still be on a team. You’ll complete practices and competitions as a group. There will also be events, known as relays, that require you to combine your talents with those of other team members to win races.

Choose a class at school to exercise with other teens.,
Choose a class at a gym or community center for a mixed group.,
Take yoga classes for an emphasis on stretching and breathing.,
Pick zumba for a high-energy dance class.,
Choose pilates for a focus on core strength.,
Go with weight training or “body pump” for a weightlifting class.,
Join a spinning class for a group bike class.",How to Stay Active After School (Teens)2," Taking exercise classes can be a fun and easy way to build physical activity into a weekly schedule. If you take an after-school exercise class held at your school’s gym or fitness center, it will likely be free of charge. It will also probably be designed especially for teens like you and your friends, as you’ll be the main participants.It’s possible that some of your teachers may join an exercise class, but you should expect that your age group will be the main audience.

, People of all different ages attend exercise classes offered at gyms and centers. This means that your class will be designed to appeal to people with different levels of strength and experience. Taking a class at a gym could allow you to meet new and different kinds of people and provide a change of pace from your typical school week.


Most gyms and community centers charge monthly or yearly membership fees. You’ll need to either pay these yourself, or discuss payment option with your parents.
Some classes may only be available to gym members that are 18 and older. Check with a gym representative to see which options are open to you., Yoga combines a variety of body movements, breathing and relaxation techniques, and meditation to achieve balance and build strength. Yoga especially focuses on calming your mind and body. You may feel like a pretzel the first time you try it, but it’s a great way to stay active while also dealing with your stress., Zumba uses traditional Latin music to take students through a dance workout that makes them sweat. This can be a fun cardiovascular activity that may not make you dread going to the gym., Pilates builds up abdomen and back muscles by moving students through different body positions. It’s meant to provide lean and balanced muscular strength. If you’re experiencing any back pain from constantly hunching over your books and computer, this is a great class for you., Your community center may provide a weightlifting class geared especially to teens, or they might modify the content in their usual class for you. Bodypump introduces its students to various movements that can be used in combination with barbells and weights. The exercises typically consist of squats, presses, lunges, and curls., Spinning uses an adjustable standing bike to provide an intense and personalized cardiovascular workout. Your instructor will make a different playlist each week to motivate you with music. The group setting is also expected to introduce a little competition. Some classes may even have a board up front listing the top spinners!

Walk around between classes at school.,
Walk or bike to school if you live nearby and it’s safe.,
Join a gym to stay active for an hour per day.,
Make your activities part of your daily routine.,
Be positive and have fun during your physical activities.,
Invite your family and friends to be active with you.,
Avoid spending too much time in front of screens.",How to Stay Active After School (Teens)3," Your physical activity doesn’t have to wait until you’ve finished the school day. Sitting at a desk all day can make your body feel stiff. Avoid this by getting up to walk around frequently in between your class sessions. Take a stroll down the hall, even if your next class is just next door.Many schools provide a ten-minute break in the morning. Walk through the halls with your friends during these breaks, instead of just standing by your lockers.
Don’t take away from class time or even study sessions to be physically active during the day. Give balanced attention to both school and your physical health.

, This morning and afternoon commute can act as a perfect way to naturally build activity into your daily schedule. Try to avoid walking or biking more than thirty minutes to school, as this may be too much time to add to your morning schedule. Be sure it’s safe for you to do this.Make this a group activity by reaching out to other students who live in your neighborhood. You may feel more safe if several of you travel together. This can also provide fun social time in the mornings and afternoons.

, It’s especially important for teens to find time to be active. It’s best to get at least an hour of physical activity each day, thirty minutes of which should be intense enough to get your heart pumping. If you’re able to get a gym membership and enlist some friends to join with you, you’ll be much more likely to commit to daily activity., Instead of engaging in physical activity haphazardly, schedule specific times each day to be active. If you just decide to be active whenever you can, you likely won’t get enough activity over the course of your day. You probably have tons of commitments already, so it’s important to “formally” add physical activity to your plans and treat it like something you’re required to complete., It can be difficult to be excited about a jog or exercise class that you know is going to be hard and make you sweat. Focus on the benefits you’ll receive from physical activity, and keep reminding yourself how you’ll feel once it’s over. If you’re able to find even one thing you can look forward to about your physical activity, you’ll likely be able to approach it with a smile on your face., It’s often easier to commit to being active when you have a friend or family member acting as your exercise buddy. You can offer each other encouragement and challenge one another with a friendly spirit of competition. Your friends and family will benefit from adding physical activity to their lives as well, so remind them that you’re doing them a favor!, Between social media and homework, avoiding your electronics entirely just isn’t possible. Record how many hours you spend in front of different kinds of screens on a typical day. You may be surprised (and disturbed) by how high the number is. Try to cut this time down by a few or even several hours.Not only will limiting your screen time give you the ability to add more physical activity to your day, you’ll likely enjoy other health benefits. For example, if you suffer from headaches or tired, itchy eyes, your screens may be the culprit.

Set realistic goals.,
Create a rewards system.,
Start a fitness journal.,
Get a fitness assessment.,
Make an “I love my body because…” board and watch how it changes.",How to Stay Motivated at the Gym1," Goals need to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-constrained). Set short-term, moderate, and long-term goals. Make the goals challenging enough that you will feel pleased with yourself for completing them, and easy enough that they are attainable in the time frame you give yourself.

Short term goals can be varied. For instance you could set a goal to do 20 minutes walking on the treadmill on Mondays. Alternatively, by the end of the month you could aim to lift 10 pound dumbbells on your shoulder workout.
Moderate goals can range from lifting a certain weight on the bench press or leg press to swimming 10 lengths of the pool, or running a 5K.
If your long term goal is to be fit and healthy, you may choose to exercise three times a week.;
, When you’re not feeling intrinsically motivated, it’s helpful to offer extrinsic motivation to your workouts to keep you productive. Develop a rewards system based on your goal, and treat yourself accordingly.Most experts discourage you from rewarding yourself based on weight loss. Instead of focusing on the number on the scale, set milestones such as number of days worked out in a week or number of reps you complete of a certain exercise.
In terms of rewards, never treat yourself with food. Go for exciting but non-food rewards such as a new journal, a pair of earrings, or a snazzy new leather jacket.

, Recording your daily fitness routine and the changes happening in your body serves a twofold purpose. Your journal entries give you objective feedback on your progress, and help you stay motivated as you look back on how far you’ve come.Even if you’re just starting or have experienced a setback, your journal can be motivating. Review it weekly to see patterns in your fitness behaviors that need tweaking for greater success.

, Most gyms offer basic fitness assessments as a part of membership. Even if yours doesn’t offer this service complimentary, it’s worth the extra fee. A comprehensive assessment can give you details about your overall physical health, like your body fat composition and basal metabolic rate. The numbers you get from this assessment at the start of your journey are a great way to review your progress and maintain motivation., Whether you’ve been working out for years or just entered a gym for the first time, it’s important to express gratitude for your body just the way it is. However, as you go through plateaus in your fitness journey, it’s inspiring to look back and see how your relationship with your body has changed, especially when you’re feeling unmotivated during a fitness plateau.Start an “I love my body because…” board on a free wall in your home or in a notebook. Write down reasons, such as “I love my body because my legs help me to be a strong dancer” or “…my hips helped me give birth to a healthy baby.”

Go with a friend.,
Put together a motivating playlist.,
Refresh your wardrobe.,
Expand your options.,
Get a personal trainer.",How to Stay Motivated at the Gym2," Friends make even the worst experiences bearable. Going to the gym is no exception. Ask a buddy to join you and you’ll benefit from increased motivation, and likely increased compliance. When you’re going in alone, it’s easy to make up excuses not to go, but it’s harder to do that to a friend. So find someone who needs motivation and be each other’s accountability.It may even be nice to set up friendly competition with your pal. For instance, the person who does the most reps in strength training gets a free lunch courtesy of the other.

, The right music can totally transform your workout. Figure out which songs add energy to your workouts, and create a playlist of them. Bring your headphones and pump up the music for instant motivation., Heading off to the gym in the same old t-shirt and shorts makes for a lackluster visit. Spice up your fitness routine by purchasing a few new articles of active wear. You just might get the burst of enthusiasm you need to take your workouts to the next level.You don’t even have to break the bank to reap the benefits of a new workout wardrobe. Just choose some items that fit in fun colors and styles.

, If you’re still doing the same routine you were doing six months ago, it’s no wonder you’re feeling uninspired. Change it up to add interest to your fitness routine. This might include trying a new machine or joining an engaging fitness class.For instance, if you always use the treadmill, try the elliptical or stair climber. If you have been doing the same thigh exercise, challenge yourself by doing more reps or including new moves.

, A personal trainer can do wonders for your fitness motivation. Hiring a trainer costs extra money, so you’re more likely to put your all in. Plus, you’ll feel motivated to do your best because you’re taking special time from someone else’s schedule.Find a trainer whose style works for you. You may want someone who acts like a military sergeant, one who is supportive and encouraging, or one who is fun and humorous.

Schedule your workout at the most convenient time.,
Visit a nearby gym.,
Avoid comparisons.,
Know when to rest.",How to Stay Motivated at the Gym3," Consistency is key when it comes to building a successful fitness routine. If you’re like most people, your chances of remaining consistent increase when you don’t have to go out of your way. Experts recommend morning workouts because motivation wanes as the day goes on. But, for best results, exercise at the time that’s most convenient for you.The most convenient time for you might be when you first wake each morning, on your lunch break at work, or in the evenings when your workout buddy is available. Pick a time and stick to it.

, The location of your gym is also important for helping you stay motivated to exercise. If your gym is far away or not easily accessible, you will come up with more excuses not to go. For this reason, go to a gym close by home or work.

, Visiting your gym is about improving your physical fitness and enhancing your relationship with your body. Yet, so many people fill their minds with comparisons about how they measure up to others. Comparisons only decrease your motivation for working out. Bring awareness to your tendency to compare and stop it now.Set a personal goal to stop comparing at the start of the week. Write it down on a piece of paper and drop it in your gym bag. Then, when you catch yourself comparing, say something positive about yourself like “I am so much better at Pilates than when I first started.” Do this repeatedly until you start focusing on yourself and not on others.

, If you’re pushing yourself too hard, you can start resenting the very idea of going to the gym. Notice when you need a break and give yourself permission to take one. Besides, pushing yourself too hard won’t necessarily lead to better results. In fact, going overboard can result in injuries or self-defeating behaviors that set back your progress."

Look around and see all the exercise that we could be getting right at home.,
While we are working on changing the way that we think, it is important that we all realize the importance of how we eat.,
Realize that it is crazy the way that TV portrays things, like someone that wears a size ten, gets down to a size one...like a size ten was too big, Not!,
Now that we are done resetting our minds lets look at simple (good old fashion) home chores to stay fit; such as sweeping the porch, pulling weeds by hand, trimming hedges, wiping down the counter tops in the kitchen, taking down curtains and washing them, feather dusting the walls, dusting and polishing furniture.,
Now since you are already working out, why not take time out from chores and hop on an exercise bike to take yourself for a ride; then later while relaxing (in front of the tube) do a few simple curls with a small dumbbell...while being proud of all that you accomplished in a days time.

,
If you're video-game savvy and enjoy dance games, then why not buy DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) or purchase a Wii and Wii Fit?,
If you are hyper and bored and stuck at home, jump around the house.,
Don't forget, if hopping seems strange or boring, add a hula hoop or jump rope!,
Use TV to your advantage by creating exercise games based on your favorite shows.",How to Stay Fit at Home," However, we first need to reset our minds, in to getting back to our daily lives - instead of focusing on going to the gym, or spending money on costly exercise equipment.

, Although there are so many new studies that tell us something different everyday about food, we can figure some things out for ourselves, and find a plan that works for each of us as individuals.

, Then to top it off shows us someone claiming to be in a size one, when it is obvious they are much bigger. But naturally, that will get blamed on saying TV adds (ten to fifteen) pounds on you; and if that's the case, then some people on TV look like spaghetti noodles. Plus if that's the case, well some of the Movie Stars that are claiming to be over weight aren't, it's just TV...if they stayed off TV (they would look thinner); therefore, they would lose weight automatically...and a career.

, There is always something to do around the house that will keep you fit; thus you'll have a clean environment in which to live... plus you'll stay healthy and looking good.

,, This method is one of the simplest ways to lose weight. Usually, most people tend to enjoy their weight loss experience instead of it being detrimental and periodic routine.

, Literally hop. Anything that causes you to sweat will help you turn body fat into muscle or just burn it off.

, The hula hoop will work your abs & hips, the jump rope is great for cardio. All you need is 15 minutes, but 20 to 30 minutes once a day will really get your heart rate up and those calories burning! After don't eat a lot of food with calories.

, Make a list of things that happen often in an episode, and pair them with activities. Every time something on your list happens on the show, pause it and do the corresponding exercise. There are example games below.

Know just how in shape you are.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Don't forget about your diet.",How to Start Working Out1," You're on this page—good job! That's the first step. Mentally, you're where you need to be. But how about physically? You probably have some idea of what kind of physical shape you're in. But in order to find out where you're truly at (and to know how far you've gone), you'll need to record your baseline fitness scores. Do a little background work to get started:Your pulse rate before and after you walk 1 mile (1.6 kilometers)
How long it takes you to walk 1 mile (1.6 kilometers)
How many push-ups you can do at a time
How far you can reach forward while seated on the floor with your legs in front of you
Your waist circumference as measured around your bare abdomen just above your hipbone;
, If you're a rookie to the workout game, you may not have a great idea as to what you're truly capable of or what you should be doing. If this is the case, it's wise to consult a doctor. They will be able to point you in a reasonable direction of meeting your goals.


If you're a male over 45 or a woman over 55, it's not only best but it's imperative you talk to your doctor before beginning. Same goes if you have major health concerns. Talk to your doctor before something irreversible happens.Not only is it for good measure, but it ensures your safety and health too.

, If you're about to work out 5 hours a week, fantastic. The good news about that is for the other 163 hours, you can be as lazy as you like. But diet is a 24/7 thing. Though it's not mandatory, it's a good idea to start thinking about it now, along with your new-found exercise regimen.


Eating right and exercising are organically connected. Once you get into it, working out can give you that same rush a package of Oreos can. But there will be points where a 300-calorie-burning workout session will lead you to scarfing a 500-calorie piece of cheesecake. Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. When you start exercising, monitor your food intake as well.
Eating junk will make it harder to exercise. It's not just a weight thing—it's how you feel. If you are serious about starting to work out, let the same attitude reflect in your diet. You'll feel a lot more ready to take on that run after a meal full of vitamins and nutrients than you would if you chowed down on preservatives and chemical additives.

Choose a goal.,
Choose a balanced routine.,
More importantly, choose something you don't hate.,
Pick a time that can become a habit.,
Start small.,
Allow time for recovery.,
Consider rewards and punishment.",How to Start Working Out2," This can be totally different for each person. Maybe you want to get buff, maybe you want to lose weight, or maybe you just want to fight off heart disease and diabetes. Whatever it is, it'll help you to have a clear goal in mind. With a clear goal, you can stick to it—and know if you're on the right path.


Think about what you want to be good at. Maybe you don't have a weight goal or a waistline goal, but you want to be able to run a 5k, no problem. What's more, if you have the desire to be good at it, you'll probably enjoy it. That's the key to staying with it.

With this methodology, your goal will be in your workout. Aim for something specific: a 5k in 30 minutes or 30 push-ups a minute, for example. This will be what you're working toward.


Think about what you want to be. Do you want to be 4 inches (10.2 cm) thinner around the waist? 15lbs (7kg) lighter? Lose 5% of your body fat? If it's easier for you, think in numbers.

If your goal is weight loss, know that 1kg (2.2 pounds) is 3,500 calories. You need to burn 500 calories a day working out (if you're on a balanced diet) to lose one pound a week.



, If you're looking to be fit overall (who isn't?), you'll want to start a routine that keeps you on top of every aspect of your game—that means aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility training. All three of 'em. Cardiovascular activity. Start out simple with walking or running. Do this for half an hour, five times a week. Try to stay on a level where you could carry a basic conversation, but definitely couldn't carry a tune.

Strength conditioning.Start doing 4 to 8 different exercises, making sure to work out different muscle groups. And don't go for weight—it's better to lift lighter and maintain the right form. Though cardio can and should be done 5 times a week, keep the weight training to twice. Your body needs time to repair itself, quite literally.

Flexibility training. You'll be surprised how much improving your flexibility can help you across the board. Every day of the week (or whatever you can fit in) do slow, sustained stretches for 10 to 30 seconds (at least according to the American College on Exercise)., This deserves its own bullet point because it's that important. If you dread working out, you'll come up with excuses not to. You'll never stick with it and you won't meet your goals. Start with something you enjoy—as you get more fit, activities will become easier and you'll start enjoying more.


Going to the gym does not have to be your only option. If you like swimming, dancing, or hiking, great! These are all exercises, too. Think outside the box.

, In order to integrate this into your lifestyle, you'll need to make it a priority. To do this, set aside a time at least a few days a week. Whether it's 09:00 or 21:00, write it down in pen. There's no getting around it.


Getting over the initial hump will be the hardest part. Soon enough, when 21:00 rolls around, your body will be raring to go and feeling antsy to get that endorphin rush.

, Most of the time, when we decide to start a new workout routine it’s because we’re motivated to do it. It’s great to have motivation, but it can be a double-edged sword. Why? Because motivation can fool you into biting off more than you can chew. In the beginning, you want to start slow. This way you'll keep at it. Remember, the goal is to get in the habit of doing the workouts, not to do intense workouts.It's important to progress slowly when you're just starting off. It'll be easy to do more and it'll be easier to hurt yourself. Increase your time or intensity a bit at a time, making sure not to over-exert yourself. And if you have an injury or medical condition, make sure your routine is healthy and, above all, doable., You'll have days when you're in the zone and dreading getting out of it. Then, you wind up in a puddle on the floor and your muscles feel like jelly for the next week. Avoid that. Give your body time between sessions to recover, even if your mind says, ""Go, go, go."" You may not be able to exercise tomorrow, but you'll be able to exercise in the long run.For strength training, it's very important to give your muscles time to repair themselves. Don't work out the same muscle group two days in a row—the muscles are literally ripping as you strengthen them. Let them heal.

, Sometimes the thought of being skinnier or being healthier isn't strong enough. These things are in the future and they're too abstract to grasp onto now. If intrinsic motivation is a problem, consider making it extrinsic.


Reward yourself. If you stick to your workout routine for a month, take a day-trip to your favorite spot. Go shopping. Take a nap. You've earned it.
If rewards don't do the trick, think about punishment. If you don't run that 5k 3 times this week, you'll donate $200 to Sarah Palin's 2016 presidential campaign. That ought to do it.

Have the knowledge.,
Get the right shoes.,
Make it easy with the extras.,
Consider home equipment.,
Join a gym.,
Find a team.",How to Start Working Out3," Not only do you have to be equipped with the ability and the machinery, but you have to have a grasp on what it is you're doing. Here are some basic terms you should start incorporating into your vocabulary:Maximum Heart Rate. A basic starting point is 220 minus your age. For your specific maximum heart rate, consult a professional. Do you know yours?

Set. This term is used during weight training. It's the same exercise repeated a specific number of times. You might hear someone say, ""I did three sets of 12 on Monday and 4 sets of 10 on Wednesday.""

Repetition or ""rep."" This is the number within the set. As in, ""I did three sets of 10 reps each.""

Warm up. This is not the same as stretching. Warming up is doing very light exercise, like walking before a run. It increases blood flow, heating up your muscles. Stretching should come in at the end of your work out.

Cooldown. Never do a full-stop; your body will have no idea what happened. Instead, go at a reduced speed for whatever activity you were doing, cuing your body that it's nearing relaxing time. Stretching is often part of a cooldown, for the record.

, You need to choose the right type of shoe for the kind of workout you’ll be doing. And yes, it does matter. A shoe made for running is very different in a number of ways from a shoe made for basketball or tennis. Even walking shoes differ from running shoes.


Running shoes have no lateral stability built into them because you don’t move your feet laterally when you run. You’re only going forward. A running shoe is built to give you support and stability as you move your foot through the running gait cycle. Basketball and tennis shoes both need to be stabilized laterally. That's because you move your feet side to side a lot when playing these sports. runners land more on their forefoot while walkers have a heavier heel strike. So for running you want a shoe that has more cushioning on the forefoot, while walking shoes should have stiffer rubber to support the heel., Sometimes it's the little things that help the most. Get some nice workout clothes—something you feel good in. Invest in an iPod or MP3 player to make the time go faster. Another possibility is a dog, but there's a lot less guilt involved about shoving an iPod into a drawer and forgetting about it.


If you're hitting the gym, get a good water bottle and towel. Having items set aside for this specific purpose somehow makes it easier to get going. You feel more invested and you have concrete reminders of your efforts.

, Gyms are, by no means, for everyone. And for those of us that don't live in perfect weather 300 days out of the year, home equipment may be the easiest solution. Think about investing your dollars into one or more of the following:Treadmill. An easy way to get in the cardio is to invest in a treadmill. Start at a walk for that 30 minutes a day that's recommended and up it from there.

Free weights. To strength-train, purchase some barbells or dumbbells (for beginners, choose the latter). Some sets are adjustable, making it a one-stop shop, regardless of progress.

Other strength training equipment. Think about medicine balls, weight stacks, and flexible bands or rods. They're good ways to change up your routine, especially if you're starting to get bored.

Exercise ball. With this one, make sure you have a grasp on what you're doing before you get on the ball and just end up having a bouncing good time. If you don't do it right, you could either hurt yourself or not end up working the muscles you intended.

Exercise videos and DVDs. Some DVDs and videos are tripe, so watch it (or get recommendations) before you go about the routine. Once you find one you like, nail down the proper form by working in front of a mirror if possible.

, For a monthly fee, you'll have access to rooms full of equipment, classes, and possibly a trainer. Everything you could possibly need will be at this location. It couldn't be much easier, especially if you find one close to work or home.


That is, as long as you actually go. Sign up for a class—having the same weekly schedule will make it easier to stick to. Or train with a trainer or friend -- when someone else is expecting you at 2 PM, you have the added pressure of letting them down.

, Okay, so you don't literally need a team, but something akin to that is a good idea. Join an intramural volleyball team or a rock-wall climbing group. Having other people to break a sweat with you makes it a lot easier—and the time passes by more quickly, too.


If a team sport is a bit too much to ask, get a buddy. Even if they can just accompany you to and from the gym (but not necessarily during), great. They'll hold you accountable and make the pre- and post-workout more enjoyable.

Add weight or repetitions.,
Use supersets.,
Extend the time of your workouts or make them short and intense.,
Add intervals.",How to Prevent Boredom in Your Fitness Routine1," If you're starting to get bored with your strength-training routine, it may be that your fitness level has increased. As a result, the exercises are no longer challenging for you.Keep in mind that exercise releases endorphins that make you feel good and make exercise rewarding. If you're no longer working your muscles to the same level, those endorphins aren't being released and you'll no longer enjoy your fitness routine.
Start lifting heavier weights, or do an extra set of each exercise to really fatigue your muscles.
For cardio workouts, you also might try wrist or ankle weights to add resistance and make your muscles work harder. However, be sure to take these off after each minute of wear. Also, do not use them for more than three minutes total. Wearing wrist and ankle weights for too long can put enormous strain on your joints. Keep in mind that there are lots of other ways to do cardiovascular exercise, such as by doing calisthenics, swimming, playing a sport, cycling, hiking, skating, skiing, or by taking an exercise class.;
, When you do a superset, you perform sets of two different exercises with no rest in between. The idea is to combine exercises that work different parts of your body, so one muscle group gets rest while another is working.Supersets are both challenging and will allow you to spend less time working out, which can help prevent boredom. Since exercise takes less of your time, it's a lot more difficult to develop excuses not to do it.
The easiest superset is one that involves doing repetitions of a lower-body exercise followed immediately by repetitions of an upper-body exercise. For example, you might do 10 walking lunges or squats followed by 10 pushups. That makes one superset. Repeat the cycle for three supersets.

, For cardio workouts, going a little longer can add an extra challenge that will ultimately make you feel better about the work that you're doing.However, you can get the same kind of challenge by upping the intensity of your workout and keeping it short.


If you decide to extend your workout, increase the length of time you're working out incrementally before you start getting bored. Going for longer will increase the intensity of your workout and challenge your body.
For example, if you normally run for 30 minutes a day, you might want to start running for 35 minutes a day after about two weeks. After another two weeks, start going for 40 minutes, and so on.
If you prefer to work out for less time in a more intense way, then try to increase the intensity of your workout from moderate to vigorous.

, Interval training will increase the intensity of your fitness routine as well as make it more efficient. You can spend less time working out and still get great results, as well as preventing boredom from setting in.Intervals can be any length of time. The point of interval training is to go as hard and as fast as you can (with good form and technique) for a relatively short period of time, and there should be no resting between sets. For example, you could do 2 minutes of vigorous cardio followed by 30 to 60 seconds of weight lifting, and then repeat this sequence.
On alternating intervals, choose exercises that work different muscle groups so you aren't overly fatiguing your muscles. For example, follow an upper-body exercise with a lower-body exercise.
Include cardio intervals, such as running in place or doing jumping jacks.

Build up gradually.,
Get creative.,
Listen to your body.",How to Start Working Out4," As you progress, you'll find that your routine is just too easy. It may be tempting to be content with that, but push yourself. When you notice that you can go harder, do so. Doing what you couldn't do before will feel good.


Though it'll take a bigger chunk out of your schedule, allow your body plenty of time to warm up and cool down. For the actual workout, listen to your stamina: Do what you can and progressively work to more, about 60 minutes of exercise 5 or so days a week., Maybe your workout routine includes various activities, such as walking, bicycling or rowing. But don't stop there. Take a weekend hike with your family or spend an evening ballroom dancing. It all counts.


As you explore activities, you'll most likely find something that tickles your fancy. When you do, latch onto it. Was swing dancing surprisingly enjoyable? Great! That's one more hour each week you'll stay moving. The more the merrier, after all.

, Realistically, if you're starting a new workout routine, you're gonna get worn out. At the beginning it's very important to know what you're capable of and listen to your body. If you hurt yourself, there's no more getting in shape.


If you feel pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or nausea, take a break. You may be pushing yourself too hard. While that may be tempting for faster results, you'll get zero results if you're down for the count.

Stick with it.,
Switch it up.,
Make new goals.",How to Start Working Out5," That is to say, don't miss workouts. If most of us are being honest our workout history looks like this: workout for a couple of months. Get sick and stop. Spend a couple months getting back to where we were. Life gets hectic and stop. Spend a couple months getting back to where we were. See the pattern? Yep, no progress. So whatever you do, stick with it. Otherwise you'll get nowhere.


You'll be amazed at how much easier it is when you do (or how much harder when you don't). And when things are easier, you're more likely to do them. The second you start skipping, it's all downhill (or uphill, depending on your perspective) from there. So don't.

, Awesome -- you're out there and going. Now your biggest problem is plateauing and getting bored. You'll know when this is happening -- your motivation is waning even though your skills may not be. The same gusto just isn't there anymore. The answer? Do something different.


If you've been running that same 5k five days a week, take it outside. Find a new trail, start running at night, or start for a 7k. If that's not enough, pick up a new activity entirely. A yoga fan? Try pilates. Always wanted to try kickboxing? Go for it. You're ready.

, When you feel it's time, reassess your fitness level. What are you capable of now that you weren't before? What's your heart rate like during these activities? Odds are everything's better—time for a new challenge!


It's all about staying motivated. Have you gotten really close to your weight loss goal? Great! Now let's start thinking about muscle definition. Have you been hiking that one trail without fail and with ease since you started? Time for the harder one. This new you needs new goals. In time, a new goal will be a reward. After all, look how far you've come.

Choose a different activity.,
Get a change of scenery.,
Join a new class.,
Hire a personal trainer.,
Change your soundtrack.",How to Prevent Boredom in Your Fitness Routine2," If you've been doing the same thing for a long period of time, not only might you get mentally bored, but your muscles may be getting bored too. Every few weeks, choose something different to do to shake up your routine.You don't have to do something completely different, if you only enjoy particular types of activities. For example, if you normally run on the treadmill you might switch over to an elliptical or an exercise bicycle once or twice a week.
If you're lifting weights for strength training, research different exercises you can do that work opposing muscle groups. This will keep your muscles in balance and can prevent injuries as well as boredom.
You can try learning a new sport or skill. For example, you could join an adult soccer team or hiking group. Or, you could take cycling, swimming, or dance classes.

, You can prevent boredom in your fitness routine by working out in different places. After a while, going to the same place at the same time everyday can get monotonous, leading to boredom.If the weather is appropriate, going outside can be an instant way to invigorate your mind and body and get back your enthusiasm for your fitness routine.
If you're a member of a gym, find out if your membership is transferable to other locations. You might try going to a different location a day or two a week, which will give you a change of scenery as well as new people to interact with.

, Fitness classes inject some variety into your routine, as well as giving you the opportunity to learn a new skill or meet new people. You typically can find shorter term or introductory classes that don't require a gym membership.Check with your local community center or nonprofit organizations to find out what sorts of fitness or wellness classes are available. There also may be information at your public library.
Keep an open mind and be willing to try something even once to see how it feels. Most gyms and fitness clubs will give you the opportunity to try something once to see if you like it before you commit.

, Even if you can only afford a couple of sessions, a personal trainer can help you identify the reasons you may be starting to get bored with your fitness routine. They can offer you a new plan that will help prevent boredom in the future.If you're a member of a gym, find out what kind of personal training services that gym offers. Typically you get a reduced rate if you sign up for multiple sessions up front, so you can find a package that suits both your needs and your budget.
For example, you may want to work out on your own but check in with a trainer once a month. Talk to the trainers in your gym to find out if this is an option.
If you work out at home, you may be able to hire somebody to come over and work on a new routine for you. This may be more expensive than the services offered at a gym, so it's important to communicate with the trainer you choose and be up front about your goals and what you want out of your fitness routine.

, If you typically listen to music while you're working out, you may get bored listening to the same album or playlist over and over. Choose different music that's upbeat and motivational.Many athletic companies have designed playlists timed for specific types of workouts that you can download. One of these might work for you and give your fitness routine the jump start it needs to prevent boredom.
You also might try listening to a podcast or audio book, particularly on days where you're just jogging on a treadmill or using an exercise bike. Your interest in getting to the next episode or chapter will fuel an interest in exercising.

Compete with friends.,
Listen to your body.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Use positive visualization.,
Get new workout gear.",How to Prevent Boredom in Your Fitness Routine3," Working out with friends adds a social element that can prevent boredom, because your workout gives you the opportunity to spend time with someone you like. If you have a competitive streak, choose someone who will challenge you.Working out with a friend also can bust you out of a rut because it will mean that someone else is counting on you to show up. Make a commitment to someone else and you won't want to let them down.
Competition can keep you motivated to win, and you don't have to work out with someone in person to compete with them. There are a number of fitness apps that allow you and a friend to train on your own schedules and still compete with each other in terms of distance, speed, number of repetitions, weight lifted, or other factors.

, If you're having significant difficulties getting to the gym, or find that you're only going through the motions during your workout, your body may be trying to tell you something.If you've been doing the same routine for a longer period of time, you muscles may be strained by performing the same repetitive motions. Over time, doing the same exercises day in and day out can do more harm than good.
Take a moment to connect with your body, perhaps through meditation. Identify any areas of soreness or stiffness, or problems that seem to be developing.
Once you've found any weaknesses, think back to what particular motion is causing that soreness or stiffness. Then you know where you need to change up your routine, or if maybe it's time to take a longer break and allow your body to recover.

, Having a goal to work towards may also help to maintain your motivation to exercise. You do not need to set large goals for yourself. In fact, setting smaller goals might make you feel more motivated because it will be easier to accomplish them.

Try setting a goal to do 50 squats, swim 30 laps, or run a mile 15 seconds faster than your last timed mile.

, It's a bit of a mind trick, but if you train yourself to focus on positive aspects of your fitness routine, you can prevent boredom. Visualize yourself meeting a specific goal, or reaching a particular point.For example, if you are a runner and have signed up for a local race, you might visualize yourself crossing the finish line or getting a personal-best time.
If your goal is weight loss, you might visualize yourself wearing a new outfit at a party or social event, or finally fitting into those skinny jeans that have been hanging in your closet for months.

, If you're the type of person who gets excited about the prospect of wearing new clothes or using a new piece of equipment, new workout gear can help prevent boredom.Make sure you stay within your budget, and do this incrementally. You don't need to go out and get a whole new exercise wardrobe every few months just to stave off boredom.
For example, you might treat yourself with a new shirt in your favorite color if you meet a goal.
If you're going to increase the intensity of your workouts by using heavier weights, you might want to get a new pair of dumbbells in a bright, fun color.

Drink enough water.,
Have a pre- or post-workout snack.,
Watch your calories.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Get enough sleep.,
Manage stress.",How to Reduce Fatigue for Easier Working Out1," One of the number one causes of fatigue and drowsiness is dehydration. Even mild dehydration, which may include up to 75% of the population, can cause you to feel tired.The minimum amount of fluids you should drink daily is about eight glasses, or 64 oz; however, most health professionals are now saying to drink between 10–13 glasses of fluid daily. This amount will increase with your physical activity level.Keep a water bottle handy. This will help you stay on track with sipping all day long and can help you see how much more you need to drink.
Stick with no-calorie, hydrating fluids like water, flavored water (add some herbs or fruit), and unsweetened decaf coffee and tea.;
, In addition to water, your body is fueled by food. If you do not eat to fuel a workout or to recover from one, your performance and stamina can suffer.


You need a little fuel or energy to get your body through a workout. Without a pre-workout snack, it's like trying to drive a car on an empty tank. Go for carbohydrates like a piece of fruit, a small bowl of oatmeal or yogurt. A small meal or snack that has simple carbs can provide your body with enough energy to get through the workout. Without one, your performance and stamina will suffer and you will see fewer or slower results long-term.Carbs combined with protein are the best choice after you exercise to help resupply the energy you used and provide the protein to help rebuild muscle.Try fruit with yogurt/cottage cheese, a glass of skim milk, or a smear of peanut butter on a piece of whole wheat bread.

, In addition to your pre-workout snack, it's also important to consider your entire diet. If you're trying to lose weight but are feeling tired all the time and have little energy to exercise, your total calorie intake may be too low.


Many diets, cleanses, and fad diets usually suggest eating very low amounts of calories. When you do not eat enough food, your body can't get enough nutrition to function at its optimal level, with fatigue being one of many side effects.In addition, if you're regularly working out, you may need more calories to help support that activity.
Try not to cut out calories so that your total level goes below 1,200 daily. This is typically recommended as the absolute minimum., A balanced diet is important for overall health, but will also supply your body with all the essential nutrients it needs to function. When your diet is not balanced, you may suffer from fatigue and other side effects.


A balanced diet is one that includes foods from each food group most days. In addition, it's a diet that includes a wide variety of foods from within each individual food group over the course of a week.Some diets and dieting patterns suggest avoiding large quantities of foods or entire food groups. Low-carb diets for example may want you to avoid grains, starchy vegetables, dairy foods and fruits. A common side effect of low-carb diets is fatigue.Ask your doctor about getting your iron checked. Low iron levels in the body can have a major impact on your energy levels. If your doctor finds you have low iron levels, you can discuss getting more iron through diet or supplements.

, If you're feeling fatigued, obviously getting enough sleep should be high on your list. Without adequate sleep it may be hard to find the energy and motivation to work out.


Without adequate sleep you may notice you're more tired. In addition, chronic lack of sleep can put you at increased risk for a whole host of health problems.It's typically recommended adults get around seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Try going to bed earlier and sleeping later if you can.

, Too much stress or long periods of chronic stress can wreak havoc on your life. Being fatigued and tired is just one of many symptoms that are associated with too much stress.Although exercise is thought to help relieve and help manage stress, it can become a vicious cycle when you're too tired to exercise and can't get a hold on your daily stresses.
If you can't fit in your usual workout, try other stress relieving activities like talking to a friend or family member, meditating, taking a hot shower, going to bed earlier or reading a good book.
If you find that stress is the number one cause of your fatigue and you're having difficulty managing it, consider speaking to a therapist for additional techniques.

Schedule in your exercise.,
Write down your exercise motivations.,
Go for a short workout.,
Do something fun.,
Ensure you're using correct form.",How to Reduce Fatigue for Easier Working Out2," Many times it may be difficult to find the time to fit a workout into your busy schedule. But studies have shown if you take a step back and start scheduling in your workouts like you would a doctor's appointment, you might have better success.Take some free time on your days off and review your upcoming schedule for the week. Look for slots within some of your days (it can be three to five days a week) that you could fit in some exercise. It can be an hour of time or something as short as 10–15 minutes.
Write your workout in your weekly calendar or datebook, or program it into your phone as a reminder.

, Keep yourself motivated to work out when you're feeling tired by focusing on the benefits of exercise. Studies have shown that this may help you follow through with your workouts.Before you can visualize, spend some time writing down the benefits you get from being active. You might write about being able to maintain your weight or lose weight, feeling more energetic during the day, feeling more fit and healthy, or feeling strong and confident.
You can also choose to think about all the health benefits of physical activity, like decreased risk of high blood pressure or diabetes, better control of blood sugar and blood pressure, improved circulation and better sleep patterns and mood.If you're not feeling up for a workout, spend a few minutes visualizing how you'll feel, how it'll feel doing the exercise, how you'll feel immediately afterwards and long-term. Imagine yourself powering through your workout, feeling positive and confident in yourself, feeling proud of yourself and reaching long-term goals.

, It's recommended to get in about 150 minutes of cardio a week. Although that seems like a long time, it works out to 30 minutes five days a week, and there is no guideline that says it can't be done in short intervals throughout the day.If you're not up for a full- on workout or are too tired to hit the gym, do a short 10-minute activity. It still counts as exercise and the benefits are almost identical to those people who did longer bouts of exercise.
Don't get frustrated or upset with yourself if you're not in the mood to work out. Try a 10-minute walk, restorative and relaxing yoga or a few isometric exercises (like planks).
Another strategy is to present yourself with small opportunities to get some activity in your life. For instance, get off the bus a few stops early and walk the rest of the way or skip the elevator in the morning and take the stairs. Commit yourself to do one thing like this each day.

, If you're tired and you do not particularly enjoy the exercise you're supposed to be doing, there's probably little chance you'll follow through. Choose fun and exciting forms of exercise to help motivate you.If going to the gym is not your thing or you find running miserable, you're less likely to continue exercising. Find something you truly enjoy that also counts as physical activity.
Try something outside the box, like hiking, kayaking, swimming, taking dance lessons or playing a team sport.
Also try working out with a friend or in a group setting. This can make it more fun if you have someone to socialize with as well., If you're not using correct form for exercises you're at increased risk for injury, but you may also be tiring yourself out.When you're not using correct form or even using too much weight, your body spends more energy and calories. This can create fatigue in the short and long-term.
If you do exercises, especially strength exercises, try performing the exercises in front of a mirror so you can see what you're body is doing and what form you're using.
Make sure not to do strength training on the same muscle group two days in a row. For example, do not do leg strengthening exercises on Monday and Tuesday. This can create muscle fatigue and doesn't help build strength over time.Also consider making an appointment with a personal trainer or a staff member at your local gym. They may be able to guide you more closely on how to do certain exercises or use equipment and help you find exercises you really enjoy to help you feel motivated.

You're in charge of the kids and everything else going on in your home. It can be tough to find time to exercise during the day. If you want to spend some extra time exercising or doing a specific type of exercise (like taking a spin class), don't be afraid to ask for help from others so you can have time to get in some activity.Talk to your spouse or other family members (like older children or your parents) and ask if they can watch little children so you can have free time to do some exercise.
Also talk to others in your home about setting up an exercise schedule. Make a system in which one person can work out while the other person watches the kids.
Talk to another stay at home parent about taking turns watching each other's kids so the one of you can get in a workout, then switch.
Hire a babysitter, even for just an hour, to get through an exercise DVD.;
, It's hard to think during the day of when you'll have a few free minutes to exercise. Setting up a workout schedule at the beginning of the week can help get around this barrier.Take 30 minutes or so when you have some down time (maybe on the weekends or during nap time) to write out your daily schedule. Make sure to write down everything you do during a typical day.
Review your schedule and look for 20 or 30 minutes of free time. This is when you should pencil in some physical activity.
Also look for time when you could make an extra 20 or 30 minutes. For example, could you wake up a few minutes earlier? Or could you exercise during other chores like waiting for the laundry? If you have older kids that play sports, plan on bringing younger kids with you and walk around the field or courts during practice.
Get consistent with making this schedule. You're more likely to stick to your routine when you have a pre-planned schedule. Keeping a routine will help you and your kids find times for the important things in your day.
At the same time, it can be tricky to have predictable free time as a parent. Be ready to get in some exercise without too much planning. Learn some bodyweight exercises, be prepared to squeeze in 100 jumping jacks while the kids are in the bath, or just go for it and do 10 squats or pushups before cleaning up the lunch dishes.

, Although downtime might not be something you have often, take advantage of any spare minutes to fit in some extra activity. This is a great time to plan more structured exercise as well.


Think about your daily schedule. Do you normally have some down time? For example, does your child normally nap from two to four in the afternoon? This is a great time to fit in exercise.
Try to make the most of times when your child is asleep or otherwise occupied. This is a great time to pop in an exercise DVD or watch an online video.
You can also try to get your child to nap in a stroller. Many children are lulled to sleep while in a stroller. This could be a great time for them to nap and for you to get in a long walk.

, If you're the type of person that wants to do more intense activity, take gym classes or have access to more equipment, you might want to hit the gym. You'll need to have someone watch your child as you work out. If you're lucky, your spouse, other children or a friend can help you watch your child. If this is not possible, look for a facility that offers daycare.


Many gyms offer child care as a service to their customers.
Many gym and fitness center child care services are not as highly regulated as daycare facilities. Although most are safe, make sure to thoroughly review the policies set by your gym.
Ask if the staff members have CPR training, ask how many children are allowed at one time, if they perform background checks on staff and what age range is allowed., If you need to stay at home, especially if you have a small child, you might want to consider having some basic gym equipment at home. This will allow you to do more in your home instead of having to go to a gym.


Consider keeping one or two sets of small dumbbells or kettlebells at home. You can do a whole variety of strength training exercises with just a few weights.
Also consider having a yoga or fitness mat at home as well. If you want to do pilates or other floor exercises, these mats can make these activities much more comfortable.
If you have the space and the budget, you may also want to have a cardio machine at home. A treadmill or elliptical are great machines to have at home and allow you to do cardio anytime.

, If you're short on time as a stay at home parent, you need to make sure you get the most out of your time. Making your workouts efficient can help you cut down on the time spent on exercising.


Aim to do more than one exercise at the same time. Whether you combine both cardio and strength training exercises or do multiple strength exercises at once, this can help make your workouts more efficient.

HIIT (high-intensity interval training) is a great type of workout to do as a stay at home parents. It's quick, high-intensity and can incorporate both strength and aerobic exercise.
Also consider doing multiple strength exercises at once. For example, as you do lunges also do bicep curls. Or as you do squats, also do shoulder presses.

, If you enjoy running or biking outdoors, you don't have to avoid or skip these workouts if you're a stay at home parent. With a little planning and the right equipment, you can still enjoy exercising in the outdoors.


Consider purchasing a running stroller. These may be a little expensive, but a great investment if you're a runner. Plus, running while pushing a stroller adds resistance to your runs and can help improve the strength and endurance in your legs.
If you're a cyclist, you might want to consider purchasing a toddler carrier. You attach these little wagon-like carriers to the back of your bicycle. You can securely fasten your child inside and enjoy a nice long bike ride.
If your child is old enough, they may be able to ride their bike alongside of you as you run or jog.

, If you enjoy yoga, you might enjoy doing this relaxing and strengthening exercise with your child. This is a particularly good workout if you have a toddler at home.


Many toddlers love to imitate their parents and participate in the same activities. Take advantage of this childhood stage and get them involved in doing yoga with you.Since children may not be able to do all poses or stay focused for a 45 minute yoga session, try doing a 10 minute sun salutation routine with your child.
There are also some poses that you can do with your child. Downward dog, sun bathing rock and boat pose are great for young children.

, If you have a baby or infant, consider bringing your baby as part of your exercise routine in a front carrier. Depending on the weight of your child, she will add 10 or 15 pounds of extra weight and resistance to your body.To start simple, you can just go for walks outside or bring your child with you to the grocery store or the mall. Again, the extra weight adds more resistance to your walk.
You can also strap on your child to add more weight and resistance to strength training exercises. Try it first with a bag of potatoes or something heavy in the carrier to make sure you can do the exercise safely with your child strapped to you. The extra weight in front or on your back affects your balance, so start gradually. Once you have established that you can do a move safely with a child strapped to you, proceed with caution.
For example, you can do lunges, squats or skater lunges with your child securely fastened in a front carrier.

, If you need a little inspiration to get you to exercise more regularly, consider purchasing and using exercise DVDs or online videos. These help you have access to multiple types of workouts right in your own home.Before purchasing any DVD's or downloading videos (that have a cost) read reviews and overviews of what the DVDs contain.
Also choose DVDs or videos that will fit your needs. Some videos have 15 or 20 minute intense cardio sessions, some have 60 minute cardio sessions and some have a combination of both strength training and cardio.
DVDs and online videos are great, especially when you have some down time at home. You can pop in a video and get in a quick workout without having to leave your home.

, Going for a run or hitting up the gym for a spin class isn't the only type of exercise you can do. If you're a stay at home parent, make exercise something fun for both you and your child.Playing kids games, either indoors or outdoors, is a great way to stay active and burn calories. For example, you can play hide and go seek or tag outside with your child to get in more movement.
Crank up the music (either your favorite or your child's) and have a dance party together.
You can also have races with your child. Whether you're running or biking together, race against each other.
Remember that you are the parent and your child's safety is your responsibility. Don't get competitive and always be aware of your surroundings and possible hazards. Children can fall or trip where you might not. Be aware of this and behave accordingly.

, When you're planning out your weekly exercise, make sure to try and aim for a minimum of 150 minutes each week.This is the guideline set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If you set up a schedule and plan ahead, you should be able to get in the recommended 150 minutes each week. It's only about 2 1/2 hours total.
To count as cardio, you need to do an activity for at least 10 minutes. That means you have a lot of freedom on how to split up the 150 minutes.
For example, you can do 30 minutes five times a week. Or you could do 10 minutes three times a day, five days a week. All end up meeting the 150 minute guideline.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also important to get in adequate amounts of strength training. The required amount is significantly less than cardiovascular exercise.


Aim for at least one or two days of strength training each week. Your workout should last about 20 minutes and you need to work every major muscle group.Like cardio exercises, you can also split up your strength training exercises. As long as you work every major muscle group, you'll meet the requirements.
For example, you can do a 10 minute upper body workout in the morning and a 10 minute lower body workout in the afternoon.

, You won't necessarily be able to get in a traditional workout everyday — especially as a stay at home parent; however, adding more lifestyle activity to your routine can help you stay fit and active.


Lifestyle activities are those activities that you do on a normal and typical day. They do not burn many calories alone, but when added up at the end of the day, can have a significant impact on your health.In fact, studies have shown that the benefits seen with more structured aerobic exercise are very similar to the benefits seen with high quantities of lifestyle activities.
Lifestyle activities can include exercises like: gardening, mopping the floor, going out to get the mail, carrying the laundry up and down the stairs, chasing after your toddler at the playground or parking farther away when you go out.
Think through a typical day and try find times or situations in which you can move more, take more steps or be more active. Try taking the stairs more often, get out and play with your kids in the yard or try to do more housework during the day. Go to the shopping mall and take the stairs, walk the length of the mall, holding hands or carrying the little one.
Kids love yard work like digging or raking. Get them child-sized garden tools to help and you might get more done than you expected.

, In addition to all the activity that you're planning on doing during the week, it's also important to include a rest day. These are just as essential to your overall fitness routine.


If you find it hard to be active every single day of the week as a stay at home parent, you're in luck. It's actually important to have about one or two rest days each week.Rest days are when you see the most gains in strength and muscle mass. If you're looking to increase these, make sure to include rest days.
Rest days are also great for your overall health and mind. It gives you time to relax, unwind and let your body recover from other activities.
Although you shouldn't do a lot of activity on rest days, you can still go for a walk or participate in your regular lifestyle activities.

To add extra weight and work your arms as well, try holding one 3 to 10 pound weight in each hand.

, Get on your hands and knees with your back straight, arms shoulder width apart, and your legs hip width apart. With your leg still bent at 90 degrees, lift one leg, pushing your heel to the ceiling until your thigh is almost parallel to the floor. Hold for 3 seconds, squeezing your leg and butt muscles. Lower your leg until the knee is back on the floor. Do 2-3 sets of 20 reps with each leg.


Your movements should be controlled and slow and your back straight. You work your muscles harder this way but you don't risk injury., Stand with your legs hip width apart with your feet, knees, and hips in perfect alignment. Pushing on the balls of your feet, raise your heels. Hold for 2 seconds, making sure to keep your ankles from turning out or twisting. Return to start. Do 3 sets of 30.


You can hold hand weights or a kettlebell to add weight to your lifts.
To intensify the lift, stand on a stair, a phone book, or other small, stable surface with your heels hanging slightly over the side. Raise up like normal, but when you come back down, drop your heels lower to make a deeper stretch., With your feet hip-width apart, slowly lower into a squat, keeping your knees over your toes. Slowly stand and lift one leg far out to the side. Bring it back down into standing position. Do 2-3 sets of 20 reps on each leg.To add intensity, you can add a resistance band around your ankles. This will engage your muscles when you are in your squat and add weight and intensity to your leg lift.

, Stand with your legs slightly bent with a 3-10 pound weight in each hand. Bend at the waist until upper body is parallel to floor; letting weights travel down your thighs, keeping your back straight, and your knees slightly bent. Reverse the movement, including the weights, back up thighs as you clench your thigh muscles. Repeat 20 times.


Unlike the squat, you keep your legs straight with only a slight bend in the knee. Make sure you don't lock your knees in order to prevent injury and discomfort.
You can also do this exercise with a barbell if you want more weight. When bending over, gently slide the barbell down and up your thighs as you complete the movement., Stand with legs shoulder width apart. Bending down in a lunge, step your right leg diagonally behind you toward the left side in a curtsy, bending your left leg 90 degrees. Bend your right arm up with your hand by your face and hold your left arm down beside you for balance. As you stand back up, move your right leg back to center, setting it down. Go straight into the next lunge, starting the next rep.Do this exercise slowly at first while you get used to the movements. You can easily lose your balance or twist a muscle.
Switch sides each time you lunge with a small hop in between to add a cardio portion to this exercise.
To increase intensity, pause in your lunge for a few counts or, after the lunge, bring your knee up towards your chest instead of standing straight., Stand with your legs together and your hands by your side. Jump your legs out and raise your arms, just like a typical jumping jack. When you jump back in, bend down and touch your toes, engaging your leg muscles. Do reps for 30 to 50 seconds.This exercise is a great cardio workout as well. Try to increase your time as you get stronger.

, Start standing on one foot. Jump on that foot from side to side, holding your arms at 90 degree angles beside you for balance. Do this for 30 to 50 seconds on one side, rest for a minute, and then do it on the other.


You can start off jumping at a slow pace until you get the hang of it, but try to increase your speed and your time for a better cardio workout and muscle training.Make sure you engage your leg muscle for the best stability.

Bend down into a squat until your legs are at 90 degrees, lightly grabbing onto your thighs. Jump up, bringing your feet together and landing with your legs side by side, almost like a jumping jack. Jump back out into a the squat position to start the next rep. Do 20 reps.


This workout incorporates cardio as well to help burn fat and promote lean as well as strong muscles.
As an advanced move, instead of landing with your feet side by side, crisscross your legs. This adds extra stretch and difficulty., Standing in front of a step, bench, chair, or other stable surface strong enough to hold your weight, place your right foot on top of the bench. Step up onto the top of the bench, bringing your left leg to rest beside your right. Step back down with the left leg, returning to your starting position with your right leg still on the step. Do 10 to 12 reps with each leg as lead.


To add intensity, try holding hand weights to add weight for each leg to lift. You can also increase your speed to add a cardio element.
The size of your step depends on your level of comfort and ability. Start at a height that is comfortable and increase it as you get stronger.

, Hold a five pound weight down in each hand, resting against your thighs. Stand with your hips over hip width apart. Slowly bend your knees 90 degrees as you move into a squat, keeping your knees from going over your toes. Move your arms straight down toward the floor. Stand back up to complete the rep. Repeat for a total of 15 reps.


Try to increase your number of reps as you increase your strength. , Stand with your feet hip width apart. Step far out with your right leg, squatting down and bending your right knee 90 degrees with your knee over your toes. This will pull your left leg straight. Place your hand on the floor in front of you for support and balance. Stand back up, bringing your right leg back to rest beside your left. Do 15-20 reps on each leg.


For a more advanced move, bend your leg behind you and touch the bottom of your foot each time you stand back up from the lunge. You can also increase your speed to add cardio to this step.

, Lie on the floor and place your legs hip-width apart on a bench, chair, or couch. Bend your knees between 70 and 90 degrees, toes pointing at the ceiling. Press your heels into the bench and lift your hips toward the ceiling, clenching your butt muscles. Drop your hips back to the ground to complete one rep. Do 15 reps.


Do as many sets of reps as you feel comfortable. If you can only do one set of 15 at first, try to work up to more sets as your muscles strengthen.
For a more advanced workout, do this exercise with a single leg on the bench instead of both., Stand with back, shoulders, and butt pressed against a wall and your feet slightly away from the wall. Keep feet hip-width apart. Slide down until thighs are parallel to floor. Hold for one count, then slide up. Do 12 reps.


To intensify this exercise, try using an exercise ball or holding the counts for longer periods of time. The exercise ball isn't nearly as stable as the wall and will engage your butt and abs more. Holding the counts longer will add intensity for your legs and butt muscles., Stand with your feet as wide apart as you feel comfortable with your toes pointed out away from your body. Hold one 3 to 10 pound hand weight or kettlebell in your hands with your arms straight down in front of you. Bend your knees until your thighs are parallel to floor, legs pointing out toward your toes and away from your body. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then straighten legs, keeping heels flat. Squeeze thighs and butt as you come up. Do 15 reps.


Make sure your knees stay over your toes, pointed out, when doing these squats. Otherwise, you might twist your ankles and injure yourself.If you want to add a cardio element to this step, when you raise back up to starting position, jump in place, returning to starting position before heading into the next squat.

, Lie flat on your back, knees bent in front of you and arms and hands flat on the floor. Raise up your butt, bringing your torso into a bridge shape and using your arms still on the floor for stability. From here, lift your right leg until your knee is pointed at the ceiling. Bring the leg back down. Do the same with your left leg to complete one rep. Do 15 to 20 reps.


To increase the cardio aspect of this exercise, raise your legs faster.Make sure your back stays straight and your arms remain engaged. You don't want to injure yourself by straining your back or losing your balance.

Be careful that your knees don't point inwards in a ""knock knee"" or Valgus position. They should be positioned over the second toe.;
, Let your arms hang loosely at your sides while you crouch into the half-squat. They'll provide a lot of momentum when you jump, so don't keep them in front of you or above you before you jump.

, You don't need to spend lots of time meditating on your jumps before doing them, but it helps to visualize the steps you'll take. Visualize the push-off and see yourself leaping in the air toward (or over) your target. You'll be focused on the series of steps and tasks you're about to complete, ensuring a successful jump.

, As soon as you've crouched into a half-squat, immediately spring up into a high jump. Push off from the balls of your feet. Extend your hips, knees, and ankles as far and as quickly as you can., Gradually bring your arms behind your back while keeping them at your sides. When you start to jump up, powerfully swing your arms forward and up into the air. This should help propel you up and provide momentum.Exhale when you're doing the motion, like when you lift weights.

, Land on the balls of your feet rather than on your toes. Make sure to land with your knees bent and slightly aligned forward. Both of your legs should equally accept the weight of your landing.This will absorb the shock of hitting the ground and prevent knee injury.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.Bend one leg at the knee and bring it behind you. Keep the rest of your body relaxed.

, Slowly crouch into a half-squat position on the one foot that is planted. Do this while your torso gradually bends forward. Flex your hips at 30 degrees. Your knees should be bent at 60 degrees and your ankle should be flexed at 25 degrees. This will generate the most power without injuring your knees.

Both of your legs should equally accept the weight of your landing.This will absorb the shock of hitting the ground and prevent knee injury.

, To do a squat, simply stand with your back straight, against a wall if you'd like. Your knees should be shoulder-width apart and your legs should be about 18 inches in front of you. Slowly squat by sitting down till you are level with your knees.These exercises develop the hamstrings, glutes, and quads which are the key drivers to helping you jump higher. If you feel pain at any time, stop the exercise.

, Build strength in these muscles by gripping a raised surface with your toes and using your calf muscles to do short dips. You can try doing calf raises with one leg at a time, both legs, or even from a seated position.


The calves are another important muscle group in improving your jumping. Try holding some weight while you do this to increase the resistance and build strength.

, Stretch your hamstrings and buttocks by laying on your back with one leg crossed over the other at the knee. Pull the lower leg toward you firmly and steadily. This should stretch the hamstring of the crossed leg. For another exercise, touch your toes while seated, standing, with your legs spread, and with your legs crossed.


If you're not flexible you'll develop an imbalance of strength. This could limit your ability to jump., Jumps, hops, and lunges are known as plyometrics. Plyometrics are high intensity movements which increase your heart rate quickly. Endurance training can actually improve your quick twitch muscle fibers, making jumping more powerful.For a maximum exercise, try holding about one-third of the weight that you normally lift. Jump explosively and repeat it as many times as you can.

Take a look at the main reasons that creating a regular exercise habit is so difficult:





Too difficult.,
Keep it simple.,
Log it daily.,
Report to others.,
Add motivation as needed.",How to Start the Exercise Habit," People set out with a lot of ambition and enthusiasm, and start out with a big goal. “I’m going to go to the gym for an hour a day!” or “I’m going to run 30 minutes every day!” The problem is that the goal is too difficult to sustain for very long. You can do it for a few days, but you soon run out of energy, and it becomes a drag to do it, so you let it drop all too soon.

Too many goals. Often we set out to do too much. We want to run, and lift weights, and eat healthy, and quit sweets, and stop drinking soda. Well, those are multiple goals, and you cannot focus on the exercise habit if you’re trying to do all the others at the same time. Or we might start with one goal, but then get caught up in another goal (to stop procrastinating, for example), and lose our focus on the first one.

Not enough motivation. It’s not a lack of discipline, it’s a lack of motivation. The most powerful motivators are logging your habit and public pressure. There are many others that help as well.

;
, Here are the four simple steps to start the exercise habit (and keep it going).


Set one easy, specific, measurable goal. There are several keys to setting this crucial goal:
Written: Write this down. Post it up. If you don’t write it down, it’s not important.
Easy: Don’t — do not — set a difficult goal. Set one that is super, super easy. Five minutes of exercise a day. You can do that. Work your way to 10 minutes after a month. Then go to 15 after 2 months. Make it easy to start with, so you can build your habit, then gradually increase.
Specific: By specific, this means asking yourself what activity are you going to do, at what time of day, and where? Don’t just say “exercise” or “I’m going to walk”. You have to set a time and place. Make it an appointment you can’t miss.


Trigger: Have a “trigger” right before you do your habit. For example, you might always brush your teeth right after you shower. The shower is the trigger for brushing your teeth, and because of that, you never forget to brush your teeth. Well, what will you do right before you exercise? Is it right after you wake up? Right after your coffee? Right when you get home? As soon as you take off for lunch? A trigger that you do every single day is important.
Measurable: You should be able to say, definitely, whether you hit or miss your goal today. Examples: run for 10 minutes. Walk 1/2 a mile. Do 3 sets of 5 push-ups. Each of those has a number that you can shoot for.
One goal: Stick to this one goal for at least a month. Two months if you can bear it. Don’t start up a second goal during that 30-day period. If you do, you are scrapping this goal.

, This is the key habit. If you can log your workout, you will start to see your progress, and it will motivate you to keep going. And you have to make it a habit to log it right away. Don’t put it off, and say you’ll do it before you go to bed. As soon as you’re done working out, log it. No exceptions. And don’t make the log complicated — that will only make you resist doing the log. Just the date, time, and what you did.

, This is key. You can do it on your blog, on an online forum, with your spouse, or friends or family, or a workout partner, or a coach, or a group, or a class. However you set it up, make it part of the process that you have to report your daily workout to other people. It could be using an online log, or on a forum, or through email, or the phone, or just by telling your co-workers what you did this morning. But be sure that they know your goal, and that you are going to report to them, and be sure that they are expecting it every day.

, The first three steps might be enough for you to get the habit going. But if not, don’t just give up. If you miss two consecutive workouts, you need to look at why, and add a new motivation. Rewards, more public pressure, inspiration, whatever it takes. You can add one additional motivator, and then see if it works. If you miss two more consecutive workouts at any time, add another motivator. And so on, until the exercise habit sticks.

In fact, that 30 minute to 1 hour period you spend lifting, pulling and pushing weight every day should be extremely uncomfortable. If it's not, you aren't putting enough stress on your muscles to help them grow stronger. Challenge yourself to ""go all in"" with every single workout to see maximum results over time.


Some bodybuilding experts advise ""training to failure."" This means pushing yourself so hard at the end of any given workout that you are unable to do one more rep. Training to failure puts the type of stress on your muscles that causes them to break down and rebuild.
If you're new to strength training, consider working with a personal trainer before pushing yourself too hard. It's important to learn the right techniques for each type of exercise; otherwise, an injury might prevent you from being able to continue working out and gaining strength.;
, Once your body becomes accustomed to a certain amount of weight, you'll need to keep adding more to continue challenging yourself. You'll know it's time to add more weight to a particular routine when it starts to feel easier, and you're able to complete several sets of reps without ""failure"" occurring. Adding another 5 pounds or 5 reps is the way to continue challenging yourself and building muscle.


Be careful not to add too much weight. You should be able to do between 8 and 10 reps before ""failure"" happens. If you can't do 4 reps without giving out, you're probably lifting too much weight. If you can do 10 or 12 without feeling the burn, you probably need to add more weight.

, Cardio exercises like running, swimming, and biking are great ways to keep your endurance good and your circulation healthy. However, only resistance training with heavy weight will build skeletal muscle. Weight training requires loads of energy, and if yours has already been used up by a long run or bike ride, you won't have enough left over to give weight training your best shot.

, Some people want big, strong arms, but don't care as much about their abs. Others want to focus on legs, pecs, and so on, but don't mind if their arms aren't as strong. However, it's a good idea to train every muscle group in your body, rather than focusing on just one. Having a strong core will help you bench press more weight with your arms. Being able to lift heavier weights with your arms will give your legs a better workout. All the muscle groups in your body work together, and it's important to give them equal attention.


Don't work out every muscle group the same day. For instance, if you focus on your arms one day, during your next workout session you should give your arms a break and work on your legs or core instead. This gives your muscles time to rest and heal, preventing injury and promoting strength.

, If you want to get strong, fast, you might be tempted to work out every single day. However, your body needs adequate rest in order to build back the muscle tissue you break down during workouts. If you work out every day, you'll never give your muscles the chance to get bigger and stronger. Plan to work out 3 or 4 days per week, remembering to rotate muscle groups.


On your ""off"" days, it's fine to go for a run, a bike ride, or do some other type of exercise to keep yourself moving and relax your muscles.

, The basic squat, and its many variations, is an excellent exercise for building muscle in the legs, glutes and abs. The simple motion of bending your knees to drop your body toward the ground while keeping your back upright, then raising yourself up again is just as effective as using fancy exercise equipment to work out the same muscles. Try the following squat variations:



The basic squat. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your back upright. Bend your knees and lower your butt until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Raise back up to starting position, with your knees aligned vertically above your feet. You can hold dumbbells or a barbell to make the exercise more challenging; aim to do 3 sets of 10 squats.

The box squat. Stand in front of an exercise box or chair. Hold either dumbbells or a barbell at your chest. Lower yourself to a sitting position, hold for a moment, then raise back up to standing position.
The back squat. For this one you'll need a squat rack, which has a bar connected to weights that you move as you squat.Stand under the squat bar and grip the bar with your palms facing outward. As you squat, pull the bar with you either behind your head or at your chest. Squat until your thighs are parallel with the ground, then move back to starting position.

, Lifting and pulling your own weight can go a long way toward building muscle. The basic push up and chin up are invaluable exercises you can do with very little equipment. Increase their difficulty by adding reps or affixing weights to your legs. Do these simple, effective exercises to work out your biceps and triceps, as well as your core.



The push up. Stretch out face-down on the floor or an exercise mat. Place your palms on either side of your body next to your armpits. Use your arms to lift your body so that your shoulders, stomach and legs are no longer touching the ground; only your toes and your hands should be touching it. Lower yourself to the ground and repeat to failure.

The chin up. For this exercise you'll need a chin up bar. Stand below the bar and grip the bar with your palms facing outward. Use your arms to lift your body toward the bar until your chin is above the top of the bar, crossing your feet behind you to keep them off of the ground. Lower yourself until your arms are straight, then repeat to failure.

, Dead-lifting is simply bending over to lift a weight, straightening up, then bending back over. It's an excellent exercise for your hamstrings, abs, and back muscles. With deadlifting, it's important to use the proper form and the right amount of weight for your strength level - otherwise, you might strain your back. Try these exercises:



The barbell deadlift. Stand in front of a barbell loaded with the amount of weight you can lift 10-15 or so times before failure occurs. Bend at the knees and grip the barbell with both hands. Stand upright, then bend your knees and repeat. Gradually increase the amount of weight and decrease the amount of reps as you build strength.

The straight leg deadlift. Stand in front of an exercise ball, a barbell, or a set of dumbbells. Keeping your legs straight, bend at the waist and grip the weights with both hands. Holding the weights straight in front of your body, straighten up to a standing position; your arms should be stretched out in front of you holding the weights. Lower the weights down to starting position and repeat. Begin with a limited range of motion and slowly build up to the full deadlift.

, Bench pressing is an important way to gain strength in your arms, and pectoral muscles. To bench weight, you'll need a barbell and an exercise bench. Load the barbell with the amount of weight you can bench about 8 times per set. Slowly add weights if possible in a period of time. Use the following technique to bench press the weight:


Lie back on the exercise bench. Your knees should be bent over the edge, and your feet should be resting comfortably on ground.
Start with the barbell close to your chest, then lift it toward the ceiling, straightening your arms.
Bend your arms to bring the barbell back to your chest, then repeat.
Rack the bar and add more weight for the next set.

, If you're looking for strength-building exercises that don't require equipment, planks and crunches are for you. These exercises focus on your abs, and they're easy to do anytime, anywhere.



Do the plank. Lie face-down on the floor with your elbows bent and your palms next to your armpits. Lift your body upward as though you were going to do a pushup. Keep your arms straight and hold the position for 30 seconds or more before lowering back to the ground, then rest and repeat.
Do crunches. Lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground. ""Crunch"" your body into a semi-seated position by using your ab muscles to lift your head and shoulders forward, keeping your arms crossed over your chest. Lower your head back toward the floor, then repeat. You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by holding a dumbbell close to your chest.

, Building muscle requires burning calories. It's important to eat sufficient calories to fuel muscle growth while you're training. That said, not all calories are equally great for building muscle; you'll want to eat healthy, whole foods that will nourish and restore your muscles, rather than depleting your body.You also need to remember that even if you don't like vegetables you still need it for stronger muscle.


Be sure to hit all the basic food groups. Eat loads of fruits and vegetables, fish, eggs, and lean meat, whole grains, and healthy oils and fats.
Avoid sugar, processed flours, salty snack foods, fried foods, and foods packaged with additives and preservatives.

, Drink about two to three liters of water a day to keep your body hydrated during training periods. Even though many sports enthusiasts drink energy drinks, water is the best choice, since it contains no sugars or other additives. If you want to add flavor, try a squeeze of lemon or lime.

, Creatine is a popular supplement that has been shown to safely increase muscle mass.It's an amino acid that is naturally produced by the body to make muscles bigger and stronger. If you take the correct dosage, you may see improvements in your muscle tone more quickly.


Creatine comes in powdered form, and must be mixed with water in order to activate.
Beware other substances on the market that claim to be able to boost your muscles quickly. Before you decide to try a product, do some research to find out whether it has been scientifically tested for safety and efficiency.

, Many people take this step lightly, but it's absolutely essential when it comes to building muscle. If you don't get enough sleep, your body won't be in tip-top shape during workouts. That means you won't be able to work out as hard or lift as much as you otherwise would, not to mention you'll be more prone to injury if you're feeling sleepy. Get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night, possibly more depending on your individual needs, during heavy workout periods.

"
Before you start working out, come up with an exercise routine.,
Start out with a set of dumbbells if you want to build muscle mass and eventually develop bulky muscles, or use resistance bands if you want to develop lean and toned muscles.,
As a beginner, you should lift weights 2 to 3 times a week, and you should never lift weights for consecutive days, as your body needs rest to help muscles recover and grow.

,
Depending on your needs, perform exercises like dumbbell curls, overhead extensions, bench presses, shoulder presses, squats, and lunges.,
Continue this routine for 2 weeks.,
Perform cardiovascular activity 3 times a week; do cardio on the days when you don't lift weights.",How to Get Stronger Muscles when You Are Currently Weak1," An exercise routine will keep you focused and is great way for you to track your progress. If you can afford it, talk to a personal trainer at a gym to come up a safe and efficient plan. If you don't have access to a gym, browse the Internet to find fitness tests and perform a test to measure your fitness level to develop an appropriate plan. You can exercise at at the gym or at home; remember that you can modify exercises that require extra equipment if you workout at home.;
, If you are weak, you will want to start with 3 to 8 pound weights or weights that you can lift for an exercise of 8 to 12 repetitions and 2 to 3 sets. If you are using resistance bands, start with light or medium resistance bands.

,, You can perform any of these exercises with dumbbells or resistance bands. Aim for 8 to 12 repetitions and 2 to 3 sets of each exercise.


You should know the proper form for various exercises before you perform them. Proper form not only keeps you safe, but ensures you get the exercises' maximum benefits. Watch videos on the Internet for demonstrations.

, After 2 weeks, you can use heavier weights or increase resistance if using bands. After 4 weeks, you need to change your exercise routine to prevent you from hitting a plateau. You can change your exercise routine by changing the order in which your perform your exercises; lifting heavier weights; and performing new exercises.

, Cardio sessions should last between 30 minutes to an hour. Excellent cardio activities include running, jumping rope, swimming, and cycling. Switch activities every couple of weeks.

Warm up your wrists.,
Practice wrist extensions.,
Do radial training.,
Do wrist releases.,
Stretch out your wrists.,
Be patient.",How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists1," Before working your wrist muscles, warm them up by performing unweighted wrist movements. These could include hand circles and wrist flexions and extensions. This helps gradually loosen the wrist area and prepares you for training your wrists.
, Wrist extensions are an easy exercise that you can start doing at home to increase flexibility in the forearm muscles that power your wrist. Doing wrist extensions is the best way to gradually start getting bigger wrists.



Rest the back of your forearm on a table or on your leg. Your palm should be facing up, and your hand should be aligned with your arm.
Place a light weight in that hand, then slowly lower the weight toward the floor. The movement should take you five seconds, then bring the wrist back up to starting position. 
Do two sets of 10 or 15 reps with each wrist four or five times a week.

, Radial training works much like wrist extensions, except you're emphasizing a different muscle motion by changing the direction of the exercise. This type of exercise is very common in physical rehabilitation routines after wrist injuries, and you can do radial wrist exercises at home.



Grab a dumbbell, then stand with your arms at your side. Tilt the dumbbell toward the ceiling and slowly lower it down. Do two sets of 10 or 15 reps with each wrist four or five times a week.

, This is an excellent way of stretching your wrists out at the end of a work out, decreasing the possibility of injury or soreness.Do this at the end of each exercise routine.










Place one hand on the back of the other with the hand flexed towards the wrist. Hold the hand in place by applying some pressure on it and move the forearm lower to increase the angle. Hold for six to ten seconds, then work the opposite arm.

, Doing wrist stretches is an important part of working up to any strength training routine that you want to integrate into your overall fitness. Especially if you've got small or ""weak"" wrists, it's a good idea to stretch things out before you get started.



Get on your hands and knees and place your hands flat on the ground with your fingers pointing back toward your body. Keep your arms straight and locked and stretch your wrists gently. Don't force them. Count to fifteen.
When you get comfortable with that stretch, try to extend your legs out behind you and bring your hips down to the ground while pushing your torso up by fully extending your arms with your palms flat on the floor. In yoga, this is called the ""cobra pose"" and it can be very effective at stretching your wrists.

, Building strength takes time, which means you need to be patient. You're not going to do a couple exercises and wake up tomorrow to some big meat-claws at the end of your arms. The name of the game is consistency, not speed. Commit to a training routine and start doing it consistently, without taking a day off because you just don't feel like it. Have patience and work for stronger wrists.

Try intermittent fasting.",How to Get Ripped Fast," Lift weights or perform another type of intense resistance training 3-4 times a week. If you have access to a gym, start with a traditional bodybuilding split (targeting 2-3 muscles groups per session) so that at the end of the week you’ve hit every major muscle group; if you’re working out at home, bodyweight exercises such as push ups, pull ups, air squats and crunches will do just fine. It may seem counterintuitive, but training the muscles actually burns more calories in the long run than spending hours on the treadmill.Give attention to all of the important muscle groups (legs, back, core, chest, shoulders, arms, etc.) rather than just emphasizing showy muscles like the abs and biceps. Exercises like squats, lunges, rows, dips and shoulder presses that call for a high level of coordination are all excellent for building muscle in different parts of the body.
The body constantly uses up calories to maintain muscle tissue, even in a resting state. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you’ll be burning at a given time.;
, Use a strength-based approach to program your weight training sessions, performing 4-5 sets of each exercise, with around 5-10 repetitions in each set. Since you’ll be in a reduced calorie state from dieting, too much volume in the gym can actually break down muscle without receiving enough nutrients to repair it. Keeping your volume in check while building and maintaining quality muscle mass is all about shifting your focus from endurance to strength.Your weight training sessions should be relatively brief (no more than about an hour) and emphasize the major compound lifts (squats, deadlifts and benchpress).Take 2-3 days off per week to rest and give your body a chance to recover.

, Dedicate part of each workout to strengthening and building your core muscles. This could make up the last fifteen minutes of your weight training sessions, or you could add one or two dedicated core sessions each week. These core workouts should be comprised of ab-focused exercises such as weighted sit ups, crunches, leg lifts, planches and suitcase carries. For most people, a ripped physique is synonymous with rippling obliques and a chiseled, defined six-pack. The more your train the muscles of the mid and lower abdomen, the more prominent they will be once you begin to lean out.You will also receive some residual core work from the compound lifts you're performing to develop your strength and muscle mass (particularly squats and deadlifts).Localized core training will make the ab muscles more noticeable, but to really start looking ripped you should be certain that you're working out your entire body, getting a few hours of cardiovascular training each week and sticking to a reduced-calorie diet. 80% of achieving a lean physique lies in nutrition.

, In addition to weight training, get in a few hours of steady-state cardio every week. This can include jogging, swimming, cycling, rowing, kickboxing or even simply walking. While resistance training creates a lasting calorie burning effect at rest, cardiovascular training gets you into a consistent fat-burning rhythm. Done together, the two will display great results in no time.Keep your heart rate elevated, but don’t torture yourself. It’s more important to find a pace and intensity that you can keep up for the duration of the workout.
Finish your weight training workouts with an hour of cardio. You will have already used up the glycogen in your muscles while lifting weights, so your body will go straight to its fat stores for energy.Experiment with doing cardio in a fasted state (when you’ve had nothing to eat). For example, go on a short jog first thing in the morning before you eat breakfast. Keep the intensity and length of the workout moderate. Again, with no muscle glycogen to draw from for fuel, you’ll burn pure fat while you exert yourself., A couple times a week, set aside time for a quick Tabata or HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) session. These workouts don’t take long, but are extremely taxing, and can make a big impact on your fat stores. HIIT and other difficult programming methods are known to be metabolically dense, meaning they rev up the mechanisms that burn fat for energy and melt the pounds right off. HIIT programs and similar exercise methods are usually offered at fitness centers in the form of group classes.Tabata-style workouts are done by performing an exercise for 20 seconds, then taking 10 seconds rest. Repeat this sequence 8 times. The entire workout only takes 4 minutes, but you get a ton of bang for your buck.Apps like Tabata Timer and Tabata Stopwatch Pro make it easy to keep track of your activity and rest intervals using your smartphone.HIIT training involves exercising with a high pace or intensity for a preselected period of time (an “interval”), then dropping the intensity for a short interval before ramping it back up again. , Keep your diet in check to make sure that you’re not consuming more calories than you’re burning. The simplest and most effective way to do this is to record the approximate number of calories you take in with each meal. When trying to shed fat, it’s best to reduce your daily calories as much as possible while receiving all the necessary nutrients and preserving lean muscle. As long as your net calorie loss through exercise is greater than your intake through eating, you’ll continue to get leaner.The number of calories you should be eating will vary person to person, and depends largely on your bodyweight and composition (people with more muscle mass need more calories to maintain it), activity level and other factors.
Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you decide to put yourself on a reduced-calorie diet. An expert will be able to tell you exactly how many calories you'll need to maintain a healthy body composition for your size, age and activity level. They can also provide you with helpful recommendations for food and supplementation.Use a nutrition app (such as My Fitness Pal, My Diet Coach or Lose It!) or an old-fashioned journal to record the number of calories you consume on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to make sure you're on track to meet your goals., Reconfigure your personal food pyramid so that foods that are rich in protein comprise a bigger part of your diet. At the same time, drastically cut down on greasy, high-fat foods, or eliminate them altogether. High-fat foods are richer with calories, meaning it won’t take much of them to sabotage your nutrition plan. Lean, protein-packed foods, however, contain few calories on average. Their protein content will help you build valuable, calorie-incinerating muscle mass, as well as keep you feeling full longer.Get your protein from sources like lean meats, eggs, beans, tofu, nuts, etc. Stay away from fried foods, chips and other snack foods.
A good general guideline is to get at least 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your bodyweight: if you weight 150lbs, for instance, you should aim for around 75g of protein a day.Supplementing with protein bars or shakes can help you meet your daily protein needs without requiring you to eat every couple of hours.

, Ditch the fast food, TV dinners and other processed junk and stick to fresh, natural foods. Whole grains, green leafy vegetables, raw nuts and fresh fruit should all be staples of your overhauled diet. They’re full of the macronutrients your body craves and uses to build a ripped, strong physique. They’re also devoid of chemical preservatives and other unknowns which can make it hard for your body to digest and break down food for energy.Organic foods can be a little more expensive, but they’re worth the benefits they offer you. Each meal will leave you feeling satisfied.
Do your shopping and meal preparation in advance. That way you’ll know exactly what’s in the food you eat—you’ll be better able to keep track of calories and other nutrients, and having food on hand when you get hungry will keep you from seeking out unhealthy options., Now is the time to give up candy, donuts and other tempting confections. Nothing stalls fat-burning progress faster than sugar-laden foods. While sugar is useful for provided instant, short-term energy, most of it ends up stored as fatty tissue if it’s not used for fuel immediately. For best results, keep your sugar intake down to or below about 50g per day.If you must have something sweet, opt for a ripe banana, a handful of wild berries or a filling snack like Greek yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey.Be careful with the amount of bottled juices and even fresh fruit you consume. While it’s better to get your sugar from natural sources, it can add up after a while.
Examine food packaging closely at the supermarket. Even non-dessert foods are often saturated with sugar.

, Aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night whenever possible. Your body repairs itself and builds new tissue while at rest. This is when the muscle mass you’ve been working so hard to pack on will begin developing. A good night’s sleep will also help you recover from fatigue, injury and soreness, and leave you feeling refreshed and ready for your next workout.Turn off the TV, stereo, phone, tablet and any other electronic distractions when you go to bed to ensure that you fall into a deep, restful sleep.If you have trouble getting enough uninterrupted sleep at night, try taking a nap for 20-30 minutes in the afternoon or whenever you have time.

, Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially during intense exercise to replenish what is lost through perspiration. Every cell in your body contains water, so needless to say it’s vital for proper growth and function. You’ll feel more energetic when you’re adequately hydrated, and water can even help curb your appetite when you start getting cravings for unhealthy foods.Water should replace sodas, sports drinks, alcohol and other beverages that are filled with carbohydrates from sugar.
As a general rule, you should drink when you feel thirsty. Try to get at least ½ to ¾ of a gallon of water per day. When you use the restroom, your urine should be very light in color or clear., Put on a pot of coffee when you first wake up, or unwind at night with a steaming mug of organic green tea. Coffee beans and tea leaves are renowned for their antioxidant properties, which reduce inflammation in the body, fighting age-related illness and obesity. The caffeine and other components of tea and coffee have even been observed to have a slight thermogenic effect, meaning that sipping them can actually help you destroy fat cells.Leave the cream and sugar out of your coffee and/or tea. This just adds unneeded calories.

, We’re often told that in order to lose weight, we should eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day. In reality, this just makes it more likely for calories to stack up and exceed your daily limit. As an alternative, try fasting for 8-10 hours at a time 1 or 2 days a week. Fasting periodically works to suppress your appetite and reset your body’s natural hormone levels. Plus, since you aren’t eating, you’ll be burning calories all that time, giving you an advantage when it comes to staying in a caloric deficit.To begin intermittent fasting, simply have breakfast as usual, then don’t eat again for 8-10 hours. Alternately, you can begin fasting as soon as you wake up, eating your first meal around mid-afternoon or early evening.
Fasting is perfectly safe, as long as it doesn’t turn into starvation. Make sure you eat at least one substantial meal on fasting days to break the fast. High-protein, moderate-fat and carbohydrate meals are perfect for this purpose.Sit down with a physician or nutritionist before experimenting with intermittent fasting. Discuss which nutrient timing schedules and frequencies would be most advantageous for you. Fasting may not be a beneficial practice for everyone, especially those with hormone or metabolic disorders."

Focus on long-term solutions.",How to Get Toned in One Month (Girls)," You'll need to get in basic shape before you can start really toning your muscles. If you move directly into intense exercise, you're much more likely to get overwhelmed and quit or even injure yourself. Start building your endurance by getting off the couch and being active in your everyday life.









Take the stairs when you have the choice. Stand instead of sit while you use the computer or study. Walk to places that are a mile or less from your location, instead of taking the car. Go for a relaxing walk or jog instead of watching TV. There are lots of ways to get active in your everyday life without even exercising.;
, Begin toning your muscles by doing some basic exercises. These will increase your endurance and help get you in better shape, so that you can move on to really sculpting your body with more targeted exercise.









Try jogging, riding a bike, or going swimming. Most of these cost very little or are free and you can do them on your own, without expensive gym memberships or equipment.
These basic exercises should take up about three hours of your day, everyday, for the first week or two.

, ""Monkey arms"" is a great exercise for your arms and upper body. Do this exercise by putting a weight in each of your hands. Start by holding the weight at your armpit with your elbows out. Then, swing your arms out to straighten them, keeping them up and level with your shoulders. Swing the weight back to your armpits and repeat.









If you don't own weights, you can cheat and use cans of food or other lightly heavy objects.
Pair this with a squat or lunge to make it a full body workout.

, After the first week or so of exercising frequently, you can start doing exercises which are a bit more strenuous. This exercise requires an exercise ball but it is a good full body workout. Start in a push-up position but instead of having your feet on the ground, let your shins rest on top of the ball instead. Pull your hips up, so that your butt goes up into the air, rolling the ball down your leg as you go until your toes are resting on the ball. Then, roll back down so that the ball moves slowly up your body to reach your hips. Your body should be kept in a straight line, legs up in the air, so that your create an upside-down ""V"" shape in profile.









Exercise balls are pretty cheap but you can cheat a bit and just buy a big rubber ball from a toy store, which are often sold for $10 or less.

, Burpees look complex but they're actually easy once you get used to the motions and they're one of the best full body workouts that you can do. Start in a standing position, feet apart. Put your hands down on the ground in front of your feet, jump your legs back so that you go into a push-up position, and do a push-up. Now, jump your feet back, then lift your hands above your head and jump straight up as high as you can. Repeat for at least 10 minutes.


You can skip either the push-up or the jump, but both really add to the effectiveness of the exercise, so it is not recommended.

, Planks are one of the more efficient exercises you can do, significantly increasing the strength of your core muscles and legs in much less time than other core exercises.Start by getting into a push-up position. Now, lower your body so that instead of resting your weight on your hands, your whole forearm is resting on the ground instead. Just hold that position, with your back and legs as straight as possible, for as long as you can.


You should try to hold this position for as long as you can, but you should know that holding it for a minute or more takes very strong core muscles. Start out holding the position for 10 seconds, resting for 30 seconds, and then repeating for about 10 minutes. Slowly work your way up to holding the position for 30 seconds to a minute.

, Squats work your core muscles and your legs, and can even work your arms if you lift small weights while you do them. A squat is done by standing with your feet about a shoulder's width apart and then crouching down, as if you're sitting in an invisible chair. Keep your back straight in order to do this exercise correctly.









If you're new to squats, using a chair or table to balance can make it much easier.

, There’s no such thing as an exercise which targets fat in a particular part of your body. There are exercises that can target specific muscles, but if you want to get toned quickly, it’s best to focus on your whole body using the full body exercises that we’ve recommended above. Focusing too much on one area and using some exercises (like lifting weights) puts you at risk of adding a lot of bulk, instead of just defining the muscles that you have.








, If you’re trying to get toned, you’ll want to start by burning any excess fat that you might have in a healthy way. Regardless of the weight you’re at, eating the right amount of food for the amount of activity you get is a healthy choice. Talk to your doctor about the recommended calorie intake for your size, age, and activity level. You don’t have to count calories but you should use your recommended daily intake to get an idea of roughly how much food you should eat. You might be eating too much but you also don’t want to end up eating too little.


For most people, our bodies will start burning fat when we burn more calories (a form of energy) than we take in. If you have fat that you need to burn before you can look toned, you’ll need to make sure you’re taking in slightly fewer calories than your body really needs. Don’t make the change too dramatic, however. Too few calories and your body will think that there’s a famine going on, causing it to absorb and create as much fat as it possibly can.
For example, an average height 16 year old girl who weighs 120 lbs and exercises about once a week would need around 1800 calories a day to maintain the weight that she’s at. If she wanted to lose weight, she might want to lower that amount to 1300-1350., To burn fat but also to take care of your overall health, you should avoid foods that are bad for you or that add a large number of calories without adding any nutrition. These tend to be some of our favorite foods, but they are often what pushes us over the edge into overeating.


Generally, you want to avoid unhealthy fats (trans fats), sugar, and carbohydrates with very few nutrients. These include items like butter, chips, french fries, commercial baked goods, candy, commercial pizza, mayonnaise, soda, processed meat, and white bread.
You’ll also want to watch out for some “health” foods. Smoothies, for example, often contain a huge amount of sugar. For example, even Jamba Juice’s healthy options still contain the equivalent of 24 sugar cubes.If you want to have a smoothie, make sure no sugar is added and that it contains mostly greens and soy or almond milk. The fruit content should be minimal.

, Instead of these unhealthy foods, make sure you eat as many nutrient rich foods as you can. Vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can give you all of the nutrients you need, although some fruit and dairy can be good too.


Healthy vegetables include: kale, chard, collard greens, broccoli, spinach, edamame, carrots, brussels sprouts, and peas.
Healthy grains include: brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, bulgur, buckwheat, and barley.
Healthy proteins include: lean proteins such as salmon, turkey, anchovies, sardines, soy nuts (and other soy products), almonds, walnuts, eggs, and lentils.
Healthy fruits include: lemons/limes, oranges, grapefruit, kiwi, strawberries, raspberries, and pears.
Healthy dairy products include: cottage cheese, low-fat yogurt, and milk..

, You body always needs water to perform properly but water will be especially important while you work on exercising to build your muscles. If you're not hydrating your body very well right now, getting enough water can actually help you lose weight too.Pass on the coffee, energy drinks, sodas and juice, in favor of water and you'll help ensure that your body can stay healthy and hydrated.


How much water you need depends on your own unique body. The recommended eight glasses a day is just a rough estimate. A good rule of thumb is that if your urine is coming out pale or clear, you're getting enough water. If it's bright yellow or dark, you need to drink more water.
You'll want to maintain your electrolytes while you exercise but don't feel limited to sports drinks like Gatorade. Electrolytes are essentially any ""salt"" in the presence of water. For example, mostly anything with ingredients in the first or second group of the periodic table (like Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium) will act as an electrolyte when consumed with water. Such salts can be found in table salt (sodium chloride), bananas (potassium), and mineral rich vegetables like kale. Eating a banana and munching on some salted nuts while staying hydrated is a much healthier way to maintain a crucial electrolyte balance without consuming artificial dyes and sweeteners.

, You'll see loads of advertisements on the internet and in magazines, telling you that this diet or that diet will get you looking like X celebrity in two weeks. However, these diets are at best unrealistic and at worst, dangerous. Starving yourself is definitely not an option. Eat fewer calories than normal, yes, but you do need to eat. You also shouldn't use any diet which forbids a food group, like the Atkins diet. Your body needs a wide range of nutrients and dietary diversity is key to making sure that you stay healthy.


It is recommended that you eat at least 1,200 calories a day. You should never go below 1000 calories a day, as this significantly increases your chances of health complications like gallstones. , You have to be careful how you schedule workouts and really pay attention to the strain that you put on your body. Doing too much too fast or only doing exercises which build your legs, for example, can lead to injury. Start slow when you begin toning to reduce the risk of injury, especially if you're not currently in shape. Rest your body between exercises, never doing intense exercise for more than two hours at a time. Rotate which muscle groups you work on, between legs, arms, core, etc. Pacing yourself like this will also keep you from getting overwhelmed.









For example, try monkey arms for ten minutes in the morning followed by twenty minutes of push-ups, jumping jacks, and burpees. Try going up and down the stairs for half an hour at lunch, and then swimming after school for an hour.
Another example of a schedule would be riding your bike for half an hour to get to school, taking an extracurricular gym class that meets every day, and doing half an hour of light cardio before doing your homework.
Aim to do between thirty and sixty minutes of light cardio, such as walking or cycling, a day. You can do more intense exercise regimens a few times a week.

, You can overcome a lot of the ""I don't feel like it today"" hurdles by making yourself a schedule and letting that schedule become habit. Just like you have a time of day devoted to brushing your teeth or eating lunch, having a time of day that's for making a healthy breakfast or a time of day that's for exercising. With some determination, if you stick to it then it will just become habit and ""normal"" to do these things.









For example, add an extra half hour onto your ""getting ready for bed"" routine. Before getting in the shower and brushing your teeth, do an exercise like jumping rope for half an hour.
Give yourself incentive to meet these time goals. For example, for every week that you stay on track, take yourself and a friend out to a movie. You can even use food rewards, like a single cookie (try a fancy cookie from the store to ensure you only eat one), to both reward you and help keep you from feeling deprived. There are even apps you can use to help you meet these time goals, like Pact which rewards you or punishes you based on how well you do.

, Another option is to choose an exercise that can be fun and a hobby for you, something that you do every day because it is a part of how you live your life. You'll see this often with rock climbers, who have a gym date at least once a week and go out to the mountains every weekend, or runners, who start each day off with a jog.









For example, let's say you're really interested in martial arts. You can take up judo. Find a class at your local YMCA and go for practice every day.
Classes from your local community center or YMCA (or similar charity health club) will be much cheaper than going to a specialty gym. They often even have scholarships, meaning that you can take the class for free if you qualify.

, The most important part of maintaining a healthy weight and getting toned, is to be consistent with a healthy diet and lots of exercise. This means that one of the best things you can do to get toned isn't a special move or eating a secret food: it's finding a way to stay motivated. You'll have to find something that makes you want to exercise and eat right every day. There are lots of ways that you can go about that. Try:









Doing exercises you like and eating foods you like. Doing exercises that are fun for you or finding healthy food combinations that you think are tasty can make a huge difference in keeping you motivated. Try to find an exercise that you enjoy doing, even if it isn't the most effective exercise. That you'll do it for a long time and consistently is more important.
Exercising with other people. Start a jogging ground or even sign up for a yoga class at the local health club with your mom. Having another person to exercise with you will make you feel responsible and you'll be more likely to stick with it on those days when you're really tired or lazy.

, It's beach season and you want to look good in a bikini. We know. But it's important to understand that quick solutions like getting fit in a month do not last. Unless you make significant changes to how you live, the weight will come back and you'll lose muscle tone all over again. Going back and forth, yo-yoing your weight like this, can be very harsh on your body and dangerous for your health, inducing diabetes, heart disease, and hormone problems.It's best to focus on long term solutions and make lifelong goals, not just focus on looking good for your brother's wedding.

Maintain a well-balanced and healthy diet.,
You need to ensure you are eating a sufficient amount of protein.,
Ensure that your diet consists of mostly raw, minimally-processed foods.",How to Get Stronger Muscles when You Are Currently Weak2," Without a proper diet, your efforts at the gym are useless.

, Use the Internet to determine how many grams of protein you should eat a day (based on weight and physical activity). Great sources of protein include:


nuts and nut butters
quinoa
beans and other legumes
soy milk
cheese
egg whites ( Avoid egg yolks as each yolk contains cholesterol roughly 4 times the daily need)
lean meats, poultry, and fish
tofu and tempeh
protein supplements made from whey, hemp, or pea protein.
Sprouts are a great source of proteins for vegans.
Spirulina

, Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Opt for nutritionally dense foods that are low in fat and high in fiber.


Stay away from soda and sugar. Drink alcohol in moderation.
Avoid tea and coffee as much as possible as both tend to dehydrate muscles leading to low muscle volume.

Do curls with a straight bar and a fat bar.,
Do plate pinches.,
Do wrist rollers.,
Do knuckle push-ups.,
Avoid the use of wrist straps.",How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists2," Bicep curls obviously target the biceps, primarily, but you can also use curls as a chance to strengthen your forearms as well. Basic bicep curls require you to keep your wrists straight, which helps to build strength while you're doing the exercise, but you can also mix it up and do some wrist curls with both the fat bar and the straight bar to increase hand strength and wrist strength.










Grip the bar over hand, with less weight than you'd use for a bicep curl. At the curl station, instead of bringing the bar all the way up as you would in a bicep curl, flex your wrists to bring the bar up. Do the same number of sets and reps you use for bicep curls. Repeat the exercise with an under-hand grip as well.

, Plate pinches are one of the most common forearm strength training exercises, commonly used by bodybuilders to bulk up the forearms and the grip. It couldn't be an easier exercise, provided you've got some heavy stuff to lift.Line up one or two plates from the weight machine on the ground, perpendicular with the ground. Squat down, gripping them with your hands, then stand up, holding it securely. That's it. Alternate hands, doing three sets of five-ten reps, or whatever is comfortable for you.
You could also use a stack of a few heavy books, something that will stretch out your grip and force you to spread your fingers relatively wide as you lift. It's mostly about the strength required to grip the objects together.

, Wrist rollers require a special device called a wrist roller, but this is commonly available at most gyms, and you could also bootleg one in a pinch. The exercise itself is simple, but challenging, extremely effective at building forearm strength and bigger wrists. A wrist roller bar is basically a short bar with a rope in the center, from which a weight hangs. If you don't have one, you could also use a bar from a barbell, hanging one of the weights from it with a length of rope, about 24 inches (61.0 cm) long.









Grip the bar with both hands, palms facing down and extend your arms straight out in front of you. As the weight hangs, twist the bar up and backward with your wrists, one at a time, as if you were activating the gas on a motorcycle. Try 10 or 15 reps at three sets.

, If you want to work on stability and strength in your forearms, doing push-ups is a great way of exercising. Traditional, flat-handed pushups, though, can actually stress your wrists, causing soreness and stiffness in the joint. Instead, use push-ups as an opportunity to build strength in your wrists by doing them on your knuckles instead of your flat palms.



Focus on keeping your wrists very straight and solid while you do push-ups, however many you're comfortable doing. If you're just getting started, try doing three sets of ten.

, Lots of beginners who are trying to build strength in their forearms over-use wrist-straps, which is counter-productive. Your wrists won’t get stronger if you’re relying on wrist-straps to bear some of the burden of the weight. If you feel like you need wrist-straps, lower the weight you’re lifting."

Shoulder abduction. Hold a weight in one hand keeping the arm straight. Then lift the arm to your side at shoulder height. Return the arm to your side. Repeat 10 times and then switch to the other arm. Repeat the procedure at least once a day as well.;
, Here are two exercises you can do to strengthen your elbows, lower arms, and hands:



Elbow extension. Lean slightly forward and hold your elbow behind you. Lift the weight behind you maintaining a straight elbow and then bend the elbow. Repeat 10 times and then switch arms and repeat on the other side.

Elbow flexion. Hold a weight in one hand. Then, bend your arm at the elbow and subsequently straighten it. Repeat 10 times. Switch to the other side and repeat or you can do both elbows at the same time.

, To strengthen your arms, hands, and fingers and get the muscle building, you can do rotations in addition to flexion and extension exercises. Here are two types of rotation exercises that can strengthen your muscles:



External rotations. Hold an elastic rubber band in your hands. Start the exercise with the elbows bent at 90 degrees against the body. Rotate the arms out moving the hands out to the side. Repeat 10 times. Perform this at least once a day.

Internal rotations. Tie the other end of the rubber band to a doorknob. Then, keeping the elbow at 90 degrees pull the other end of the band towards the abdomen. Perform this exercise at least once a day as well.

, Wrist exercises through the use of weights are considered weight-bearing exercises. Weight-bearing physical activity causes new bone tissue to form and this makes bones stronger.Together with the increased blood flow caused by exercise, muscle mass and strength also increases. The following can be performed:


Hold weights in both hands with your elbows bent to 90 degrees. Turn palms up and down 10 times. Perform this exercise at least once a day.
With palms facing downward, hold one weight in each hand and bend up to 90 degrees. Lift your wrists up and down while keeping the elbows still. Repeat 10 times. As usual, perform this at least once a day.

, Exercises such as shoulder flexion and abduction, elbow flexion and extension, external and internal rotations work out the muscles of the hands, elbows, wrists, and shoulders. Exercising the affected body part through pulling, pushing or lifting stimulates growth of the muscles and increases their efficiency. Regular exercise increases the number of myofibrils (muscle fibers) in each cell that accounts for 20 to 30% of muscle growth.Because of the increased blood flow, the muscle fibers are being supplied with more oxygen and nutrients leading to an increase in muscle mass. An increase in muscle mass also increases muscle strength. When the muscle gets worked, they develop more mitochondria, the little powerhouses that convert chemical energy into energy the cells can use.

, This medication acts on the central nervous system by blocking the nerve impulses in the brain that make muscles contract. It relaxes muscles by decreasing muscle spasms, tightness, pain and improves range of motion. For adults, the maintenance dose of Baclofen is 40-80 mg/day in 4 divided doses.A similar medication to baclofen is dantrolene sodium (Dantrium). The recommended dose ranges from 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100 mg 3 times a day.

, This medication also blocks the nerve impulses in the brain that make muscles contract. The ideal starting dose is 4 mg every 6 to 8 hours. The maintenance dose is 8 mg every 6 to 8 hours.


However, the effectiveness of the medication lasts only for a short period of time, so it is advisable to use it when needed for relief of the discomfort and to be able to complete certain activities.

, This type of medication acts on the central nervous system, thus relaxing the muscles and decreasing spasticity for a short period of time.


The oral dosage varies as benzodiazepines come in many generic names (in other words, there are different medical names of the drug). Consult with your doctor for the proper prescription.

, A botox injection attaches to the nerve endings and blocks the release of chemical transmitters which signals the brain to activate muscle contraction. Essentially, the medication prevents muscle spasm.


The maximum dosage of a botox injection is less than 500 units per visit. Botox is only given by injection directly into the affected muscles., Phenol destroys the nerve conduction that is causing spasticity. It is given by injection directly into the affected muscles or into the spine. The dosage may vary according to the manufacturer.


Consult with your doctor about whether or not this is the right course of action for you. Phenol injections are not suitable for all stroke patients.

, This therapy is a way to stimulate the affected nerves in the brain to make the muscles contract. Electrical stimulation therapy helps regain movement and control of hands and arms, improves muscle tone and decreases the pain experienced by the stroke patient. It also increases blood flow to the brain to speed up healing and reduce swelling, improves the medication flow into the skin and reduces muscle spasticity.Again, EST is not for everyone. Your doctor will know whether this treatment is appropriate for you or not.

, There are two types of muscle rehabilitation you may wish to consider:



Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy. To increase the brain’s ability to repair itself and for the affected hand to regain its function, this therapy is often performed during rehabilitation. The unaffected arm is restrained using a device to allow usage of the affected arm in doing activities as much as possible.

Occupational Therapy. The occupational therapist (OT) helps the stroke patient relearn his daily activities he had before the stroke. It will speed up recovery as you learn to live and function with disabilities. The therapist will help you arrange your home for safer and easier movement inside the house.

, Getting strength back in your hands does not mean you rely solely on one medication or process of treatment. During stroke rehabilitation,you and a stroke rehab team will work together to determine which medication works well and what improves the stiffness in your hands after the stroke.


Medications are not a cure for stroke – they only relieve the symptoms of spasticity that make a muscle too tight. Spasticity of a muscle causes pain, abnormality in posture, and uncontrollable movements. The hands can start to regain their normal strength and range of motion if the medications given to the patient relieve spasticity.

, When the blood supply to an area of the brain is obstructed, it causes the development of a stroke. The brain cells that are not supplied with blood die due to lack of oxygen. In a matter of minutes and without warning, a stroke can happen and affect any individual. There are two types of stroke:



Ischemic stroke. This is the most common kind of stroke. About 87% of stroke patients suffer from this condition. It develops due to a blood clot in the blood vessel that causes the interruption of the blood flow to the brain. It can also be caused by an embolus or a blood clot that travels to other parts of the body.

Hemorrhagic stroke. A ruptured blood vessel on the surface of the brain that fills the space between the skull and the brain leads to hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke can also be caused by an explosion of an artery in the brain that causes bleeding to the surrounding tissues.

, Stroke patients can experience weakness on one side of the body, the arm or leg or both can be affected. There are also speech abnormalities, vision problems, memory and intellectual difficulties, difficulty swallowing, incontinence and bladder problems that may occur. For serious cases of stroke, paralysis or death can happen.


Arms and hands can be particularly affected after a stroke. The stroke patient shows an incident of spasticity, uncontrolled muscle tightness and stiffness that causes difficulty in moving the hands or arms. The affected arm or leg is the opposite side of the body where the stroke happened in the brain.

, The factors that increase the risk of an individual having a stroke include:Age
Family history of stroke
Gender
Race or ethnicity
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Diabetes
Heart disease
Smoking
High blood cholesterol levels
Drug abuse (use of marijuana)
Obesity

, Restoration of normal movement and improvement in coordination, strength and endurance is the main focus of physical rehabilitation for stroke patients. About 80% of stroke patients are unable to walk alone right after a stroke – with the help of physical rehabilitation and natural management the incidence is decreased to less than 20%.A stroke patient can utilize a walker or cane in the initial step of the physical rehabilitation. Then, gradual progress to the movement of the legs until the patient is able to walk independently will be implemented. Walking requires coordinated movement between the healthy and impaired legs.
Some rehabilitation centers have a good facility that uses a harness to support a patient during treadmill exercises. It gives the patient the support and balance needed to regain his normal walk.

Maintain a balanced diet.,
Eat lots of lean protein.,
Add 12 grams of fiber to your daily diet.,
Swap sweets for healthy snacks.",How to Get Ripped Quickly Without Money or Equipment3," Eat the recommended number of calories for your age and sex, and eat meals that consist of 50% fruits and veggies, 25% whole grains, and 25% lean protein. Eating right will help you ensure that you actually see results from your daily workouts. It’ll also give your muscles the fuel they need to grow.Track your meals and create a personalized diet using a wellness app or a resource like Super Tracker: https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/.

, To build muscle you’ll need to consume at least the daily amount of protein recommended for your age and sex. Lean proteins, like chicken breast or fish, are your healthiest options. Eating leaner proteins instead of red meat will help you swap saturated and trans fats for healthier fats.If you’re a teen or adult male, go for at least 6 1/2 ounces (184 g) of protein per day. Teen and adult women should eat at least 5 1/2 ounces (156 g) per day., Fiber will increase your metabolism and help reduce fat deposits covering up your core muscles. Beans contain more fiber than any other food, so try to eat at least 1/2 cup (120 mL) per day. Other great fiber sources include whole grains, so choose whole grain options for cereal, pasta, and bread.Teen and adult men should eat 8 ounces (227 g) of grains per day. Teen and adult women should eat 6 ounces (170 g) per day., Between meals, eat healthy snacks instead of sweets to fuel your muscles and trim excess fat and sugar from your diet. Snacks can be an effective way to ensure you’re getting the protein, fiber, and other nutrients needed to build muscle and burn fat.Go for snacks like unsalted nuts, dried fruit, a tablespoon of peanut butter, or whole grain crackers.

Sign up for a fitness test with a personal trainer at the gym, if you are unsure where you are weak. They can test your aerobic and strength and give you some areas to work on.;
, These will keep your workouts on track and allow you to hit milestones as you change your body's shape.


For example, your cardio goal may be to run 2 miles (3.2 km) in 15 minutes. Interval training, using sprints and moderate exertion can help you reach your goal, by running 3 or 4 times per week.
For example, your strength goals may be to do 10 push ups in 2 months.
These goals will differ greatly between men and women for the most part. Men may want to build more muscle mass, while women may want to build lean muscle mass. The difference is in the execution of your Weightlifting.
Include weight loss goals, if they apply to you. You can still get buff and gain muscle mass while losing weight. While Weightlifting speeds up your metabolism, you will need to spend an equal amount of time doing aerobic exercise to burn more fat off your body.

, Divide the goals up into 4 or 5 smaller touchstones, so that you can monitor your progress.

, Try to fit in Weightlifting 3 or 4 times per week with a day of rest in between, cardio at least 3 times per week for 30 minutes and body weight exercises 3 to 4 times per week. Add in stretching to cool down each day.


Don't forget to take rest days. If you feel you are doing too much or you are exceptionally tired, take a day for your body to recover. Alternate Weightlifting and cardio days, during the majority of the week. Pay attention to your body so that it can rebuild stronger muscles while you rest.

, These include squats, lunges, planks, side planks, calf raises, push ups and pull ups.


Take a barre, core burn, boot camp or TRX band class to learn how to do these exercises with proper form. You should be able to do them on your own, at home or at the gym, after a few classes.
Stop lifting weights if you are feeling the work in your lower back. Seek the help of a personal trainer so that you can get alternate exercises.

, You can mix in this training with either cardio or Weightlifting days.

, Shorter rest times will improve the aerobic burn during this type of strength training.

,, You should aim to increase difficulty every 2 to 3 weeks of consistent work.

, Learn proper form in this easy to use format first, if you have never lifted weights before.


Choose an amount of weight that will allow you to do at least 2 sets of 10. People who are aiming to build leaner muscles, rather than muscle mass, may choose to use less weight and do 3 sets of 15 repetitions.

, After completing a set of repetitions with full range of motion, do a set of half range of motion more quickly. This will work the fast twitch muscles as well as the longer fibers.

, For example, do arms and shoulders on Monday, legs and abs on Tuesday and chest and back on Wednesday. Never work the same areas 2 days in a row.

, You should reach muscle exhaustion in those groups when you stop lifting. You will build muscle quickly and get buff faster.

, Increase in increments of 5 to 10 lbs. (2.2 to 4.5kg).

, Make sure your body does not sway. Lifting weights without the help of machines can build muscle faster, and it can also be combined with work on weight machines.

, You will look buffer if you melt off some of the fat on your body. It is difficult to do this with strength training alone.

, Do 1 to 2 minutes of sprinting, followed by 4 to 5 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. Intervals increase the efficiency of your metabolism, burning more fat.


If you choose to do interval training, you will get the same or more benefit in a 20 or 30 minute period of exercise as you would doing 45 minutes to 1 hour of work at the same moderate intensity.

, Do running, swimming, cycling, speed walking, elliptical and rowing, so that you work different muscles and avoid overtraining.

,, Protein is the building block of muscle, and you should increase your consumption immediately after you work out and in general.


Lean proteins that help build healthy muscle include non-fat Greek yogurt, fish, chicken, turkey, lean pork, lean beef, beans, eggs and milk.

, As you build muscle and your metabolism increases, these will not fill you up for very long.


Choose complex carbohydrates like oats, quinoa, whole wheat bread, brown or wild rice and lentils.

, You need the vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables to remain healthy. Seek a trainer's help if you feel you need nutritional supplements, but try to provide what you need with your regular diet first.

, This will serve to curb hunger while your metabolism is running high.

Try wide leg or skinny jeans.",How to Get Curves," If you have weight loss goals, a combination of diet and exercise is the best way to shed fat and get more flattering curves. Try reducing your calorie intake by around 500 to 700 calories a day to lose roughly 1-2 lbs. a week.Note that it is not advisable to eat any less than 1,200 calories a day. Anything lower could be harmful to your health.;
, Making diet changes can be tough, especially if you have started an exercise routine. Start by making smart choices for your 1200-1400 calories. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat. Processed sugar and high fructose corn syrup can negatively affect weight loss. Also avoid eating processed foods. Stick with natural, unprocessed foods.


Eat more fruits and vegetables. Try to snack on things like avocados, kale chips, carrot sticks, hummus, berries, and other produce that provides the essential micronutrients, complex carbohydrates, health fats, and proteins your system while curbing your appetite.
Add in low-fat dairy. Eat high protein Greek yogurt, skim milk, and low-fat cheese as part of your normal calorie intake. The dairy can help build muscles and make you feel fuller longer.
Eating a dessert or some fries may be part of your daily menu, but make these occasional, ""treat"" foods, instead of your normal routine. Remember that treat foods aren't to be eaten every day, or even every week.

, Most people should be aiming for between 25 and 35 g per day, but most people get around 10 g. Studies have shown that viscous fiber can make you feel full and reduce your appetite.To add more of the good, weight-loss friendly fiber into your diet, such as beans (legumes), asparagus, brussel sprouts, and oatmeal. Whole grains, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates are rich in good fiber.
Introduce increased fiber into your diet slowly. Too much fiber too quickly can cause stomach aches, nausea, and diarrhea.

, When you start your fitness routine, you should be drinking at least 84 oz. per day. That's 10.5 8 oz. glasses of water. Exercising increases your need to replace your fluid. Drink more water before, during and after you work out., Alcohol can add unwanted calories to your diet, slow down your metabolism, and cause more stress on your body. Reduce the days you consume alcohol, as well as the amounts.

, Making significant, positive body changes is both physical and mental. Make sure your body is at top shape so you see the best results.


Schedule time for sleep. People who get fewer than 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night are more likely to carry weight in their mid-section.This will keep you from your goals. Try to set aside the hour before you go to bed to turn off electronics and relax from the day, so that you can get restful sleep.
Add a stress reducing activity to your day. When your body feels stress because of work or your personal life, it releases cortisol, which can tell you to pack on pounds on your waist.Try deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or ambient music to reduce anxiety.

, To increase the loss of body fat and tone your muscles, increase the amount of aerobic/cardio workouts you do. To burn fat, you need to work out 5-6 days a week, and increase your cardio workouts to at least 45 minutes each.Switching from 30 minute workouts to 1 hour workouts can improve your tone and fat loss greatly. Your curves will get more pronounced faster.


If you don't have time to do 45-60 minutes at once, break up the time into 2 30-minute workouts. Do a 30 minute workout at the gym and do a speed walking session after dinner. Make sure to have at least 1 workout that is 30 minutes to reap the benefits.

, High-intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is where you do short bursts of intense work followed by less intense activity or rest. This kind of workout is great for blasting fat away.To do this, warm up, then switch between low/moderate and high intensity for 2 to 4 minutes at a time.


For example, try running for as fast as you can for 1 minute (or 15 or 30 seconds to start if you can't run for a minute). Walk for twice that time (2 minutes for 1 minute of running; 1 minute for 30 seconds; 30 seconds for 15 seconds). Repeat 5 times for a fat blasting 15 minute workout. As your fitness improves, run for longer durations, run faster, jog instead of walk to rest, and increase to 30 and 45 minutes.

, For a curvy body, you want to make sure to balance upper body workouts with lower body workouts.Make each of your workouts different to work different muscle groups for all-around tone and keep your metabolism running high.


Try a class, such as spinning, barre, cardio burn, flow yoga, or boot camp once per week.
Workout on a machine, like an elliptical, treadmill, or stair stepper 1 day. You can set these machines for interval workouts.
Try other activities like swimming, hiking hills, speed walking, or biking to further break up the routine.
Use 30-minute or longer strength training sessions as both cardio and strength training workouts. Use weight machines or hand weights and add them to a 30-minute machine workout. Decrease the time that you rest between sets to keep your heart rate up and your body sweating.

, To get and maintain a curvy figure, pay attention to your legs and arms while strengthening your core.Another thing to do while strengthening your curves is not to forget the back of your body.Strength train 3 to 4 times per week - basically every other day. Once your cardio exercise burns off excess fat, these exercises will provide hourglass curves.


Do squats to target your glutes and thighs. Always keep your stomach flexed and your spine neutral. Add hand weights for added resistance.Try step ups to improve your glutes, hips, and thighs. Place a bench in front of you that is at knee height or higher. Place your right foot on the bench. Then, step up onto the bench with your left foot. Lower your left foot and your right foot. Repeat 12 times with each foot leading. Do side steps to improve hips and the outside of the thighs.
Do planks. Start out with a half-plank on your knees if you are beginning. When your strength increases, advance to a full body plank. Go for side planks to work your oblique muscles.
Do Serratus pushups. This will work the shoulders and chest areas to better support curves in your upper body. Get on your hands and knees. Lower your arms so that you are resting on your elbows. Flex your stomach muscles in and get into a low plank position with your legs out. Squeeze your shoulder blades together for 2 to 5 seconds, then let them go apart. Do this in 2 sets of 10 while breathing slowly in and out.
Target your outer thighs with clam shells. Get on your side, resting on your elbow. Place your knees in front of you as you would when you sit in a chair. Open your knees while keeping your heels together. Pause and lower your knees with control until they meet. Do 20 clam shells, and make sure your hips stay stacked so all of the work remains in your thighs.

, Horizontal stripes help make your body seem rounder instead of long and lean. They accentuate your largest parts and curves, which is a good thing when trying to create curves.Try a wide stripe to help give you some roundness., Black is a slimming color and can emphasize your thin frame, or diminish the curves you do have. Instead, wear bright colors, or even better, patterns that give some texture to your body.


If you have a curvy bottom half, but not a curvy top half, then wear a darker color on bottom and a lighter color on top to balance out your shapes.

, To create an hourglass shape despite your body type, go for styles that cinch at the waist. Make sure to cinch at the thinnest part of your waist. This gives the illusion of more pronounced curves by drawing attention to the smaller waist.Try a peplum top or dress. This style of dress can help emphasize a curvy silhouette despite your body type. Peplums flare at the hips, and narrow at the waist.
Wear a belt. Like a peplum, belts help give the illusion of an hourglass figure by helping to narrow the waist and letting the material flare at the hips., Instead of tight fighting cuts, go for loose, flowing garments. These garments, like cinching the waist, make your waist appear smaller while making the rest of your look curvy. Try shirts with sleeves that add volume, like ruffle sleeves or puffy sleeves. Another great look for an hourglass effect is a wrap shirt.


Try maxi dresses, mermaid skirts, tulip skirts, pleated skirts, and skirts with layers to help give the illusion of curves. Also try harem pants and dolman sleeves, or ruffles along the front., Either of these styles work well for increasing curves. Skinny jeans will hug your natural curves no matter how large or small they are, and wide leg jeans provide some width and shape to your lower half."

Start by pushing the dumbbells straight up from the chest. Slowly lower the arms out to the sides only as far as you feel sure you can bring the dumbbells back up. Make sure you have a spotter nearby for safety
Exhale, and carefully bring the dumbbells back together over the center of your chest in an arch motion. Once the dumbbells come together, repeat the motion by lowering the dumbbells back out to the sides. Repeat this motion for your specific number of reps.

, Push-ups help build strength in the shoulders, chest and triceps, all of which work in conjunction with the biceps. Incorporate push-ups in your regular work out routine as a body-weight exercise to help build up your supporting muscle groups.Set yourself on a mat stomach-down, and place your hands at shoulder level and slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Set your feet up so that your legs are straight back behind you and the tips of your shoes are touching the ground. Look down while keeping your head, neck, and spine in a straight line.
Push up on your arms to bring your body to an elevated position at the full extension of your arms. Your body should stay in a straight line. Brace your abs as you push up.
Once you reach the full extent of your arms, carefully lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle. Do not let your chest or head drop to the ground.
Repeat the exercise for the recommended amount of reps, or until your body gets tired.

, Stretching is important to help your muscles loosen up and kickstart the recovery process. Consider adding a stretching routine such as yoga to your workout schedule to make sure that your biceps and supporting muscle groups are all getting the attention they deserve.

You can perform muscle-specific static stretches, but whole-body stretching exercises such as yoga provide a more inclusive, comprehensive stretch for all muscles worked, including smaller supporting ones., You might think that working out every day will lead to bigger biceps, but your muscles actually get stronger during the resting period in between workouts, when they have time to recover. Over time they get larger in order to be capable of lifting more and more weight.


Train your biceps no more than twice a week for the best results.
Work out other parts of your body on the days you aren't doing exercises to enhance your biceps.

, Training for too long during any given session can strain your biceps and cause an injury, setting back your progress. Fifteen to thirty minute training sessions are sufficient for building strength and preventing injury when you are focusing specifically on your biceps.

, After a few months of biceps training, building muscle memory and strengthening the biceps, you can safely go all in. Make each training session count by working out as hard as you can during that short period of time. Lift the heaviest weights you can lift for six or more reps to make your sessions as high-intensity as possible. Bodybuilders call this method ""training to failure,"" because you should be training with weights heavy enough that you eventually can't complete another rep.









Find your ""train to failure"" weight by choosing a weight you can curl no more than 6 - 8 times before experiencing too much muscle fatigue to keep lifting. If you're able to complete several sets without breaking a sweat or ""failing,"" you need to increase the weight. If you can't lift it even one or two times without stopping, decrease the weight.
Your train to failure weight will gradually increase as you gain muscle strength. Add weight in one to two pound increments every week or so, using the same standard to determine whether you're lifting too much weight or too little.

, Your train to failure weight should also be a weight you can lift while using the proper form. Using the right form keeps your biceps from getting injured and promotes the right kind of muscle-building.









Don't use momentum to lift the weights; use controlled movements. Lower them slowly rather than letting them drop quickly.
If you find that you can't complete more than a few reps without losing your good form, you're lifting too much weight. Start with a lighter weight and build up your strength.
Take one to two minute breaks between sets to let your muscles rest.

, When you're training a lot, you need to make sure you get plenty of calories for energy, but eating too much can create a layer of fat on your body that will obscure the muscles you're working so hard to build.


Choose vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.
Drink plenty of water to keep your body hydrated and ease your hunger pangs after working out.

, Protein helps build muscles, so it's recommended that you eat 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight while you're training.


Eat poultry, fish, beef, pork, eggs, nuts, seeds, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, milk, and other sources of protein to build your muscles.
Beans, leafy greens, tofu, and other vegetarian sources of protein are also good choices.

, Creatine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body to build big, strong muscles. Many bodybuilders take creatine supplements to help them achieve their training goals. Although it isn't approved by the FDA, creatine is considered to be safe when taken in 5 gram doses.


Choose a powdered creatine supplement that can be mixed with water and ingested several times a day.
After an initial ""loading"" period during which you drink high amounts of creatine to build it up in your body, taper off to a maintenance dosage.

Take rest seriously.",How to Get Big Arms," It's healthier to strengthen all of your muscles with compound exercises than to focus only on building arm mass. If you want to be able to lift heavy objects and weights, you also need to work on your shoulders, chest, and back. If you don't work out your legs and core, you'll end up with big arms and a lower body that isn't as muscular.On the days when you aren't training your arms, train other muscle groups in your legs, back and abdomen. This way you'll still be building strength while your arm muscles are recovering.
Do compound exercises that bulk up your arms while also toning other muscles. Chin-ups and push-ups, for example, strengthen your abs at the same time they are strengthening your arms.;
, Many people think that working out every day builds bigger muscles, but muscle mass is actually built during resting days between workout sessions. Your muscles grow stronger as they recover between lifting sessions, enabling you to gradually lift more and more weight. If you don't give your muscles time to rest, particularly your arm muscles, you risk overtraining them and delaying the results you want to achieve.

, For the same reason, you should only train one or two times per week and each training session should only last about half an hour. Training for over half an hour per session greatly increases the risk that you will injure your ligaments, joints, and tendons. Short, intense training sessions are your best bet for building arm mass.

, Choose heavy weights that you are able to pick up, and make your training sessions as high-intensity as possible. Muscle-builders call this ""training to failure,"" because it means lifting weights that are heavy enough to cause you to ""fail,"" or be unable to complete the exercise after five to eight reps. As your arms grow stronger, and you find that the weight you've been lifting is no longer as difficult, add more weight.


If you are new to lifting weights, you may want to work with lower weights first before working your way up to heavier weights. Do not start off with the heaviest weights you can lift. Instead, find a lighter weight that you can do at least 8-12 reps with.
Find your ""train to failure"" weight by experimenting with different weights until you find one you can lift several times before breaking a sweat and feeling you can't lift it again. If you can complete 10 or 12 reps without sweating or feeling much of a burn, you should be lifting more weight. If you can't complete five or six reps before giving up, decrease the weight.
While extreme discomfort is part of building muscle mass, you shouldn't be lifting so much weight that you feel you're going to be sick or pass out. There's no shame in starting at a lower weight. Start lifting a weight you can handle, and soon you'll build up the strength required to lift heavier weights.

, Get the maximum benefit from your workouts and avoid injury by using the correct form when you lift weights. In addition, to lifting the appropriate amount of weight for your level of fitness, keep the following tips in mind when you're lifting weights:


Lift with controlled movements, rather than using momentum to move the weights.
Be sure you are able to complete each full exercise for at least 6-8 reps. If you cannot do this many, the weights you are using may be too heavy.

, Bicep curls work out the muscles in your upper arm. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms straight. Curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders. Pause briefly and lower them again.

Do two or three sets of 8-12 repetitions.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold dumbbells over your head with your wrists facing inward. Lower the dumbbells behind your head so that your elbows point up in the air, then raise the dumbbells above your head and straighten your elbows again.Do between 8 and 12 reps, and 3 to 5 sets.
This exercise can also be performed using both hands to lower and extend one dumbbell above the head.

, It is important that you do not neglect your forearms. Wrist curls can help strengthen your wrists and forearms, which will improve your lifting ability overall. To do wrist curls, sit and grasp a dumbbell in each hand. Rest your arms against your thighs with your wrists hanging off the edge of your knees. Curl your wrists up and back down, keeping your forearms still.Repeat 8-12 times. Do two or three sets total.

, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the dumbbells at your sides with your arms fully extended and your palms turned inwards, curl the dumbbells to your chest, then press them over your head before reversing the dumbbells to the starting position.


Do between 8 and 12 reps, and 3 to 5 sets. Rest for about 45 seconds between sets.
This exercise may also be performed with a kettle bell or barbells.

, The primary muscles that chin ups engage are in the back, but this exercise also helps strengthen your biceps. Grip a fixed bar with your hands shoulder-width apart and your palms facing you. Use your arms to lift your body, until your chin is higher than the bar then slowly lower yourself back to the starting position.Do between 8 and 12 reps, and 4 to 5 sets.
You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by using a weighted belt.

, Push-ups are a great exercise because they target the chest, back, and ab muscles while also working out the arms.To do a push up, put your hands below your body and slightly outside your shoulders. The rest of your body should extend straight back. Lower yourself by bending your elbows until you are just above the ground. Raise yourself back up until your arms are straight.

Do as many push ups as you can while still maintaining proper form.

, You may think that to bulk up your muscles, you should eat more calories than you usually would. Eating more calories doesn't translate into building bigger muscles. Rather, the calories increase body fat, which obscures muscle definition. The key is to eat a diet that enables you to be lean, so your big muscles become more apparent.


Eat balanced meals with plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean meats.
Avoid white sugar and flour, fried foods, and other high-calorie foods that may cause you to gain fat.

, Protein helps build muscles, so when you're trying to bulk up, it should be a mainstay of your diet. Try to increase your daily intake of protein to help build more muscle.


Choose fish, chicken, lean beef, pork, and other types of meat to supply yourself with protein. Eggs are also a great source of protein.
Beans, nuts, and other vegetables are good vegetarian protein sources.
Dairy, such as milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt, is another great source of protein.
Consider supplementing your diet with protein powder such as whey. Whey is a byproduct of cheese that helps build bigger muscles., When it comes to building muscles, resting periods are as important as workout periods. Get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep on the days when you work out, and avoid overdoing it with other activities that require use of your arm muscles.

Resting simply means taking a break from your normal activities. If your muscles are sore, take it easy for a few days and allow them to heal.Ice the sore area for 15 to 20 minutes at a time three times a day. You can use a bag of frozen vegetables, ice cubes placed in a plastic Ziplock bag, or an ice pack from the supermarket. Never place a store bought ice pack directly on your skin, however. You should always wrap it in a towel before application.Use a compression bandage to reduce swelling of the sore area. You can buy such a bandage at a local drugstore. Apply as directed.You may want to check with your doctor if you have a family history of blood clots before using a compression bandage.
Elevate the sore area, if possible. It's best to elevate a sore muscle above the heart whenever you have the opportunity to do so.;
, Heat can help with sore muscles. Soaking in a warm tub of water for about 20 minutes can help ease sore muscles.Some people claim Epsom salt helps ease sore muscles. You can add a handful of Epsom salt to a warm bath and allow it to dissolve. You can find Epsom salt at most local pharmacies., If your muscles are still sore 2 or 3 days after treatment, consider applying heat. You can use a heating pad or run warm water over a washcloth. If you use a heating pad or a heated blanket, make sure you do not fall asleep with it on as this can be a burn hazard., Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, can be used to treat sore muscles. Take any medications as directed on the label. If you're on any prescription medications currently, you may want to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking over-the-counter pills to make sure they do not interact poorly with your existing medications., Foam rolling is an inexpensive technique to get an at-home massage. A foam roller, which can be purchased at many sports good stores, is a foam cylinder that's 6 inches in diameter. To use a foam roller, lie on the floor with the foam roller beneath you. Gently roll your body along the foam roller where the muscle is sore. Do this 5 to 6 times a week for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. You can look up more specific foam rolling techniques online. Websites like YouTube may provide tutorials.You can also check out How to Use a Foam Roller.

, A diet full of protein and fatty acids will help your muscles. Aim for 20 grams of high-quality protein every few hours throughout the day. Fatty acids can be found in nuts, seeds, and fish. If you are having trouble getting your fatty acids, ask your doctor about fish oil supplements.Include foods from the four major food groups: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. Aim for low-fat dairy products, lean meats like fish and poultry, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole wheat breads and pastas, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Make sure to eat a lot of leafy greens like spinach and lettuce.Try to cook at home when you can. Avoid fast food, eating out, and frozen meals. Sticking to the basics, items easily found at the local grocery store can help make eating healthy easier., Dehydration can cause a variety of problems including muscle soreness.Make sure you hydrate adequately before working out in order to avoid muscle soreness.


You should aim to drink 20 to 24 ounces of water for each hour you work out. Drink water before, during, and after a workout.A good way to test your hydration is observing your urine color. Within a few hours of your workout, your urine should be clear or light yellow. Dark urine indicates possibly dehydration., A proper warm-up increases muscle temperature. When the muscle temperature is warm, it contracts more forcefully and relaxes more quickly. This helps you get more out of your workout and reduces your chance of injury and muscle soreness. If you’re doing a leg workout, try a 10-minute run to warm up. If you’re focusing on upper body, try a lightweight shoulder circuit to warm up. Ask a trainer at the gym if you’re not sure which workout will cater to you best. You can also talk to your doctor about ways to warm up before exercise., Stretching throughout the day or after working out can greatly relieve muscle soreness. Work on incorporating stretching into your day-to-day routine if you want to prevent sore muscles.


Always cool down after exercise. You should spend 10 minutes or so after a workout doing light aerobics, walking, or stretching. You can find stretching techniques online or talk to your doctor or trainer on how to best stretch after a workout.Soreness in the neck and shoulders, sometimes caused by using a computer at work, can be treated with occasional stretching. Try rolling your shoulders backward and down 10 times, squeezing your shoulder blades together 10 times, or bringing your ears to your shoulders 10 times. Such exercises are quick and can be done on the car on the way to work or during downtime at your office.Workout routines like yoga and Pilates focus on stretching the muscles. You can look for yoga and Pilates classes in your area. You can also find easy to follow routines online.

, Sore muscles are usually not a major medical concern and will heal on their own with rest. However, under certain conditions, you should see a doctor for evaluation.


You should go to the ER if sore muscles are accompanied by trouble breathing, dizziness, extreme muscle weakness, or a high fever and stiff neck.If you have a tick bite or rash accompanied by sore muscles, see your doctor for evaluation.Soreness around the calves after exercise should be evaluated by your doctor.Signs of infection around a sore muscle, like redness or swelling, should be looked at by a doctor. If your muscles suddenly became sore after you started taking a new medication, talk to your doctor.Any muscle soreness that lasts longer than a week should be evaluated by a doctor., If you think your muscle soreness requires medical attention, make an appointment with your physician. He or she should be able to evaluate your muscle pain and make a plan for treatment.


At your appointment, your doctor will ask you a variety of questions regarding your pain. He or she will want to know when your pain started, how long it's lasted, its location, any medications you're taking, and whether you have any other symptoms.Depending on your medical history, your doctor may order certain tests. He or she may want to do x-rays, a blood count, or other blood tests. This can help check for certain medical conditions that can cause sore muscles., Therapeutic deep-tissue massage can help relieve muscle soreness, especially if it's done after you exercise.If you have consistent muscle soreness, talk to your doctor about the possibility of a medical massage referral. Often, insurance companies will cover medical massage if it treats a medical condition.

, If your sore muscles are the result of an injury, your doctor may recommend physical therapy. The type and duration of physical depend on your current health, medical history, and the specific cause of your muscle soreness. Your doctor should be able to provide you with a referral to a physical therapist."

Remember that intense cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise which elevate the breathing and pulse to 80 -- 90% of your maximum should be done two or three times weekly, and never for more than 30 minutes.",How to Get Fit the Military Way," Fitness includes these four themes:


Physical Training (will be referred to as PT throughout)
Nutrition

Cardiovascular Training (will be referred to as CT)

Rest.

If any of these key themes are missing you will not make great gains. PT should be done at least three days a week and should include in this order a warm-up, dynamic stretching, workout itself, static stretching, and a cool-down. PT can be done with two different goals, muscular endurance or muscular strength. In this article PT will include only body-weight exercises. Nutrition is a self-explanatory theme, but will be described in detail later on. CT is similar to PT, but focuses on other forms of exercise to burn stored energy. Finally, Rest is obvious. Get enough sleep and you will have met this goal.

;
, Body-weight exercises that should be incorporated into your workout include:



Upper Body (Arms, Chest, Shoulders)

Pull-ups
Super-mans
Press-ups (push ups) in many variations
Ball grips
Chin-ups



Lower Body (Calves, Legs, Glutes)

Calf Raises
Squats in many variations
Glute Marches
Wall Sits
Glute Bridge Raises



Core Muscles (Abdominals)

Crunches

, Dynamic Stretches allow for full range and speed of movements overtime.

,, Static Stretching develops flexibility.


Static stretches that should be used after workout as a cool-down include:

Lateral and Forward Neck Stretches
Swimmers Stretch
Upper Back Stretches
Posterior Shoulder Stretches
Supine Back Stretch
Overhead Trunk Side Stretch
Torso Prone Stretch
Hip Cross-Overs
Iliopsoas stretch

, Either do jumping jacks, jump rope, or a stationary bike for five minutes.

, Use repetitions of 13 and upwards. For strength, do 6-10 reps (12 might be pushing the boundary between strength and endurance). With strength comes muscle size, with endurance comes toning of the muscle.

, How can I possibly build strength with those?"" Altering push ups to make them harder so that you can only do 6-10 reps is easy. In fact, you can add resistance to any body weights exercises. Try doing the exercise more slowly, do exercises on side of the body (i.e. one arm push ups, one-legged squats), also, try wearing a backpack with small bags of sand, books, or anything that adds weight.

, To build muscle you must take in additional calories then needed.


To determine how many calories you need a day, use this equation: 6.95 x Weight + 679= Calories normally burned in a day.
Now, take that amount and multiply by 1.7. So the final equation should be 6.95 x Weight + 679= Daily amount x 1.7.
Now that you have figured out your daily expenditure, add 200-500 calories for muscle gain. For weight loss, subtract 200-500 calories from your daily expenditure.

, Only eat healthy fats such as those found in olive oils, fish, nuts, and flax seed oils. Saturated and trans fats will only shorten your life and add body fat. Aim for these percentages: complex carbs (found only in whole foods, vegetables, whole grain -- eg, whole wheat) 60-70%, protein 20-30%, fat 10-20%.


Chicken
Fish
Pasta
Potato

, Do it only on your off training days. Stationary bikes are good, but sprints are even better.

Fix your mind on the goal.,
Consume more water.,
Eat at least three meals a day.,
Stretch.,
Pump some iron.,
Build up your reps slowly.,
Do some cardio.,
Give yourself time to recover.",How to Get Ripped After 401," Before you begin, it is important to tell yourself that once you go in, you will not back out. Set the amount of time you are going to keep up working out. Some claim they want to do it for life, but give up after a certain amount of time. Make it a goal to keep up with your program for at least four months.;
, Water is more important than food and has always been. Your body can go three to four weeks without food, but your body can barely last several days without water. Drink at least three to four water bottles a day, two at the very least. Drink two more bottles every time you workout.

, There are fitness rumors that you should consume smaller, more frequent meals, but for many, this isn't feasible. Many people are caught up with business or parenting, and do not have the amount of time to incorporate those extra meals. If that's the case, eat regular meals; calculate your calorie intake when you consume food or eat until you are full. You do not need to diet, but you should consume junk food moderately. You can eat it for three meals a week. Definitely, eat more fruits and veggies!

, You can do simple stretches, bending only until you feel pain. Do not go any further than that; hold it there for twenty seconds. Stretch every part of your body. Do this when you first wake up and at night. Stretching helps you to avoid stiffness and does improve posture somewhat.

, Buy some dumbbells from your store or gym. Keep it very light-weight, preferably 5-15 pounds. Do body-weight exercises with the weights; work different muscle groups separate days. Squats, lunges, standing calf-raises, sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups. Consider doing weighted calisthenics with a back-pack.

, You should start off with 6-12 reps the first week. Keep the same amount of weight you use the first week for the second week, but add 5 reps for each set you do, and then increase the weight by five pounds the next week. This builds muscular endurance and strength. Keep this cycle consistent and you are bound to get stronger doing only the same exercises.

, For cardio, you don't need to do running; you can do things like rock-climbing, martial arts, and swimming. If in doubt, try four sets of sprints until you exhaust yourself, or do things like jumping rope, jumping jacks, or dance.

, After working each muscle group, you will need at least 2 days of rest. Expect yourself to get sore.

, For every one to two days of the week, replace your meals with only smoothies. Add as many fruits or ingredients you would like. 3-4 smoothies is the recommendation.

, If you use weights, make sure they are very light, and continue to do reps until you are tired.

, Swimming or high-intensity aerobic exercises. You can run for as long as you want or as fast as you want.

, Cut it out, completely, until you reach your goal. When you're at your goal weight, consume it in moderation.

, Buy Whey Protein, Creatine, or make your own.

,, Resting allows your muscles to develop. Try drinking some sleep herbal teas that shall allow you to rest at night.

, Junk food can put on weight or bulk you up rather fast, but after 40, it is very unhealthy to the body. So, if you are not suffering from weight loss issues, then you can eat junk food more often.

, Sprint instead of jogging. Cardio prevents your ability to put on weight. Therefore, do not do it as much.

Since you have a specific goal—making your back wider—it’s a good idea to come up with a lifting program that will help you develop those muscles in the best way. You can develop your program either on your own or meet with a certified personal trainer, who may suggest different and more effective exercises for you.


Consider how often you want to lift. You should train each muscle group at least twice a week to get the most muscle gains. Add a third workout to maximize your gains. Remember that it’s important between lifting sessions to rest, which allows your body to recover and build muscle.Incorporate exercises that target your larger and smaller back muscles to get the most gains in wideness and definition. This includes using your entire range of motion through different exercises.Choose seven to eight exercises that target your back muscles. Do two sets and vary the number of repetitions every few weeks to get the best gains in power, size, strength, and endurance. You can also consider doing one-armed versions of exercises to maximize strength.Make sure to build in a rest period of 45 – 60 seconds between sets.;
, When someone thinks of a “wide back,” the person generally means having wide latissimus dorsi, or lats. Your lats are the broadest muscles in your back and give it that ""V"" shape. Choose a combination of three to four of the following exercises that target and develop the strength of your lats.Pull yourself up. Pulling up your body weight is one of the most effective — and difficult — ways to build your lats. You can do a variety of different grips and variations of pull ups to build your lat strength.Place your hands on a bar using a narrow or wide grip. Once you’re hanging securely, engage your abs and pull up your entire body until your chin is over the bar.
Do easier alternatives if you don’t have the strength. For example, you could have a box under your feet and jump up until your chin is over the bar. Then let yourself return to starting position. Do the alternative jumping pull up until you have the strength to do regular pull ups.

, The row is a weightlifting exercise that should not be confused with rowing on a machine like an erg. Instead, you will be lifting a long-bar while in a bent-over position.Find a long-bar — the kind you may see bodybuilders using — that weighs 30 – 45 pounds. Put some extra weight on one end if you are able or build up your strength 5 lbs. at a time. Begin with the bar in your hands, palms facing toward you.
Bend your knees slightly and bend forward at your hips, keeping your back straight. Allow your arms to hang straight down, but don't lock your elbows. This is the starting position.Breathe out and use your forearms to lift the long-bar toward you. Keep your elbows in and your torso stable. Pause and contract your back muscles.
Slowly lower your arms back to starting position and continue pulling up the weighted bar until you are finished with your allotted reps.
Make sure to keep your shoulder blades down your back so that you target your lats. In some cases, pre-contracting your lats may help you more effectively engage and target this muscle group.

, Another type of row that you can do to target your lats is the seated cable row. If the long-bar is too heavy for you or you simply want a different type of rowing exercise, try cable rows.Find a cable machine at your gym. You can use a variety of different bars and grips for seated cable rows including narrow grip ""y"" shaped handles, straight handles, rope handles, ""W"" shaped bars, and straight bars. Add a weight that you can lift comfortably but still challenges you.
Sit on the seat with your legs and arms gently bent. Keep your back straight and abs engaged. Now pull the weighted cable towards you until your bent elbows are beside your ribs. Avoid pulling the cable too quickly towards you or you won’t get at your lats most effectively. Slowly release the handle back to starting position, which will help really build muscle. Continue your reps until you’re done.

, Like pull ups, pull downs can also be an effective way to target your lats. Unlike pull ups, you use a weighted bar on a cable machine.Choose seated pull downs or standing pull downs. You can do both on a cable machine, but may need to use a different weight amount.
Sit down in the same position for cable rows. Make sure the bar is above your head and grip it with your palms facing away from you in an overhand grip. Square up your shoulders and engage the muscles between your shoulder blades to help prevent injury. Contract your lats and pull down the bar, aiming the center of the bar at your sternum. If you can't pull the bar that low, don't worry — drop some of the weight and build up your range of motion over time. Release the weight to starting position and continue until you’ve finished your reps.
Stand facing the cable machine with the bar set just below shoulder-height. Place your hands on top of the bar handle and retract your shoulder blades. You will use much less weight when doing this exercise. Push down the bar, keeping the arms fully extended forward with only a slight bend in the elbow, until the bar has gently touched your thighs. Slowly control the release of the weight as you return to the starting position and finish your reps.
It is very important that you pull your shoulder blades back and down before and during the exercise. This allows you to access the lats.

, Developing your shoulder muscles, or deltoids, is also key to getting a wider back. You want to make sure to build muscles along the three heads of the deltoids—the anterior, medial, and posterior—along with your rotator cuff. Doing shoulder work can help maximize your strength gains and make you look wider. Just as with your lats, incorporate three to four of the following exercises to build your deltoids., The overhead shoulder press is one of the most effective ways to build up your shoulders. You want to lift a bar or set of dumbbells directly above your head.Get a weighted bar or a set of dumbbells. Make sure the weight is comfortable but still challenging for you. Grip either the bar or dumbbells so they are slightly wider than your shoulders. Engage your abs and stand upright as you press the weight directly upward until your arms are straight. Return the weight to the original position and finish your remaining reps.
Start with a light, easy weight. As you build up strength, increase the weight so that completing 10 repetitions is challenging.

, Lateral raises, which require you to lift weight upward with your palms facing the floor, are a great way to hit all three heads of your deltoid muscle. You can choose to lift dumbbells or kettlebells based on your preference. You may find that kettlebells are easier to grasp than dumbbells as you get stronger.Hold your dumbbell or kettlebell in a natural position with your palms facing inward. Using your shoulder muscles, raise the weight upward to the height of your shoulder. Your palms should face the floor while you lift. Consider alternating arms to give each a rest in between reps.

, Many people often forget the posterior head of the deltoid, which connects into the back muscle. Doing reverse flys can more effectively define your wider back and the connection between your lats and deltoids.Sit and bend over your belly or use an incline bench. Then raise your arms outwards in a Superman motion. Lift the weight until your arms are at the same height as your back and then return to starting position.
Be aware that this part of your shoulders may not be as strong as the others. Don’t be surprised if you lift a lot less weight when you do reverse flys than with other exercises.

, Width may be your main goal, but it’s also important to train the rest of your back muscles to get an enviable V-shape and ensure that your muscles are properly balanced so that you don’t injure yourself. Be aware that many of the lat and deltoid exercises will also hit the lower and middle back muscles as a secondary effect, but you should do one to two exercises that also target these groups.Choose any of the following exercises to fill out your back muscles:


Back extensions
Pendulum exercisesDeadliftsCable face pulls[

, Part of showing off your wider back is also burning fat and being lean. Building muscle will help you burn fat effectively, but adding a bit of cardio to your workouts can help you get even leaner. Choose to do cardio that helps builds muscle in addition to burning fat and calories.Stick to two to four short cardio sessions of 20 – 30 minutes every week. While a little bit of cardio is good, too much can actually hinder your weight lifting gains. Do cardio exercises that can also help widen your back. Some examples of this are: swimming, rowing, using an elliptical, kayaking or paddleboarding, cross-country skiing, and windsurfing.
Build in high-intensity intervals to get the most of your cardio session. For example, do one minute at a hard pace followed by one minute at an easier pace.

, Exercise increases blood flow to your working muscles and having a shake with amino acids and carbohydrates may help you build muscle. Drink a whey-protein shake 30 – 60 minutes before your workout to boost the results of your weight lifting sessions.Buy your shake mix at health food and nutrition retailers. Read product labels to find a shake mix that has a healthy blend of amino acids and carbohydrates. You could get, for example, a ratio of 6 grams protein to 35 grams carbohydrates.
Eat a turkey sandwich with a slice of American cheese on whole wheat bread if you can’t stomach a shake. This alternative may have the same effect.

, Having five to six small meals every day filled with nutritious foods can maintain your health. It can also help build muscles, especially if you eat a healthy snack like a cup of cottage cheese after a workout.Incorporate different choices from each of the five food groups — fruits, vegetables, whole wheat, protein, and dairy — to ensure you are getting the proper nutrition to fuel your workouts and build muscle.Consider adding extras of the following foods to help you build muscle mass and gain healthy weight:Beets
Brown rice
Oranges
Cantaloupe
Cottage cheese
Quinoa
Spinach
Apples
Sprouted whole grain bread
Wheat germ
Chickpeas
Lentils
Beans
Flaxseed

, Protein helps to build muscles. Getting enough protein from whole, lean food sources helps increase your muscle mass. Choose lean meats such as chicken and dairy products like Greek yogurt to get more protein. Some other good sources of protein you might want to incorporate into your diet are:


Organic milk
Eggs
Cottage cheese
Grass-fed lean beefNuts and nut buttersRotisserie Chicken
Bison
Seafood such as scallops
Fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines

, Just as a healthy diet is important to help your body recover and build muscle, so is getting enough water to drink. It also improves your performance when you train. Aim to get 2 – 4 liters of water per day based on how active you are.Remember that eating lots of nutritious fruits and vegetables will also increase your daily water intake.
Make sure you are properly hydrated before a workout to optimize your performance. Keep a water bottle handy during workouts to ensure you’re replacing lost fluids.

, Every person needs sufficient rest to help him or her recover from the day’s activities. This is especially true if you’re training hard. Getting enough sleep every night helps your muscles recover and grow. In fact, not getting enough rest may sabotage all of your training and diet efforts to get a wider back.Get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you are tired or feel fatigued, allow yourself a 30 minute nap to relax and refresh."

, You may have an hour between getting off work and meeting your friends for drinks, or you may be able to take an extra long lunch break in the middle of the day. See what will work for you, and remember it does not have to be the same time, or the same amount of time, every day., You know yourself and your preferences better than anyone else. If you hate getting up early, don’t schedule a workout at 5 a.m. or your routine will likely fall flat before you even get started. At the same time, if you know you’re too tired after work to do anything other than lay on the couch, try to schedule your workouts for earlier in the day., You may be, or become, a member at a local gym. If not, you may decide to workout at home. You can even exercise outdoors; walking or running on a path near your office may be the best fit for you. Alternating between these options will work as well, don’t feel as though you always have to exercise in the same place., This exercise engages the front of your body in the arm and chest area. Start in a high plank position with your palms flat on the ground underneath your shoulders. While keeping your back straight, lower your body and then raise your body by bending at the elbow., Strengthen your abdominal muscles with sit ups. Start by laying flat on your back with your feet flat on the floor and your hands supporting the back of your head. Engage your abdominal muscles, exhale, and keep your neck and back straight as you sit up. Then, inhale as you lay back down., This exercise works your lower body. Position your feet shoulder-width apart, and bend at the knees while raising your arms. You thighs and arms should be parallel to the floor. Keep your back straight and avoid extending your knees past your toes., Hip hinges flex the hip muscles and also work the lower body, but in a different way than the previous exercise. Bend at the waist and extend your arms forward, palms facing down, straight over your head., While this does engage your leg muscles, it also strengthens your core. Step back with one foot and lower your back knee almost to the ground., This exercise will strengthen your shoulders, upper back, and the back of your neck. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold your fists just outside your shoulders with your arms bent, and then extend your arms straight up over your head while your palms face each other.If you’re comfortable with it, do this exercise while holding a couple of lightweight dumbbells in your hands.
You can adjust your hand positioning in order to pull a resistance band and strengthen the same areas of your body. Turn your palms toward you while making fists and raise your arms straight up above your head., If you decide to exercise at a gym, they will likely have everything you need. If you are going to exercise at home you may want to invest in some equipment: yoga mats, free weights, resistance bands, an exercise ball, or even an elliptical machine or stationary bicycle., Experts recommend beginners start with a full-body routine two to three times per week.

, Cardiovascular exercise gets your heart rate up. This is best if you want to slim down. Cardio exercises include aerobics, running, dancing, and using the treadmill. Do about 1.5-2 hours of cardio exercises each week., Lifting weights helps you gain muscle. It can also help you target a specific area you’d like to improve. Popular exercises include bench pressing, dumbbell presses, and curls. Incorporate these exercises into your workout twice per week to get the best results., You’ll want to work out your arms, legs, and core area. You could set aside one day for each group, such as legs on Monday, arms on Wednesday, and core on Friday. The next week you could change the order to keep your routine from getting stale.


Leg exercises include: squats, lunges, wall sits, calf raises, and leg lifts.

Arm exercises include: pushups, pullups, and curls.

Core exercises include: planks, sit ups, and the superman flex.

, To make the most of your workouts, alternate strength training and cardio. You don’t want to do the same routine each day for months. Your body will get used to the exercise and you may not see the results you are looking for. You could try a kickboxing class on Monday, do strength training on Wednesday, and swim laps on Friday., If you are new to working out, don’t plan for a two-hour marathon session each day. Not only will you get burnt out, but you’re likely to hurt yourself as well. You could begin with 30-minute sessions every other day until you build up your stamina., Not only do you want to take a short break between sets, but you should also rest between workouts. Your muscles need time to rest, and you actually build muscle during those breaks. Aim for 24-48 hours of rest between workouts., Most exercises are a single movement that you do multiple times. Different numbers of repetitions (reps) give you different results. Build endurance and tone by doing 12 or more reps with 2-3 or more sets using light weight, build muscle size and strength by doing 8-12 reps in sets of 3-4 with moderate to heavy weight, and build muscle strength by doing 5-8 reps or 5-6 sets with super heavy weight.Do 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps with light weight to start out. This builds muscle memory in the correct movement pattern and strengthens your tendons and ligaments without putting too much strain on them.

, Don’t feel as though you have to stick with a routine you hate. If the time you’ve set aside for working out, or the exercises you’ve chosen, aren’t working out then reevaluate. Make decisions based on what is best for you and your schedule., It’s incredibly important to stay hydrated while exercising. This is particularly true if you workout outdoors, especially in the hot summer months. Water is the best way to keep hydrated. You could consider sports drinks as well, but pay attention to the ingredients: many are full of sugar and sodium., You won’t see much improvement from your exercise if you are constantly eating junk food. Eat a diet high in protein and “good” fats, such as fish, nuts, and dairy products. Avoid salty foods like potato chips, sugary snacks such as candy, and processed foods., It’s important to do your research and find out what ingredients are in your supplements, and if they will truly benefit you. Look for products with carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and essential amino acids. Be wary of products that sound too good to be true: they probably are."

Ask your client what they want to achieve, first and foremost.,
Help your client list realistic, measurable, and specific goals.,
Track your client's progress.",How to Motivate Personal Training Clients1," Most people sign up for a personal trainer with a mission in mind, and it’s important to determine your client’s purpose. You will motivate a 20-year-old man who wants to gain muscle differently than a 60-year-old woman who wants to lose weight. Get to know your client so that you can conceptualize a plan for them and figure out what will keep them going.


A lot of times, clients will be starting at square one. They may make self-deprecating comments like, “Obviously I need to lose a lot of weight so I’m not so fat anymore.” Try to steer them away from this discouraging way of speaking by keeping the conversation positive– focus on how great it will be to reach goals and make positive changes.Remind them of how great their results will be, not how far they have to go. Tell them that they are in good hands, and this is a great starting spot!;
, If they say they want to lose “a lot of weight,” ask them for a specific number and a date they want to reach it. If they want to gain muscle, ask them which areas they want to focus on (and later, set specific weightlifting goals). If they are training for an athletic event, have them set a specific time or placing they want to achieve.Have them write down their goals so they can read them everyday.The more specific their goal is, the easier you can help them get the “eye of the tiger,” using tunnel vision to focus on that goal, and that goal alone!


If your client has a long-term goal, like wanting to lose 100 pounds in one year, it’s crucial to help them also set mini-goals in the mean time. Big, long-term goals can discourage clients. It’s easy to lose motivation when your deadline is months away. Help them set monthly, and even weekly, targets to keep them on track., As a personal trainer, it is your job to keep track of everything. Write down how many repetitions, minutes, and rounds they do of everything. Monitor how much weight they’re lifting, how much weight they’re losing, and which milestones they’re hitting.Part of your duty as a trainer is taking care of distractions so your client can focus on their workout.
When your client needs a motivational boost, pull the records out and show them just how far they’ve come since day one or since your last major check-in.
Use fitness testing, physical measurements, and before-and-after photographs to help your client see how far they’ve come.

Plan regular check-ins.,
Give your clients “homework.” In order to keep your clients motivated and doing the right things, give them specific tasks to complete on the days when they aren’t at the gym with you.,
Help your client to find a supportive community.",How to Motivate Personal Training Clients2," If your client is only with you for a couple hours a week and they want to see real progress, they have to do the right things when they’re on their own. Working out regularly with you is great, but it isn’t the only thing they should be doing. With your client, plan a system of checking in. Whether it is a text daily or an email every other day, decide how they will keep you updated on their exercise, diet, or anything else you’re working on with them.If you determine that your client is pretty self-motivated outside of your sessions, you can ease up on the check-ins. Continue to ask for brief recaps at the beginning of your workouts, however.

, This homework can be something like a workout plan, writing down a food journal, or even simple goals like, “Eat vegetables every day.” Most clients will genuinely want to complete their assignment successfully, so this can be extremely motivating.


When you assign this “homework,” give them the opportunity to decide if it seems realistic and manageable. If they tell you that they will be able to complete it, hold them to it.

, There are several ways that they can do this. The free iPhone app MyFitnessPal allows users to log their food intake and exercise, and it also can give your client a forum to speak to other people on a fitness journey through extensive discussion boards and comment features. Encourage them to attend a certain workout class regularly or recruit friends to become gym buddies. The more people they have around them cheering them on, the more motivated they will be to stick with it and see progress.

Challenge your clients in different ways.,
Remember their favorite exercises and save them for last.,
Remind your clients that their “dreaded” exercises are making them the strongest.",How to Motivate Personal Training Clients3," Changing your client's workouts regularly helps them avoid hitting a progress plateau, and it will help them stay motivated. Introduce new physical activities every so often so that they have the challenge of trying something new. You might discover a type of exercise that they particularly enjoy. People will be much more motivated to exercise if it’s a fun outlet rather than a dreary chore.Even though two hours of cardio and an hour of free weights will probably get your client results, it’s also probably not sustainable. Make sure you help your client find an exercise routine that they can keep up. If they feel overwhelmed, they’re likely to quit altogether.

, This has several benefits for both your client and yourself. If your client is struggling midway through a workout, you can remind them that their favorite exercise is coming up.Additionally, ending a workout on a positive, strong note is key. Your client probably won’t feel motivated if their last memory from a workout is crying midway through a set of push-ups. They’ll be much more encouraged to come back if they end their workout feeling great!

, If your client absolutely hates doing a certain exercise or working out a particular body part, motivate them by telling you those exercises will make the most difference. If they hate it because it’s so hard, they probably need to work on it! Don’t let them skip anything or only choose their favorite workouts.Take note of the things they really don’t like doing, and be extra encouraging during these.

Stay positive in front of your clients.,
Find ways to relate to your clients.,
Walk the walk.",How to Motivate Personal Training Clients4," If you’re constantly excited, passionate, and encouraging in front of your clients, it will rub off on them. Refrain from saying anything negative- even if you agree with your client that working out the triceps is super boring, don’t tell them that! Act like everything about exercise is fun, and they might just start to feel that way.Even if you’re disappointed that they didn’t hit a goal or finish an assignment, stay focused on the positive. Rather than berating them or allowing them to dwell on a failure, remind them that they have a new day, week, and month to accomplish their goals. The past is the past!

, If you were once overweight, out of shape, or gym-phobic, tell them that! If you have struggled to find time for workouts or to beat cravings, let them know. By finding similarities with your client, you can show them that you’re human, just like them, and their goals are possible. If they see your lifestyle, physique, or mindset as an unattainable goal for them, they can easily lose motivation. Make yourself as relatable as possible., As a personal trainer, you are your own best advertisement. Your body is proof that your techniques work. Don’t give your client instructions that you yourself couldn’t follow. Your clients will find motivation by seeing you work hard, with positivity, determination, and consistency. You’ll lose credibility if you talk the talk but don’t walk the walk, and there is nothing motivating about that.

Start small and work your way up.,
Shoot for between 0.3 and 3 mg of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.,
Ingest coffee three hours before an endurance competition.,
Avoid taking too much throughout the day.",How to Improve Your Fitness Using Coffee1," A dose of as little as 0.3 mg of caffeine per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of body weight will have an affect on your fitness abilities. While this is the minimal amount that will be effective, it’s best to start small and slowly increase the amount of coffee you’re drinking, especially before a workout. More specifically, the smallest effective dose for a 200 lb (91 kg) person would be about three ounces of brewed, black coffee (assuming one ounce of coffee has 10 mg of caffeine, which is on the low side).Drink your coffee about an hour before beginning your workout. Wait a bit longer if you're hoping to promote endurance, as opposed to burning fat more quickly.;
, Drinking 200 mg (3 mg/kg of bodyweight) is the maximum amount of caffeine at which you will receive some benefit. Anything greater than that will have no additional benefit and may even become detrimental to your health. Again, if you don't normally drink coffee, you'll want to start with a low amount, about 0.3 mg/kg. If a 200 lb (91 kg) person wanted to use the maximum amount (3 mg/kg), then they would take about 273 mg (91 x 3) of caffeine.237 mg is about 3.5 cups of coffee if the coffee is brewed at a strength of 10 mg/ounce.

, If you’re hoping to benefit from caffeine use in a particular event, there are a few specific guidelines to follow. Consider abstaining from caffeine use for a few days preceding your competition, as this will increase the drug’s effectiveness.Caffeine reaches your blood much quicker, but the fitness-enhancing effects on fat stores are maximized a few hours after blood levels peak.
Don’t suddenly use caffeine on the day of a competition. Only use caffeine if you have trained with it multiple times and can predict its effects.

, Too much caffeine can not only make you feel anxious, nervous, and shaky, it can also decrease your physical performance. To prevent this from occurring, monitor the amount of caffeine you’re consuming throughout the day. Do not exceed 600 mg in a single day.Often, people consume more caffeine than they realize. For instance, if you’re drinking a cup or two of coffee in the morning and drinking more before your workout, you’re likely drinking too much coffee per day.

Use your body’s fat first.,
Reduce muscle pain and wear.,
Increase your circulation.",How to Improve Your Fitness Using Coffee2," The main benefit of caffeine use to improve your fitness is the drug’s ability to mobilize fat stores and encourage the use of fat as fuel for your muscles. Glycogen is your muscle’s favorite fuel, not fat, and caffeine postpones access to your glycogen reserves. This means your body may burn fat more quickly and more effectively, and that your workouts may last longer, as glycogen reserves will be depleted less quickly., An occasional, large dose of strong coffee — two to three cups of strongly brewed coffee — taken an hour before a muscle-building workout can diminish the pain you feel.In turn, you may be able to push yourself further during a weightlifting session or other strength-training exercise. This may ultimately lead to greater muscle growth.Caffeine may also help you retain muscle as you age. In this case, steady, moderate caffeine use can contribute to long-term fitness, and even help prevent age-related injuries., Improved circulation helps get oxygen to your muscles, which can improve performance and keep your working longer. A Japanese study found that people who regularly drank coffee experienced increased blood flow of 30% over a period of 75 minutes.Improved circulation means more oxygen being delivered to your muscles.

Doctor your coffee for flavor or enhancement.,
Drink black coffee.,
Be wary of packaged caffeinated drinks.,
Consider tea, caffeine pills, or workout supplements.",How to Improve Your Fitness Using Coffee3," There are plenty of relatively healthy ways to craft a coffee-based beverage you enjoy drinking. For instance, try adding almond milk and cinnamon. Both of these are far healthier than sugar and dairy creamers. You can also blend coffee into a breakfast smoothies with other nutrient-rich, workout-enhancing ingredients like almond butter, banana, and whole grain oats.MCT oil and butter in your coffee can provide healthy, fat-based energy to help kick-start your day. This is especially true if drinking butter coffee prevents you from drinking a more sugary morning beverage, or from eating a carbohydrate-based breakfast.

, Plain brewed coffee provides the benefits of caffeine without unnecessary additional calories. Understand that the amount of caffeine will vary widely based on the bean, the roast, the grind, and the preparation methods of your coffee. Remember that in this article, 1 ounce of coffee is assumed to have about than 10 mg of caffeine,which is on the lower end of the spectrum.Be conscious of where your coffee is coming from and how caffeine amounts vary. For instance, an 8-ounce dark roast coffee from Starbucks may contain 130 mg of caffeine, while a K-cup may contain between 75 and 150 mg of caffeine.

, While packaged drinks are often conveniently labeled with the exact amount of caffeine they contain, they are often also full of sugar, sodium, or other unhealthy additives. Be sure to check the ingredients list and check the levels of sugar and sodium., Tea has a whole slew of antioxidants and even contains additional fat-burning components. Black tea usually contains more caffeine than green tea, though specific contents vary widely. Capsules are arguably the easiest and least expensive way to get your fix, but may be especially likely to make you jittery. Finally, work-out specific products such as endurance gels or strength-building supplements often contain caffeine, precisely for the benefits that the drug offers."

Experiment with caution.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Watch out for the side effects of addiction.,
Do not drink coffee within six hours of bedtime.,
Be aware that caffeine will show up in drug tests.",How to Improve Your Fitness Using Coffee4," Aside from the known side effects of caffeine, it is important to note that your metabolism, level of caffeine use, and other dietary factors can affect how your body reacts to caffeine use during exercise. In fact, some people’s fitness performance is decreased by caffeine.When starting to use caffeine before exercising, start small and work your way up. Pay attention to how your body feels, and discontinue using caffeine if you repeatedly experience abdominal cramps or diarrhea.

, Though you are not at great risk of being dehydrated by caffeine consumption alone, it’s always important to drink plenty of water. Shoot for at least 64 ounces a day (2 liters, or half a gallon). A helpful way to remember doing so is drinking an 8-ounce glass of water eight times a day., If you are consuming 200 mg or more of caffeine per day, you will likely experience withdrawal symptoms if you skip a day. In fact, you may experience headaches, depression, and anxiety for more than a week if you stop drinking caffeine cold turkey.If trying to wind down, slowly reduce the amount of caffeine you consume each day.

, Even if you’re accustomed to claiming that caffeine doesn’t keep you up at night, rest assured that it does interfere with the quality of your sleep. Not getting enough deep sleep will not only leave you feeling tired during the day (and depending on caffeine to feel awake), it will also keep you from excelling in terms of physical fitness., Though it is not commonly considered to be a performance-enhancing drug, there is an upper limit established by some athletic competition organizations. For instance, the International Olympic Committee considers concentrations of 12 mg/liter of urine to indicate a deliberate “doping” attempt. However, you would need to consume roughly 1000 mg of caffeine (which, assuming 1 ounce of coffee has 10 mg of caffeine, would be 12.5 8-oz cups of coffee), an amount you should never take at once, or even over the course of one day.Individual factors may affect your body’s caffeine absorption. Accordingly, just a few hundred milligrams of caffeine may put some people at risk of testing in the 12 mg/liter range, though this is highly unlikely.

Speak to your children about the importance of exercising to improve their health.,
Discuss with them the health benefits that exercise can provide to their body.",How to Motivate Kids to Exercise1," Discuss with them the basic benefits of exercise. The obvious benefits are weight control and a better physical appearance but also inform them that it can lead to increased energy which can lead to better athletic abilities and improved concentration that can make school easier.;
, Talk to them about the way the body works and the way exercise works with the body. Explain how it helps to keep the heart strong , the lungs healthy and how it helps to build strong muscles and bones. In addition, talk about some of the diseases that exercise can help prevent, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

Know the muscles you want to improve.,
Do goblet squats.,
Try three-way lunges.,
Perform single leg lateral ski hops.,
Do classic deadlifts.,
Perform the side-plank hip lift.,
Try the bridge.",How to Get Strong Thighs1," There are four muscle groups in your thighs, and you'll want to work out all of them. These are the quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors and abductors.In order to strengthen these muscles, you'll need to pick activities that especially target them.


There are many exercises that target these muscles, more than there is space to be listed. If you ever hear anyone talking about an exercise that targets any of these muscles and you want to try it, you should.;
, This exercise works out your glutes, quads, inner thighs, and hamstrings all at once. It derives its name from the way you hold a dumbbell in both hands like a goblet. Spread your feet out wider than shoulder width with your toes turned outward. Holding onto the dumbbell, squat down until you reach a 90 degree angle, and then rise out of the squat., This move mostly works the front of the thigh and the buttocks, but also the backs of the thighs. First stand with your feet hip-width apart and your hands held in front of your chest. A single repetition focuses on one leg: first lunge it forward to a 90 degree angle, then to its side (lunge left for your left leg, right for your right leg) again at a 90 degree angle, and then backward., This move mostly targets the thighs, buttocks and calves. To do this exercise, lift one leg off the ground and crook it to an angle so that you will not be tempted to use it. On your remaining balancing leg, begin hopping back and forth from left to right and back again in small motions, gradually moving yourself in the direction of the leg you're standing on. A hop to the side and a hop to the other side counts as a single repetition.Make sure the foot you are hopping on is not twisting outward or inward and remains perpendicular to the direction you're moving., This exercise targets the backs of the thighs and legs. Using a reasonably weighted barbell, form a shoulder-width stance with your feet behind the bar and grip the bar with both hands. Sit into a squat as deep as you can go and make sure your back is in a straight line between your butt and your head. Lift with your legs through your heels and bring the barbell to your knees, then rise to standing., This exercise targets the outside of your thighs and your obliques in the side of your torso. Begin on your side with one forearm propping you up and both legs bent behind you. Your legs should form a 90 degree angle at the knees. Keep your other arm extended vertically into the air. Lift your leg, still bent, up into the air, using your hips. Be sure not to move your arms., The bridge targets your buttocks and the back of your thighs. Lie down on the floor, face up, with your arms at your sides and palms down. Bend your knees up but keep your feet flat against the floor. Using your abs and glutes, raise your hips to form a straight line between your shoulders and knees, and hold this position for 25 seconds before slowly releasing. Repeat this 3 times only."

Resolve to begin setting an example for your children.",How to Motivate Kids to Exercise2," Let your children see how important exercise is to you by exercising yourself. Children naturally mimic their parents if they take the time to notice. Get their attention and make them notice your effort by making it a bigger affair than it actually is.

"
"
Introduce exercise in small bursts if your child is very resistant to your attempts.,
Mix up the routine once your child has become accustomed to activity.,
Pump up the routines and the length of activities as your child grows accustomed to the work outs.",How to Motivate Kids to Exercise3," It is better to allow your child a little time to adjust to the idea than to turn your child off completely. Start with 5 minutes a day of a light physical activity. Continue this routine for a week before increasing the time by a minute or 2 and continue to gradually increase the time until your child is exercising for at least 15 minutes a day.

, Rather than 15 minutes of one light exercise, do 5 minutes each of 3 different exercises. Start with the usual light activity for 5 minutes, then switch over to a more vigorous activity for 5 minutes and conclude the final 5 minutes with a lighter activity again.

, Using this gradual approach allows your child to slowly adjust to an exercise program with much less resistance.

"
"
Try to designate a set time for exercise.,
Make it a family ritual.,
Allow exercise to become a group affair by including a friend of the child.,
Turn exercise into a challenge for your children.,
Develop a progress chart.",How to Motivate Kids to Exercise4," We all work better when a schedule is in place because we adjust all we do in a day to fit into that schedule. By anticipating that moment in time, we mentally prepare ourselves for when it arrives. This can work in your favor when it comes to getting your child motivated for the activity. It may be met with resistance at first, but over time it simply becomes the standard routine.

, By incorporating the entire family into the activity it becomes easier for the children to adapt to being forced to exercise. This eliminates any chances of the children feeling singled out and being forced to endure an activity that no one else has to participate in. It is easier for children to accept doing something they prefer not to do if they feel that everyone else has to do it too.

, Your child will be less resistant to the idea of physical activity if it appears to be more of a special event. Incorporating a friend into the routine will turn it into an event the child actually looks forward to. An added bonus can be that when the routine is over the children get to play.

, Children naturally like to prove to others their competency. By betting them that they can’t do something, they will be more motivated to try to prove to you that they can. Be sure to approach this in a fun, joking manner so as not to discourage them from exercise.

, Children love to be able to compare their progress over time and to try to surpass themselves. Make it a family chart and children will become competitive with the others on the chart. The end result is that they push themselves to do better.

"
"
Understand that exercise can be obtained in many different manners.,
Make exercise fun.,
Sign your children up for classes that are physically active.,
Enroll your children in a sports program.,
Plan an outing that will incorporate physical activity into the day.,
Create your own mini-sports team.,
Turn routine chores around the house into physical activity.,
Begin a family game night of activity using the WII game system.",How to Motivate Kids to Exercise5," Do not limit attempts at exercising to routine programs. Any form of physical activity counts as exercise. Be creative in ways to get your children moving.

, Bike riding, swimming, hiking and boat-rowing are all activities that will strengthen muscles and burn calories. Your children will consider this a day of fun rather than looking at it as a form of exercise.

, Karate, dance and gymnastics are examples of activity lessons that your child will get exercise from.

, Basketball, soccer and baseball are effective ways to get kids moving. Keep in mind that in today’s society, girls are just as able as boys to join a sports team. If you are not a fan of co-ed teams there are some all-girl teams available in the sports area as well.

, A trip to the zoo will result in a day of walking. A water park will result in a day of walking and swimming.

, Have family or friends meet at a park for a day of picnicking and a sport event such as kick ball or relay races.

, Walking the dog or carrying items up and down the stairs force children to get moving.

, Your children will love the unity it brings as you build good memories together.

Take up running.,
Ride a bike.,
Climb stairs.,
Try kickboxing.,
Go swimming.",How to Get Strong Thighs2," Running involves your quadriceps and hamstrings and burns hundreds of calories within an hour. It requires and shapes both cardiovascular and muscular stamina. Individuals with a greater overall fitness level will benefit from going longer, but beginners can start with a 20 to 30 minute run on a treadmill, walking trail, or even around your neighborhood., Some people cannot run because they have joint issues in their knees or ankles; bicycling is a great, low-impact alternative to running. This exercise involves the quadriceps, glutes, calves, hamstrings, and even adductor muscles to create a well-rounded exercise for your legs. You can either ride a stationary bike at a gym or at home or ride a bike through your neighborhood., You can either invest in a set of stair climbers or find some sets of real stairs for free for this exercise. The repetitive motions involved with the act of climbing stairs creates muscle endurance. It's also great because the low impact nature means there's few risks of injury. Just 10 minutes spent climbing stairs can burn the same amount of calories as an hour long jog.Whenever you see stairs at work or at home, instead of trying to find ways around them, climb them for an extra workout.

, As the name implies, this aerobic activity relies on and incorporates a lot of moves that involve the thighs. The variety of kicks involved will get you using your hamstrings, quadriceps, and other leg muscles. You can find classes at your local gym or by looking for a martial arts studio near you online or in the phone book., Most forms of swimming involve kicking a force that helps to propel your body through water. Working against the natural resistance provided by the water will help build up muscles in your legs. You can heighten the effects of the workout to your legs by holding onto a kickboard with your hands and making your legs the only force keeping you afloat."
"
Eat right.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Design a regular fitness schedule.,
Have reasonable goals and a timeline in mind.",How to Get Strong Thighs3," That old saying ""you are what you eat"" exists for a reason: it's important that you eat the correct proportions of quality foods to get the minerals, vitamins, protein, and healthy fats you need for muscle development. In particular, be sure to eat plenty of protein, which your body uses to rebuild muscle you've broken down in workouts. Try to eat some high protein food about 20 minutes before and again directly after a strength-training workout.The amount of calories you should take in per day varies by age, gender, and lifestyle., Drinking water will help to reduce your sense of hunger and also allow you to exercise longer and better. Your body is approximately ⅔ water and it must continuously be replaced to make up for what is lost through breathing, sweat, urination, and other bodily functions.Teenagers should try to drink 8 to 10 glasses, or 2 liters of water per day.Adults should have between 2.2 and 3 liters of water every day., In order to improve your overall fitness level, you're going to need to get active more often, even if you're busy. That means you need to design a fitness plan for yourself. Physical trainers recommend that individuals take four to five days a week to work out. If you're looking to build up muscle, then you might spend three to four days for strength training, one day on cardio, and two days of your week ""active resting,"" which refers to doing something light like yoga or walking.In order to have good results, it is of the utmost important that you have a routine and that you stick with it.
It is important to have cardiovascular workouts incorporated into your routine in order to help reduce fat since fat lays on top of and can hide muscle., Your goals must be concrete and reasonable or else you may give up. If you never exercise currently and you want rock-hard thighs, you will need to start with routines that are less strenuous (like incorporating smaller weights, shorter cardio workouts, and fewer reps) and work your way up.


Some specialists suggest that in one year's time, beginners can gain up to 10% of their total body weight or 2 lbs of muscle per month with dedicated training."

Choose to walk or ride a bike rather than taking the bus or car to school.,
Encourage your child to play with your family pet, rather than video games.,
Bring your child to a playground or park.,
Let your child choose an activity that interests him.,
Enroll your child in physical education classes after school.,
Choose an active family outing.,
Perform unstructured exercise programs.",How to Increase Physical Activity in Children1," If your child is too young to do this on his own, take the time to walk or ride with your child to school. Doing this together will help your child to see that you also believe that physical activity is important.


Of course, you need to make sure that there is a safe way to do this. Do not encourage your child to ride a bike alone if there is not a bike lane to ride in.;
, Have your child throw the ball for your dog, or play with the cat. You can also encourage your children to play games with each other if you have more than one child.

, There is a good chance that your child will make new friends with other children when you bring him to a common public area. A playground can be a great place to get active since it is spacious and filled with climbing structures and slides.


If the park near your house does not have a playground, encourage your child to play imaginary games in the trees or grass. Bring a ball and kick it around with your child.

, Another way to encourage your child to get physically active is to give him some power in the matter; if he gets to decide what kind of physical activity he does, he will be more likely to get excited about it.Ask your child what his favorite physical activities are. Or maybe, you can discover what active sports he likes the most by having him try a lot different activities. From there, you will be able to sustain his interest and he will most likely stick to the activity.
Ask if your child would like to go to a sports camp. These camps will expose your child to a bunch of different kinds of sports. At the end of the camp, he may have found the kind of sport he wants to try for a longer period of time.
Sign your child up for the sport (or sports) that he wants to try.

, There is high probability that the school your child is attending has physical education as part of its curriculum. However, you can also enroll your child in after school physical activities, like swimming lessons or dancing classes., If you are going on a vacation or weekend outing, you can choose one that promotes physical activity.


For example, rather that taking your family to go see a movie, you could go hiking or camping instead.

, Not all physical activities need to be structured; there are silly and fun activities that can also encourage your child to be more active. Get creative! Some example activities could include:


Dancing to the child’s favorite tune
Flying a kite at the beach
Riding bicycles
Playing a game of table tennis together with other family members
Regular swimming at the local pool
Routine walking of the dog
Throwing a Frisbee
Jumping on a trampoline

Ditch the gym.,
Engage your brain.,
Indulge your inner child.,
Sneak exercise into your day.,
Help a good cause.",How to Make Your Workout More Enjoyable1," Being a member of a gym may have its own rewards, but if you don't like the gym atmosphere or the people there, you may find that you can make your workout more enjoyable by finding somewhere else to exercise.For example, you might get more benefit out of exercising outside in a park, or simply taking a walk around your neighborhood.
You also might consider joining a community sports league to get exercise outside of the gym while having more fun participating in a sport that you enjoy.
If you live near parks or wooded areas, you also might consider hiking or other outdoor activities to get exercise while also communing with nature.;
, If you find exercise boring, you may need something that will stimulate you mentally while your body works. Bring along headphones while you exercise and listen to your favorite music, an audiobook, or podcast.If you're exercising at home, consider moving your bike or treadmill in front of the television. You can work out while you catch up on your favorite program. The timing of television shows and commercials also makes it easy to mark your pace or set up intervals.
An audio book can be a good way to motivate yourself and make you want to workout, even if you're doing something relatively boring like walking and running on a treadmill. Only listen to the book while you're exercising, and once you get into it you'll find yourself anxious to exercise if only so you can listen to the next chapter.

, Children often build activity into their everyday routines without even thinking about it. Just because you're an adult, that doesn't mean you can't still have fun with some of the activities you enjoyed as a kid.Think about what you enjoyed as a child, and figure out how to replicate that activity in your adult life. It may not be possible for you to do the exact same things you did, but you may be able to find a close substitute.
For example, if you enjoyed roller skating as a child, you might buy yourself a pair of rollerblades and go skating in a nearby park or find a skating rink near you that has open skating sessions that fit into your schedule.
Keep in mind that adults on public playgrounds may be forbidden or frowned upon. If you want to hit the monkey bars, go at a time when there aren't a lot of children present.

, Don't think you have to spend hours in a gym lifting weights or running on a treadmill to get exercise. There are plenty of ways to stay active throughout the day, even if you have a relatively sedentary desk job.For example, you might take the stairs instead of the elevator when going to and from your office.
Another way to sneak in some exercise is to choose a parking space near the back of the lot when you park somewhere so you have to walk through the parking lot. If you take public transportation, get off at an earlier stop than you normally would and walk that distance to your destination.

, Volunteering at a local charity or nonprofit organization can be a way to get some activity into your routine and help others at the same time. There are many nonprofits that require active volunteers on a regular basis, so you can work it into your regular schedule.For example, if you enjoy animals, you might volunteer at the local animal shelter to walk dogs. Both you and the dogs get your exercise each day, and you're improving the animals' quality of life.
You also can volunteer (alone or with a group) to build houses for the poor or homeless. This can be a physically intense activity, but it gets you moving. While this isn't necessarily a daily activity, you may find that you want to train in between house-building sessions to build your strength and endurance so you can contribute more.
Charity walks are another way to make your workout more enjoyable by helping a good cause.

Consider activities for your preschoolers.,
Think about what activities school-aged children will enjoy.,
Help your teen get involved in physical activities.",How to Increase Physical Activity in Children2," Children who are in preschool should be encouraged to take part in activities that help them to develop their motor skills. This includes playing tag, hopping using one foot, riding a tricycle, freeze dancing, playing follow the leader and throwing or kicking a ball.


Children this age can also be encouraged to paint the walls or mimic moves that are made by a butterfly, kite or a cat.
Some sports leagues are open to children as young as four years old, but children that are this age often have a hard time grasping the rules of most sports., Most school going children are used to a sedentary lifestyle like watching television or playing computer games. Limit the amount of time your children can participate in these sedentary games (this will be covered more extensively in the next section).


Instead, sign your child up for sports team or classes like swimming lessons.
Plan family outings to go hiking or biking.
Ask your child to help out around the house or in the garden.

, In addition to being on a sports team, there are many other physical activities that your teen can take part in after school.Encourage your teen to try skateboarding, yoga, or cycling.
Make it easy for your child to take part in physical activities by offering to provide the transport to practice, or to a skate park.
Provide gear that your teen needs to be successful at the sport or other physical activity he has picked.

Be physically active as well.,
Join or support your child in doing physical activity.,
Enjoy yourself when performing a physical activity.,
Talk to your child about physical activity.,
Be alert to your child’s lack of motivation or resistance to physical activity.,
Teach the benefits of exercise without instilling body image problems.",How to Increase Physical Activity in Children3," Most children learn by example and they can be good imitators. What they see you do will most likely be reflected in their behavior. For you to encourage your child to be physically fit, you need to show him that you are doing the same.Go on a run or for a bike ride while your child is doing homework or with a friend. Make sure to tell your child about the sort of physical activity that you are doing.

, Supporting your child means being there during his physical activities. This can simply be sitting on the bleachers while he plays soccer, bringing him to and fetching him from the baseball field, buying him toys or devices that encourage physical activities, and more.

, If you complain about the physical activities you have to do, your child will be much less inclined to perform them. Children learn by example, which means your child will be more likely to complain about physical activity if you complain too.


Make sure to tell your child how much fun you had at your cycling class, or how beautiful the trail was when you went out for a run. If you make exercising sound appealing, your child will be more willing to participate.

, When explaining to your child the importance of physical activity, you need to use language that your child can readily understand. Using medical terms such as obesity, blood pressure, cardiovascular health, and related words should be avoided unless your child is able to comprehend these words. Instead, use simple words and pictures to illustrate your points about physical activities.


You can read your child books about the importance of being active.

, Every child is different. Some kids love playing outside, while other kids prefer not to participate in physical activities. Be alert to your child’s preferences; if your child doesn’t like playing an organized sport, try enrolling him in dancing, swimming, martial arts, rock climbing, or hiking.Involve yourself in your child’s physical activities. Some kids prefer when their parents do the activity with them. For example, sign up to be a coach or assistant coach for your child’s soccer team.
Point out that participating in physical activities will allow your child more time to hang out with his friends, while he will miss out on friend time if he just sits in front of the TV.

, Your child might still be young, but there is a potential that he may suffer from lack of self-esteem and confidence due to his body image.


Don’t focus on your child’s weight and image. Praise your child’s appearance and steer clear of talking about it when you encourage your child to be physically active.

Set rules about how electronic gadgets should be used.,
Replace passive video games with active video games.,
Ask for your child’s help in doing some basic cleaning or organizing around the house.",How to Increase Physical Activity in Children4," There are different things that may divert your child’s attention from doing physical activities. These include cellular phones, desktop computers, laptops, video games, the TV, and other related devices.Rules may include how long and when your child will be able to use these devices. For example, video games can only be played for a maximum of 2 hours per day or watching TV should only be allowed from 8 to 10 am. It really depends on you and your child.

, If your child really wants to play video games, or you set a certain amount of time for your child to play videos games, promote active video games that make your child move around.

, This is a great way to not only promote physical activity, but to also instill a sense of responsibility and dependability in your child’s mind at a very young age. Make sure to ask your child to help with physically active chores.


You can ask your child to help you with washing the car, gardening, house cleaning, mowing the lawn, decorating, bathing the dog, and more.

"
Pair your goals with a treat.,
Dress for success.,
Get friends and family involved.,
Push yourself.",How to Make Your Workout More Enjoyable2," Set small goals for yourself that you can obtain within a week of exercise, and reward yourself for achieving that goal. If you're just starting out, you may even want to reward yourself just for showing up.For example, you may enjoy flavored lattes at your local café. Tell yourself that you can only get a flavored latte if you exercise that day. Find something that will motivate you, and keep in mind that you may have to change up your rewards from time to time as they start to lose their motivational pull.
Try not to reward yourself with food or drinks, especially if you're exercising to try to lose weight. Think of other small things you enjoy, such as buying a book or a new T-shirt, or going to a movie. Take a long candlelit bath, go to a sports event or treat yourself to a movie you want to see.

, What you wear when you exercise can make your workout more enjoyable, particularly if you choose clothing that you like and that makes you feel comfortable and confident.If you're exercising in old, baggy sweats, your workout attire probably isn't doing anything to motivate you. While you don't have to spend a fortune on an entirely new exercise wardrobe, buying a few pieces can help entice you to work out – if only to wear that cool new outfit.
Choose items of clothing that make you feel good about your body, and that are flattering. If you feel good when you put on your exercise gear, that good feeling will persist as you work out.

, People who care about you can serve as great motivators to help you meet your goals. Pairing exercise with social time can help make your workout more enjoyable because you'll look forward to spending time with your friend or loved one.Planning a regular workout with a friend or family member also makes you accountable to someone other than yourself. You'll be less likely to skip an exercise session because you don't want to let that person down.
You also might find an activity that you want to learn, then do it with a friend who has experience in that activity and can coach you and motivate you. That way you get to learn a new skill while also spending time with your loved ones.

, Exercise causes your body to release endorphins, feel-good chemicals that will give you a natural high. If you're working hard enough, those endorphins will both make you enjoy your exercise and give you something to look forward to with each session.If you're not getting this natural high after exercising, that may mean that you're not pushing your body hard enough to release those endorphins.
Once you get to the point where you're getting that natural high, the exercise itself becomes its own motivation, because you'll want to feel that rush of endorphins again.
Keep in mind that over time you'll gradually have to up the intensity of your workouts to continue feeling the endorphins kick in.

"
"
Eliminate excuses.,
Make exercise a part of your daily schedule.,
Hire a trainer.,
Create daily reminders.,
Set realistic goals.",How to Make Your Workout More Enjoyable3," If exercise has become a chore, you've probably come up with several reasons why you just don't have time to do it. Take some time to think about those excuses you use, and you can find your way around them.For example, if you believe you cannot exercise because you are too busy, take a usual day and journal the tasks you do that day. You may be surprised at how much time you spend on unimportant activities. If you decide to make exercise a priority, you can always find a way to fit it in to even the busiest schedule.
Keep in mind that your exercise shouldn't be painful. If your excuses for not exercising are that it's too difficult or it hurts, try something more low-impact such as going for a walk, or talk to your doctor.

, Exercising at the same time every day is part of what turns it into a routine. If you get used to working out at a specific time of day, or tie it to other activities, it can quickly become an essential part of your daily routine.For example, you might decide to start going for a 15-minute walk in the morning. Sleep in the clothes you plan to walk in, and set your alarm a few minutes early. If you drink coffee in the morning, pre-program your machine to start making it half-way through your walk, so you'll be greeted with the smell of coffee when you return.
If you're just starting to exercise, make it a goal to exercise for a short period of time every day, rather than only exercising two or three times a week. Exercise will more easily become a part of your routine if it's something you do every day.

, Sometimes it's easier to overcome mental blocks and make exercise a regular part of your day if you have someone else depending on you to be at a certain place at a certain time. Spending money on a trainer also can be its own motivating factor, since you probably don't want to waste that money.Consider joining a gym that offers personal trainer services for free or at a reduced rate for members. You also can save some money by joining a class or scheduling group sessions with a trainer.
If you're already a member of a gym, the amount you're spending each month on your membership can be a motivating factor as well. However, this may not be the case if you've already paid for several months, since that money is already gone. Paying for your membership once a month rather than paying several months in advance can serve as a reminder.
Keep in mind that motivating and encouraging people to work out is part of a trainer's job. Once you show up, a good trainer will know how to keep you motivated and help you enjoy your workout.

, Daily reminders will trigger you to automatically react and go work out, although it may take a couple of weeks. Leave yourself reminders and visual cues so you'll remember when it's time to exercise.For example, if you've decided to go on a 15-minute walk first thing in the morning, you might set your sneakers and clothes right by your bed as a trigger to your brain that you need to exercise.
If you're headed to a gym, putting your workout gear next to the front door also can serve as a trigger.
These reminders also serve to remove any obstacles that get in the way of you going out to exercise. Plan everything in advance, and make it easy for yourself to go exercise, rather than leaving a lot that needs to be done before you can begin.

, If you find yourself getting frustrated, part of the problem may be that you've set goals that are too long-term or too vague for you to meet. Smaller goals that you can meet in a few weeks time will help you set the pace for continued progress.For example, if your goal is to lose weight, you may have set an overall goal that you want to lose 50 pounds. However, you're not going to lose 50 pounds after a week of exercise, and failing to meet your goal over a longer period of time can be discouraging and make it difficult to continue.
Since weight can fluctuate for a number of different reasons, you might set small weight loss goals, but focus on losing size, such as inches around your waistline, rather than a set number of pounds. Or you can break up the goal into manageable pieces, such as lose five pounds per month. Get out for a walk four times every week this month.
If you're trying to build strength or flexibility, focus on incremental increases rather than your overall goal. Being able to bench press your own weight may be your overall goal, but set smaller goals to gradually increase the amount of weight you can lift each week.

Exercise.",How to Get in Shape," If you must sit at school and/or work, then move your legs and body about, but not constantly like a pendulum. Get up and go to the pencil sharpener, if possible. Step outside during your lunch break or walk to get a drink of water. If you want to get in shape but you’re too busy to hit the gym, you need to at least get yourself up and active. Walk. Park on the far side of the parking area. There are lots of ways to do such things, and they don’t need to be very time consuming or costly at all.


Make a point of taking the stairs rather than an elevator when going home or to work (split between stairs and elevator if you need to go up very high).
Get a standing or treadmill desk, or use an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Go ahead, listen to your favorite TV shows -- but don’t just sit there watching. Cook, fold laundry, empty the dishwasher or ride a stationary bike. Do a step routine/step up/step down (repeatedly) for a good while.
Do squats while waiting for your food to cook. Walk around on your tiptoes, in a duck posture or in a semi-squatting position.;
, Aerobic exercises are those that get your heart-rate up the most. They will improve your body’s ability to handle physical exertion and make you healthier. Aerobic exercises will help you lose any weight, if that is your goal but exercising like this will be absolutely required, if you want to get in shape.


You can bike, which is a great way to work out and get yourself outside.
Try jogging or speed walking, either of which is an easy exercise to take up and is free!
You can swim, which is a great way to work out your whole body.

, If you want to get in shape, you will need to get in some activity at least every other day. You can’t expect results when you exercise inconsistently and infrequently. Have a plan and follow it.


Don't try to work out every day of the week. You should work in at least 2 or 3 rest days total per week. Give your body time to rest and build muscle! Your resting time is essential.

, Studies show if you have someone else pushing you and doing the exercises with you, then it's going to be easier to stay on track.

, To lose weight while getting in shape, you will need to create a calorie shortfall. This means that you will eat fewer calories than are needed to maintain your weight, causing your body to begin burning fat. Calculate how many calories you need to maintain your weight and then plan how many calories you can eat in a day (usually 2,000 calories a day).

, Sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats will contribute to keeping you from getting in shape. Avoid sugary drinks like soda, and anything which is high in saturated or trans fats (partially hardened or hardened fats, margarine). Instead, eat fruit as a dessert and foods with healthy fats like omega-3’s (found most easily in fish, olive oil and nuts)., You will need to eat a proper balance of protein, carbohydrates (found grains), fruits and vegetables, and dairy. Whole grains might comprise about 30% of the food you eat (if grains are not inflammatory for you), fruits and vegetables another 30% (weighted more towards vegetables), dairy 15%, very lean protein 15% or up to 40%, if you lower the calories from carbohydrates. Lower unhealthy fats, processed carbs and sugar to no more than 4% of you diet.


There are different types of fats. Some are good for you, while others are not. You should avoid trans fats (found in many commercially baked and snack foods) and limit saturated fats (ground meats, sausages, wieners, fried foods and butter). However, monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados) and polyunsaturated fats (fish, walnuts) are good for you.
Good whole grains include whole wheat, whole oats, quinoa and brown rice.
Good fruits and vegetables include chick peas/garbanzo beans (can be used to make hummus), beans, kale, broccoli, spinach, blueberries, strawberries, lemons and pears.

, Your meals should have reasonable portions to keep you from taking in more calories than you need. Be careful not to overfill your plate - use a smaller plate if you’re unsure. Drink a glass of water with your meal, and eat slowly in order to help your body feel full.

, Eating protein will help you to feel full and energetic. However, processed protein-heavy foods often contain lots of unhealthy fat. Eat lean proteins to reduce the amount of unhealthy fats in your diet. Use a little hard cheeses with low fat and low carbs.


Examples of lean protein include chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, and lentils/beans.

, Balance protein, dairy and carbs in the morning for a natural energy boost. Alternate between these three example breakfast options:


One cup of vanilla yogurt, 2 cups of melon, and ¾ cup cooked oatmeal.
One cup of low-fat cottage cheese, one banana, and one whole-wheat bagel.
Two scrambled eggs, ½ cup of blueberries, and 2 pieces of whole-wheat toast.

, Lunch is a great time to fit in protein (for an energy boost) and produce to keep you from feeling weighed down while you finish your day. Try alternating between these three example lunch options:


Arugula salad with salmon, onions, and tomatoes. Use Italian dressing.
Pita stuffed with chicken, tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, and feta.
Rye bread sandwich with spinach, mozzarella, hummus, and tomatoes.

, Eat a small dinner and try to eat it further in advance of going to sleep (your body won’t be able to burn enough of the calories if you eat right before sleeping). Examples of healthy dinners include:


Lemon pan-seared chicken, steamed broccoli, a side salad, and garlic mashed potatoes.
Quinoa with bacon pieces, peas, and carrots with a side of steamed kale.
Grilled salmon with roasted asparagus and spinach salad with cherry tomatoes, carrot slices, and vinaigrette dressing.

, Eat one snack in between breakfast and lunch as well as between lunch and dinner. This will keep you from getting faint or hungry and will also help you not to overeat when it’s time for meals. Examples of healthy snacks include:


Carrot and celery sticks.
1/4 cup hummus and 3 pieces of broccoli.
Apple slices with a handful of almonds

, Drink sixteen-ounces of water with every meal and at least once more during the day.

, Take the stairs, stand when you work at your computer, and go for a walk around your building while you eat lunch.

, Make it your goal to exercise with variety, for at least a total of one hour a day. This does not need to be all at once. When exercising, make sure you are getting your heart rate up for at least ten minutes at a time. Here are some example exercises (try to do all three every day):


Do 2 minutes of planks, 4 minutes of jumping jacks, and 4 minutes of squats with thighs parallel to the floor (not deep squats), as soon as you get up. Do a few sets of as many push-ups you can do while keeping good form.
If you have time before getting ready for work, go for a half hour fast walk or jog.
Use a stationary or mobile bike for half an hour when you get home from work or school.

Be aware that it is not possible to spot reduce fat on your body.,
Commit to a long distance cardio workout.,
Avoid lunges, squats, leg extensions, or calf raises.,
Do resistance training exercises once you have burned off the fat on your thighs.",How to Take an Inch off Your Thighs1," Due to how our bodies are made, it’s simply not possible to burn body fat in one specific area. So rather than focusing on reducing fat in your thighs, think about committing to a full body workout that allows you to lose weight in all areas of your body, including your thighs.Burning fat in the inner thigh area is difficult, and may take time. Be patient and set realistic goals for your overall weight loss. Slim thighs are possible, but it will take time to achieve them.;
, Run on the treadmill for 30-45 minutes, go for a long spin on the exercise bike, or complete a solid session on the elliptical machine.The most effective cardio workouts for reducing large thighs is to do work on your cardio through running, jogging or spinning for a long duration of time, as this will allow you to burn fat and not put on too much muscle or bulk. If you are running or jogging outside, avoid hilly terrain as this will cause you to build up muscle on your legs.If you are working out on cardio equipment like the elliptical or the stationary bike, keep the resistance and the incline low. Aim for a moderately high intensity on the machines to maximize the amount of fat you burn.
Use a heart rate calculator to determine how intense your workout is and to ensure you maintain an even pace throughout the cardio workout.

, These exercise, while great for building thigh muscle, will only help your thighs become larger, not slimmer.Focus on burning fat on your body and then build your thigh muscles gradually.

, Once you feel you have lost an inch or two off your thighs through a long distance cardio workout, start to integrate resistance training with weights into your workout routine.Start with lighter weights on exercise machines like the leg lift, leg rotations, and leg presses. Do more reps on each machine with less resistance to build up muscle slowly.

Get a check-up.",How to Get Fit," The mind may not be a muscle, but it's still incredibly strong, and can make the difference between succeeding and failing at your goal. Being fit is a marathon, not a sprint, and it requires making changes to your entire lifestyle.


Don't approach this with the mindset that you can abandon the changes you make as soon as you reach your ideal fitness goal or you risk slipping into your bad habits again. Being fit should mean incorporating things into your life that you can eventually do by habit.;
, It is a good idea to start a 'fit journal' so that you can keep track of when you work out, what you do, and for how long. You can also log what you eat each day. You may find that when you have to write down whether you snacked or not you may be less inclined to snack.


Don't think that just because you have one setback, you may as well scrap it all and give up for the day. Don't be discouraged if you stop losing weight or stop gaining muscle; remember that plateaus are normal but overall you've put yourself on an upward trajectory and that's definitely something to be proud of.

, These contracts are otherwise known as a reward system. Set a goal for yourself and then decide upon a reward for yourself. Pick an item that you really want or something that you really want to do.For instance, make a contract with yourself that states that if you go on a run for 30 minutes every day you can buy that cute shirt or new golf clubs you have had your eye on for weeks now.

, It is much easier to reach your goals when you have someone to share the pain and the gain. Create a schedule that you can both commit to and keep each other on track.You could even get a group of people in on the 'get fit' schedule. Have everyone put $10 into a pot and the person who works out the most during the set amount of time wins the money.

, By regularly challenging yourself you keep your physical self ""tuned up"". If getting fit means losing weight, this will help the pounds melt away—and stay away! If you're training for endurance, this is the way to ensure steady improvement.


Take the subway or bike to work or school instead of driving. If that's not possible, park several blocks away from your office building to force yourself into two 15-minute walks every day. When you go to the grocery store, hardware store, movies, or mall, park at the end of the lot instead of wrangling for a spot near the front door.
Walk the dog more often—both your body and your pup will thank you.
Clean your house vigorously. You'd be surprised how physically taxing housework is: dusting your shelves, cleaning your toilets, doing the dishes, mowing the lawn, pulling weeds, vacuuming and sweeping, picking up the house, and cleaning the garage will definitely give you a workout. Making yourself and your family clean parts of your house on a regular basis will not only create a better environment for you to live in, but also make burning calories, staying flexible, and keeping in shape a much simpler process.

Exercise at the office. Believe it or not, it’s completely possible to make sitting at your computer into a calorie-burning activity. You can stretch and workout your muscles by doing leg lifts, oblique reaches, and lower back reaches, among others.

, A proper fitness program has five components: a warm-up, an aerobic workout, strength-building exercises, stretching (flexibility), and a cool-down.


A good warm-up is a steady walk outside or on the treadmill, a slow pedal on a stationary bike, or a few rounds on the stair master. You want to exercise just enough to get your blood flowing and put your joints through their full range of motion so that your muscles warm up. Exercising without a warm up could lead to pulling or straining a muscle.
Cardio workouts improve circulation and endurance. This could include going on a run, biking at a high resistance, or doing an increased speed on a stair crunching machine. You want to work up a sweat and get your blood pumping. Good cardiovascular health is not only good for heart health and blood pressure, it has even been linked to a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s Disease.Doing interval training (i.e. alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity) has been shown to be an especially fast and effective way to improve heart health and endurance, and an efficient way to burn fat.Building muscle through strength-training will not only increase your strength and tone, but will also increase your metabolism, as muscular people have been shown to burn more calories even when they’re at rest. You could work with weights, do squats, push ups, or crunches, among many other exercises.If going to the gym isn’t for you, try strength-training at home.
Stretching during or after a workout increases your flexibility. It can also relieve muscle and joint stiffness. Stretch your legs, arms, back, any muscles that you used while working out (which should generally be all of them.)A cool-down is very similar to a warm-up. You should perform some sort of cardio exercise at a very low level. Cooling down allows your muscles to relax while the blood is still flowing through them at a slightly increased rate.Note: anyone over the age of 60 or who has heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis should consult a doctor before attempting interval training.

, Any physical activity that takes a bit of effort will help you get fit, but it's important to remember that variety is the spice of life—and of physical fitness! More importantly, as your body gets comfortable performing a certain activity, it learns to do it more efficiently, making it easy for you to plateau in your workouts. Keep both your body and your mind guessing by enjoying a diversity of activities and having fun.


Dance. Anything from ballet dance to breakdancing or even jump style will increase your fitness if you stick with it. Enroll in a Zumba or hip-hop class. You’ll be surprised by how many calories you burn while having fun.
Go swimming. It doesn't matter if you're treading water, dog paddling, or mastering the butterfly stroke. Swimming is a good form of exercise that can be fun, too.
Do yoga. Yoga is a healthy exercise that keeps both your mind and body fit. Pick one day a week to let your body indulge in some serious stretching, rather than doing your normal workout. Yoga will help you maintain your flexibility, but is also a great way to tone your muscles.

, Being with other people helps motivate you to keep going. For example, you're doing track. Your teammates motivate you to keep going (and possibly the fact you don't want to be last), unlike when you're at home on the treadmill by yourself when you can easily press a button and you're done., As you become more active, you'll need more food, but not just any food—you need healthy, energy-laden food that will jump-start the next phase of your day, not weigh it down. Learn how to eat healthfully and drink more water.


Switch to wholegrain. It's healthy and delicious. It might not be what you're used to, but you'll enjoy the richer, nuttier flavors. If you don't want to switch entirely to whole grain, try to make half of the grains you eat whole grain. Who knows—you may find that you like whole grain more and more each day.Cut out unhealthy snacks and replace them with fruits and vegetables. The high fiber and water content will make you feel full, and the high vitamin and mineral content will nourish your body naturally. Try to make meals that are half fruits and half veggies.
Eat lean protein foods. Try to buy meat that is lean (which means that it has a lower fat percentage). Eat beans, eggs, and seeds to boost your protein intake without the fat that comes with meat. Eat seafood at least once a week. Seafood contains protein as well as omega-3 fatty acids (which is the heart-healthy kind of fat).Cut back on solid fats. These include items made with butter or shortening such as cookies, cakes, and other desserts. They are also found in processed meat like sausage and bacon, as well as in ice cream and pizza. Solid fat is the kind that results in you hitting the gym a lot more.Eat foods with a low glycemic index. These are foods that take longer for your body to digest and convert into energy, so you will feel fuller throughout the day with a smaller number of calories. Moreover, you avoid the ""sugar rush"" that comes as a result of eating foods with a high glycemic index, getting a nice boost of sustained energy throughout the day instead. This will keep you uplifted whether you're doing work or exercising.

, Purchase the healthy fruits, vegetables, whole grains, soups etc. that you want yourself to eat, and keep the junk out of your cupboards so you won't be tempted. It's not bad to indulge once in a while, but it's too easy to do so if you keep your house full of unhealthy treats. Instead, the best litmus test for your true desire to indulge is if you're willing to make the trip to the bakery or supermarket to purchase it. (Even better, make that trip on foot or by bike, if possible).


Before you indulge, drink two 8oz (250 ml) glasses of water. If you still want the treat after that, go for it. Sometimes our brain confuses our hunger or cravings for food with thirst. Water is one of the best cures for cravings.

, Water keeps you hydrated and promotes optimal metabolic activity.Moreover, water takes up a great volume in your stomach, so you will feel fuller without having consumed many snacks or meals. This is a great tool to keep off the excessive calories that you don't really need but consume due to psychological eating or not knowing your satiety levels.


Carry a reusable water bottle around with you at all times. You'll be surprised how easy it is to get in your recommended 1.5~2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water each day. It's also cheaper than purchasing drinks whenever you get thirsty and better for the environment.
Drink water instead of sugary drinks like soda. If you feel less compelled to drink water because of its lack of taste, try infusing your water with your favorite fruits, like strawberries, blueberries, lemon, orange,amla and lime.

, When you're giving your body a run for its money with varied physical activities, you also need to let it recover by getting a sufficient amount of sleep. Determine how many hours of sleep you need in order to feel refreshed in the morning, then discipline yourself to wake up and go to bed at the same times on a daily basis.


Not getting enough sleep also comes at a huge expense to your immune system. You're much more likely to get sick if you don't give your body the energy or time to fight against infectious viruses and bacteria, and you'll take longer to recover from common conditions like a cold.
Sleeping too little has also been linked to overeating.Be sure that you don’t deprive your body of sleep energy or you will make it up in calories.


, To stay fit in the long run, you should perform regular maintenance on your body, just as you would with a car. Take yourself to the doctor and dentist regularly to make sure everything is running smoothly on the inside and to prevent any potential problems from arising.

Recommit yourself to exercising.,
Evaluate your fitness level.,
Define your goals.,
Set realistic goals.,
Get the gear.,
Set a start date.",How to Get Motivated to Exercise After Getting Off Track1," It is never too late to start exercising again. Although it may have been a long time and working out again may feel like a “lost cause,” you can start exercising at any time. It may feel like you are back at zero, but this isn't the case. Your body will remember all the hard work you put in previously, helping you return to familiar habits.;
, Depending on how long it has been since you last exercised, you may need to determine your current fitness level. If it has only been a few weeks since you last worked out, you should be able to jump back into your original workouts with little problem. However, if it has been more than a few weeks, you will want to ease back into your workouts.If you exercise regularly, you begin to lose your muscle and cardio fitness after only a few weeks. However, if you exercise less frequently, you will get out of shape more quickly.
If you are unsure about your fitness level, you can perform a few physical tests, such as walking and doing some push ups, to test where you are at.You can also talk to your doctor about what exercises and strategies are best for you.

, Set some clear goals about why you are working out and what you want from it. This will give you something to work towards and keep you motivated. A good goal is one that you can track and that gets you going every day.For example, you might set a goal of running a 5K or losing 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in 6 months.

, If it has been a few months, or even a few years, since you last worked out regularly, you are not going to be in nearly as good of shape as you once were. It is important to be aware of this and not expect yourself to get back into shape overnight. Because of this, you need to set realistic goals that you will be able to meet. Unrealistic goals will only demoralize you and may lead to injury.For example, if you were previously able to run five miles (8.05 km) three times a week, you should not expect to meet that distance right away. Instead, set a manageable goal of only running a mile or two a few times a week and work up from there.

, Before you restart your workout routine, you might need to invest in some new gear. If you have gained a little weight since you stopped working out, you should get some new exercise clothes that stretch and breathe, keeping your body cool and irritation-free. You may also want to look into getting new shoes and other workout gear, such as water bottles and cell phone holders.Getting new clothes can remove a mental hurdle to exercising and push you to get back on track.

, Making a vague plan to start working out at some point in the future is not going to give you much impetus to start exercising again. Instead, you need to set a specific date and stick to it. This will help motivate you and give you a deadline to work towards.For example, if you start working out for a New Year’s resolution, you should set January 1 as the date that you plan to begin exercising again.

Go for bottoms that cover your thighs.,
Invest in clothing that will slim your lower body.,
Stick to dark colors.,
Avoid whiskered jeans.",How to Take an Inch off Your Thighs2," For women, that means skirts that cover the widest part of your thigh and hit 4-5 fingers above the knee. For men, that means dark washed jeans that fit you properly in the waist and are a slim fit.


Avoid overly baggy clothing as this can actually make your entire body, including your thighs, look bigger.It’s a good idea to also avoid low-waist skirts that shorten your legs and make your thighs look larger, as well as mid-calf skirts as they can look matronly or frumpy.

, This means purchasing clothing that is not too tight or too loose and is styled or cut in a way that slims your larger lower body.


For women, clothing like wrap dresses and A-line dresses work to slim your thigh area and still look good.Avoid tight fitting dresses made of material that are too body hugging like lycra, nylon, and satin., Dark colors always seem to make everyone look slim.


However, don’t be afraid to wear prints, especially printed tops that draw attention away from your legs and thighs.If you are petite and larger in the lower body area, avoid very bold or large prints as these can overwhelm your look. Opt for the more detailed or printed garments to be skirts or pants.
Avoid horizontal stripes as they can make you look wider and draw the eyes side to side, right onto your thighs. Go for tops, skirts, and dresses with vertical stripes as they draw the eye up and down.

, The whiskering on the thigh area of the jeans will only draw attention to your thighs.


As well, go for dark wash jeans that fit you well rather than capris or short shorts that will only accentuate your thighs rather than slim them down.

Reduce your daily calorie intake.,
Limit your sugar intake.,
Eat less carbs and increase your protein intake.,
Avoid dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt.,
Monitor your calorie intake to look for ways to improve your diet and prevent bad eating habits.",How to Take an Inch off Your Thighs3," Calories are the energy currency for your body, but if you consume too many calories, your tissues will store more fat and this could result in obesity or weight gain. So focus on eating foods that have a low calorie intake and take longer to digest, like leafy green vegetables and fruits, as well as lean proteins and foods that contain less artificial sugars., Research data suggests that eliminating sugar from your daily diet can decrease your calorie consumption by almost 20-40%.Replace sugary drinks like soda with water or green tea. Green tea stimulates your metabolism and has anti oxidants that are very good for you. It is also important to make sure you drink at least eight glasses of water a day.
Replace sugar in your coffee with Stevia, which is made from a South American plant and tastes sweet but contains no sugar or calories. You can also try natural sweeteners like cinnamon or honey.Avoid all artificial sweeteners, including Splenda. Read the packages of food items to ensure they do not contain corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup.
Keep in mind alcohol is actually very high in sugar, so avoid drinking alcohol to keep your sugar intake down.

, While carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for your body, a higher intake of simple carbohydrates like baked goods, candies, and cookies can significantly affect your metabolism in all the wrong ways. Carbs in the form of grains like breads and pastas can also lead to weight gain and a drop in your blood sugar, resulting in lethargy and a lack of energy. So look to minimize your consumption of these foods.Switch from bread and pasta to healthier grains like brown rice or quinoa.
Replace sugary desserts of baked goods with naturally sweet foods like fresh fruit.
Increase your protein intake in the form of lean meats like turkey or chicken, instead of fatty beef or pork. Ideally, you should be eating four servings of protein a day. A serving is 3-4 ounces or about the size of your fist. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, especially poached, broiled, or grilled.If you maintain an active lifestyle or a daily exercise routine, it’s important you have enough energy in the form of grains and proteins to allow you to work out and build muscle, including your thigh muscles.

, Use whey protein to make protein shakes that will still give you energy but won’t be fattening.You can also use egg white protein powder.
You also want to avoid butter, mayonnaise or heavy cream. If you’re making a salad, use olive oil, coconut oil, or flaxseed oil to make a healthy salad dressing., Calculate your daily caloric requirements according to your weight and level of physical activity and then make notes on your daily calorie intake for one month. While it’s important to have a healthy calorie intake, you should also try to keep your blood sugar stable so you will feel full and satisfied after a meal and not feel hungry.Make note of any moments in the day where you feel tired or cranky between meals. If you notice your energy dips at certain times of day, be prepared and have a healthy snack ready so your blood sugar does not dip. You might find you aren’t as sleepy in the late afternoon if you avoid eating bread or heavy carbs at lunch.
Note any meals that strayed from your healthy diet and any food triggers you may have. Maybe stress makes you want to eat cookies or a social atmosphere causes you to reach for a glass of wine. Regardless of the triggers, it’s important to recognize them and try to curb them by substituting cookies for a piece of fruit or a glass of wine with a glass of water or cup of green tea.
In fact, it is recommended you drink a glass or water or tea before meals to stimulate your metabolism and suppress hunger, which will help you to avoid overeating.
The key to a healthy diet that will help keep weight off and give you enough energy to strengthen and tone your thighs with exercise is to still enjoy what you are eating. By replacing processed foods with “real” organic food, your body will thank you by feeling better and ultimately, looking better.

Consider liposuction.,
Be aware of the possible risks and side effects of liposuction.,
Consider a thigh lift.,
Be aware of the possible risks and side effects of a thigh lift.",How to Take an Inch off Your Thighs4," Liposuction is a procedure that can remove unwanted pockets of fat from nearly any area of the body, including the thighs.However, this is considered a drastic or serious method to taking an inch off your thighs and is an expensive way to address unwanted fat on your thighs.


This treatment uses a very narrow tube, called a cannula, which is inserted directly into the thigh. The cannula is attached to a suction device, which removes fat cells, resulting in a smoother, leaner contour to the thigh.
The procedure is typically performed on an outpatient basis, and discomfort and recovery time after the procedure is generally minimal.
However, the procedure can be expensive. Depending on the location where you plan to get liposuction done and the surgeon performing the surgery, you can expect to pay between $2,000 - $5,000 for inner thigh liposuction and between $1,600 - $5,000 for outer thigh liposuction., Like other surgical procedures, thigh liposuction has some possible risks and side effects. These include:


Blood clots, infection, fat clots, skin sensitivity changes, bleeding, irregular or uneven body contours, swelling, skin discoloration, skin and nerve damage, scarring, anesthesia risks, pain, and loose skin.
It’s important to keep in mind that while liposuction will help remove fat from your thighs and give them a more contoured look, it cannot treat obesity or make up for a poor diet without exercise. It will not solve other health issues from obesity or a lack of physical activity.
Liposuction also cannot treat cellulite, which are the dimpled marks on the thighs and buttocks. It cannot treat loose or sagging skin.The results of thigh liposuction can be long-lasting with proper care. But if you gain back any weight in your thighs, you can completely reverse the look of the thigh liposuction. So its essential you adopt a healthy lifestyle with a good diet and exercise before and after the procedure.

, A thigh lift, or thighplasty, is a more invasive surgical procedure that reshapes the thigh, removing excess skin and some fat.The procedure is often performed in combination with liposuction to reshape and smooth the thigh after fat is removed through the liposuction session.
Thigh lifts may also be done on an outpatient basis, but recovery can take one week or more. Most patients are back to all normal activities within a few weeks after surgery.
However, thighplasty procedures can be expensive. Prices range from $2,000 - $10,000, with the average procedure costing about $4,500., This surgical procedure has several possible risks and side effects, including:


Poor wound healing, bleeding, fluid accumulation, major wound separation, skin discoloration or swelling, skin loss, persistent pain, deep vein thrombosis, risks from anesthesia, unfavorable scarring, numbness or other changes to skin sensation and loose skin.While the surgeon may be able to remove some thin layers of stubborn fat on your thighs during the procedure, a thigh lift is not focused on removing many layers of fat. It is not a substitute for other fat burners like a healthy diet and daily exercise.Before a surgeon performs a thighplasty, they will make sure you are at a stable weight as losing further weight could cause your thigh tissue to droop again. As well, a significant weight gain after the procedure could also interfere with the results. So its important to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regime before and after the surgery."

Start with a stretch.Though the benefits of stretching are ambiguous, stretching can help you improve flexibility and blood flow to muscles while decreasing risk for injury.,
Play a sport.Summer is a great time for outdoor sports.,
Get involved in your community.Many communities host triathlons, yoga classes, and runs during the summer.,
Head into the great outdoors.Walking and biking in the forest is a great way to get fit during the summer.,
Go running.Running is a low-cost exercise that can get you fit quickly.,
Hit the gym.Working out at the gym offers tons of options and possibilities for getting fit.,
Start small.It’s best to start small when getting fit.",How to Get Fit over the Summer1," Stretches can flex your calves, thighs, lower back, neck, hips, and shoulders.


Do a quick walk or a light jog for about five minutes before stretching.
Hold each stretch for about 30 seconds.For instance, if you sit on a pad or mat with both legs out in front of you and try to touch your toes, hold the position for 30 seconds.
Focus on stretches that relate to your workout. For instance, if you’re going for a jog, your stretches should work the hamstrings, calves, and ankles.
You can end your workout with a stretching session too, if you wish.;
, Volleyball, tennis, and soccer are all great summer sports that can help you get fit. Sports are an especially great way to get fit during the summer if you are competitive.

, Some might also offer the opportunity to join a community basketball or soccer team. Check your local community events page online or contact community development organizations and ask if they offer fitness classes or sports programs., Enjoy the fresh air, the quietude, and the simplicity of communing with nature. Lose yourself on a mountain path or a hiking trail. Visit your local public park for hiking and biking opportunities.

, All you need is a comfortable, well-fitting pair of tennis shoes and your legs to take you wherever you want to run. You could run along a natural trail, on a community track, or on a treadmill.


Start by walking for about five minutes. This will stretch and warm up your leg muscles.
Start at a time or distance you feel comfortable with. For instance, you might start out by running ten minutes each day. Add minutes or distance every few days to continue building your running endurance and strength.
When you’re close to finishing your run, sprint hard for about thirty to sixty seconds. If you do this before ending your run every time, you’ll be able to build speed as well as endurance during your runs.
When you’re done running, walk around for about five minutes to cool down.

, Try a variety of exercises and focus on the ones you like best.


Cardio (or aerobic) workouts involve working the heart in whole-body exercises like biking, running, jumping rope, or walking.
Anaerobic workouts could include bench presses, push-ups, pull-ups, chin-ups, sit-ups, lunges, and squats. These are the best exercises for burning fat and building muscle.
Switch back and forth between cardio and anaerobic exercises. For instance, run for 30 minutes, then do 30 pushups.
If you're unfamiliar with gym equipment or certain exercises, ask the staff for assistance. For an added cost, many gyms also offer personal workout trainers to help you develop a routine that works for you.

, For instance, start out by walking or running two miles each day, depending on your current physical fitness level. After you can easily do two miles (usually after a week or so of daily workouts), start doing two and a half miles. Increase your distance to three miles after another week. Continue adding distance until you feel you’re working out at your maximum capability.

Start off by going slow and steady.,
Drink water before and after you run.,
Push yourself, but know when you need to stop; injuries are not fun.,
Congratulate those around you afterwards.",How to Survive the Beep Test," You know the saying Slow and steady wins the race and, although you may not be able to run slowly for the entire beep test, you can at least try to pace yourself. If you push yourself too hard in the first couple of beeps, than you'll be setting yourself up for disaster. For the first 10-15 Beeps, you may be able to get away with a slow jog or by walking at a brisk pace. It will take many beep tests before you figure out a technique that works well for you as an individual.;
, It's essential that you keep your body hydrated, especially when performing this test of fitness. You might not be able to sip while running, but at least keep a bottle of water at the sidelines for when you finish. Becoming dehydrated can be fatal, or at least make you become very ill.

, It's perfectly healthy to get your heart-rate up, but not to the point where it is at such a peak that it can barely maintain itself.

, If you're running a beep test while in PE class, there will be others who were running it as well. Chances are, by the end of the test, everybody will be tired. Patting a classmate on the back and saying, ""Good job out there today!,"" can really brighten someone's day.


It doesn't matter if you are the first to drop out, just try your best and you'll be fine. Eventually you won't be too troubled by your scores, and you'll just get on with the rest of your day.

Start with something easy.,
Keep it short.,
Prepare your gym bag ahead of time.,
Incorporate rest days.,
Reward yourself.,
Be patient with yourself.",How to Get Motivated to Exercise After Getting Off Track2," When you start working out again, try not to do too much. Pick an easy exercise that you are confident you can complete and that will not be too physically taxing. Once you complete it, you may be motivated to pursue something a little more difficult the next time.For example, if you want to get back into swimming, start with five laps and then add another lap each day, gradually building up to longer swims.

, If you are totally overwhelmed with the idea of working out, then just commit to a short workout. Take five or ten minutes to walk, stretch, or do some lunges. Once you start, you may find that you want to keep going.For example, if the idea of running a mile seems daunting, go for a ten-minute walk and see how you feel.

, If you hate working out in the morning, get all of your workout materials together the night before. That way, when you get up and feel like skipping your workout, you have one less thing to worry about. The fewer excuses you have to not workout, the better.The same strategy works for sticking with evening workouts. Make sure that your gym bag is ready to go when you get home from work or school.

, Because you will be sore and tired at first, you should take advantage of rest days. Your body needs time to heal and strengthen the muscles that you are using. Pushing yourself too hard initially can result in an injury that may sideline you for an extended period of time.Initially, you might consider giving yourself more rest days than exercise days. For example, in the first few weeks, consider only working out three days a week, filling the rest of the week with light physical activities like walking.

, A little positive reinforcement is a great way to get yourself motivated and to stay on track. If you are having a hard time getting excited about your workouts, work towards a tangible reward. This could be a micro reward for completing a day’s workout, such as an extra hour of TV at night. It can also be a macro reward for achieving a long-term goal, such treating yourself to a vacation for meeting a weight loss goal.A combination of micro and macro rewards can really help you stay on target.

, Many people who return to exercising overdo it, which leads to burnout. If you tend to push yourself too hard, make a conscious effort to moderate your exertion. The goal should be to stick with the plan, not achieve the plan on the first week.

"
"
Schedule your exercise.,
Use a fitness tracker.,
Get an exercise buddy.,
Make a financial commitment.,
Join a class.,
Hire a personal trainer.",How to Get Motivated to Exercise After Getting Off Track3," If you are having a difficult time staying motivated when you first start working out again, plan a few weeks’ worth of exercises. This will help you establish a routine and make you less likely to bail on exercises. If you have no other conflicts of interest, you do not have an excuse to avoid working out.You can use a planner or an online calendar app, such as Google Calendar, to schedule your workouts.

, Electronic fitness trackers are a great way to get motivated and stay invested in your exercise regimen. Trackers, made by companies like Fitbit and Garmin, make it easy for you to monitor your exercise and track your health objectives. They also allow you to share that information with others, which can be fun and motivating.You can also download fitness apps, like Strava, that track your exercise from your smartphone., A workout buddy will help hold you accountable and motivate you to keep on working out. Talk to a friend or family member about starting an exercise program together or working out at the same time. A workout partner will give you someone to talk to and make working out again a little less difficult.It is important that you and your partner hold each other accountable. Otherwise, you may just end up reinforcing each other’s bad habits. Make sure that you push and support each other to keep going.

, Purchasing new equipment, paying gym memberships, or hiring a personal trainer can all be great motivators to keep working out. The thought of losing money may keep you going to the gym. There are also apps, like Pact, that allow you to wager money on your workouts. You start by wagering a sum of money and, if you meet your exercise goals, you earn money. However, if you do not work out, you lose your wager., Exercise classes at your gym or the local YMCA will provide your exercise routine with a little more structure, which is great for staying motivated. The structure of a class will give you set times each week to go work out. In addition, you will exercise with other people, which can be fun and encouraging.There are classes for a variety of different exercises, ranging from beginner to advanced skill levels. For example, you might join a beginner’s yoga class at your local YMCA to work on building your flexibility.

, If you have the resources, a personal trainer is a great motivator. They will push you to complete your workouts while ensuring that you are performing them correctly and safely. A personal trainer is a great option if you do not have an exercise buddy or if you really want to focus on working out.Most gyms will have personal trainers that you can hire to help with your workouts.

Think positively.",How to Get a Healthy and Strong Body," In general, adults should consume between 11 and 15 cups (2.7-3.7 litres) of liquid every day. This amount, however, includes the liquid (including water) that you receive from all sources, including food. The general guideline to ensure you’re drinking enough liquids is to prevent thirst, which you often don't notice until you are dehydrated. Jumpstart the habit by having a drink with every meal. Any type of liquid can be included in this daily consumption, including milk, tea, coffee, or soup.You may need liquid, but that doesn't mean that every liquid is beneficial. Drink caffeinated beverages and sugary fruit juice in moderation, and skip sugary sodas completely.;
, Don’t be fooled by “light” or “natural” on the label, it doesn’t necessarily mean the product is “light” in calories, or made from “natural” ingredients. The nutritional information is also very important, and the amount and % of your daily intake of various nutrients are listed on product labels. However, it is important to know the QUANTITY of the product these measurements are referring to. You might see that the product contains 1g of fat - awesome - but that 1g might be in reference to 2 chips when you normally eat 20., A balanced diet may be slightly different for each person, depending on their age, gender, size, activity level and existing health conditions (i.e. high cholesterol, diabetes, pregnancy, etc.). Regardless of the amounts of each type of food, almost everyone needs to ensure they get enough protein, dairy, grains, fats, and fruits & vegetables.Protein is mainly found in meats, but you can also find it in beans, tofu, nuts, and eggs. Try for the lean and non-fried options.
For dairy products, try to consume the lower fat options when possible. Try to stay away from items like cream cheese, cream, and butter if possible.
Grains include wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, millet, bulgur, quinoa, and more. Grains can be found in foods like pasta, oatmeal, cereals, breads, and tortillas. Try to select the whole grain options when possible.
Our bodies do require a certain amount of fat to function properly. Some, but not all, oils that are liquid at room temperature tend to be those with more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are the better fats to consume. Look for oils made from canola, corn, cottonseed, olive, safflower, soybean or sunflower.
Fruits and vegetables are a great source of fibre, vitamins and minerals. They also usually contain the lowest amount of calories as compared to other types of food. While juice can be a good source of vitamins and minerals, it tend to contain a lot of added sugar. Try to limit yourself to only one glass of juice a day, or less.

, A lot of dairy products like milk, sour cream, cottage cheese, hard cheese, ice cream, etc., come in a “regular” version and one or more “light” versions. The label will explain what the percentage of milk fat is contained in each version (i.e. 2% milk versus 0% skim milk). If you currently consume the “regular” or higher fat versions, switch to a lower fat version of the same product.The same thing can be done with products that contain sugar. Some items made with sugar can also be found with low sugar or sugar-free versions.


Some ""fat-free"" labels are just advertising gimmicks. If the food normally contains little to no fat, it doesn't matter whether you buy the brand with the fat-free label.
Sugar-free products sometimes use sugar substitutes instead of natural sugar. Some sugar substitutes (like stevia) also come from natural sources. Other sugar substitutes (like aspartame) do not. You will need to decide how you feel about sugar substitutes before consuming certain products.
Sugar comes in many forms. Sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, dextrose, maltose, honey, and molasses are all sugar!

, This includes snacks and drinks. If you think about your food intake a week at a time, you are not only able to make sure you buy all the things you need, but you’re making sure each meal you eat is balanced. Meal planning may even allow you to make some of the food in advance so you don’t have to cook every day. Make sure every meal includes fruits and/or vegetables.Your meal planning should include:


One dark green and one orange vegetable per day.
Whole fruit instead of fruit juice.
Whole grain products.
Lean meat cuts or other protein sources.

, Vegetable-based soup provides both the vitamins and nutrients of the vegetables in the soup, and helps fill your stomach so you don’t eat more of another food. Soup can also make a good meal in and of itself, and may be less expensive than non-soup alternatives.Try to choose broth-based soups, rather than creamy soups. Or, if you’re making the soup yourself, make a creamy soup using a lower fat alternative (i.e. 2% milk instead of cream).
Add healthy extras to a home made soup, such as lean meats, vegetables and beans.

, Whole grains contain a lot of vitamins and minerals your body needs, as well as complex carbohydrates, which provide your body with energy. Whole grains have also been known to help reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. When selecting items that contain grain, try to choose as many whole grain options as possible. This includes items such as brown or long grain rice, oats, whole grain bread products, and whole grain pastas and flours., They weren’t kidding when they said breakfast is the most important meal of the day! It’s probably also the meal most people tend to skip. Try not to do this. Eating breakfast gives you enough energy to get through your morning, and helps control hunger throughout the day., Don’t eat in front of the TV or computer. Chew each bite completely before swallowing and pause between each bite. Savour your food.In an ideal situation, you should be able to sit down to each meal with one or more other people and enjoy a conversation while eating. Not only is this enjoyable, but it’ll slow down how quickly you eat and allow your body to register when it’s actually full so you stop eating.

, Don’t worry, you don’t have to actually count your footsteps all day. Wear a pedometer or download a cell phone app that counts your steps. Walking is one of the best aerobic exercises you can perform because it is not harmful to your body, specifically your joints. Ten thousand (10,000) steps a day is a common goal for people aiming to reach and maintain basic health and fitness.Going to the mall? Park on the opposite side of the mall from the store you’re going to so you have to walk further.
Taking public transit? Get off a stop or two early and walk the rest of the way.
Take the stairs if they're an option. Pretend elevators and escalators don’t exist.

, If you don’t exercise a lot currently, suddenly working out for an hour every day of the week will probably make you hate exercise. Instead, slowly build up a routine for yourself at your own pace, and build it into your daily schedule. Try to do your exercise at approximately the same time and on the same day each week. Try to change up the type of exercise you do to give yourself variety and reduce boredom. Write down your exercise routine in your calendar (on paper or online) to help motivate you.Once you start your routine, don’t overdo it. If you’re in pain, too exhausted, or not feeling well, stop or slow down. Don’t push yourself past your limits (at least, not without professional guidance)., The exercise you perform should be balanced so it has positive impacts on all your internal systems. This means you should include activities that provide you with: stretching and flexibility exercises (e.g. standard stretches, yoga, etc.); aerobic exercises (e.g. walking, running, biking, etc.); strengthening exercises (e.g. weights, yoga, etc.); core exercises, which is anything that helps build strength and power in the muscles that support your spine (e.g. pilates, etc.); and balance exercises (e.g. yoga, tai chi, etc.)., Yoga offers a lot of great benefits for your whole body, as well as your mind. It can also help you increase or maintain your flexibility, build muscle strength, and decrease your weight. And it can benefit your cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Yoga is also great regardless of your age or previous exercise experience., Moderate physical activity will make you breathe harder, but you should still be able to talk (includes quick walking, skating, biking, etc.). Vigorous physical activity will not allow you to talk without catching your breath (includes running, cross-country skiing, basketball, soccer, etc.).You should spend at least 2.5 hours per week performing moderate physical activity in sessions of at least 10 minutes OR 1.25 hours per week performing vigorous physical activities in sessions of at least 10 minutes.Of course, doing BOTH would be awesome!

, Mindfulness is basically taking a moment to be aware of your feelings and senses at a particular point in time, without trying to analyze or judge anything. Many of the day-to-day things we do with our mind can be stressful and tiring. Taking a moment to be mindful, on a regular basis, can help relieve stress and anxiety, improve your mood and feelings, and help you concentrate on the more important things in life.Some methods of being mindful are as follows:


Pay close attention to other people. Learn more about someone - how they think, why they are the way they are - without using any judgements or applying any stereotypes.
Look at the world as if you’ve never seen it before. Try to take notice of things you take for granted.

, There is almost nothing bad about meditation. It helps increase your immune function, relieves pain, decreases inflammation, helps depression and anxiety, helps you regulate your emotions, physically changes your brain for the better, makes your memory better and much more.If you have never meditated before, learn how to concentrate first - sit still, close your eyes if you want, and focus on a single point. The point can be your breathing, a specific word, staring at a specific object, or even counting something. Focus on the object for as long as you can. If you notice your mind wandering, bring it back into focus. Once you get good at this method of concentration meditation, move onto more difficult forms of meditation, Self-confidence and self-esteem are an important part of having a strong and healthy body. Decreased self-esteem/self-confidence can be brought on by physical events, and can start an endless cycle of feeling bad mentally and physically.There are, however, many things you can do to help yourself increase your self-esteem/confidence every day:


Look the part. Pay attention to what you wear and how you look. Wear things that make you feel comfortable and yourself. Don’t dress in a trend that isn’t you. The more confident you look, the more confident you’ll feel.
Start crossing things off your to do list. Sometimes we have so much on our plate that the little, mundane things like doing the dishes or laundry get put aside. Take the time to get those small things out of the way - they’re accomplishments too!
If needed, don’t spend time with people who make you feel small, or break down your self-esteem. And stay away from places that make you feel bad or have negative memories. If that isn’t possible, develop a plan to re-build your memory of a person or place in a more positive light.

, Take the time to recognize when you’re feeling down, or thinking negative thoughts. Try to overcome negative thoughts with positive ones. Think about the good things in your life.Try to be optimistic. Think about the things you feel guilty about and formally forgive yourself. Turn mistakes into learning opportunities. Don’t hold onto grudges. Reward yourself for the good and positive things you do in your life.Try not to aim for perfection in everything you do.Have fun! Do what you actually enjoy doing - on a regular basis. Try new and exciting things. Do something nice for someone else.Set some goals for yourself, easy or challenging, or both, and work towards them. Make sure you take the time to relax every now and again, and if necessary, do nothing. Just be yourself."

Visualize yourself in action.,
Think of something enjoyable and fun associated with exercising.,
Find an activity you enjoy.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Be consistent.,
Reward yourself.,
Self compassion is everything.",How to Get Motivated to Do a Healthy Workout," Many sports psychologists talk about visualization all the time and many of the athletes across the globe use this kind of technique to boost their performance. The night before you exercise, try to take at least ten minutes to visualize the entire session in your mind. Imagine yourself getting up, working out and at least feeling energized and accomplished afterwards. You need to go through the entire exercise routine in your mind. By visualizing, you will able to adjust and at least prepare yourself for your fitness routine the following day.;
, Many people usually underestimate the power of having fun and enjoying the routine when it comes to exercise. A recent study shows that if you are not happy and perceive your exercise as work, then you are more inclined to slack.

, Try to pick up a certain sport or join dance classes that you used to love or always wanted to try. Why not pump up your workout with music? Music can change your perception of how difficult the tasks are. And breathing throughout heavy routines can give you the added stamina you need.

, It is always important that you remain positive throughout the whole fitness routine. You can reframe your negative thoughts to some positive ones. Reframing is a type of cognitive-behavioral method that can support people to become higher functioning in all areas of life. Doing self-talk has a very powerful ability on your motivation and ability to perform. Focus your thoughts on your own strengths, like how you made time to exercise or how you worked out even though you did not feel like it.

, You may already know from research that some “feel good” chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine are released in your brain every time you perform an exercise routine. Yet, when you do your workout consistently, some of the new dopamine receptors are made in the motivation center of the brain. Through exercising, it becomes a self-reinforcing behavior. Consistency is the key to achieve optimal results.

, A positive reinforcement can be an effective way to keep yourself on the right track. Rewards throughout the process are also well-deserved when you start and maintain a fitness routine. Try to give yourself some rewards daily or weekly. Or take a trip to the spa or get a massage to unwind. The short and long-term rewards are very important. Try planning a celebration one to four months in advance where you can show off the results.

, If you miss a day or a few days working out, tomorrow is another opportunity to thrive. Be kind to yourself during your process, there will be ups and downs. Don't give up!

Keep a food diary.A food diary is a log in which you record everything you eat, along with its calorie count, each day.,
Eat fruits and vegetables.The health benefits of fruits and vegetables are almost too numerous to list.,
Get lots of fiber.Foods with fiber take longer to digest than less-fibrous foods, meaning the will keep you feeling full longer.,
Avoid fatty foods.Unless you’re adhering to a very intense workout schedule, you should try to limit your fat intake.,
Eat early.Have an adequate (but not too big) breakfast.,
Don’t deny yourself everything.",How to Get Fit over the Summer2," A good way to keep a food diary is to record your meals and snacks on your phone. You could use a simple notation file to track your meals, or you could try an app like MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, or Noom Coach.Since you’re not just monitoring what you eat, but also working out, it’s a good idea to add a workout aspect to this food diary, too. Add two additional columns to each day’s diary entries briefly describing the day’s workout routine and tallying how many calories you estimate you burned.

, The high water content in fruits and veggies will leave you feeling full but not add a significant calorie load to your diet. Their high fiber content will keep your gut clean and operating efficiently. Fruit contains many phytochemicals (naturally occurring compounds) that promote good health.Aim to eat at least two cups of produce each day.

, In addition to fruits and vegetables, popcorn, brown rice, and whole grain bread are some foods that pack in fiber that can get you fit during the summer.

, Stay away from fast food, fatty snacks like potato chips, and other junk foods. Get your fats from avocado, olive oil, peanut butter, nuts and other natural sources of fat for your fat needs.


Saturated fats are especially bad for your heart health. These are fats that can raise your blood pressure quickly. No more than 5% of your daily calories (or about 13 grams) should be from saturated fats., Try to eat most of your calories by 3:00 each day. If you eat most of your calories earlier in the day, you’ll be able to draw on that energy throughout the day and won’t need to eat as much as the day continues. This will keep you from eating continuously throughout the day.


Granola with banana or berries makes a great breakfast. Other healthy options include whole-grain toast with jam, oatmeal with fruit, or a vegetable smoothie.

, You might struggle with the temptation to eat fatty, sugary, and salty foods -- the very foods that you should avoid when trying to get and stay fit. Unless you have superhuman will power, you might give in to their temptations sometimes. You should not set up specific rules against eating any one food.Summer is a great time to eat ice cream, for instance. As long as you don’t make a regular habit of having a post-workout ice-cream cone -- thus negating any benefits you might have gained from working out -- it’s probably okay for you to have some ice cream once in a while.
Maintain portion control when eating foods that you usually wouldn’t indulge in.

"

Make a list detailing why you want to get fit.For instance, you might want to have more energy.,
Set your goals.Do not go into the summer without solid goals.,
Create a plan.Now that you know your goals, figure out how you can achieve them.,
Incorporate fitness technology into your summer.There are a variety of apps available that can help you get fit over the summer.,
Take pictures of yourself each week.Look back over these pictures, and compare each new picture to pictures from prior weeks.,
Get support.,
Have fun.Getting in shape can be a challenge, but it can also provide great opportunities for fun.",How to Get Fit over the Summer3," You might want to give yourself a more positive mental outlook. Maybe you just want to achieve overall good health. Whatever your reason(s), list them and be specific. Tack this list to your fridge or another visible location and consult it daily, especially when you feel tired from your exercise regimen.

, Ensure your fitness goals are achievable, realistic, and specific. For instance, do not make a goal like, “I want to get fit.” Instead, make a goal with quantifiable data, like, “I want to lose ten pounds,” or “I want to be able to do fifty pushups.”


A realistic weight loss goal is to lose two pounds each week. Use this baseline to determine how much you can lose.
Don’t schedule gym time for yourself every day if you cannot make it to the gym each day.
Getting fit will be hard.Expect to put in lots of work to get fit over the summer.

, Your plan should include both an exercise and nutrition aspect. Write the plan down.


Your nutrition aspect might be, for instance, “Consume no more than 1,800 calories each day.”
Your exercise aspect of the plan might read, “Exercise for one hour each day except Wednesday and Sunday.”
Feel free to modify your plan as the summer progresses. If you think your current plan is too rigorous -- or not rigorous enough -- add or remove steps and benchmarks as needed.

, Fitness tracking devices like FitBit can also be helpful in helping you monitor your progress and achieve your goals.


Yogaia is a mobile app that provides guidance and training for yoga moves. Using it to do yoga on your own can save money that would have been used for classes.
Lifesum is an app that provides a personalized nutrition plan based on how much you exercise and what your fitness goals are.
Use a health and fitness tracking device like FitBit to help you track your biometrics (the data of your body). FitBit can track how far you’ve run, how many steps you’ve taken, and what your heartbeat is during different times of day.

, If you are on track with your fitness goals, your body will become visibly toned and muscular. You can use these images to remind yourself how far you’ve come on your path to good health.


You could also post the pictures on social media to receive praise and positive feedback from friends and family. This feedback can also function as a great source of motivation.

, If you have friends who have also expressed interest in getting fit over the summer, propose a contest in which the individual who loses the most weight over the summer wins. A friendly contest among friends or coworkers can motivate all of you.Money is also a great motivator. For an added twist, you and your friends could put up some money as a prize for whoever loses the most weight. If you and five friends put in $20, the winner could get $100 at the end of the summer.
You could also make a rule that if someone doesn’t lose at least one pound by the end of each week (compared to their previous week’s weight), they must add $10 to the prize pot.

, Invite your friends to go walking or swimming with you. Get a gym buddy to accompany you on your workouts.


Exercise also produces endorphins, a kind of biological chemical that makes you feel good.
Thinking about your workouts as something other than drudgery can help you stay on track. Think of your workout sessions as personal time, or a personal reward or mini-vacation from your regular work life."

, Doing high-intensity workouts is the key to building muscle. Light workouts, even if they're long, don't go nearly as far to produce the right conditions for your muscles to break down and rebuild. Plan on doing 30-45 minute sessions 3-4 times per week (every other day). This may sound like a surprisingly manageable plan, but remember that during each session you have to make it as intense as possible. Your muscles will definitely get sore at first, but that will ease up once you get going with a routine.


During each session, lift as much weight as you can using the correct form. Test your limits to find out how much weight you should lift by doing reps with different weights. You should be able to do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps without having to put the weights down. If you can't, lower your weight. Generally, the 6-12 rep range stimulates bulky muscle growth, while lower reps favor strength gain at the expense of muscle size.
If you can do 10 or more reps without feeling a burn, add more weight. You simply will not get bigger unless you challenge yourself to go all in.

, Lift the weight quickly but lower slowly., To develop precise technique, do every rep with good form. Beginners, strive to keep the rep target inside your strength capabilities. Find the right groove for each exercise. Don't train to failure when you're just starting out.


You should be able to complete the full motion of an exercise without having to lean over or change position. If you can't, you should be lifting less weight.
In most cases you'll start with your arms or legs extended.
Work with a trainer for a few sessions so you'll learn the right form for different exercises before continuing on your own.

, You don't want to work out the same groups with every workout, or you'll end up damaging your muscles.Rotate muscle groups so that each time you work out, you're putting in an intense hour working on a different group. If you work out three times a week, try something like this:


First workout: do exercises for your chest, shoulders, back, and abs.
Second workout: focus on your legs, triceps, and biceps
Third workout: Do your abs and chest again., If you do the same thing over and over each time you work out, you're not going to make progress. You need to be adding weight, and when you plateau with the new weight, switching up your exercises. Stay aware of the progress you're making and take notice when it seems like your muscles haven't changed in awhile; it could be a sign that you need to switch things up in the weight room.

, For someone with a fast metabolism, the rest period is almost as important as the workouts. Your body needs time to build muscle without burning a lot of calories doing other activities. Running and other cardio exercises can actually impede the growth of muscles. Take it easy in between workouts instead. Get a good night's sleep so you're fresh for the next workout.

, Research confirms that tuning in to the mind-muscle connection can optimize your results in the gym. Instead of focusing on your day, or the blonde next to you, strive to get into a muscle-building mindset to help increase gains. Here's how to do it:


Visualize your target muscle growing as you complete every rep.
If you're doing lifts with one hand, place your other hand on the muscle you're hoping to improve. Doing this can help you feel exactly where the muscle is straining, and help you refocus your efforts.
Remember, it's not the amount of weight on the bar that's important; it's the effect of that weight on the muscle that leads to increases in the size and power you're after. This has a lot to do with how you're thinking and what you’re focused on.

, Foods high in sugar, bleached white flour, trans fats, and additives are high in calorie but low in nutrition, and they're going to build fat instead of muscle. If you want your muscles to grow and look defined, you need to eat an array of whole foods from every food group.


Eat calorie-rich protein dishes like steak and roast beef, roasted chicken (with the skin and dark meat), salmon, eggs and pork. Protein is very important when you're building muscle. Avoid bacon, sausage and other cured meats, which contain additives that aren't good for you to eat in large quantities.
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables of all kinds. They provide you with fiber and essential nutrients and help to keep you hydrated.
Eat whole grains like oatmeal, whole wheat, buckwheat, and quinoa instead of white bread, biscuits, muffins, pancakes, waffles and similar foods.
Eat legumes and nuts like black beans, pinto beans, lima beans, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, and almonds.

, Do you eat when you're hungry, and stop when you're full? That sounds normal enough, but when your aim is to gain muscle fast, you need to be eating a lot more than you usually would. If your goal is to gain weight, add an extra serving to every single meal, and more if you can handle it. Your body needs the fuel to build muscle: it's as simple as that.


A good muscle-building breakfast might include a bowl of oatmeal, two to four eggs, and one to two pieces of fruit, such as an apple, an orange, or a banana.
For lunch, you might eat a chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread, several handfuls of nuts, an avocado, and a big kale and tomato salad with grapeseed oil dressing.
For dinner, have a big piece of steak or another protein, potatoes, and vegetables. Have an extra serving of each if you need more fuel for your gains.

, Don't wait until your stomach is growling to eat again; you need to be constantly refueling your body when you're in a muscle-building phase. This isn't going to last forever, so try to enjoy it! Eat two additional meals in addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner.

, You can't rely on muscle-building protein milkshakes to do the job for you. To build muscles, you need to be getting the vast majority of your calories from calorie-rich whole foods. That said, you can help accelerate the process by taking certain supplements that have been shown not to harm the body.



Creatine is a protein supplement that has been shown to help build bigger muscles. It comes in a powdered form, and you mix it with water and drink it a few times a day.
Protein milkshakes like Ensure are acceptable supplement to have around for when you're having trouble eating enough calories between meals.

, Working out as hard as you have to in order to gain muscle can dry you out quickly. Combat this by carrying a water bottle with you wherever you go, and drinking whenever you feel thirsty. Ideally, you should be consuming around 3 liters (0.8 US gal) per day. Drink extra water before and after workouts.Give up sugary or carbonated drinks. They won't help your overall fitness, and they might actually hold you back when it comes to strength training.
Alcohol isn't helpful, either. It dehydrates you and leaves you feeling low energy.

, What's working, and what isn't? As you change your, pay attention to what's happening with your muscles. Everyone's different, and a food that might not do much to one person might be helpful for someone else. If you don't see improvements one week, switch it up and try something else the next week.

, Sleep is very important for giving your muscles a chance to grow. Getting at least seven hours of sleep a night is the minimum, 8-9 is ideal.

, You might enjoy other cardio activities (sports, running, etc.) but those put additional strain on your body (muscles, joints) and use up energy that could be used instead to build muscle. Normally, cardio activities should definitely be included for all-around health, but if you're temporarily focused on building muscle quickly, focusing on weight-training exclusively for a few months will help you reach that goal.

Eat more than you think you need to.,
Try to eat five meals per day.The best way to time your eating is to eat consistently throughout the day.,
Keep track of your protein intake.,
Include carbohydrates in your diet.",How to Gain Muscles with a High Metabolism1," Weight gain or loss is a numbers game – to put on weight, you need to consume more calories than you burn on a daily basis.This doesn’t mean go crazy with sugars and bad fats – your diet should be balanced and healthy. The best way to keep track of your calories is by recording what you eat and how much you burn. To gain weight, add about 500-1,000 calories to your current diet spread over the course of the day.Use a notebook, app or website like MyFitnessPal to total up your day’s calories. This requires reading food labels, being meticulous about recording ingredients, and being aware of portion size. Also record what exercise you did that day and how many calories you burned (as close as possible). A surplus of 500 calories per day will help you gain 1 pound per week.
A great way to add calories is by eating “good fats,” like olive oil, nuts, and flaxseed.;
, Of course if you work or go to school, you may not find time for full sit-down meals. Keep protein-rich snacks with you between meals like almonds, pumpkin seeds, and peanuts.You can also try to sub in a protein shake during the day between whole meals. You’ll do better spacing meals out multiple times throughout the day than trying to eat 1-2 extremely calorie-heavy meals in a sitting.


Definitely do not skip breakfast. Try to include fresh fruits or vegetables, carbohydrates, and proteins in your breakfast.

, To put on muscle mass, try to eat at least 18 calories of protein per pound of your body weight. Also remember to shoot for 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily (about 0.36 grams per pound).For example, if you weigh 180 pounds (81.6 kg), you want to get 3,240 calories from protein every day. At this weight you should try to have about 65 grams of protein that day.
Eat high-protein foods like lean meats (beef, chicken, turkey), beans, peas, lentils, eggs, oats, cottage cheese and milk, quinoa, tuna, peanut butter, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.Your best choices for high-quality protein are beef, yoghurt, milk, eggs, cheese, poultry, and fish.Try protein shakes with whey powder base. Whey is a commonly-used protein supplement.

, Carbs are your body’s main source of energy, and eating them with protein can help your body turn the protein into muscle. Try to have a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of carbs to proteins in your meals. Plan meals in advance by reading labels and using your notebook or app to track protein and carbs, as well as calories.Have fruit and veggies at every meal with a 3:1 ratio with carbs.Add carbs to your protein shake to get a great boost of both. This is great for after a workout.

Talk to her about why you want to gain weight and muscle mass, and tell her about the kinds of things you’re going to change in your lifestyle.
Ask your physician what a safe amount of weight gain is for your age and gender. Gaining too much weight could put your body weight into an overweight category.;
, Everyone’s body has different capabilities. Sit down and write up a realistic long term goal for yourself.


Goals should be measurable and specific. Not just “gain weight” or ""gain muscle"". Try to be as specific as you can with your goals. Vague goals or out of reach goals are harder to stick to.
Also include a timeline for your long-term goals. For example, I want to gain 10 pounds in three months.
Once you do this, come up with short term goals to help you reach your long term goal. Weekly goals are a great way to keep you on track for this kind of endeavor.

, Whenever you've set up goals for yourself, it helps to track your progress. This will help motivate you and also provide you with valuable feedback.


Track a variety of measures that will show your progress. You might track your weight, body fat percentage or circumferential measurements.
Tracking your progress will help you evaluate how your diet and exercise program are working. For example, if you're not gaining enough weight, you might need to readdress your caloric intake or how many calories you're burning through exercise. Reassessing or re-measure every two weeks to get an accurate picture of how your program is working.

, Find someone to be your accountability partner. Making lifestyle changes like this can be difficult. Having someone to talk to may help you stay motivated or stay on track.


Talk to friends, family members, your trainer/dietitian, or coworkers about your goals. Ask them if you can check in with them weekly to tell them about your progress.
Take personal accountability as well. It is up to you to make the necessary changes. While your partner is there to help, it is mainly your job to stay focused.

, These nutrition experts will be able to coach you on the appropriate diet and foods to eat to help you build muscle and gain weight.


Ask your primary care physician for a recommendation or do a quick online search for a local dietitian. Many specialize in weight gain and/or sports nutrition.
Talk to your dietitian about your goal and how they suggest you reach it. You may ask for a meal plan, cooking advice, and a total calorie goal to follow.

, In order to gain weight, you'll need to increase your overall caloric intake. Increase your caloric intake by 250–500 calories a day in order to gain weight.This will generally result in about 1/2-1 pound weight gain each week.


Gaining weight faster than this or using unhealthy foods to help you gain weight is generally considered unhealthy.

, Increasing your total daily calories may be difficult. You'll need to eat more and choose foods that are higher in calories. If you're finding it difficult to meet your calorie goals each day, try adding in healthy, yet higher-calorie foods.


Try eating: full-fat dairy products, olive oil, avocado, nuts and nut butters.
Drizzle olive oil or put a pat of butter on your foods after you've prepared them. Put avocados on your salad or serve with scrambled eggs in the morning. Blend peanut butter into protein shakes or have it as an afternoon snack.
Avoid eating sugary junk food to increase your calorie intake. Eating cookies, candy, donuts, etc. may help you gain weight, but not in a healthy way.

, If you're trying to gain weight and build muscle, you'll need to consume adequate protein to support your goals. Lean proteins (and greens) should be the cornerstone of your diet.


It's typically recommended to consume 0.8 g of protein per kilogram (your weight in pounds divided by 2.2) of body weight.However, some studies show this may not be enough — especially if your goal is to build lean muscle mass. On the higher end, consume about 1 g of protein per pound of body weight. You should never exceed this amount.A typical serving of protein is about 3–4 oz. Including a serving of lean protein at each meal and snack will help you meet your minimum goal and most likely provide you with an amount that's slightly higher than your minimum goal.
Focus on both lean and moderately high fat protein sources. Try including items like: poultry, eggs, low-fat or full-fat dairy, moderately lean beef, pork, seafood, or legumes.
Avoid high fat, fried, or processed protein choices. Items like fried foods, processed breakfast meats, or fast foods are not healthy options and should not be used to help you gain weight.

, Studies have shown that when you refuel with complex carbohydrates after a work out, it helps minimize muscle break down and can help increase muscle mass long-term.Eat a carb-dense snack 30 to 60 minutes before you work out as well. This will provide your muscles with fuel to power through your workout, keep your blood sugar level, and give you a head start on post-workout recovery.Healthy post-workout carbs include: fruit, mashed potatoes, whole grain breads or a whole grain bagel, dried fruit or yogurts.
Also include healthy sources of carbohydrates at your other meals and snacks. Whole grains, fruits, legumes and starchy vegetables all are great sources of essential nutrients in your diet. Include a variety of these foods each day.

, Although you may be focusing on protein and higher calorie foods to help reach your goal, it's still important to get in adequate servings of fruits and vegetables each day.


It's recommended to consume five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.Including a fruit or vegetable at each meal or snack can help you reach this goal.
One serving of fruit is considered 1/2 cup chopped or one small piece. One serving of vegetables is considered one cup, or two cups of leafy greens.

, You may want to consider drinking a protein shake during the day to help meet your daily protein goals but also to help build muscle faster.You can incorporate your protein shake at any point during the day. However studies have shown that if you consume a 20 g protein shake prior to your strength training workout, you'll have increased protein synthesis.You can also use your protein drink to help increase your total overall calories. You can mix it with higher fat milk, add in fruit, peanut butter, or even avocado to help boost calories.

, Starting a food journal may be a helpful activity to do when you're trying to gain weight. You'll be able to see exactly what you're eating and how that's affecting your weight.


Be realistic about your intake and write it down. Invest in a a food scale and measuring cups to help yourself be more accurate. These tools are extremely helpful when trying to determine how much to eat.
When you’re first starting out, it can be difficult to keep track according to your goals—especially if it’s a big change. Use your workout journal, or buy a separate one, to make yourself aware of how much and how often you’re eating.
Revisit your food journal if you're not gaining weight, losing weight, or gaining too fast. Make any necessary changes to your diet plan as needed.

, Once you get the OK from your doctor, consider meeting with personal trainer. The trainer may recommend a variety of exercises to help support your weight goal and fitness goals.


These fitness professionals have the job qualifications that can allow them to help you with your workout goals.
Talk to your trainer about your goals and ask how they can help you build muscle mass. You may even want them to set up a weekly plan for you.
You may be able to work with a trainer that is at a local gym or find a consultant trainer that works independent of gyms and fitness facilities.

, To increase your muscle mass, you'll need to work each and every muscle group.It's important to strengthen all muscles including your core, lower body, upper body, arms and chest.
You can choose to do three to four days of a total body workout. This is where you'd spend time working every major muscle group in one day. Ideally, you follow this with a rest day.
You can also do strength training on most days if you choose to work separate muscle groups each day of the week. Ensure you're not working the same muscle group two days in a row.

, Although working out regularly is essential to increasing muscle mass, having one to two rest days each week is equally important.


Much of your muscle growth and strengthening actually occurs during the resting phase of your work out.If you don't include regular rest days, then do not work the same muscle group two days in a row. For example, do not work arms and chest on Monday and Tuesday. Try doing arms and chest on Monday and legs on Tuesday.

, Keep track of the exercises you’re doing by keeping a journal of your workouts. This may help keep you motivated and also give you a guideline for your week.


This will ensure that you’re increasing weights during workouts. Also, it will help you keep track of what workouts you’ve done on what days. This is important because you need to include rest days.
In addition to tracking what you've done each day or week, look at how far along you've come and how far you still need to go to hit your long-term goals.

, There are a few studies that suggest using heavy weights for this exercise to maximize muscle mass and definition in your core.You use your abdominal muscles on a daily basis. Since they are used regularly, you'll need to increase the weight or resistance with your exercises to help increase muscle mass.
There is no set answer on whether you should do a few reps or do many reps for your abs. However, it's suggested to do the exercise until your muscles are very fatigued.
Make sure that you do slow, controlled exercises whenever you're working your abs.Don't forget to breathe!

, To gain muscle mass in your upper body, you'll need to include a wide variety of exercises to work the muscles in your chest and arms. Use a heavier weight and lower reps with these exercises:Overhead press
Incline bench press
Dips and pull-ups
Bicep curls

, To enhance muscle mass in your lower body, it's recommended to do isolation exercises first, followed by heavier strength training exercises.Incorporate some of these exercises with heavy weights and moderate reps:


Seated leg curl
Leg extension
Lunges
Dumbbell Step-Up
Barbell squat

, Whenever you're starting with new exercises or a new strength training plan, it's important to take it slowly at first.


Even if it's recommended to do very heavy weights at first, you'll fare better if you choose lower weights as you build up your strength and fitness level.
You may also need to include more frequent rest days if you're a beginner. This will help allow your muscles to rest and repair appropriately.
Plan to do about two weeks of strength training in which you gradually increase weight. After this period, you'll need to hit it heavy to gain significant muscle and weight. You can add more or longer rest periods, but you'll need to start working with the heavy weights to gain that lean mass you're after.

Explore your payment options prior to making an appointment.",How to Find a Reflexology Practitioner," Seeking advice from people you know and trust to find a reflexologist. It is important that you find a practitioner who feels right to you.;
, You need not limit yourself to seeking advice from alternative healthcare providers since reflexology is often employed in traditional health care facilities.

, There are several professional associations for reflexology. Their websites provide information on reflexology both locally and around the world. Links to trusted websites are provided at the end of this article.

, Some people will write an unflattering review because they have an axe to grind and some businesses have many reviews by family and close friends. It’s best to read between the lines of all ""unsolicited"" reviews with discernment. Look for a reflexology practitioner with at least five user-contributed reviews so that you can have enough comments to make comparisons.

,, Many day spas offer alternative healing treatments and can probably offer recommendations for a reflexologist even if they don’t offer that particular service. If a day spa does offer reflexology, make sure they employ certified reflexologists. Otherwise, you may end up receiving a simple foot massage and not a healing modality.

, You want to find a reflexologist who is certified, not someone who simply attended a weekend workshop. Ask them how many hours of reflexology training they obtained. A good reflexology certification program can require as much as 1,000 hours of training. Find out if the reflexologist you are considering has passed a national board exam. Nationally certified reflexologists have not only trained at an accredited institution, they have also passed a national board exam. You are likely to benefit more from your session if you choose a reflexologist who is nationally certified and experienced. Your time, energy and money will be wisely spent.

, For example, some reflexologists prefer not to use firm pressure. If deep pressure or gentle pressure matters to you, discuss your preferences with the practitioner before you schedule an appointment.

, In most cases, insurance does not cover private reflexology sessions. Occasionally reflexology is reimbursed under employee flexible healthcare plans, but you should double check your company’s policy to make sure. Be sure to discuss payment details with the reflexologist you have chosen before you schedule a private session.

Train with weights three times per week.,
Limit your cardio.,
Start with a brief warm-up.,
Do full-body workouts with increasingly heavy weights over time.,
Do 6-12 reps for your workout with short rests in between sets.,
Give your muscles rest.",How to Gain Muscles with a High Metabolism2," Getting the carbs and protein your body needs sets you up to build muscle, but in order to put those building blocks to work you have to train. There are generally two kinds of exercise: aerobic exercise like running and swimming, which gets your heart rate up, and anaerobic exercise like weight lifting – the second is what builds muscle.Aim for 3 weekly sessions of weight training; there’s no need to hit the gym every day.Start slowly so you don’t strain your muscles.


Talk to your doctor before starting a new workout regimen, especially if you have any medical issues or are over 40 years old.
Consider hiring a personal trainer to help you stay safe and motivated!If you go at it alone, always be safe with workout equipment. Know how they work before you use them, don’t use them under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and only use as much weight as is safe for you.
When pushing your limits of weight-lifting, always have a spotter.

, Aerobic exercise like running, biking, and swimming is great for losing weight and burning calories, which is not your goal. You don’t have to completely avoid cardio exercise, but keep it to a minimum. If you do go for a run, for instance, use a website or app to estimate how many calories you burned and try to make up for it.

, Take 5-10 minutes to do a short aerobic warm-up, like fast walking or a mild jog. Warm muscles are less likely to get injured than cold muscles.This small amount of aerobic work won’t burn enough calories to be a problem. At the very least, start your anaerobic workouts with light weights to warm your muscles.

, Aim for 45-60 minute workouts, and try to target all your muscle groups. Do sets of exercises with the heaviest weight you can use safely. Try to increase your weights weekly, if you can. Focus on exercises like these, against resistance (have a professional show you proper form to avoid injury):Military press
Squats
Deadlifts
Bench press

Barbell rows (while bent over)
Pull-ups
Chin Ups
Dips
Calf raises

, Ideally, try to rest for less than a minute in between your reps (a rep, if you’re just starting out, means doing one exercise one time, like one pull-up; a set is, for instance, 10 reps). Do 6-12 reps per set of each exercise.For instance, do a set of 12 reps of squats with 45 pounds of weight, wait a minute, then do a set of 10 reps with 50 pounds, wait a minute, then do 8 reps with 55 pounds, etc. Remember not to overdo it – aim to have your last set of reps use your maximum amount of safe weights.

, Don’t work out every day – your muscles need rest to heal and build. The healing is actually what causes muscle growth.Working out 3 days a week with days off in between is the right amount to increase muscle mass. More isn’t always better – take your rest days!

Get 8 hours of sleep or more every night.,
Make exercise part of your routine.,
Minimize your NEAT score, if necessary.,
Be patient with yourself.",How to Gain Muscles with a High Metabolism3," When you don’t get enough sleep, your body releases hormones that affect you in many negative ways – including building muscle. Prioritize sleep and try to get as close to 8 hours nightly as possible.While you’re sleeping is when your body gets the rest it needs to build muscle., Putting on mass requires dedication. A great way to dedicate yourself to your workouts is to set a schedule and stick to it. Get a calendar and mark which 3 days of the week you’re going to go to the gym or workout at home.


Remember to reward yourself sometimes! Some ice cream or pizza won’t hurt you every now and then, and rewarding yourself for hard work can help you stay motivated.

, NEAT, non-exercise activity thermogenesis, is the term for all of those small daily movements and activities that may just add up as calorie-burners. Fidgeting, walking, pacing, climbing stairs – most people don’t burn many extra calories at all, but if you do these things often throughout the day, you could possibly be burning up to 2,000 extra calories daily.If you truly struggle to gain weight, pay attention to your NEAT activities – you may be able to save yourself some calories.


If you pace or fidget because you’re nervous, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, or a few minutes of meditation. If your extra movements are just a habit, pay closer attention and be mindful. Sit with your feet planted firmly on the ground so you don’t tap your foot or shake your leg, and otherwise focus on keeping your body still and calm.

, Accept your body, especially if you are a teenager and are still growing. When you reach adulthood your metabolism and body shape may change. Remember that muscle gain is a slow process and takes dedication and time – keep at it, and you’ll get there!

Do the sumo deadlift with a medium wide stance.,
Do a partial, medium stance, sumo deadlift by stopping the lift at the kneecap.,
To have a complete deadlift motion and benefit from it:


Do the conventional deadlift from above the kneecaps.,
Do singles, doubles or possibly triples instead of a continuous repetition set with the medium stance deadlift to the knees.,
In between your singles or doubles, think about technique pointers:


Track your knees over your feet.,
Use footwear with lateral support such as cross trainers.,
Have in place a total body routine.,
Practice without weights, quick side to side moving from the deep crouch, like a crab, to top of your routine.",How to Do the Sumo Deadlift,"


Do not use the very wide stance: a slip or dropping the barbell on your foot could be disastrous. The very wide stance stresses the side, knee ligaments throughout the lift but the medium wide stance stresses the side knee ligaments at the top half of the lift
The very wide stance should be done only by competitive power lifters who are suited to it and understand the risks involved.;
, Squeeze the bar off the floor, holding it close to your shins and do the turnaround at the kneecaps. Do not pull the bar beyond your kneecaps to avoid side stress on your knee ligaments.

, You body will be extremely strong in this position, do more continuous repetitions. This is a smooth deadlift variation that is pretty to watch. Observe someone doing this lift in rapid fire, it looks like an optical illusion of that lifter doing a barbell bent over row and with his elbows constantly bending and extending. In reality, the arms do not bend at the elbows during any part of the deadlift.
Do the conventional deadlift from the floor. You must be able to apply power off the floor with the medium wide, sumo stance and with the narrower, conventional deadlift stance.
Expand your workout into Olympic weightlifting assistance exercises and do a clean shrug to involve the calf, shoulders, upper back and arms further. The clean shrug is a conventional deadlift and a bit more.
For a bit more athleticism or practicality, do some weightlifting or strongman lifts with light to medium weights. Use a barbell, dumbbell or an odd object such as a luggage, a small vehicle, a box, a person or a sand bag. Choose objects that will not hurt your foot, or damage the floor, if the odd object is dropped.

, For example if you are going to do six repetitions for your final deadlift set, do them as six singles or three doubles - it is very important to do the deadlift with good form.


If you must do a nonstop set, you will have to rest and catch your breath at the top or bottom position. At the top position, you will be hanging on to the bar for a couple breaths and a lot of your energy will be spent hanging on to the bar. If resting at the bottom position, you might put the barbell on the floor but still be gripping the bar. Even at the bottom position, it will be tiring to stay stooped and your form will deteriorate.
Do singles or doubles instead. Do a rep, put the barbell on the floor and stand up. While standing, go over the technical aspects of the lift and breathe deeply. After catching your breath do another single and repeat the process.

,
Keep your spine straight and neither slumped or arched.
Continually shrug your shoulders back. Practice shoulder shrugs from the different angles.
Drive with your hips but do not lead with them. While driving with your hips, also drive your torso back - which may seem futile but this effort is what keeps your form correct. When watching experienced dead lifters and squatters, it may look like the starting drive is with the legs only. This is a dangerous illusion - you could get a horrendous backache by leading with your hips and having to finish with a straight-leg deadlift.
Look forward, do not look down or to the side.
Keep the bar close to your shins to where the knurling could occasionally tear your sweatpants or scrape your shins.
At the start grip the bar evenly and check that the bar is correctly loaded.
Grip the bar fully. If your hands hurt, tense your hand muscles before gripping the bar. Grip the bar, in the meat of your palms, like you would be pressing it instead of pulling.
Explode at the start. After getting a grip on the bar you will be locked to it. Next, pull on the bar and explode. This is not yanking but a mustering of power to get the bar moving upwards.

, If using walking or jogging shoes, do not keep increasing the weight on the bar when your shoes start feeling springy. When using jogging shoes, use a medium - heavy weight at most and do more repetitions.

, Exercise all of your muscles even if just with obligatory effort. Besides all around strength, have flexibility, speed, endurance, skill and agility in your routine.

, Do jumping jacks and lateral, ladder drills also, but not all in the same workout.

Monitor your progress.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Gain More Muscle Mass and Strength1," As you start gaining strength and building muscle, keep track of how much weight you gain, how much weight you can lift, and what exercises you do from week to week. This will help you figure out what works for your body and what doesn't, and keep you from getting into a workout rut.


If you find that a certain muscle group doesn't seem to be making significant gains, switch up your exercises to see if something else works better.
Alter your diet as necessary to help you lose fat and gain muscle. Experiment with different ratios of protein, fats and carbohydrates to find a balance that helps you achieve your weight and fitness goals.;
, When you're in training mode, it can be hard to remember how important it is to rest between sessions. Your body needs time to repair itself after workouts. Don't push yourself too hard, or you may find yourself sitting on the couch with a pulled muscle instead of at the gym training to failure.


Sleeping well is another essential aspect of gaining mass and strength in a healthy way. Try to get seven to nine hours per day.

Choose a small medicine ball.,
Get in position.,
Trace the letters of the alphabet.,
Repeat with the other arm.",How to Do the Medicine Ball Alphabet Workout1," If you want to do the medicine ball alphabet workout to strengthen your shoulders, you need to work with a medicine ball that's small enough that you can palm it with one hand.Choose a lighter weight to start with, one you can hold with one hand with your arm extended and comfortably move with full range of motion in your shoulder.;
, To do the one-armed medicine ball alphabet workout, stand in a stable position with feet hip-width or shoulder-width apart. Check your posture and make sure your back and shoulders are neutral, not hunched.Lift the medicine ball with your right hand, and extend your arm out straight in front of you, just slightly to the outside of your body. Your arm should be a straight line from your shoulder with the medicine ball in your hand.

, Move the medicine ball as though you are writing the letters of the alphabet, using slow, controlled movements. It's generally easier to write the letters in cursive so there's a connection between each letter.By doing this exercise with one arm, you strengthen your deltoid and rotator cuff muscles. This can improve your posture and increase the range of motion in your shoulder.

, Once you've gone through the entire alphabet with your right arm, lower your arm and rest for a minute, setting down the medicine ball. Then pick the medicine ball up with your left hand and raise your left arm just as you did your right.Trace the letters of the alphabet with your left arm. This can be tricky if you're right-handed, because you don't have experience making letter shapes with your left hand. The key is to go slowly, and think of reversing the movement you made with your right arm.

Work out your legs with squats.,
Strengthen your back with deadlifts.,
Get bigger arms with pull-ups and chin-ups.,
Do bench presses to make your chest bigger.",How to Gain More Muscle Mass and Strength2," Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Either use a squat rack with a barbell or hold dumbbells in your hands over each shoulder. Lean forward slightly, keeping your head back, and bend your knees until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Do not let your knees go past your toes. Slowly rise to the starting position.


Do six to eight reps and three to four sets. Rest for about 45 seconds in between sets.

, For this exercise, you may either use a Smith Machine, a barbell, or two dumbbells. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and, using an overhand grip, slowly lower the weight down and return it to the starting position, focusing the work on your hamstrings and lower back.


Do six to eight reps and three to four sets. Rest for about 45 seconds in between sets.
To increase the difficulty of this exercise, bend at the waist, grasp the weights, rise to a standing position, then pull the weights up to your chest and press them over your head. Lower them back to your chest, then lower them to your sides, bend at the waist and rest them back on the floor.

, Place your hands on a fixed bar. For pull-ups, have your palms facing away from you; for chin-ups, have your palms facing you. Lift your body with your legs crossed behind you until your chin is higher than the bar, then slowly lower your body back to the starting position.


Do six to eight reps and three to four sets. Rest for about 45 seconds in between sets.
To increase the difficulty of this exercise, wear a weighted belt around your waist. Increase the weight as you gain strength.

, Lay on an exercise bench with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a barbell or two dumbbells in resting position at your chest. Press the weights over your head, extending your arms and straightening your elbows. Lower the weights back to your chest.


Do six to eight reps and three to four sets. Rest for about 45 seconds in between sets.

Weight train two or three times a week.,
Make your training sessions short.,
Train different muscle groups on different days.,
Train to failure.,
Use the right training form.",How to Gain More Muscle Mass and Strength3," When your goal is to increase muscle mass and strength, training every day is counterproductive. Your muscles need a chance to repair themselves in between training sessions. Without adequate rest periods, you won't achieve the body mass you want.


On the days when you aren't weight training, you can still be physically active. Do cardio workouts such as jogging, swimming, biking, or even power walking to keep yourself moving.

, There's no need to train for hours at a time — in fact, if you train for too long, you risk damaging your muscles, which can lead to a forced rest period. Your sessions should last from 1/2 hour to an hour.

, Rather than training your entire body during each session, it's a good idea to split up your muscle groups so that some parts of your body have time to rest while others are getting a workout. Create a training schedule and stick to it, so you don't accidentally overtrain a certain muscle group.

, Bodybuilders have found that training in short, intense sessions leads to greater mass and strength than easier, longer sessions. ""Training to failure"" means doing an exercise until you can't physically repeat it one more time. You'll need to find the appropriate train to failure weight for each of your muscle groups to do this effectively.


To find your train to failure weight, choose a weight you can use for six to eight reps before your muscles give out. If you can do 10 reps without breaking a sweat or feeling too fatigued, you need to add weight. If you can't even do one or two reps correctly, reduce the weight.
Attempting to lift too much weight before you've gotten strong enough to lift it can damage your muscles, and it's also counterproductive. Start with your appropriate train to failure weight and give your muscles time to build strength. Soon you'll find that the weight you've been using has become easy; when that happens, increase the weight by 5 or 10 pounds until you're back to the six to eight rep sweet spot.

, Another essential aspect of gaining strength and muscle is using the right form. If you don't, you'll risk injuring your muscles, and you also won't be training as effectively as you could be. Consider working with a personal trainer to learn good technique and keep these pointers in mind during your training sessions:


You should be able to complete each exercise using the right technique. If you can't press your dumbbells over your head with your arms fully extended, for example, then you should probably be using less weight.
Another option for difficult exercises is to begin with a reduced range of motion. Gradually increase your range of motion until you are able to complete the exercise's full range of motion. Do not increase the amount of weight you use until you are able to do this.
Don't use momentum to swing your weights into place. Lift with controlled, steady movements. Lower weights back to their starting position slowly rather than letting them drop.
Slowing down the eccentric (downward) portion of an exercise can help build muscle.

Eat a lot of protein.,
Get your calories from healthy sources.,
Supplement your diet.",How to Gain More Muscle Mass and Strength4," Muscles need protein to get big and strong, and when you're working on building them up every week, you'll have to fuel them with a lot of protein-heavy food. Be creative with your protein sources; not all of your fuel has to come from meat.


Chicken, fish, lean beef, lean pork and other meat products are excellent sources of protein. Other animal products like chicken or duck eggs are also good choices.
Almonds, walnuts, legumes, and other vegetables also contain protein.
Soy products like tofu can also contribute to your protein intake.

, Eating food that causes your body to produce fat will help you look big, but not strong. You want to decrease the layer of fat between your muscles and skin so your hard work becomes more visible.


Avoid eating fried foods, snack foods, fast food, and other high-calorie, low-nutrition food sources.
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other sources of healthy calories.

, Many bodybuilders help the process along by supplementing with a variety of different muscle-building products. Creatine supplements are a popular choice that has been shown to build muscles without bad side effects. The supplements are available in powdered form and should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before workouts for the maximum benefits.


Avoid supplements purporting to help you gain a certain amount of weight within a certain time period. Everyone's body is different, and products claiming to have magical muscle-building properties are probably a scam.

Choose a larger medicine ball.,
Get in the correct stance.,
Trace the alphabet.,
Make larger letters.",How to Do the Medicine Ball Alphabet Workout2," To use the medicine ball alphabet workout as a core exercise, you want a large ball that you can easily hold with two hands. The weight of the ball depends on your personal level of fitness, but generally should be between 5 and 15 pounds.Make sure the ball you choose is one that you can hold out in front of you with arms extended, and move it around without struggling. If you find your back hunching or your shoulders crunching inward, try a lighter ball.

, Do this exercise standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, or maybe a little wider. Firm up your quads and bend your knees slightly so they don't lock up – you want to keep a little bounce in your knees.Hold the medicine ball between both hands with your arms extended in front of you. The ball should be at about chest height.

, Engage your core, and start tracing each letter of the alphabet in cursive with the medicine ball. Typically you can keep the shapes better if you let your dominant side ""lead,"" but try to move your arms at the same time.Use your abdominal muscles to keep your torso as still as possible while your arms are moving around. Make sure you're not hunching over, and keep your back and shoulders neutral.

, To turn your medicine ball alphabet workout into a mobility challenge, increase your range of motion so that you're making larger letters in front of you with the medicine ball.Move your whole body to make the letters as large as you can. Imagine that you are also using your torso to write the letters as well.
You may want to start with a lighter medicine ball than you were using for the previous exercise, as the increased range of motion can be more challenging.

Trace the alphabet while standing on a BOSU ball.,
Incorporate a squat or lunge.,
Incorporate crunches.,
Use a heavier medicine ball.,
Do an ABC plank.",How to Do the Medicine Ball Alphabet Workout3," A BOSU ball is like a stability or exercise ball that's been cut in half. It has a ball side and a flat side. Turn the ball side upside down and balance on the flat side.It's best to use a BOSU ball while doing the stability version of the medicine ball alphabet workout, in which you're tracing smaller letters directly in front of you.
Find your balance standing on the ball, then extend your arms with the medicine ball in front of you. Wait until you've found your balance and are stable again before you start tracing the letters.

, When doing the medicine ball alphabet workout to improve your mobility, try tracing the letters from either a squat or a lunge position to increase the difficulty.If you use a lunge position, make sure you can do two sets so that you can lunge forward on each leg.
Make sure you're doing the squat or lunge with proper form. Keep your back straight and your shoulders neutral.
In squat position, make sure your knees are directly over your ankles so that your shins are perpendicular to the floor.

, Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet are flat on the floor. Hold the medicine ball in front of you and flex your core to bring your head and shoulders off the floor. Trace a letter with the medicine ball, then return to the ground.

, One of the simplest ways to increase difficulty with the medicine ball alphabet workout is simply to use a heavier medicine ball. However, be careful not to increase the weight too much. Make sure you can still do the movements with control.Especially if you are doing a one-armed medicine ball alphabet workout, you also want to make sure that the ball remains at a size that you can comfortably hold in one hand.

, While not entirely the same as the medicine ball alphabet workout, the ABC plank is a challenging strength-training exercise that will work out your entire upper body.Using a lighter medicine ball, place it on the floor in front of you and then get into a plank position with your forearms on the ball. You can do a plank either from your knees or your toes for this exercise.
Engage your abs, keeping your body in a straight line, your shoulders neutral. Using your forearms, draw the letters of the alphabet on the ball. Firm up your core and stabilize yourself so your hips aren't wobbling all over the place.
Start small. The larger you draw the letters, the harder the exercise will be.

Lie on the floor.,
Place your hands behind your head.,
Raise your legs.,
Touch your right elbow to your left knee.,
Now touch your left elbow to your right knee.,
Repeat.",How to Do Bicycle Crunches," Stretch your legs out straight and hold your arms outstretched at your sides. It's important to use the right form when you're doing the bicycle crunch - if you don't you won't be getting the maximum benefits from this exercise.






;
, You can interlock your fingers if you desire. If you prefer, you can keep your arms at your sides.








, Raise them so that your thighs are perpendicular to the ground, and your calves are parallel to the ground. Keep your feet together. This is called tabletop position.








, Now lift your head up and touch your right elbow to the left knee while pulling your knee up towards your head. At the same time, straighten your right leg, keeping it several inches off of the floor - similar to the motion you'd make while pedaling a bicycle.









As you lift your head, tense your abs. Use your abdominal muscles to crunch your body forward so that your elbow can reach your knee.
At the same time, tense your leg muscles and be sure to keep them bent or straightened correctly. Don't rest your feet on the ground.
Be sure to keep your elbows back, rather than bringing them forward toward your chest, which could strain your neck.
To increase the difficulty, try keeping your shins parallel to the ground throughout the exercise.

, At the same time, straighten your left leg, keeping it off of the floor. Don't forget to tighten those abs. You've now completed one bicycle crunch.








, Perform bicycle crunches in sets of 10-20 repetitions. Instead of counting crunches, you can also time yourself for sets lasting between 20 and 60 seconds. Rest between sets."

Know what press supports are and choose a press variation to do supports with.,
Choose a method to do your press support.,
Do supports correctly


Choose a time for your final set that you can easily do and work your way up over a period of months by adding 5 seconds each time.,
Warm up with at least two warm up sets of supports.,
Stop your cycle when you can no longer progress or want to progress.,
Tense your latissimus muscles to support upper arm on.,
Do not over-flex with your biceps as this will cause your elbows to pry apart.,
Use supports as:


A variation of your long term pressing training.,
Adjust your other exercises to the demands of doing your press supports.,
Add variety to your other exercises by doing the support versions of them.,
Have control over the weight, be careful not to drop it on the floor or your foot.",How to Do Press Supports," A press support is a static exercise done for time. You simply time yourself holding a weight in the press starting or ending position. The press starting position is at the shoulders and the ending position is where your arm(s) are fully extended overhead. This article is on the one dumbbell press support from the shoulder.;
,


Use the same weight and over time increase the time that you hold the weight at your shoulder. Increase the time gradually and use a clock with a second hand to time yourself. At each amply spaced workout increase the time by 5 seconds. When you have built up the intensity over several weeks, you will find it difficult to focus on anything other than what you are doing, and keeping track of your time is going to be a problem. Start your timed, press support when the second hand is on ""12"", or have a helper keep track of your time.
Use the same time and over time increase the weight on the dumbbell. Increase the dumbbell weight at the smallest increment and have ample rest between your workouts.
If you have a big yard, measure your press support by walking. Use a short distance for strength and a longer distance for fitness.

, At the beginning of cycle, a good starting time should be at least 15 - 20 seconds.
Choose a weight that you can easily do several repetitions with at the beginning of a cycle. Although press supports are easier to do than full range presses for the same weight, resist the urge to do too much too soon. Take it easy at the start of a cycle, after many workouts and increasing the time each time, you will have some challenging workouts and your breathing will be progressively labored.
Do press supports in the correct form. Shoulder the dumbbell using perfect form: lift the dumbbell as if it were heavy. When doing the support, keep the dumbbell in the press start position and if you are unable to do that easily - decrease the weight on dumbbell. Shoulder the dumbbell in place with two hands or with one hand cleaning motion - study the form of Olympic weightlifters. Do not copy the form of lifting from diagrams in workplaces unless you are lifting light weights, for example, do not shoulder (or put down) the dumbbell with your weight on the balls of your feet. Do not arch, round or twist your spine whether you shoulder or clean the dumbbell. Whether you shoulder or clean the dumbbell, choose one method and keep it consistent throughout your cycle. When lowering the dumbbell, with one hand, do it in a somewhat quick and controlled fashion. When watching others lower a heavy weight, in any lift, it appears that they are doing it merely fast - not so. Lower and raise the weight with control to avoid injury to your elbow, shoulder and back joints and muscles.

, For example, if your top set is to hold a 70# dumbbell for a minute, do: set 1 30# for 15 seconds and set 2 50# for another 15 seconds.

, Using the previous example and using a fixed weight of 70# for the top set, your final workout might have you supporting the 70# dumbbell for 2 minutes and 15 seconds, after 15 workouts of adding 5 seconds each time. If this cycle took 6 months, you have gotten a nice break from doing full range overhead presses.

, Before grasping the dumbbell, tense your hand, to cushion your palm and avoid the discomfort of supporting the heavy dumbbell.

, Maintain your starting position of your elbow angle and shoulder. If the dumbbell sinks too low, from the press start position, and you cannot keep it in the starting position: 1) stop the cycle: you lack the the strength and could hurt your shoulder, 2)repeat the workout the next time without adding time or weight, or 3)start a mini-cycle and work your way back to the resistance that caused your form to deteriorate.

, Always have a press in your training routine but vary your routine over time. For example: do press supports for 6 months, do press starts for another 6 months, do barbell presses for 8 months, do high repetition presses for 3 months etc.
A supplement to your full range pressing. Continue doing full range pressing at a reduced weight, such as 65-70% of your maximum. For example, if your want to break your personal record for the dumbbell press of 70# at 6 reps, reduce your full range pressing scheme to 50# at 7 reps. With the press support, gradually increase the intensity, and develop great endurance. After your press support cycle is over, blast thru your personal record by a rep or two (or a couple of pounds) with a full range press cycle.

, When nearing the end of a press support cycle and each workout, at that time, has you huffing and puffing and taxing your waist, back and shoulder muscles, decrease the effort on your other exercise for your shoulder, lower back, obliques and abdominal. For example, if doing crunches for your abdominal, decrease the amount of crunches you do to a minimum.

, Do exercises, that do not involve weights, in the support style. For example, crunches and chin ups held in the top position are calisthenics done in the support style.

, Use chalk and especially if you are perspiring a lot after doing a general warm up and specific warm up sets. Do the safer version using a barbell and in a power rack.

Work against gravity.,
Start slow.,
Maintain an exercise program.",How to Exercise for Strong Bones1," Weight-bearing exercises, which include anything that forces you to work against gravity, are among the best types of exercises to help build bone strength. Essentially if you’re supporting your own weight and moving around, you’re placing stress on your bones, and encouraging them to grow or maintain their strength. The best options for most people include walking, hiking, jogging, and dancing.Anything that keeps you moving up and down or side to side will help strengthen your bones. For instance, tennis, soccer, dancing, and more.
Choose an activity you enjoy. This will increase your desire and willingness to exercise consistently.
Examples of exercises that don’t require you to bear your own weight include swimming and cycling. While these exercises can help keep your heart healthy, and even strengthen your muscles, they are less effective in strengthening your bones.;
, Start doing a weight-bearing exercise as many days of the week as possible. Ultimately, you’re shooting for 30 minutes per day, but work up to this amount of exercise if you’re not accustomed to physical activity. Pay attention to the way your body feels and tone it down if exercise starts to be painful.If you've been living a relatively sedentary lifestyle, start with a daily ten-minute walk. Keep as brisk a pace as you are able for those ten minutes every day. Once you can comfortably walk briskly for ten minutes, start walking or jogging for fifteen or twenty minutes, and so on.
Muscle soreness, and even some moderate discomfort are entirely normal. If you experience soreness for more than 48 hours after exercising, however, decrease the duration or intensity of your exercise sessions. See a doctor if you have persistent pain in one location.
Stop exercising immediately if you experience chest pain, or noticeably irregular breathing or heartbeats. Talk to your doctor before exercising again.

, Keep increasing the duration and frequency of your workouts until you’re exercising for 30 minutes at least four times per week. Take a day off if you feel like you need to, but be sure to return to exercising the following day.If you prefer, feel free to split your 30 minutes of exercises into multiple sessions. For instance, a 15 minute jog twice a day is a good way to get in the habit of exercising consistently.

Consider strength-training exercises.,
Keep a strength-training schedule.,
Stretch after your workouts.",How to Exercise for Strong Bones2," Using weight machines, lifting free weights, and doing bodyweight exercises are all considered strength-training. Many studies over the years have shown that resistance or strength training can increase bone density, as well as influence risk factors for osteoporosis, such as balance, strength, and muscle mass.Bodyweight exercises can be a great way to get into strength training. For instance, get in the habit of doing a couple sets of push-ups before you get in the shower. To start, try to do two sets of five push-ups each. If you do some every day, you’ll be doing two sets of twenty push-ups in no time.

, If you find you enjoy strength training, it’s important to schedule your workouts to alternate working on different muscles. Train one muscle group at a time (upper body, core, and lower body), and rotate muscle group that you’re exercising roughly twice a week. Avoid exercising the same muscle group two days in a row.Keep a tangible or electronic journal to help you keep track of your routine, and to record your progress.

, Flexibility and balance are also extremely important to bone health. At the very least, follow up weight-bearing or strength-training exercises with stretching.In addition to increasing your flexibility and balance, stretching will also help you prevent injury.
Consider taking a yoga class and plan to try one out after one of your strength training workouts.

Encourage young people to exercise.,
Exercise extensively during your twenties.,
Slow bone loss after 35.,
Talk to your doctor about specific health complications.",How to Exercise for Strong Bones3," Your bones continue to develop up to your mid-twenties.However, young people are especially capable of doing the high-intensity exercises that encourage bone growth.Accordingly, encourage children and teens to do any sort of exercise they are interested in, especially weight-bearing exercises like most team sports.

, Your mid-twenties are the most important years for building bone mass that will last into adulthood. Accordingly, be sure to consistently do weight-bearing exercises at this age, both to strengthen your bones, and to increase the amount of time they are likely to stay strong.Gradual, natural bone loss begins to occur at around age 35.

, Keep exercising at least twice a week during middle age to slow down natural decreases in bone density. Great options for people in their thirties, forties, and beyond include brisk walking, stair climbing, or using cross-training machines or exercise bands.You can also include resistance training using your body weight, free weights, machines, or resistance bands.

, If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis or any other skeletal condition, know that some types of exercise may put you at risk for skeletal injuries. Further, if you have health problems—such as heart trouble, high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity— check with your doctor before you begin a moderate or intense exercise program of any type.For instance, ask questions like ""What type of exercises will help me safely maintain my bones' strength?"" or ""I've been thinking about getting back into golf. Is this safe, considering my condition?""

Make sure your straps are anchored well.,
Consider working with a professional.,
Give yourself more stability when you're first starting out.,
Try the exercises without suspension.",How to Do Suspension Training1," Before you try any exercises, make sure to follow any directions that come with your suspension straps. If you don't follow the directions, the straps could come loose while you're working out, which could result in you being hurt. They should be anchored well, usually to a door, a tree, exercise equipment, or the ceiling.You can buy suspension kits that come with what you'll need to anchor the kit into the wall. You may need a drill to install it.;
, While suspension training can work for many people, if you haven't been exercising much, you may want to work with someone who knows what they're doing. They can assess your level of fitness and help you do suspension training properly without injuring yourself. You can likely work with a personal trainer at your gym, if you have one., If you're new to suspension training, you can make it a bit easier on yourself. When you're doing moves standing up, you'd normally have your feet shoulder-width apart. Instead, try putting one leg behind the other, as it will give you more stability. You'll still get a good workout, but you'll have better balance overall.You can also adjust the angle of your exercise. For instance, you can move yourself a bit more upright if going farther down is too hard at first.

, Before trying an exercise in suspension, you may want to try it without suspension first to make sure that you are using the correct form. For instance, try doing a burpee without the suspension training before you use the straps, as it will help you understand the movement better before you make it more difficult.

Choose your starting weight wisely.,
Know your goal.,
Position yourself properly.,
Keep it smooth and simple.,
Don’t cheat yourself.,
Return and repeat.,
Look into variations.",How to Do Bicep Curls," If you’re trying to show off by lifting giant dumbbells, you’re likely only doing your body a disservice. Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue.Start small, and work your way up the dumbbell scale as your progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even one to three pound weights may be sufficient. Remember, do curls for health, not for show.If you are going to do two-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly.
Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form.;
, Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique).For muscle maintenance, a general guide is doing one to three sets of ten to twelve (or even twelve to fifteen) reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of six to eight reps may be preferable.Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with one set per arm and build up to three.

, Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. The overall goal is to isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal.In the standing position, keep your feet at hip width, with your knees slightly bent. Stand tall, with your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Keep your arms resting at your sides and your head looking forward — look into a mirror if possible to monitor your technique.
There are many variations for seated biceps curls, but for the basic maneuver, sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls.

, In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a biceps curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group.You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with one arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell.
With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward.
While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still.
Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder.
Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder.
Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction.

, Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell.

Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help.Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and / or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury.As mentioned earlier, don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps.

, When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift.Rest for approximately thirty to ninety seconds between sets, if you are doing more than one. If you are curling one arm at a time, simply keep alternating arms while allowing one to rest between its sets.Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down.

, While the basic standing or sitting curl is a simple, efficient, and effective biceps workout, there are numerous variations that you may find suited to your particular conditions or goals. So long as they limit unnecessary movements and keep the focus on the biceps, they should produce results. Mixing up your curls may also help keep you motivated and interested. Some of the many examples include:Incline Dumbbell Curls. Use the same arm motions as described above, but do so while lying back on a bench set at a 45-degree angle. Keeping your back against the bench will inhibit your ability to gain power or momentum from anything other than your arm.

As with a normal curl, keep your arm close to your body. Flaring your arm outward while lifting up can strain or damage your shoulder.


Hammer Curls. Instead of starting with your palm facing forward while holding the dumbbell, have it facing inward (toward your upper leg). As you lift, rotate your lower arm and the weight so that you reach the top of the motion in the same position as with a regular curl. Reverse the process on the downward motion.

For another variation of the hammer curl, start in the standard curl position (palms facing forward), but curl the dumbbell across your chest to the opposite shoulder. Cross it back over while lowering to the starting position.


Concentration Curls. Sit on a bench with your feet flat on the floor. Lean forward so that you can place your upper arm against your same-side inner thigh (thus the dumbbell in your hand is between your ankles. Place your other hand on the same-side knee for stability. Do the curl as normal, keeping your arm pinned against your inner thigh.

This variation helps further focus the movement to the arm doing the curl.


Zottman Curls. Start in the standard position, with your palm facing forward. As you lift, rotate your forearm and the weight so that when it reaches your shoulder, your palm is again facing forward (instead of toward your shoulder). Reverse the motion to the standard starting position. Keep your arm close to your side throughout the process.

This variation is basically a reverse of the Hammer Curl.

Start with five reps.,
Add five more reps and a set.,
Have an end goal of 20 reps.",How to Do Kegel Exercises for Men," While you are urinating, attempt to stop and start your urine stream. The muscles you use to do this are your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles you are trying to target.This method should only be used to find your pelvic floor muscles. It is recommended that you do not stop and start your urine flow regularly as this may cause a urinary tract infection.;
, Contract the anus muscles you normally use to prevent yourself from passing gas, or to hold in a bowel movement. These muscles are your pelvic floor muscles. To perform the exercise correctly, contract and release your anus muscles repeatedly.You know you are performing the exercise correctly when you feel a lifting or pulling sensation on your anus.

, Stand in front of the mirror. Try to lift your penis vertically while keeping your buttocks, abdominal and thigh muscles still. Use the mirror to focus on the pelvic muscles and to detect the use of any other muscles. Do this exercise repeatedly in front of the mirror.If you notice yourself tightening your buttocks, thigh or abdominal muscles, then stop the exercise and try again.

, Do this if you are having trouble targeting your pelvic floor muscles. Your doctor will be able to work with you and give you techniques to target these muscles. In some cases, doctors may use a technique called biofeedback training to help their patients isolate their pelvic floor muscles.Biofeedback training involves inserting a small probe in your rectum as you attempt to contract your pelvic floor muscles. This helps the doctor see which muscles you are using and how to target the correct ones., Lie down on a mat or your bed. Contract and hold your pelvic floor muscles for five seconds. Do this without contracting your buttocks, abdomen or thigh muscles. Then relax them for five seconds and repeat the exercise.Because it is easier to do kegel exercises while lying down, start out by doing them this way first if you are a beginner.

, Do this once you have perfected the movement while lying down. Sit up straight in a chair or stand in front of a mirror. Contract and hold your pelvic floor muscles for five seconds. Then relax them for five seconds and repeat the exercise., Each time you do a routine task, such as shaving, brushing your teeth, or sitting at your desk, practice contracting and relaxing your pelvic floor muscles. You can also do these exercises while reading or watching TV, for example., When you first start doing the exercises, start out slow by doing only five reps at a time. Do a set of five reps twice a day; for example, in the morning and at night. Do this five to seven times a week.Remember to breathe while you are performing the exercises. If you are having trouble synchronizing your breathing with the exercises, then count to five as you contract and hold your muscles.

, Do this after a week. So, on your second week, do a set of ten reps three times per day. You can do them in the morning, during your lunch break, and before you go to bed. Do this five to seven times per week.For example, contract and hold your pelvic floor muscles for five seconds and then relax them for five seconds. Do this ten times, three times per day.

, Eventually you should work up to a set of 20 reps three to four times a day, i.e., 60 to 80 individual exercises per day. Do this by adding five new reps and a set each week until you reach your end goal.Try doing a third while lying down, a third while sitting and a third while standing up.
Depending on your pace, it takes about six weeks or more to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.

Place a mat or towel on the floor.,
Elevate your upper body.,
Twist.",How to Do Russian Twists1," Place the mat near a couch or another piece of furniture that has a small, but big enough, space to stick your feet under. The resistance from the couch will stabilize your body while you do the twists. Lie down on the mat with your knees bent and place your feet under the couch.Alternatively, you can have a friend hold your feet down for you instead of the couch.;
, Your upper body should be at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Hold out your arms in front of you and clasp your hands together. Clench your abdominal muscles, pulling your bellybutton in toward your spine. This is the starting position. Make sure your spine is straight and not rounded.In this position, your upper body and thighs should create a “V” shape.
Your arms should be straight and fully extended in front of you, as well.
Keeping your abs tight engages the deeper transverse abdominal muscles, which will help protect your spine during the exercise.

, With your arms extended in front of you, twist your torso to the right side. Twist until your arms are parallel to the floor. Hold the position for a second or two and breathe out. Then, move back to the starting position and repeat the same technique for the left side. This is one repetition.If your shoulders begin to hunch while performing the exercise, re-straighten your spine.
Try to do three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. If this is too difficult, then do three sets of five to eight repetitions.

Do an inverted row.,
Try a body saw.,
Use the suspension to do a pushup.,
Work on a clock press.",How to Do Suspension Training2," Grasp the straps, and lean backwards so that your body is at an angle. Allow the straps to support your weight and keep your back straight. Your arms should be straight out in front of you. Tighten your core muscles, and use your arms to pull your upper body upwards. Lower yourself back to the floor, completing one rep.You can adjust the angle of your body as needed to increase or decrease the difficulty of this exercise. The more parallel you are with the ground, the harder the exercise will be.
Your strap should be at mid-body length.

, Lay face down on the ground with your feet pointed downward in the suspension straps. Lift your upper body up with your forearms flat on the ground. Your elbows should be just under your shoulders. Keeping your body straight and your forearms in place, hinge at the hips so that your buttocks lifts up slightly. This upward thrust is very subtle; basically, you just don't want your body sagging downward. Push yourself as far forward as you can go, then as far backward, which equals a single rep.Make sure to keep your back straight and your hips bending as you move forward and back.
The straps should be at calf-length.

, Start by facing away from the straps with your arms straight out in front of you in the straps. Keeping your hands in front of you, bring your torso down until it's about even with your hands, then push out your arms straight again, which makes one rep.When moving into the pushup, put your weight on the balls of your feet.
Try starting out more upright (less than 90 degrees), and moving down to 90 degrees as you get more confident.
The strap should be at about mid-body for this exercise.

, You'll likely need to adjust the straps longer for this exercise. A clock press is similar to a pushup in suspension, but you add an extra move. Face away from the straps. The straps should be in your hands, across the palms with your arms extended. Bending your arms, lean forward until your arms and upper body reach the point of the pushup where you'd typically be near the floor. Your upper body should be in line with your hands. Push one arm straight out to the side, and then bring it back in. Do the same with the other arm. Push back up into the standing position, straightening out your arms again.Your heels should be off the ground for this exercise.
Start out with just a gradual incline and work up to a greater incline as you gain strength.
Also, keep your elbows in line with the ribs and hands in front of the elbows. This exercise can cause shoulder injuries if your arms are fully extended out to your sides.
The straps should be at calf length.

Do a side plank with a hip raise.,
Exercise with a single leg lunge.,
Do a one-leg squat.,
Attempt a burpee.",How to Do Suspension Training3," With your feet in the straps and your toes facing downward, raise your upper body into a pushup position. Your arms and body should be straight. Lift your left arm upward toward the ceiling, looking in that direction as you do. Your feet should also twist slightly to the side you're turning. For one rep, push your hips up in the air, then return to the regular position.Keep your legs straight throughout the exercise.
The straps should be at calf length.

, Face away from the straps, about a foot in front of the anchor point. Slide one leg up and into both of the straps behind you. When you only need one strap for an exercise, you need to put your foot or hand through both handles. The sole of your foot will be angled towards the ceiling, and your knee should be bent. If you need to, have a chair nearby to hold onto for balance. Keeping your upper body straight, slowly bend the knee of your standing leg, and simultaneously extend the suspended foot backwards. The leg on the ground should be at a 90-degree angle, while your other leg should stretch out behind you. Return to standing and repeat.For this exercise, it's best to start with the handles hanging at a thigh height.

, Hold the straps out slightly in front of you with the straps in your hands and your elbows bent. Choose a leg to start with. Center your weight on that leg. The other leg can be on the ground next to your working leg, but most of your weight should be on the leg you're working. Squat down, keeping your torso back. You can use your other leg to help if you find yourself unbalanced, but keep the weight mostly on the leg you're working. Stand back up, and then do the other leg.You can also hold the straps above you if that's easier, but they'll need to be shortened.
Another version of this squat is the pistol squat. Instead of using your other leg to help balance yourself, stand on one leg, lift the other leg straight out in front of you, and then squat with the standing leg.
Place the strap at mid-body length.

, Another exercise you can do with suspension training is a burpee. Start standing up. Put one foot in the foot cradle (your foot will end up sole-up), and that's the leg you'll push through the burpee. The other foot should be touching the ground.Push the leg that's suspended backwards, until the knee is about 2 inches from the ground.
Place your hands flat on the ground, and jump your grounded leg back even with the suspended leg touching the ground with the ball of your foot.
Do a pushup in this position, then jump back into the air by pushing up from the ground with the leg that's grounded.
Make sure the strap is at mid-body before starting this exercise.

Lift your feet.,
Add a dumbbell.,
Do more sets or repetitions.",How to Do Russian Twists2," For this challenge, assume the starting position. However, instead of placing your feet under a couch or having a friend hold them down, lift them up off of the ground. Then, resume the exercise as usual with your feet lifted., When you are ready to add another challenge, use a dumbbell. Choose something light to start off with, for example, 5 to 8 pounds (2 - 4 kg). Instead of clasping your hands in front of you, hold the dumbbell straight out in front of you. Then resume the exercise as usual and don’t forget to lift your feet.Make this step even more challenging by using a medicine ball, or by increasing the weight of your dumbbell.

, You can always add more sets or repetitions to challenge your body further. Add more sets, but keep the number of repetitions the same, for example, four sets of eight to 12 reps. Alternatively, you can add more repetitions, but keep the number of sets the same, for example, three sets of 15 to 20 reps."
"
Consult your doctor.,
Stop your workout.,
Add more core exercises to your routine.",How to Do Russian Twists3," Russian twists place pressure and strain on your lower back; therefore, if you have lower back problems, you should consult your doctor before engaging in this exercise. Women who are pregnant should also consult their doctor before adding this exercise to their routine.In general, if you have health problems, you should ask your doctor which core exercises are safe for you to do.

, If you experience shooting pains in your back while performing this exercise, then you should stop the exercise immediately. Furthermore, it is normal to experience some muscle soreness in the 24 to 48-hour period after a workout. However, if you experience pain that is long-lasting, sudden, or sharp, then you should contact your doctor., Try side planks and side planks with a leg raise, single leg toe touches, and bird-dog crunches. These exercises are also intended to strengthen your abdominals and obliques, but they do not put as much strain on your lower back as Russian twists."

Start in the correct position.,
Step forward with your right leg.,
Push yourself back to starting position.",How to Do a Lunge with Arm Raise1," To start, stand with your feet hip-width apart. Your toes should be pointing forward. Stand tall with your shoulders down. Keep your core tight to help brace your spine.As you complete the exercise, keep standing straight with your chest up. Don’t lean forwards or backwards as you complete the lunge. Keep your shoulders over your hips.;
, To go into the lunge, you should step forward with your right leg. Your heel should be the first thing that touches the floor. When your heel is on the floor, lower your body until your front knee is at a 90 degree angle. Your right thigh will be parallel with the floor.Make sure your front knee does not go forward over your toes. Your lower leg, or shin, should be straight up and down, which places your knee behind the toes. If the knee pushes past the toes, it can lead to injury.
Your back knee should also be in a 90 degree angle and should never touch the ground. Only the toes of your left, back leg will be on the ground.
If you feel pain in your knees, take smaller steps. Making your range of motion shorter will help decrease some discomfort., To finish the lunge, push yourself back using both your thighs and glutes. Return to your starting position. Your feet should be hip-width apart, and your body should be straight.Lunges are a great exercise for your thighs and glutes, so you may feel the lunge in those muscles as you complete the move. If it is too painful or difficult, shorten the step you take.

"
"
Perform a basic arm raise.,
Try a lateral raise.,
Do a front raise.,
Hold weights in your arms.",How to Do a Lunge with Arm Raise2," To add an additional challenge to your lunge, add an arm raise. An arm raise can help open your upper body as you open your hips with the lunge. Step forward into your lunge. Then, lift your arms straight overhead.Your arms should be straight lines from your fingertips to your shoulders.
You can lift your arms at the same time you lunge forward for a simultaneous action.

, A variation for the arm raise is a lateral raise. In this move, you lift your arms out to your sides instead of overhead. To start, step into your lunge. Then, lift your arms out to the sides until they are at shoulder height. Keep your elbows slightly bent.Your arms should be parallel to the floor.
You can lift your arms at the same time as you lunge if you wish.

, Another variation for an arm raise is a front raise with your lunge. To complete, step forward into your lunge. As you step, raise your arms in front of you. Keep your palms facing the ground. Alternately, you can turn your palms so they are facing each other. Stop when your arms are slightly higher than parallel, about level with your shoulders.You can raise your arms at the same time as you step into your lunge if you wish.

, If you want to add an extra challenge, hold dumbbells as you complete your lunge and arm raise. Start with small weights, like five pounds. Complete the exercises the same with, just holding weights in your hands.Make sure to watch your lunge form as you add weight. You should still be able to complete the lunge with proper form even while holding hand weights. If the weight messes up your form, you should go back to arm raises with no weight.

"
"
Do a reverse lunge.,
Try a side lunge.,
Try a walking lunge.",How to Do a Lunge with Arm Raise3," Reverse lunges are a variation to the standard front lunge. To perform a reverse lunge, step back with your left leg until your toes touch the floor. Lower your body until your knees are at 90 degree angles. You should end in the same position as your front lunge. Push yourself back to a standing position.


Repeat with your other leg by stepping backwards.
The reverse lunge is almost the same move, but in reverse. Because you are stepping backwards instead of forwards, this can be a more difficult more for people.

, To perform a side lunge, step your right leg to the right. Shift about 70% of your weight to your right leg, and keep the other 30% of your weight on your other leg. Bend your right knee until it is at a 90 degree angle. Your left leg should be at a diagonal and with no weight on it. Your left foot should be flat on the ground. Push yourself back to standing with your right leg.You should have a distance of around two feet or 70 cm between your legs.
Switch to the left leg when you are done.

, To complete a walking lunge, step forward into your front lunge. When you push up, do not return to the starting position. Instead, bring your left leg forward by balancing on your right leg. Place your left leg on the ground heel first, and shift your body forward into a left leg front lunge.Each time you push yourself out of the lunge, bring the back leg forward into a lunge. You should be walking across the floor as you lunge.

Eat plenty of healthy foods.,
Drink water instead of juice or soda, even if it's diet.,
Get more sleep.,
Walk for about 15-30 minutes after dinner, before going to sleep.,
Do your cardio.,
Start walking.,
Make a workout routine.",How to Get a Hot Body," Avoid junk food like chips, cakes, pizzas, and ice cream. Your body will thank you. Eat foods high in protein and fiber, and remember to opt for smaller portions. Shoot for 3-4 small meals per day.


Fruits and, more importantly, vegetables will keep you from gaining the same gut you are losing doing all that cardio. Go for vegetables that have lots of color in them: beets, carrots, kale, tomatoes, spinach and broccoli. Combine them in a salad or eat them with hummus if you don't have a taste for them.
Don't starve yourself. Starving yourself will actually hurt your chances of losing weight, because your metabolism slows when it doesn't get food. (It's preparing to save more energy.) So eat regular, small portions if you want to lose that extra weight.;
, Although diet soda offers a ""zero"" calorie alternative to regular soda, it still interferes with weight loss. If you're serious about getting that body looking in tip-top shape, don't drink anything but water. Substituting water for every other drink will drastically lower your caloric intake.


If you don't know how to keep up with your water uptake, you should keep a water bottle with you and drink whenever you are thirsty. It may improve your complexion as well.
Cut alcohol out of your diet. This can be a tough one, especially if you're used to drinking that glass of red wine after you come home from work. Alcohol has lots of calories in it, especially those cosmos. So, even though a glass of wine may be healthy for you for other reasons, it's not the greatest way to slim down.

, Sleep is the third part of the puzzle for many looking to lose weight. Many women (and men) go obsessively to the gym, eat like vegetarian monks, and still don't see a reduction in their waist size. Getting a good night's sleep is an important part of shedding those extra pounds, so be sure you are getting 7-9 hours of sleep.


Sleep deprivation hurts your ability to lose weight.This because your body produces the glucose and insulin levels of some diabetics when you don't sleep! So depriving yourself of sleep is a no-no for healthy weight loss.
Less sleep kills your motivation to workout and eat well. We've all been there: It's the end of a stressful day at work, we're tired, and we have no energy to do the things we told ourselves we'd do at the beginning of the day. Getting a good night's rest helps keep you energized and motivated, so that when it comes time to hop on the treadmill, you'll have the motivation to push through.

, This walk is important because it will help your stomach to digest food properly and will prevent pyrosis or heartburn.

You can listen to music to keep you motivated.

, Cardio is great way to burn calories and get your body in shape. The goal is to get your heart rate going at a healthy clip so that it burns extra energy.


Start off running for half an hour a day for two weeks, or ride your bicycle at an intensive level. If you think you can handle it, jump into an hour a day for better and faster results.
If you run out of breath, it is ok to stop and rest for about a minute, but don't stop long enough for your heart rate to slow down.
When you are ready to stop, take a cool-down walk. Walk at a fast pace first then slow down gradually. Don't forget to stretch after your workouts.

, If you don't do anything else, get yourself to walk at least 15 minutes a day. Walking is a great way to exercise, and studies show that even 15 minutes can increase your lifespan by three years.So you'll live longer and look better to boot!


Take the stairs instead of the elevator when possible. Walking up stairs is a great way to work your leg and glute muscles.
Get a pedometer. A pedometer measures how many steps you take over the course of the day. People who wear pedometers tend to walk more than people who don't.
Find excuses to be outside! The more you're outside, the harder it is not to walk. Especially when it's nice out, eat lunch outside, take a walk after dinner, or walk your dog regularly in the morning.

, Working on the parts of your body you want to show off will better tone and define your muscles, which will make you look even better.


Warm up dynamically by moving all the joints, muscles and body parts you'll be working on through their full range of motion. Move around enough to increase your heart rate and temperature a bit. The exact motions or exercises you choose aren't so important as long as you are hitting all the right areas, just don't overexert yourself before your actual workout.
Begin with 50 crunches. You must do a proper crunch to get results. Always keep your hands across your chest. Lift up using your abs without relying on momentum. You shouldn't move your back when doing a crunch. Come down only until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Don't use the ground to bounce back into your next crunch.
Do as many push ups as you can do; push your limits as much as possible. Arms straight, bend all the way down, your bottom must stay in line with your body, not pushed up in the air.
Do squats and lunges. Try some simple bodyweight squats at first. From a comfortable standing position, hold your arms straight forward and lower down as far as you comfortably can, keeping your head level and your knees over your toes. Try to work your way up to 20 reps. For lunges, stand comfortably, put your hands on your hips and, engaging your abs, take a large step forward and lower your hips until both knees form 90 degree angles. Then return to starting position and repeat on the other leg. Try doing 20 reps, that is, 10 for each leg. You can make either exercise more difficult by holding onto some weights, just be careful not to increase the weight too rapidly.
Do the ""Superman."" Lie flat on the ground with you arms outstretched in front of you. Lift up your legs and arms and chest off the ground as high as you can. Hold this for 10 seconds. Then return to starting position and rest for 5 seconds. Then repeat. Do a total of 10 reps.
Do as many arm curls as you can on each side. This is a basic starting work out. Once you feel no burn until you pass 12 reps, increase the weight you lift slightly. The optimal amount of weight to lift is an amount you can lift at least 8 times, but begin to feel a burn before 12 reps.
After your workout pick out some stretches, but always use a hurdle stretch and a saddle stretch to increase flexibility. Try using stretches that simulate what you would be doing when you do exercise. This will get your muscles ready for the real work.

Aerial work targets the upper body and core, so focusing on those areas will help to get your ready and prevent injury. Try leg lifts, pull-ups and horizontal rows. Invest in an at-home pull up/ chin up bar that you can practice on. It will improve your strength for climbing and holding yourself up in the future. , No one should learn aerial silks on their own. It's extremely dangerous, and you could get seriously injured. The below steps should only be used to refresh your memory and practice in conjunction with a class. If you can, try and invest in private lessons. It's best to work one on one., Aerial silks use your muscles extensively. You want to have them stretched sufficiently before each class and practice session. Not only should you warm up your shoulders, arms and hamstrings, but it's also important to stretch out your hands. When stretching, also work on your straddle. You'll need this for future reference.,
Take your muscles through their typical range of motion with stretching exercises such as arm, shoulder and neck circles, rolling your spine up and down, shaking out fingers and wrists, up-dog, down-dog and the electric slide.

Climb the silks.Take the silk in both of your hands and wrap your strong-sided lower leg once around the silk.

,
Pull up with your arms, and bring your legs up with you.,
Put your free foot on top of the silk.,
Stand up, and continue climbing until you've reached your desired height.,
Learn the single foot tie-in.,
Climb down carefully.",How to Do Aerial Silks2,", Climbing is first and probably the most difficult trick for a beginner since the body is probably not used to such actions. But with the passage of time, it becomes easier to climb the silk.


When you are pulling the silk, your arm should be sturdy and firm. Your grip on the silk should be stable so that you can concentrate on the movement of your lower limbs.

, That way it won't slip, and you're not supporting yourself with just your arms. This requires a lot practice and stamina because it also involves your mental strength.

, You will want to remain near the ground until you've mastered the techniques.

, The basic move is easier to practice on the ground. Wrap your lower leg around the silk as if you were going to climb. Pull some slack out of the silk from about mid-shin, and loop it under your foot so it looks like you're wearing a shoe. Your toes and heel should not be in the silk.

, When coming down from a climb, walk yourself down slowly, hand over hand. If you slide down, you'll get painful second-degree burns on the top of your feet. Also, don't let go until you're at least only a foot off the ground.

Tie yourself in either from the ground or from a climb.,
Separate the two silks so you have two clearly visible pieces.,
Lean forward through the silks, so your body is in front of them.",How to Do Aerial Silks3," Separate the silks. Because the silk is hung from its middle, it hangs down with two separate pieces. When you're tied in, it looks like one., Grip the separate silks so your elbows are level with the top of your head.

, Either extend your free leg in front of you, or bring it up to your knee in a jazz passe. Try to make it look as pretty as possible.

Begin with a single-foot tie-in.,
Separate the silks.,
Lean against the other silk and grip it above your head.",How to Do Aerial Silks4," You can perform the half-moon from a climb or on the ground.

Squat down so your knees point outward.,
Lean forward, and gravity will pull you upside down.",How to Do Aerial Silks5," Next swing your upper body through so that the silks make a V down your torso., It's easier to do this move from a climb instead of from on the ground.

, This is a very relaxing move.


Flipping upside down makes the Half-Buddha more dangerous than the others, so make sure you're ready and be careful.

Plan outdoor activities.,
Train for a big event.",How to Exercise with Friends1," Becoming exercise buddies is a big commitment. You will be spending time together each week for long stretches of time. The two (or more) of you should enjoy each other's company, and commit to supporting and motivating each other. You will have to know that this will make a very close bond between you and the workout friends, since you are sharing the same physical exercise.Sometimes the best workout partner isn't your closest friend. Ask people with similar schedules and an interest in similar activities.;
, When deciding which friends you should work out with, think about fitness level. If you are going to go to the gym together, use the machines, or visit classes, people of any fitness level will be okay.If you want a running buddy, don’t choose someone who runs marathons if you are working towards a mile or 5k. Instead, find someone roughly around your level who can progress with you.

, Meet beforehand and decide together what kind of workouts you'll be doing. It helps to find shared fitness goals (such as strength training or weight loss), so you can workout on the same types of activities.That said, some people enjoy attending the gym together even if they do entirely separate workouts.


For example, you may decide to focus on aerobic activities only, like walking, running, cycling, or swimming. However, you may want to add in strength training or yoga for stress relief and flexibility.

, Part of the benefits of exercising with friends is that you have people to keep you excited about working out. This means you should work out more than once each week. Come up with a schedule that works for all of you.


For example, you may be able to meet three days each week after work, or try for five days at different times because of schedules.

, Milestones give you a goal and a way to measure your progress. Milestones can also help you stay motivated. When you reach a milestone, make new ones.For example, if you and your friend(s) are training to run, you might set a goal of running a mile or 5 K in a certain amount of time.

, Though you will have a schedule, life isn’t always predictable. Expecting the person to be able to do the same time each week for years isn’t realistic. Instead, be prepared to adapt according to schedules, conflicts, or life changes.For example, if you usually work out in the morning, but your friend gets a new job where they have to go to work earlier, then you may need to start working out at a different time of day.

, Hiking, cycling, and similar forms of outdoor exercise are safer with other people, not to mention more fun. Brainstorm activities you wouldn't do alone, such as a weekend ski holiday or a canoeing trip that requires portage.

, Goalposts are a great motivator. If you share a passion for the same types of exercise as your workout friend or friends, consider training for an event. This could be running a marathon, hiking a multi-day trail, or even a grueling team challenge such as the Tough Mudder.

Motivate each other.,
Agree to meet for a workout.,
Give up your excuses.,
Try new activities.,
Share your thoughts and feelings.,
Create exercise routines for each other.",How to Exercise with Friends2," Working out with a friend gives you a built-in cheerleader. You both are sharing similar workouts and goals, so you can provide support when the other is feeling down. Cheer your partner on, and they'll do the same for you., One of the best things about exercising with a friend is having someone hold you accountable for showing up to a planned workout. Whether you are meeting at a gym, the track, a park, or someone’s house, you have someone who depends on you to be there.Don’t wait to the last minute to plan your workout. Make a schedule of days that work for you and your friends. If you can’t plan multiple days at once, schedule the next workout as soon as you finish one.

, It’s easy to come up with excuses about why you can’t work out, whether they're real schedule conflicts or invented stories. Hold each other accountable so you stop making excuses and make time for the workout.If you are too tired, rely on your friend to motivate you. If you’re too busy, your friend can offer suggestions on how to reorganize things to prioritize your workout.

, Having a buddy by your side can give you the confidence to try new activities. If you have to go into a class by yourself, you may never walk through the door, but having someone with you can make a new activity less intimidating.For example, you may have always wanted to try a zumba, weightlifting, spin, or boxing class. Having a friend with you can help you get over your nerves or discomfort and try something new.

, Exercise buddies offer the chance to bond and become closer with the people you are exercising with. Often, people who exercise together talk about their days and lives. An added bonus is that you can share your frustrations and feelings.Long walks, hikes, or training sessions give you opportunities to vent your frustrations, but try not to stress out your workout buddy. Find the balance between talking and listening, and don't make every workout a high drama event.

, Have fun by coming up with workouts for each other. This can help you push each other and keep the workouts fresh and exciting.If you know your friend wants to improve upper body strength, come up with a routine with pushups and dumbbells. If you know your friend likes to hike, choose a hike with some built-in added exercises like sprints or bodyweight moves like lunges, push ups, or dips.

Use a medicine ball.,
Try bodyweight partner exercises.,
Perform alternating moves.,
Try partner intervals.",How to Exercise with Friends3," Medicine balls are great for partner workouts. There are multiple exercises you can do using a medicine ball. Choose a weight that is challenging yet not impossible for both of you.Throw the ball back and forth, catching it with arms that are extended but not locked at the elbow.You can also train your balance by standing on one leg during this exercise.
Stand back to back and lower into a squat. Staying in the squat, have one partner hold the medicine ball as they rotate at the waist to hand the ball to the partner. The partner takes it and twists to hand it back to the partner on the opposite side. Do 10 reps in one direction and then switch.
Lie on the floor with your knees bent and your feet between each others. One partner will hold the medicine ball as both people do a sit up. When both partners are up, pass the ball to the other person, then return your back to the floor.

, These are a great opportunity to make use of a partner. A bit of competition helps motivate you, but there's also a high level of support as you aim to keep each other going through the reps, sets or intervals.Get on the floor facing one another. Do either a regular pushup or a modified one on the knees, spaced so your heads are almost touching. Once you push back up, reach out your right hand and tap the other person on the left shoulder. After the next pushup, tap on the opposite shoulder. Try 10 reps.
Stand facing each other or side by side in opposite directions. Lower down into a squat and then instead of coming up slowly, jump through your heels in an explosive movement. When you are in the air, high five your partner. If you are facing each other, slap both hands. If you are side by side, just clap the inside hands together.

, Alternating bodyweight and cardio moves can be a great way to do a high intensity partner workout. These exercises generally have two movements. Each partner does a different movement for around 20 to 30 seconds and then switch. Try 10 reps of each movement.One partner lowers into a squat and hold it for thirty seconds. The other partner does high knees, a move where you quickly bring your knees up as high as you can as if you are running in place. You may also do butt-kickers, which is where you quickly try to bring your heel to your glutes as fast as you can. After 30 seconds, switch.
One partner holds a forearm plank, supporting themself on elbows and toes and holding their body as straight as possible, keeping the core tight. The second person does crunches while the person in forearm plank position holds their feet.

, Partner intervals are a good way to make exercise at solitary gym machines more interactive. One person uses the equipment for a certain number of reps or a certain length of time, while the second person spots. Switch places and repeat until you hit your goal of a certain number of rounds or length of time.


For example, spot your partner at the squat rack while they do five squats. Switch places and repeat until each person has done four sets.
Partners are especially useful in weight training. Many weight training exercises require a spotter, including bench presses, pec flies, and any exercises on the squat rack.

Do pushups.,
Try an inverted row.,
Perform a dip.",How to Do Bodyweight Exercises1," Pushups are a great bodyweight exercise you can do anywhere at any fitness level. Pushups primarily work the chest, shoulders, and triceps. You can modify to make them easier or harder, or try different types of pushups to emphasize certain muscles.








To do a traditional pushup, start by laying on your stomach on the ground with your hands underneath your shoulders. Push yourself off the ground so you are holding yourself up on your toes and hands in a straight line. Do not sag or arch your back.
If you are unable to do that, you can modify by doing pushups on your knees instead of your toes. You can modify even further to do pushups against a wall or a table.
The placement of your hands can alter the muscles you work. If you place your hands right beside your chest instead of further out, you get a different workout. You can also form a diamond with your fingers under your chest to work different muscles.;
, For this exercise, you need access to some kind of bar, like a pull-up bar. You can also use a hand railing or a towel wrapped around a pillar. Position yourself under the bar and hold on with your hands facing away from you. Your body should be in a straight line. Use your arms to pull yourself up until the bar touches your chest, then lower yourself in a controlled motion.If you are using a hand rail, tuck your feet under the railing, then pull your torso towards the rail.
If you are using a towel or strap wrapped around a pillar or column, stand with your feet touching base of pillar. Then lean backwards holding onto the ends of a strap or towel, then pull yourself back to upright.
If they are too difficult, move your feet back so you are not lying as flat. As you improve, you can move lower.

, You can do dips with any surface you can push yourself off. You can use a chair, a bench, or a machine at the gym. Start by lowering yourself in front of the chair or bench with your hands on the edge behind you. Make sure your hands are around shoulder-width apart. Lower yourself down until your elbows get to a 90 degree angle, then push yourself up until your arms are straight.You can make the dips harder or easier by the placement of your feet. The closer your feet are to your body, the easier they will be. Keep your legs straight to make the movement more difficult.

Ensure your computer is set up ergonomically.",How to Exercise While Using Your Computer1," Check the Ergonomic Guide at ergo.human.cornell.edu/ergoguide.html to see how your desk compares to the recommended set up. Updating your positioning to be ergonomically correct may be even more important than exercising at your desk in the long run, because you can prevent back pain, eye strain and repetitive stress injuries.


The most commonly ignored ergonomic rules include placing your monitor at eye level, sitting at a slightly reclined angle with your feet flat on the floor, placing your keyboard flat and using lumbar support. Also important is taking micro breaks where you frequently stand and walk around in order to relax your eyes and stretch your muscles.

Go on a group hike.,
Take a group fitness class.,
Play a group sport.",How to Exercise with Friends4," If you have a large group of friends, you can get everyone together to go on a hiking trip. Hikes are great exercise that people of different fitness levels can enjoy. They are also a good way to get a lot of people together and exercising.


You can choose a nearby state or local park to visit.
Make it a weekend trip by getting everyone together to go camping or stay in a cabin near longer hiking trails.

, Group fitness classes at gyms or studios generally allow up to 30 people per class. This means you can get a group of friends together and take an exercise class together. You may want to try spin, zumba, yoga, pilates, or weightlifting.


The number of people per class may vary from gym to gym.

, One of the best ways to exercise with your friends is to go to the park and play a group team sport. When playing with friends, you don't have to worry about whether you are good or not. Instead, you are playing for fun and to be active.


You may want to try different sports every week. Try baseball, basketball, flag football, rugby, field hockey, soccer, kickball, or croquet.

Do a lunge.,
Try a squat.,
Work on calf raises.,
Perform a step up.",How to Do Bodyweight Exercises2," Lunges are a great bodyweight exercise for fat-burning and strength training. To perform a basic lunge, step forward and bend your leg until both knees are at 90 degree angles. One leg will be in front of you, the other behind you. Step your front foot back to the original standing position. Then repeat the same movement with the other leg.









Your knee should always be directly over your foot, and never extending beyond it. This can lead to injury.
You can modify the exercise to emphasize different movements and muscles. Try a reverse lunge, side lunges, curtsy lunges, or even walking lunges.

, Squats are an effective lower body exercise that almost anyone at any fitness level can do. They are also easily done no matter where you are. To squat, start with your feet hip-width apart. As you lower your body, make sure you push your hips back as you bend your knees. Keep your chest lifted. Your weight should be in your heels. Squat down as far as you can, preferably until your lower body is parallel with the floor. Hold for a moment, then slowly stand back up.









Lift your arms as you squat to help keep your balance.
Avoid letting your knees go forward over your toes. This may lead to injury.
If you are not very flexible through the hip and pelvic area, you may not be able to go down as far as others. This is okay. Focus on form and work on improving your flexibility as you perform squats.
You can add dumbbells to make squats harder, try plie squats, or try one-legged squats. You can also try split squats by holding one leg out in front of you and balancing on your other leg then lowering the body down to a seated or nearly seated position.

, Calf raises strengthen your calf and lower legs. You can do this on the floor or place a board or mat under your feet that adds two to three inches. Place the balls of your feet on the additional lift if you are using one. Your heels should be flat on the floor. Slowly raise your heels off the ground. Then, slowly lower back down.Try single leg calf raises to really increase the work of the calf muscles. Lift one foot behind you and lift the heel of your other leg.

, Step ups are an exercise in which you step up onto a box, step, or bench. Start on the floor, then lift your right foot onto the bench. Make sure the foot is fully and securely on the bench. Then, place your weight in your heel as you lift your body and left leg onto the bench. Then, lower the left foot back to the floor, then your right foot. Repeat the movement again, starting with the left leg.To modify, you can make the platform shorter or taller.

Do a plank.,
Try bicycle kicks.,
Perform Russian twists.,
Try scissor kicks.",How to Do Bodyweight Exercises3," Planks are a great bodyweight core exercise. They work the abs and core muscles, along with the legs, glutes, and shoulders. To perform a plank, lie face down on the floor. Push yourself slowly onto your elbows and toes. Pull your core in tightly and hold for as long as you can.









Make sure to keep your neck and head in line with your back — do not sag or round your back. Your shoulders should be right above your elbows. Keep your hips down.
To modify, drop your knees to the floor.

, Bicycle kicks work all the core muscle groups. Start by lying on your back. Rest your hands behind your head, but do not pull on the head — simply cradle it in your hands. Bring your knees up, bent at a 45 degree angle, and then go through a bicycle pedaling motion, pushing your feet out and rotating them slightly. Make sure your core is pulled in and engaged.


Then, bring the opposite elbow to the opposite knee. You will be twisting your core to make these two meet. Then, return to center as you pedal your legs and twist your other elbow to the opposite knee.

, Russian twists focus on the external obliques, which help with the rotation of the body, along with the transverse abdominis and rectus abdominis. To do a Russian twist, sit with your knees bent. Lean your body back about halfway to the floor, keeping your abs tight, then twist to the right as far as you safely can. Make sure the position of your torso doesn’t change. Then, twist to the left as much as you can. That is one rep.


To make the exercise harder, hold a dumbbell or medicine ball as you twist. You can also lift your feet off the floor for an added challenge.
To make it easier, sit up closer to a 90 degree angle. The farther you lean back, the harder the exercise will become.

, Scissor kicks work the transverse abdominis and help strengthen the lower back. Lie flat on the floor. Keep your head, legs, and buttocks on the floor. Pull your abs in and lift one leg while holding the other slightly above the floor. Lower your leg as you lift the opposite leg. Continue this scissoring motion, trying to keep your legs from touching the ground.


Try to keep your legs as straight as possible. You can go as fast or slow as you want.

"
"
Do a burpee.,
Try jump squats.,
Perform mountain climbers.",How to Do Bodyweight Exercises4," Burpees are a good bodyweight exercise. They work muscles in the arms, legs, and core. Burpees are difficult, but they can be modified for every fitness level, and then you can work up to more challenging ones.









To do a burpee, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower into a squat, and then bend forward and place your hands on the floor. Kick your legs back so that you end up in a plank position. Next, jump your feet back under you towards your core. Lift yourself back into a squat. Jump as you hold your hands above your head.
Make sure you keep your core engaged throughout the entire movement.
Add a pushup to the burpee for additional bodyweight exercise.
If you are a beginner, instead of jumping, you can slowly straighten your legs behind you into the plank position and then slowly pull them back in one at a time.

, Jump squats are a version of the traditional squat. They add intensity to your workout, along with cardio training. To do a jump squat, start with your hands behind your head as you lower into the squat position. When you get into a squat, jump up by pushing through your hips and driving through your heels in an explosive movement. Try to jump as high as you can. Land with your knees bent and go back into a squat movement.Make sure to maintain your proper squat form. Make sure your knees never get in front of your toes and that you keep your weight in your heels.
You can turn this into a tuck jump by pulling your knees as high as you can when you jump up.

, Mountain climbers work your legs, arms, and core, so it’s a good overall bodyweight exercise. To perform a mountain climber, start in the plank position, drawing your abs in tight. Pull one knee in until it is bent under the hip. Push the knee back with as much power as you can until the leg is straight and your weight in on your toes. Do the same with the other knee. Alternate each leg as you continue the movement for as long as you can.








You can modify this exercise to bring your knee towards your opposite hip, making it a mountain climber with a twist.

, Scan the edges of your vision in a circle for 2 minutes. Breathe while you keep your eyes moving around the room in a fluid motion.

, Place cupped hands in front of your eyes, making sure the palms do not directly touch the eyes. Stare into your palms for 20 to 30 seconds, until your vision becomes darker.


When you see almost complete darkness, you will know your eyes are relaxed and you can continue. Studies have shown that eyestrain and visual stress place you at a risk for glaucoma. A few eye exercises or resting periods each day can help to reduce the risk.







, Lower your neck so that it almost sits on your right shoulder. Breathe deeply and roll your neck from your right shoulder, past your collarbone to the left shoulder.


Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times in a slow, fluid motion.







, Allow the toes to curl until they are at a right angle to your feet. Hold for 10 seconds and repeat if necessary.

, Repeat the motion for 15 seconds and then switch to a counter-clockwise motion.

, Breathe deeply and raise them slowly until they are straight up in the air. Raise 1 hand a time, as if you are trying to pick apples of a tree, then lower it and raise your opposite arm.


Repeat 10 times with each arm before slowly lowering them to the ground. On the last 2 repetitions, when you are done with your ""apple pickers,"" lean back in your chair. Gently arch your back and take your arms back as far as they can go.







, Place your palm down and push down gently on the top of the wrist with the other hand for 10 seconds. Place your palm face up and push gently on the tops of your fingers with the other hand.

If possible, do these exercises 3 or more times per day to noticeably firm your muscles and improve your posture. Try to do this list of exercises throughout the day, devoting more time and repetitions to your weaker muscles.







, With your hands typing or resting on the keyboard, squeeze your shoulder blades together for 3 seconds. Relax for 1 second and repeat 10 times.

, Sit on the ball with your back straight and your feet hip width apart, a few inches away from the ball. Do this for 10 to 20 minutes at a time, and then return to your desk chair, to avoid injury from overworked muscles.


Overuse of an exercise ball as a desk chair can do more harm than good. Core muscles need to be engaged for short periods and then rested. Tired muscles can lead to bad posture or a muscle imbalance. Try to use the ball for 3 periods of 10 minutes each day, and slowly work up to using it for a longer period of time.







, Push your head against your palms, as your palms resist the motion. Hold for 10 seconds.

, Push your head backwards against your palms, as they resist for 10 seconds. Repeat this exercise 3 to 5 times to tone your neck muscles.

Think about things that make you happy and relaxed before you go to bed.

,
Go to the toilet before bed!",How to Feel Great in the Morning," Bend over and touch your toes. It is good to hold a stretch for at least 10 seconds. You should push yourself to feel tension, but not pain. If you need to, you can do this sitting down as well!;
,,, You don't have to do lots; just a few to get your blood circulating.

,, On a step, stand with just your toes on the step, with your weight pushing down. Let your feet relax and your toes will get pushed up. You should feel tension in back of your lower legs, called your calf muscles.

, This is a good thing. Make sure to eat something clean and healthy. Fruits, or simple proteins work best in the morning. Eggs, cheese, yogurt, or cottage cheese are good options for morning meals. Avoid eating a large portion or heavy carbs.

, During the day, if you can, try to drink a few bottles of water, and at the end of the day drink another 2-4 glasses with dinner, etc. This may seem like a lot at first, but your body actually does need 8-10 glasses of water to stay correctly hydrated. You may have to use the restroom more than usual when you first start. This is only temporary! As your body gets used to having all the water it needs, it will absorb into your system and your restroom visits will return to normal.

, Meditation, or deep breathing exercises, for at least 5 minutes each morning can help facilitate a fresh mindset for the day and relieve the burden of unwanted tensions and anxieties. Just twice a day is all you need, once before bed is shown to clear the mind for sleep, and when you wake up - to set your fresh mind for the day.

, You must get a good sleep!

Choose the correct chair.,
Do the sit to stand exercise.,
Build arm strength with a triceps dip.,
Adapt gym exercises.,
Try chair aerobics to get your blood pumping.,
Use chair yoga or tai chi to increase your flexibility.",How to Exercise If You Have Limited Mobility1," When you do exercises in a chair, make sure the chair is stable and you can put your feet flat on the floor with your knees at a 90-degree angle and your thighs parallel to the floor.If you're in a wheelchair, make sure you apply the brakes or otherwise immobilize the chair before you begin exercising.;
, If you have limited mobility, start from a chair with this basic exercise. As the name suggests, all you do is sit in a chair, stand up straight, then sit back down again.Sit up straight at the edge of the chair with your feet flat on the floor. As you stand, try to keep your knees directly above your ankles.
Start off with 10 repetitions of this exercise.

, For this exercise you'll need a chair with arm rests. Resting your feet flat on the floor, grip the arm rests and extend your elbows to raise yourself off the chair.Lower back down with a slow, controlled movement – don't simply drop back down into the chair.
Do 10 repetitions of this exercise to start, making sure you keep your feet flat on the floor.

, If you need to exercise in a chair, that doesn't mean you can't lift weights. Many strength training exercises you normally would do on a weight bench or with dumbbells can be modified for a chair.If you're interested in starting with a class, check in your local area for a gym that offers wheelchair strength training or weightlifting classes. You also might be able to find some videos you can follow online.

, Even if you're in a wheelchair, you can still get cardiovascular exercise with chair aerobics, which involve a series of upper body and arm movements.Your local fitness center or health club may have chair aerobics classes. You also might check at your local community center or even a senior care facility.

, Yoga and tai chi improve your physical strength and flexibility as well as your mental balance. These practices have been adapted so that people with limited mobility can still participate.Look for chair classes in your area. Retirement communities can be a good place to look. You also might ask a local instructor if they're aware of any classes nearby.

Work with your doctor or physical therapist.,
Start with a warm-up.,
Choose exercises related to your daily life.,
Train opposing muscles.,
Start slow.,
Add weight gradually.,
Take to the water.,
Use a stationary bike for cardiovascular exercise.,
Get exercise with recreational activities.",How to Exercise If You Have Limited Mobility2," In some situations, your doctor or physical therapist may prescribe specific exercises or movements that you should do. This is especially common if you have limited mobility due to a recent injury.The exercises and activities prescribed by your doctor or physical therapist are designed to help you avoid muscle deterioration or loss as a result of inactivity from limited mobility.
For example, you may be prescribed isometric exercises, in which you push against an object or another part of your body without moving the joint.

, No matter what kind of physical activity you're doing, you need to warm up first to get your blood flowing and your muscles ready to work. Skipping a warm-up can lead to cramps and other injuries.Likewise, you should end any exercise routine with some stretching and cooling down to lower your heart rate after activity.
Some ideas for a good warm-up include walking or jogging in place, arm and leg lifts or circles, and shoulder rolls. Generally, you just want to move your body all around and get it loose and ready to move.

, You have a lot of options in terms of how to exercise and the types of exercises to do. If you have limited mobility, focus on exercises that mimic actions you normally perform throughout the day.For example, if you're often reaching into high cupboards, look for exercises that involve lifting overhead or improving the range of motion in your shoulders, such as overhead presses and triceps extensions.

, When you have limited mobility, you shouldn't try to exercise parts of your body that are injured or otherwise limited. Instead, train other parts of the body to compensate.For example, if you have a shoulder injury, you'll want to focus your strength training exercises on your lower body and your core. If you have limited mobility in your legs, on the other hand, work on upper body and core strength training.

, If you're just starting to exercise, go for a few minutes each day. Get used to being active and make it a part of your regular routine, then gradually increase the length of time you exercise each day.Set small, reachable goals for yourself. For example, if your overall goal is to lose 20 pounds, you might set a smaller goal of losing a pound a week. Keep track of your progress and allow yourself a small reward for each successful week.

, When you have limited mobility, start strength training with the lowest weight possible. Increase repetitions first, then increase the weight. You can use soup cans or other household items if you can't find dumbbells light enough to start.For example, you might start doing 2 sets of 5 repetitions of bicep curls with 2-pound dumbbells. After a week or two, do 2 sets of 7 repetitions, then 3 sets of 5 repetitions. When you're up to 3 sets of 10 repetitions, move up to 3-pound dumbbells.

, A water aerobics class is a low-impact way to build muscles as well as increase your cardiovascular strength. The water both supports your body and adds resistance as you move through it.Check at your local fitness center or health club to find out what water exercise classes are available. Ask if there are any classes specifically for people with limited mobility.

, Cycling is a relatively low-impact, whole-body workout that is easy on the joints. Stationary bikes typically are easier because you can control the resistance and don't have to worry about balancing the bike on rough terrain.You also may be able to find a portable pedal machine. You can set these machines in front of your chair or sofa and get exercise while watching television or reading a book.

, Many recreational and everyday activities also may provide exercise if you have limited mobility. Think of the things you enjoy doing, such as gardening or fishing, and try to incorporate them into your regular schedule.For example, fishing can help increase the strength and range of motion in your arms and shoulders.
Go for a walk with a friend so you can socialize while you're getting some exercise.

Practice tai chi to improve your balance and flexibility.",How to Exercise If You Have Limited Mobility3," A regular stretching routine can improve your flexibility and increase your range of motion over time. Warm up before you start your stretching routine, and only stretch as far as you can without pain or discomfort.Practice breathing deeply as you stretch. Don't continue stretching if you find yourself holding your breath, gasping, or otherwise unable to breathe through the stretch.
Control your movements going into and coming out of the stretch. Return to the start position slowly rather than simply dropping out of the stretch.

, All yoga poses can be modified for people with limited mobility. A regular yoga practice may increase your range of motion as well as improving your balance and making you more flexible.Typically your best bet is to join a class locally so you'll have the benefit of a professional instructor to assist you and make sure you're doing the poses correctly.
Don't try yoga at home if you have no experience with the practice, especially if you have a chronic condition such as arthritis or are recovering from a recent injury.

, If you have limited mobility, pilates may significantly improve your flexibility and range of motion. Look for a ""gentle pilates"" class, particularly one specifically designed for people with limited mobility.Many gentle pilates classes are mat-based. Talk with the instructor if you have difficulty getting down onto the floor and then back up again.
Make sure you discuss your specific physical limitations with your instructor so they'll know when you need additional assistance.

, The slow movements of tai chi are low-impact and suitable for people with limited mobility. The practice has other benefits, including increased calmness and mental outlook.You typically can find a tai chi class locally by checking senior or community centers, health clubs, or even hospitals in your area. Many tai chi classes are specifically designed for people with limited mobility, such as those with arthritis.
Talk to the instructor before you take the class and explain your limitations. Find out how much experience they have working with people who have the same limitations or health conditions as you.

Sit down as a family and discuss what kind of activities you would be interested in.,
Create a schedule.,
Plan out your exercise routine and write it down.,
Daily exercise does not have to be time consuming.,
Keep it up!",How to Exercise Together As a Family," Exercising together doesn't have to be strictly going to the gym, it can include a wide variety of activities such as; hiking, canoeing, rock climbing, biking, jumping rope, sledding, dancing, or simply walking around the block. There are hundreds of different activities that supply the health benefits of regular exercise, so get creative!;
, Many families are over worked and over booked, so making a special ""family night"" to exercise is very important. As you begin to get into the routine of exercising once a week, you can slowly build up to a few times a week, and eventually once a day. Saving one specific day a week for a ""big"" event (one that requires travel or money or more time) will ensure that you stick to your schedule and give everyone something to look forward to.

, Writing down your goals and routine is very important, it gives the whole family a solid outline of what you would like to accomplish, as well as something to feel excited about. Get the kids involved and have them write down what they want to get out of a family exercise routine.

, The benefits of a ten minute walk around the block after dinner with the family are noticeable. Incorporating exercise into playing with your children allows you to spend time with them as well as reap the benefits of physical activity. A quick game of tag, a run around the local playground, sledding or snowman building in the winter, or a walk around the block are all small but great ways to get exercise as a family.

, Don't get discouraged. Missing one or two days of exercising isn't the end of the world. Find another way to make up for the lost time, and don't quit your regime. Remember why you want to start exercising with your family, read the goals you've written down, and keep your routine fresh and exciting. Don't forget that beyond the value of the physical activity, you are creating a stronger bond with your family.

Replace your chair with a stability ball.,
Squeeze your buttocks for 5-10 seconds.,
Use a hand gripper to work out your hands and forearms.,
Do bicep curls with a heavy stapler or full water bottle.,
Swivel in your chair for an ab workout.,
Do leg raises under your desk.,
Squat over your chair for 15-30 seconds.,
Raise yourself above your chair using your arms.,
Do stretching exercises to reduce stress and relax your muscles.",How to Exercise at Work Every Day1," Check with your boss or supervisor first, as some offices may have safety policies about this. If you get the green light, go for it! Sitting on a stability ball automatically makes you use more muscles than you would by sitting in a chair by forcing you to use your abdomen and back to keep yourself upright.It’ll also encourage you to have better posture., This is a great, secretive way to exercise your glutes at your desk. Just squeeze your butt cheeks together and hold for at least five seconds, then release. Repeat this exercise 4-5 times.Women can also do Kegel exercises by tightening their pelvic muscles for at least 15 seconds, then releasing. Repeat 10 times.

, Buy a hand gripper at any exercise supplies store. Rest your elbow on your desk and squeeze the gripper for 30 seconds. Repeat this five times, and remember to do each arm.Increase the amount of time you squeeze the gripper for a tougher exercise.

, Do 4-5 sets of 12-15 “repetitions,” or reps. Be sure to work out both of your arms!If you don’t think it will bother or distract anyone in your office, you can also bring a light set of weights to work. Do the bicep curls with these instead.

, Keep your feet just off the ground and touch your fingers lightly to the edge of your desk. Tighten your core and use your abdomen muscles to swivel the chair to the right and then the left. Do 10 twists to each side, and repeat this 3 times over the course of the workday., Straighten one leg under your desk and hold it up for 5-10 seconds. Put it back down and repeat the exercise on the other leg. Do 15 reps for each leg. If this isn’t tough enough for you, loop a purse or briefcase strap over your leg and lift that.

, Make your hands into fists next to the arms of your chair. Use the muscles in your thighs to lift yourself out of your chair and hover above it. Repeat the exercise 4-6 times.This may only be appropriate if you have a private office. You don’t want to distract or annoy your co-workers.

, Lift yourself up and hold your body out of the chair for 10-20 seconds. Rest for a minute once you’re sitting again, and then repeat the exercise 4-6 times.This exercise works best if you can cross your legs in your chair and then lift yourself up. This cross-legged position won’t work for those in tight pants or pencil skirts, however!
Again, be sure not to cause any problems in the office. If your co-workers feel your exercises are preventing them from getting their work done, you’ll definitely need to make some adjustments.

, Over the course of the day, be sure you’re taking the time to stretch. This gets your muscles moving as well, and it’s super important for relieving any workplace tension. Try these stretches to get started:Lift your arms above your head and rotate them one at a time.
Shrug your shoulders and roll them backwards and forwards a few times.
Roll your neck gently from left to right, focusing on tight spots.
Roll your ankles, point your toes, and flex your feet.
To avoid bothering your co-workers, stretch in the bathroom.

If you enjoy those things, then go for it. If not, then find something that you will enjoy. The easiest way to make exercise fun is by sticking with workout routines that you know you'll enjoy.If you don't like certain exercises, like lifting weights, you don't have to do them.
Some people find exercising outdoors (especially in nature) to be particularly satisfying.
Try getting outside and going for a long walk, trail run, or hike at your local park.
Many people enjoy revisiting activities they did as children. If you were a very active child (perhaps you biked everywhere or ran around the block to unwind), think about ways to revisit your childhood and incorporate that into your workout.If you like exploring your city or town, go for long bike rides. It's a great way to get exercise while seeing the sights or running errands.;
, There are many fitness apps on the market today. Fitness apps can be downloaded to your smartphone or digital mp3 player, and they can be used to help you stay motivated during a workout, track your progress, and compare your workouts over time.

There's a good chance your smartphone might have come with a fitness app already on it. If not, you can download one for free or for a low cost.
Look for apps like MyFitnessPal, MapMyFitness, Moves, Fitness Buddy, and Tabata.
Most fitness apps have spoken instructions that can let you know your progress, tell you when to start/stop running, and keep track of time during your workout.
You can listen to music through some workout apps if you have mp3s saved on your phone.
Workout apps typically tell you how many miles/kilometers you've traveled, how long it took you to travel that distance, and how many calories you've burned. Many apps will also chart your route on a map (using your device's GPS) so you can see your route and follow it again in the future.
There are many workout apps on the market today. Read other users' reviews online to find one that works best for you.

, Music can help motivate you during a workout. It can also help take your mind off of soreness and fatigue by keeping you grounded in your workout.Put together a playlist of songs you love that will keep you moving and motivate you through your daily workout.


The best songs to exercise to tend to have at least 120 beats per minute (BPM). You can find out a song's BPM by searching online.
Choose songs that make you tap your fingers or feet. Anything that makes you want to move will probably help you work out.
Choose something fun and exciting for your first track to help you get going, then choose fast-tempo music for the mid section of your workout. That's when you'll need motivation the most.
Something with a catchy, steady rhythm is a good choice, as it will likely help you keep moving once fatigue sets in.
Add motivational and/or catchy songs for the tail end of your workout, as your endurance will really be lagging by that point.
Throw in one or two slower songs (like ballads) for the cool down part of your workout. You'll want to slow your breathing and heartbeat as you slowly walk off the workout, so something slower and more relaxing would be ideal.

, Some people want to join a gym but worry about being around hyper-fit, athletic individuals. While some gyms may cater to that crowd, there are also many gyms and workout groups that focus on being supportive of everyone.Look for gyms that specify they are supportive and inclusive of all body types.
If you can't find a whole gym that's supportive, look for specific workout groups. You can find these at your local gym, or through online meet up groups.
Search online for supportive or body-positive workout groups in your area.

, A good way to stay motivated is by rewarding yourself. It can be a good ""carrot on a stick"" to remind you through the exhausting daily workouts that you'll get some type of tangible reward for your efforts.Whether your aim was to lose weight, run a set distance without stopping, or exercise on consecutive days for a week in a row, it's important to celebrate those victories.
Make sure you reward yourself in ways that won't compromise your newfound healthy lifestyle.
Instead of going out for ice cream or alcoholic beverages, try treating yourself to a healthy homemade dinner or a small shopping spree. After a little progress you'll be able to buy new clothes that wouldn't have fit you before you started working out.
Increase your reward as you prolong your workout regimen. For example, after a month you might treat yourself to something more expensive, like a movie or album you've been wanting.
A great reward that will help keep you motivated is a new pair of running shoes (if you run), or some other type of workout gear. By investing money in something to help you work out, you're also committing to your healthier lifestyle.

, If you've been working out with the same routine for a few weeks in a row, you might begin to feel bored. Your progress might also plateau, without any continued weight loss or muscle gain. Changing up your exercise routine can help avoid these workout pitfalls and keep your workout fresh and productive.Your body's muscles adjust and adapt to a workout routine in about six to eight weeks. If you don't change up your routine, you may find that your progress stalls after this period.
One easy way to alter your routine is by increasing the intensity of your workouts. You can do this by adding more weights (if you lift weights) or by walking/running/biking faster and/or farther in short bursts (sometimes called interval training).If you walk, add some light jogging. If you jog or run, add some sprinting intervals by setting your sights on a target ahead of you and sprinting as fast as you can. Then resume your normal jogging/running/walking speed.
Sometimes just changing up the sequence of your workout can help make a difference. You'll essentially be retraining your muscles in a new pattern, which can help break out of your old, repetitive routine.
If changing the sequence doesn't do much, you can try switching out different exercises into your regimen. For example, switch to bench presses instead of squats, or cut your run five minutes short and go for a quick bike ride around the block.

, Exercise should never feel boring or chore-like. If your workout routine starts to feel dull or if you've hit a plateau in your workout plans, try a new form of exercise that you may not have previously considered. You may end up enjoying it, and it could be just the thing you need to break out of your slump.Try some new and emerging fitness trend. This can help you explore your workout options while feeling like you're on the cutting edge of a new trend.
You can find new classes at your local gym, community center, or local college/university. Search around online to find out about new classes being offered in your area.

, Whether you've been working out alone for a while, want to take the predictability out of your workout, or simply need help getting started, a group exercise class could be just the thing you need. Most gyms and exercise facilities offer group classes in yoga, Pilates, kickboxing, core conditioning, and various styles of aerobic dance.Group workout classes allow you to exercise in a safe, fun, and social environment.
The workout you get in a group exercise class is designed for maximum efficiency and safety, plus it offers a consistent schedule for your exercise regimen.
You can find group exercise classes at your local gym, community center, and many colleges/universities. Some are open to the public, while others may require a membership fee.
Try out a few different classes, and don't get discouraged if things don't click right away. Sometimes it takes a while to find an instructor, music style, or setting that works best for you.

, If you have a hard time getting excited about exercise, or if you find that working out alone has gotten dull and repetitive, having a workout buddy could make a big difference. You can help each other - just make sure you choose the right friend to work out with.Try to choose a friend who can stay motivated. Otherwise you might be working double duty, keeping both you and your friend on your workout routine.Let your friend know that you're looking to commit to a serious workout routine, and that this isn't just a short-term, passing interest. Make sure your friend is also willing to commit for the long haul.
Don't rely solely on your workout buddy. There will be days where your friend can't make it, and you'll need to commit to going out and exercising alone if you need to.

, If you're having trouble sticking with exercise, it may be because you've tried to lose weight in the past and couldn't succeed. One way to enjoy exercise in spite of this is to keep working out because it feels good and is enjoyable, not just to lose 10 pounds.Some studies have shown that working out because it feels good and manages stress is a better motivator than working out just to lose weight.
You can still make exercise part of your weight loss plan, but don't stop working out if exercise alone isn't dropping the pounds.
Remind yourself that you'll feel happier and less stressed with exercise, and you'll sleep better at night. Those factors can help you stick with it if your scale starts to frustrate you.

, Everyone makes excuses from time to time. Letting yourself keep making excuses can ruin your chances of ever getting started, though. If you're prone to making excuses or finding reasons why you shouldn't work out, make a list of your anticipated obstacles and find ways to preemptively avoid those pitfalls.By anticipating your excuses before they arise, you'll be able to recognize them as they arise and work around them.
If money is an issue, for example, you can exercise outdoors instead of joining a gym.
If you can't find time to exercise, try getting up an hour earlier or staying up an hour later. You can also try making exercise part of your daily commute by riding your bike to work instead of driving.
If you're really short on time, you can break your workout up into smaller sessions. Even working out 15 to 20 minutes at a time is an option, especially if you can do multiple short sessions throughout the day.
Remember that any exercise is better than no exercise. Even short sessions will bring tremendous health benefits compared to doing nothing at all.

, Flow is a popular term that gets brought up in studies about human happiness. It can apply to any activity you engage in, including exercise. If you're having a hard time getting into your exercise routine, try to keep going until you achieve some experience of flow in your workout.Flow involves total immersion in the moment.
People who achieve flow tend to feel happier and more fulfilled with their activities.
Flow focuses on the process of working towards a goal rather than just centering on achievement.
To achieve flow when you exercise, set clear and specific goals for every workout session.
Listen to your body and mind for feedback during your workout.
If you're pushing yourself too hard, or not hard enough, your body and mind should register the situation through soreness or a sense of not doing enough.

, Trying to do too much or progress too quickly can make an otherwise fun workout feel awful. It can also discourage you by making you feel like you can't keep up with your expectations. Instead of trying to become a world-class athlete overnight, aim to amp up your workout routine gradually and over a period of several weeks and months.Starting out slowly will make the transition to exercising easier on your body. It can also help your brain develop stronger associations between exercise and pleasure.
Start out with sessions that last around 5 to 10 minutes, especially if you're new to exercise or haven't done it in a while.
Gradually add 5 to 10 minutes to your workout every week or two, but don't rush too fast. Doubling your workout time in a week could potentially cause injuries and may make exercise less fun.
Aim to eventually (after a few months) reach 30 to 60 minutes of exercise each day, and try to work out around five days a week (or more if you feel capable).

Be sure to keep an extra pair of clothes and shoes at work if you do this, however.Check and see if your office has a shower. This may be crucial if you’re going to get sweaty on your commute.
This goes for errands as well. Walk, run, or bike whenever and wherever you can.

, Never pass up an opportunity to stand up and walk around. You can carry a pad and pencil with you to take notes if you need it., Break your lunch up into two half-hour blocks.

If your office has a gym, lunch-break workouts may be much easier to fit in. If you don’t have one, chat with your boss and see if it’s something that could be in the works.

, Especially if the weather’s nice, a meeting could be a perfect time for a walk outside. You could also chat and meet while you walk up and down the halls of the office.This won’t work for every meeting, especially if you need to do a conference call.

One reason people struggle to work out in the winter is that their exercise of choice isn't an option in the colder months. If you, for example, love running, you may struggle to do so in below freezing temperatures. Try to find a new activity that you enjoy.Take this as a chance to experiment a little. You want to diversify your workout routine, and winter is a chance to do so. Take a chance at trying a variety of new activities.
For example, try skiing if you've never tried it before. If you prefer to stay warm in doors, take a class at your local gym. Try a dance-based exercise class, for example.;
, Weather is often the reason people taper off working out during the winter. Therefore, find something you enjoy that you can do indoors. There are a variety of workout routines you don't need to leave your home to do.Try enrolling in a class at your gym or at a local community center. You can try something like tai-chi, yoga, or Pilates.
If you love doing something like biking or running, try using a treadmill or stationary bike at your gym. If you go for long walks during the warmer months, try walking at a local mall during the winter.

, Many people enjoy playing outdoors in the winter. Certain activities can actually burn calories. If it's too cold to make it to your gym on any given day, try going outside and enjoying the weather as a form of working out.You can do things like make snowmen, make snow angels, go snowshoeing, or other winter activities.
If you have kids, try spending a day in the snow with your children instead of going to your gym if it's very cold out.

, If you don't like working out indoors, take winter as a chance to try winter sports. Things like skiing, snowshoeing, and even running outside are all options. See winter as a way to force yourself to try new things.You can see if there are classes for winter sports in your area. Taking a skiing class can be a fun way to stay active over the winter.

, Sticking to a workout routine requires goals. You can see winter as the beginning of another season. Just as you may set a weight loss or fitness goal for the new year, set some goals for winter.The best goals are reasonable and specific. If your goals are vague or over-the-top, you're likely to get frustrated and not stick to them.
For example, you may have a goal along the lines of, ""I want to lose some weight before the new year."" This is an acceptable goal, but it's a little vague. Try to specify. For example, ""I want to lose 8 pounds by New Year's Eve.""

, Finding a workout buddy can help you stick to a routine. You will have another person to keep you accountable. Try pairing up with a friend to go skiing three times a week, or agreeing to go for a winter hike with your spouse each weekend.It's a good idea to pick a very motivated workout buddy. This way, their enthusiasm will rub off on you.
If you can't find a workout buddy in person, try finding an online workout partner.

, Working out can be tiring and stressful. Many people make excuses as to why they can't complete a routine. This can be particularly easy to do in the winter, when the weather gives you an easy out. Make a habit of recognizing and challenging your own excuses.Remind yourself that your health and fitness does not take a vacation. Even though it's winter, your body still needs a routine.
Recognize when you're making an excuse and challenge it. For example, you may think something like, ""It's so cold. I can't walk to the gym in this weather."" Counter this excuse with something like, ""I can wear layers and, even though the walk will be rough, I can make it to the gym.""

, Sometimes, things do happen. A snow day could leave your gym closed. Very low temperatures could make a winter run dangerous. In these scenarios, have a Plan B.Say you usually go to a gym. Have a few at-home workout routines on hand in case the weather closes your gym, or if it's too dangerous to drive. You can even get some small home workout equipment, like free weights, to use at home.
You can also find guided exercise routines to follow online. There may be a YouTube video, for example, of a half hour aerobics routine you could follow.
Say you generally go running outside, even in the winter. If it gets too cold to run outside, you can run on a treadmill instead.

, Try to get excited about working out over the winter. Instead of viewing it as a burden, remember everything you're gaining. You are keeping your health and weight intact even when it's cold outside.Also, look into the fun things about working out in the winter. You can have a cup of warm cocoa in front of the fireplace after a vigorous workout, for example.

, You should always warm up before a workout, but this is especially important during the winter. A 10 minute warm up prior to a workout is important. Warming up usually means doing a less strenuous form of your chosen exercise first. For example, walk briskly for 10 minutes before running., You want to make sure you stay warm when working out outside in the winter. Layering is the best way to assure you're warm without having an outfit that inhibits your movement.Use a synthetic material for your first layer so that it will absorb sweat. Then, cover with layers of wool and fleece. Top off your layers with something waterproof.
Avoid cotton. This gets wet easily, and you want to make sure you don't get too sweaty when working out in the winter.

, You will need to seek help fast in the event of frostbite and hypothermia. You should get out of the cold if you notice either and seek medical care if necessary.Frostbite usually occurs on exposed skin. You may feel numb or experience a stinging sensation. You should warm up the frostbitten area without rubbing it, as this can hurt the skin. If normal feeling does not return, see a doctor.
Loss of coordination, slurred speech, fatigue, and intense shivering are signs of hypothermia. Go to the emergency room if you notice any signs.

, You may not feel the need to drink much water, or wear sunscreen, during colder months. However, you still need protection from the sun even if it's cold out. You also may not feel thirsty if it's cold outside, but you still need to hydrate as you lose fluids when working out.Even if you don't feel thirsty, drink water. Carry a water bottle with you and takes sips on occasion when working out.
Cover most of your skin to avoid too much sun exposure. Put sunscreen on areas of your body not covered by your clothing.

Don't forget about rest days.",How to Ease Into an Exercise Routine," Before easing into an exercise routine, you should visit and talk to your doctor.


If you've never exercised before or are returning to exercise after a few weeks or months off, talk to your doctor first. Get a clearance from them that you can be active.
Ask your doctor if there are any exercises you should avoid, how long you can exercise for and at what intensity.
For example, ask: what exercises should I avoid? Is there a time limit on my exercise routine? How many days a week can I exercise?;
, Also consider seeing a personal trainer to make sure you're on the right path with exercise. These fitness professional can give you hands on guidance on how to safely return to an exercise routine.


After meeting with your doctor and getting a clearance for activity, sign up for a few sessions with a personal trainer. Make sure to relay any guidance provided by your doctor so the trainer knows what they can and cannot suggest for you.
You might want to schedule just a few sessions to help get professional guidance as you ease back into a good routine.
A trainer can make sure you're doing exercises correctly, using proper form and doing a variety so you don't overwork your body.

, To help you layout your plan and help you be consistent, create an exercise plan. This can help give you a vision and pathway as you ease into a new exercise routine.To help you figure out how much exercise to do, when your rest days are and how long you're exercising for, make an exercise schedule. This will help you stick to your routine and make sure you have the time to exercise during the week.
Studies have shown that you're more likely to stick with an exercise routine if it's been pre-scheduled into your week.
Write in what exercise you plan on doing, for how long, at what time and where. Use your date book or calendar and do this for at least one week in advance.

, When you're planning out your new exercise routine, try to choose activities or exercises that you'll actually enjoy. This is important so that you can ease into a routine you'll stick to long-term.When you're thinking about easing into an exercise routine, you'll have to think about what types of exercises you want to do.
For example, do you want to run? Do you want to incorporate aerobics classes? Do you want to bike?
If you choose exercises that you don't really like, that are too expensive or are too difficult, you're more likely to stop or give up over time.
Really consider what is realistic for you and what you enjoy. That way, as you ease into an exercise routine, you'll stick with it.

, When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you might be excited for your new plans. However, you need to make sure you take it slow and don't overdo it initially.


Going slowly when you're easing into an exercise routine is important. You'll be able to focus on your form while you exercise and take extra time to listen to your body.
The quality of exercise is much more important than quantity and how much you do.If you exercise too long or too hard to start, you're risking an injury or excessive soreness. This is an essential component of easing into a routine.
For example, choose lower intensity, lower impact exercises (like walking) and only do them for 15 to 20 minutes. Or if you're restarting strength training, use a 5 pound dumbbell instead of the 10 or 15 pound dumbbell you were using previously.

, One essential component to consider when you're easing into an exercise routine is your body's signals. Listen to your body and take care to keep yourself safe as you become more active.


When you're just starting with an exercise routine, it's essential that you really pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise.
Your body will tell you when you've done too much or are working too hard.
Pay attention to signals like: nausea, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, sharp pain, excessive soreness or extreme fatigue.If you're noticing any of these symptoms, you've most likely pushed yourself too hard. Lessen the time or intensity of your exercise until you build up more strength.
If you have any chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness or pain that doesn't go away, call your doctor immediately and do not restart exercise until cleared.

, When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you may find it difficult to stick to your routine. It takes a while to get into a routine and a friend can help you.


Studies have shown that when you have work outs planned with a friend or family member, you're more likely to go and be consistent long-term.Ask friends, family members or co-workers if they'd be interested in exercising with you a few days a week.
Consider getting together with someone who is also considering easing into an exercise routine. It'll be fun to do this together.

, When you're easing back into an exercise routine, you have to think beyond your activity. Choosing appropriate exercises and being safe is important, but so is getting adequate rest each night.


Exercise is physical work and stressful to your body. Although it's beneficial and healthful work, it's still work and your body needs to get adequate rest after being active.When you're easing back into exercise, your body will be burning more calories, using more energy and engaging muscles more strenuously.
Make sure to get at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. And if there are days where you feel more tired, go to bed early or sleep in occasionally for a rest day.

, If you're just starting back with exercise, one area that you can focus on initially is your lifestyle activity. You can make a lot of changes here without worrying about overdoing it.


Lifestyle activities are those exercises that you do as part of your normal daily routine. They can include things like: walking to and from your car, taking the stairs at your office, doing household chores or lifting the laundry basket.Lifestyle activities are generally not overly strenuous and are not done for long periods of time. This makes them a safe way to increase your activity without worrying about injuring yourself or doing too much too quickly.
Think about your typical day and consider when you can add in more movement. Can you take more steps? Can you use the stairs more often? Are there times when you could be standing instead of sitting?

, When you're working on finding the right combination or right type of exercise to do, don't forget to include a warm-up and a cool-down. These are essential as you ease yourself back into a routine.A warm-up and cool-down are designed to help your body get ready for exercise and recover after performing exercise. Not including them, especially when you're initially restarting exercise, can increase your risk of injury.A warm-up should be done immediately prior to your exercise routine. In general, do something light and slow for about five minutes.
For example, your warm up could be a slow walk or using the elliptical without any resistance.
After you've completed your workout, end with a cool-down. Slowly bring down the level of your exercise and finish with stretching. Again, this should last for about 5-10 minutes.

, Walking is one of the oldest forms of exercise and it's perfect for easing back into an exercise routine. Start walking more regularly to help build up your strength and conditioning.


Walking is a low intensity and low impact exercise. It's perfect for a variety of fitness levels and ages.If you're just starting out with exercise, try going for a 10 minute walk in your neighborhood or on the treadmill.
As this becomes easier, slowly increase your distance or time. Try increasing your time or distance by 10% each week.

, Another great exercise to try is water aerobics or swimming. Again, this is a low impact exercise that can make easing into workouts a little bit easier.Water aerobics and swimming will give you a great cardiovascular workout. However, the buoyancy of the water takes your weight off your joints which can help prevent excessive force and pounding on your body.
This is great if you feel like you might have some joint pain or soreness associated with exercise.
Many water aerobics classes can be 45 to 60 minutes long. If you're just starting out, tell the instructor you're new and are planning to only stay for half the class or until you feel fatigued.

, Another fun aerobic exercise you can add in is biking. It's easy on your joints and you will have full control over the resistance and difficulty of this exercise.Biking is considered a good beginner exercise because there is no pounding on your joints. It's also great if you're easing back into a routine.
You can choose to either bike outdoors or try out a spin class. Biking outdoors allows you to go at a leisurely pace.
Spin classes are typically higher in intensity. However, you can do a spin class and let the instructor know you won't be using a lot of resistance or do higher intensity bouts since you're getting back into your exercise routine.

, Yoga is a well known low impact and low intensity exercise. This is a great form of activity to start with especially if you want to work on improving your strength, balance and flexibility.Like walking, yoga is great for a variety of people. You don't have to be in great shape, you don't have to be strong or overly flexible. It's perfect for varying fitness levels.
To start, take a beginners yoga class or even yoga for arthritis. These easier forms of yoga can get your body moving without increasing your heart rate or having you do poses that may be too advanced.

, When you're easing into your exercise routine, strength training might make you a little nervous. Some people opt for weight machines because they seem easy to use, but using a pair of light hand weights when you are just starting out might be a better option.


While there are benefits to both free weights and weight machines, using free weights offers you more options for exercises, more range of motion, and a more effective strength training workout.Try using a pair of light hand weights to do some basic strength training exercises, such as bicep curls, shoulder presses, and tricep presses. You can do these exercises at home or at a gym.
If you are not sure where to start with free weights, and you feel more comfortable using weight machines instead, then that is also fine. Just keep in mind that it is important to use these machines properly to avoid injury. Ask a gym employee if you are not sure how to use any of the machines.

, Once you've been cleared by your doctor and are slowly getting back into the routine of exercise, work on meeting the recommended amounts of cardio each week.


The CDC recommends that healthy adults include at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity cardiovascular exercises each week.You need to be doing these exercises for at least 10 minutes at a time for them to count towards this goal.
Moderate intensity exercises are those that increase your heart rate and blood pressure slightly. You should be able to talk while you exercise, but only in short sentences before taking a breath.
Remember, you may not be able to meet this goal initially. That's OK. This could be a moderate or even a long-term goal to work towards.

, In addition to cardio, it's also important to include adequate amounts of strength training. These exercises offer additional health benefits and should be included weekly.


Again, the CDC has recommended that healthy adults include one to two days of strength training every week.These exercises should be done for at least 20 minutes total and should work every major muscle group in your body.
In addition, it's not recommended to do strength training of the same muscles or muscle groups two days in a row. Always separate days of strength training of the same muscles or muscle groups by a day of rest or cardio activities only.
This recommendation can also be a long-term goal if you cannot do this level of activity initially.

, Stretching and flexibility exercises are always an important component of your exercise routine. However, they become more important when you're easing into or back into your exercise routine.Don’t worry about stretching before you exercise. It is best to wait to stretch your muscles until after they are warmed up, so focus on stretching after you are finished with your workout.
Stretching helps to improve your flexibility. In addition, you're more likely to be sore and tight when you're starting in with exercise again. Stretching after your workouts can help to alleviate these symptoms.

, In addition to getting in all the right amounts of activity and including regular flexibility training, you also need to give your body a rest.


When you're easing into an exercise routine, it's essential that you take your time and go slowly. This means including adequate rest days.
In fact, you may need to initially include more rest days than you will later down the road.
It's during rest that your body and muscles recover. Your muscles grow in strength and size while performing essential repair functions.Initially include two to three rest days a week. Once you progress and get stronger, you can knock this amount down to one to two rest days a week.

Instead, set manageable goals, such as 20 minutes of jogging a day for a week, and increase these the length and difficulty as you become more fit.

, Aerobic exercise will help your body burn fat. Strength training, while beneficial, will cause you to gain weight in muscle and may not reduce your body fat as effectively.
, If you do the same workout each day, you'll quickly get bored. Try different activities, such as swimming, hiking, yoga, or canoeing to keep yourself engaged.

, For example, try to log a certain number of hours or miles each week, and reward yourself with a fun treat, like a foot massage or a day at the beach, when you meet it.

, Instead of comparing your performance to others or to an imaginary ideal, praise yourself for improvements you make.

, A partner can provide encouragement and push you to work harder. Just be sure to do the same for them!

, Know your body and what exercises are best for you. For example, if you have bad knees, you might want to try swimming as an aerobic workout instead of jogging. Pick activities that you enjoy. An example of a workout:



10 minutes warm-up For example, jog or walk briskly.







30 minutes aerobic exercise Jog, run, swim, kayak or bike







10 minutes strength training Push-ups, weightlifting, situps







10 minutes cool down Same as warm-up

Take a break occasionally.",How to Exercise at Your Desk," An easy exercise that you can do at your desk are push-ups. Using either the wall or your desk (depending on your fitness level), you can perform this exercise to help strengthen your chest, shoulders and arms.


If you don't have a lot of upper body strength or are just starting out, try a wall push-up first instead of the desk push-up. Begin by standing about 1-2 feet away from the wall. Place your palms on the wall shoulder width apart.Bending your elbows outward, slowly lower yourself closer to the wall. Stop when your face is a few inches from the wall. Your core and lower body should be stiff and firm.
Once you get close to the wall, slowly push yourself up to the starting position. This is one push-up. Repeat 8-10 times or as many times as you're able.
If you're a little more physically fit, you can try a desk push-up. Because your desk is lower, this version of a push-up is a little more difficult.
Follow the same protocol as the wall push-up, but start with your palms and hands holding onto the side of your desk at shoulder width. Lower until your nose almost touches the desk and push yourself back up.;
, If you want to strengthen the back of your arms, you can perform tricep dips at your desk. You can use a sturdy desk chair or the edge of your desk to perform these exercises.Stand with your back facing your desk. Place your hands, fingers facing forwards, on the edge of the desk. Your hands should be shoulder width apart.
Slowly bend your elbows so they are pointing backwards. Lower yourself down until your upper arm is almost parallel to the floor.
Hold this position for a second or two. Then push yourself up, focusing on the backs of the arms, to the starting position. Repeat 8-10 times or as many times as you can.

, Another great exercise to do at your desk are chair or wall sits. These exercises help strengthen your hamstrings, quadriceps and glutes.To do chair squats, start in a standing position. You should be facing away from a sturdy chair (do not use a chair with wheels). Place your hands on your hips and keep your feet shoulder width apart for this exercise.
Slowly squat down as if you were going to sit down in your chair. Stop when your just a few inches away from the seat of the chair. Push yourself back up to a standing position and repeat 8-10 times.
A wall sit is similar to your chair squat except you hold your squat position. Stand with your back pressed up against a sturdy wall.
Lower your body into a squat or sitting position. Your thighs should be almost parallel to the floor. Hold this position as long as you can. Repeat 1-2 times.

, Although there are a variety of strengthening exercises you can do at your desk, there are also some cardio exercises that you can do at your desk or in your office. Try:


Jumping jacks. Do 30-60 seconds of these to help get your heart rate elevated.
Squat jumps. Do 30-60 seconds of these to help elevate your heart rate and strengthen your lower body.
Mountain climbers. Do 30-60 seconds of this exercise to help strengthen your core, shoulder and arms.
Running in place. Try a few minutes of running in place (with high knees) to help get your heart rate up.
Skater lunges. Add in 30-60 seconds of this exercise to help tone your outer thighs and increase your heart rate.

, When you're sitting most of the day at your office, many of your muscles or joints can become tight from staying in the same position for an extended period of time.Mix up your exercises to help loosen you up by adding in some simple stretches:


Do neck, shoulder and arm rolls. Take a few minutes before or after doing other exercises to do neck, shoulder and arm rolls. These are particular helpful if you're hunched over a computer most of the day.
Do the mermaid stretch. Sit in your chair with your back straight up and erect. Lift your right arm up over your head and lean towards the left to stretch out the right side of your body. Repeat on the other side. This helps stretch your back which can get tight or sore after sitting for long periods.
Stretching is great to do on a rest day or when you're feeling overly tight. These stretches can also help wake you up a bit and relieve any tension you're feeling from sitting too long.

, If you want to get even more active at your desk, consider purchasing or asking for a standing or walking desk. This allows you to move and stay upright instead of seated all day long.


A lot of studies have been done on these types of desks. They have proven that those people who used the desk had improved quality and quantity of work in addition to feeling more alert during the day.Talk to your boss or HR department about getting a walking or standing desk in your office. They may offer to pay for it, split the cost with you or just give you permission to use one in the office.
If you get one of these desks, try to stand or walk for part of your day. You may stand/walk every hour or alternate sitting for an hour with walking or standing for an hour.

, In addition to doing exercises at your desk, also get up and move more often during the day. One good way to get you out of your desk chair is by delivering messages in person instead of email.


Think about how many emails you shoot off during the day. Some of those emails might be to colleagues on another floor or down the hallway from you.
Consider writing a message on a post-it note or memo form and delivering your messages in person instead of via email. This will force you to get up and walk.
To help remind you to deliver messages in person, pick out a certain person to walk to or pick out a certain time to deliver all messages in person.

, Another way to increase your steps and even get in a little more intense cardio, is by taking the stairs. Skip the elevator or escalator at your office and hit the stairs instead.


When you're coming into work, skip taking the elevator and take the stairs instead to your office. If your office is on a high floor (like the 25th floor of a tall building), consider taking the stairs half way up and then taking the elevator the remaining way.
Also, take the stairs to deliver messages to co-workers. Again, this forces you to get up during the day and move more and take more steps. Also consider using the bathroom or water fountain on another floor.
To increase the resistance or intensity of the stairs, consider taking them two at a time instead of one. This increases the resistance and your heart rate., You're probably not the only one at your office that's interested in being more active during the day. Talk to your friends and co-workers to see if there are activities you can do together.


Try to start an activity group at your office. You can plan to do a regular walking lunch break, do a short 15 minute yoga session or plan to have everyone get up and do stretches together in the middle of the day.
When you do exercises together with a group, you're more motivated, you have some accountability and you get time to socialize and disengage from work for a bit.Send out a group email or get HR to help you set up an activity group during the day at your office. Pick activities and times that work for everyone.

, Another way to get more steps during your day is to try parking father away from your office. This again, will force you to take more steps in the morning and afternoon.


If your office has a large parking lot, skip those close up spaces. Drive out to the end or a far corner of the lot to park.
Also consider using the top floor of the parking garage. That way, you can take the stairs down and up to get more steps in during the day.
If you leave work when it's dark or where there are not a lot of people, you may want to consider parking farther away with a friend or co-worker so you're more safe.

, If you have a job that ties you to your desk - like talking or answering the phone - there are still ways that you can be active and move more during the day.


Talk to your boss or the HR department about getting a phone headset. These are wireless and do not tie you a physical phone or desk during the day.
While you're on the phone, get up and walk around while talking or walk or stand at your desk.

, While a quick walk at work or a few yoga poses can help you stay active during your day, you need to make sure you're meeting the minimum guidelines for activity over the course of the week.


Health professionals recommend that you aim for at least 150 minutes of aerobic or cardiovascular activity each week.You should be working at a moderate intensity and do an activity for at least 10 minutes at a time. Those quick cardio sessions during your work day, if done for at least 10 minutes, can count towards this guideline.
Other exercises that will count towards your weekly minimum include: walking, jogging/running, using the elliptical machine, hiking, biking or taking an aerobics class.

, In addition to cardio exercises, it's also recommended to do strength training. Try to meet these guidelines so you are participating in a well rounded exercise plan each week.


Health professionals recommend that you incorporate 2 days of strength training each week in addition to cardio exercises.You need to aim to work every major muscle group (like your legs, arms and core) and should be exercising for at least 20 minutes.
Depending on your work schedule, you may be able to complete most if not all of these strength training exercises during the day.

, Although it's great to go for a 30 minute jog or spend 40 minutes on the elliptical, not everyone has time for that. If you can't fit in more structured exercise, keep up with your lifestyle activity instead.


Lifestyle activities are the daily movements you do that keep your body active and moving. These include using the stairs, walking to and from the car, doing household chores or standing.
Studies have shown that regular lifestyle activity has similar benefits to more structured aerobic exercise.Think about your typical day. When can you add more steps or move more often? Try to take regular breaks at work and include some exercises to help keep you active during your typical work day.
Also continue to stay active when you get home. You can walk to get the mail, sweep the floors, vacuum or stand during TV commercial breaks.

, Although regular and consistent exercise is essential to your health, its also important to take time off occasionally. Take an occasional rest day to help your body recover and refuel from more intense exercise.


Rest days are just as essential to your health and fitness level as more regular exercise. Plan to have 1-2 rest days each week.
Rest days help your body recover after more intense or longer sessions of exercise. It's during rest that your muscles rebuild, grow stronger and get bigger in size.Although exercising at your desk won't be a high intensity exercise or something you do for a long time, if you need a full day of rest, you might want to consider skipping your desk exercises or only doing restorative exercises.

Select equipment that will provide physical exercise.,
Understand the extent of a workout that is gained by using a rowing machine:


Aerobic benefits: the rowing machine stimulates the heart and lungs.,
A rowing machine can be fun.,
Realize that rowing machines carry less risk in use.,
Consider the ease of use with a rowing machine.",How to Decide on Whether to Get a Rowing Machine for Home Exercise," A rowing machine should not produce boredom and the type of machine chosen should have minimal risk of injury and be easy to use.;
, The stimulation is reached through the specific intensity and continued level of the exercise being taken. The levels needed for this aerobic workout is contingent upon the age and health of the person who is exercising.
Cultivates the major muscles: another benefit of rowing machines is the exercise experienced by the major muscles of the legs. Both the muscles of the lower legs and thighs receive significant attention and provides for a good 'burn' to be achieved.
Assists in preserving or reducing one's weight: in addition, the benefit of rowing machines is the burning of calories. It is gauged that a workout of 30 minutes can burn close to three hundred calories. This burning of calories in alignment with a reduction in calories eaten, can help oneself to contribute towards the loss of weight or preserving one's weight.

, While there are no guarantees, a rowing machine may decrease the boredom that is often linked with other pieces of exercise equipment. This decrease in boredom is workable because the exercise can be accomplished while watching television or reading a book.

, An added benefit of rowing machines is that there is less 'shock' associated with this exercise. Body 'shock' is defined as a portion of the body getting in contact with a hard surface. This 'shock' action can cause stress which can be damaging to parts of the body such as the knees, feet and ankles. An example of this type of 'shock' is jogging and the wear and tear realized by the knees when the feet hit the asphalt or other hard running surface. Obviously, any exercise that is finished and produces hurting is an exercise program that should be given up.

, A benefit of a rowing machine is their ease of use. Look for a rowing machine that can be sat upon like a normal bike. There are also rowing machines that are manufactured in a semi reclining position. These machines provide more comfortable seating as well as letting the legs to extend outwardly instead of straight down. This comfy seating allows for less risk to the person who is exercising and minimizes the probability of losing your balance and falling.

Consider alternative sports.,
Let your child decide what they like to do.,
Understand their ability at their age.,
Have ongoing conversations with the kid.",How to Encourage Kids to Exercise if They Dislike Sports1," Just because sports like football, baseball, hockey, or soccer are widely popular doesn't mean that the kid will enjoy them. When thinking of exercise routines for your kids, think outside of the box. Things like dance, martial arts, boxing, gymnastics, swimming, biking, skateboarding, surfing, and skiing are all sports that they can enjoy.Other alternative sports include circus arts, dirt biking, fencing, rock climbing, and rugby.;
, Pressuring a child to do what you want them to do can increase their anxiety and cause them emotional distress. Instead, let your child choose which types of exercise that they will participate in. Allow them to try out different types of sports and physical activities until they tell you that they like a certain sport or exercise., When children are really young, they may not have the cognitive development to understand complex rules or game strategies. Let children between the ages of 6-8 try a wide range of different sports and activities to determine what they enjoy doing the most. It's more important in these developmental years to develop basic hand-eye coordination and motor skills. By 9-12 years old, kids are ready to try out more complex sports and activities and can understand and learn rules. At this point, if you've kept them active, they should know what they enjoy doing.Good sports for kids ages 6-8 include T-ball, running, soccer, swimming, and martial arts.
Great sports for children between the ages of 9-12 are football, basketball, hockey, and volleyball., Talk to the child and ask them about their interests. They may already be interested in joining a certain sport or activity. If this is the case, allow them to pursue the sport that they are interested in. Take notice of their body language and determine if they look depressed, sad, or angry. In addition, pay attention to verbal cues like long pauses in between words. These may all be signs that they feel uneasy or upset with having to participate in the sport.Sometimes children will refrain from telling adults the truth to satisfy them.

Dance with your child.,
Do yoga with your child.,
Create your own games to get exercise.,
Assign physical chores to your child.",How to Encourage Kids to Exercise if They Dislike Sports2," Play music in your house and encourage your kids to dance. If they begin to feel comfortable dancing, they may want to do it in an organized atmosphere. Also, dancing can improve their self-esteem and help build their rhythm if they ever want to learn an instrument. Get into the habit of playing music in the morning and dancing so that it becomes commonplace in your household., If your child doesn't like sports, they may feel more comfortable doing yoga in the house with you. On top of increasing their flexibility and keeping them physically fit, yoga also has mental benefits and can reduce stress and keep them centered. Look up yoga instructions online and involve your child into the sessions when you do them.Getting your kid their own yoga mat will give them a sense of responsibility and ownership over the exercise as well.

, You can create indoor or outdoor games to increase the child's physical activity. Games like freeze tag or indoor or outdoor obstacle courses are non-traditional ways they can get exercise. Think of different games that you can create and make fitness fun.Other activities you can encourage include jump rope, hopscotch, and hula hooping.

, Chores are a great way to get your kid outside. Choose tasks that involve physical activity like raking the leaves, cleaning the gutters, or mowing the yard. Even simple chores like taking out the trash, walking the dog, or bringing the mail into the house involve physical activity."

Provide the child with positive reinforcement.,
Participate in exercise with your child.,
Use exercise as a reward, not a punishment.,
Talk about the positive aspects of exercise.,
Don't pressure the child.",How to Encourage Kids to Exercise if They Dislike Sports3," Always try to give positive feedback when you are exercising with the child. Tell them that they are doing a great job and celebrate with them in their victories. Children are prone to self-consciousness and the fear of embarrassment, so the more that you reinforce a good self-image, the more likely they are to succeed.You can say things like, ""Great job, keep going, push yourself, you're doing great!""

, The more involved and dedicated you are to your child's exercise, the more likely they will begin to enjoy it when you aren't around. Start by going on walks or jogs with your child or playing catch. If you are proficient in a certain sport, play it with them and see if they enjoy it. Never force them to play a sport just because you played it, though.

, Using exercise as a form of punishment in your child's development can cause them to create a negative association with physical activity. Avoid forcing them to do push-ups or run laps when they are in trouble. Instead, use it as a reward after they complete a task like finishing their homework or cleaning their room.You can say something like, ""Awesome, now that you finished cleaning your room, we can go outside and throw the ball around.""
Recess is a great example of how physical outdoor activity can be used as a reward for children.

, If the kid still isn't keen on exercise, you may be able to convince them by talking about the positive ways that exercise can impact their life. Talk to them about the positive effect that exercise has on their muscles, lungs, and coordination. Exercise can also help them get better grades in school, make new friends, and sleep better., When you pressure a child to participate in a sport that they don't enjoy, it can affect them negatively, and they are more likely to quit the sport. Instead, create a low-pressure environment. Rather than pushing them to join an organized team, practice drills and have fun in the backyard.This will help them develop their skills without the pressure of having to perform on a team.
Practicing the basics in a low-pressure environment will actually allow them to improve their abilities in a shorter amount of time.

"
"
Limit their TV and computer use.,
Establish a routine.,
Don't budge on the need for exercise.,
Set a positive example.",How to Encourage Kids to Exercise if They Dislike Sports4," Try to limit your child's use of the TV and computer to two hours a day. This will encourage them to participate in more physical activities rather than sitting around. To enforce this, don't put TVs in individual bedrooms and put the computer in a shared and open space. Set limits for teens on how often they can talk to their friends on the phone and texting., Start small and build up a routine. Begin by doing simple things with your children, like taking walks after dinner or tossing a ball around in the backyard. Make it a point to do it regularly and encourage fun so that it becomes something that they look forward to doing. Once it's embedded into a routine, they will be more likely to participate in the activity without even being asked., Exercise is a critical factor in a child's emotional and physical development and shouldn't be overlooked. Kids that don't exercise are more prone to health problems like obesity and emotional instability. Create a routine and stick to it. Don't make excuses for not exercising and make sure that you squeeze it into your schedule even if you have limited time., Children often take the lead from their parents, so it's important that if you want them to become more active that you also make it a point to be physically active. Exercise in your time off and actively participate in the child's sport of choice. If you have opportunities to practice at home with the child, take them."

Set goals.",How to Run a 6 Minute Mile," Instead of looking at the whole, break down the mile into parts; it's a lot more manageable to work on your skills in 90-second chunks. When you get to that 90-second 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km), start working on your 1/2. When you can do a half mile around 3 minutes, you'll be jazzed to see if you can keep the pace. So skip the unnecessary duress on your knees and break it into pieces.


Psychologically, your brain looks at that 6-minute mile and goes wah-ha-ha-ha-ait a second. 6 minutes? Are you crazy? But 90 seconds of going all out? ...Why not?
;
, That stands for High-Intensity Interval Training and it's quite possibly one of the best things you can do for your mile time and for your overall athletic performance. It's like sprints (as discussed above), but repetitive and cyclical. For example, you might run all out for one minute, rest for one minute, and repeat for 8 or so cycles. Eventually, that 6-minute mile seems like a leisurely walk in the park.


As you get better at it, up the intense periods. Go to 75 seconds of running and after that, 45 seconds of rest. Keep going in small increments until you're up to two 3-minute chunks. Then all you have to do is piece them together!

, When you train, run more than just that goal of 1 mile (1.6 km). Speed isn't the only key -- endurance will get you going, too. So take a break from your speed training and go for a nice, long jog to break up your running routine. When you routinely run 5 miles (8.0 km), the 1 mile (1.6 km) poses way less of a threat.


Use it as a reason to change up your environment. Move your run to the gym, your home treadmill, or a different trail outside. It's about keeping your mind fresh, too!

, The third player here, in addition to endurance and speed, is strength. To propel your body at this speed, you're gonna need to build it up. Jogging the track for miles won't do you as many favors as a hilly track will! Getting your heart rate up and your muscles earning it on inclined terrain primes them to take you to the next level when the ground is flat.


This is a good excuse to change up your routine, too. It's easy to hit the gym or your favorite track at the beginning, but then you inevitably get bored with it and hit autopilot, never reaching your goals. Spice it up by finding a hillier route to keep your mind in the speed zone, too.

, Learn to run a 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) in 1:30, then a 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) in 3:00, then a 3⁄4 mile (1.2 km) in 4:30, and finally try to reach the goal of a 6 minute mile. Find a route where you can easily see the distance markers, grab your stopwatch, and see where your feet take you. It's the only way to know how lofty your goals are -- or how attainable.


That being said, don't feel the need to do this every day. Work on your skills for the majority of the week and then see how far you've come. If you do it every day, it'll just become a drag.

, If that 6-minute goal is because you're a competitive runner, there's some science that can help you get ahead of the pack and get you to the finish line sooner:


Start strong. Unless you're playing the dark horse card, you don't want the pressure of making some ultimate comeback. Hang near the front group initially so you aren't facing a mob of obstacles in front of you.
But don't feel the pressure to be in the lead at first. That person sets the pace, breaks the wind, and feels an enormous amount of pressure from all the people running at their heels. They'll get tired eventually and that's when you make your break for it. Make sure to run your own race. The worst mistake you can make in a middle to long distance race is in the first minute; that is, going out too fast.
If you're running on a track, pass on the straights. If you try to make a go of passing the runner in front of you on a curve, you're actually running a bit further to get around that person. Just a waste of energy, really.
Push yourself in the third lap. Deepen your breathing, smooth out your stride, and push yourself a little more. Your mind will tell you to stop long before your body makes you. If you push yourself a little more than the first two laps here, then your pace will remain constant or improve. You need to feel like you are running faster in the third lap for you to maintain your pace. Also, it is much easier to push yourself to your limits in the last lap, so if you push yourself a little here, it will only improve your time. Once you can see the finish line, you can almost always find the drive to finish strong.
Focus on your form, breathing, and what's in front of you. Also, once you start your finishing kick, focus on still maintaining form and driving your knees a little higher. Do NOT focus on your crowd of adoring fans, your coach, or your feet. Keep your head straight and your eyes on the prize and don't get distracted. A second's look could make or break your time.

, It's a bad habit for a lot of us to breathe at the top of our lungs. Don't do it! Make sure your breaths are deep and coming in through your nose and out slowly through your mouth. Insufficient breathing can wear out your muscles before they wear out themselves.


Try to get into a rhythm while you're running. Take a breath for every 3 or 4 steps. Staying in sync will give you something to concentrate on, too.

, To get your muscles ready to turn into speed machines, you gotta warm up. If you don't, you risk asking them to do things they're not ready to do -- and they'll revolt by ripping and tearing. So do some jumping jacks, some burpees, high knees, butt kicks, and get your body loose and ready.


Cool down after your workouts, too, with a good stretching session. This'll help bring your heart rate down and get your head back down from the rush you've just had, in addition to keeping your muscles safe and not freezing back up.

, Improper form is not only potentially dangerous, but it wastes energy needlessly. To hit that 6-minute mile, you need to be running as efficiently as possible. Here's the gist:


For your upper body, make sure you are looking forward on the horizon and not to either side. Keep your shoulders loose -- if you notice they're stiff, give 'em a quick shake to rid yourself of the tension. Keep your back straight and your elbows at a 90-degree angle, hands in loose fists.
For your lower body, make sure you're hitting the ground lightly (quieter = quicker) with your mid-foot, rolling onto your toes and propelling forward. Lift your knees slightly, keep your strides short, and your feet landing directly beneath you. Aim to feel as if you're springing off the ground.

, Since so much of a good mile time is about strength, working out your body is useful, too. Include squats, lunges, planks, sit ups, and push-ups into your regimen to keep your muscles primed for optimal performance.


Incorporate work with free weights into your routine as well. Do bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, or hammer grabs working your biceps, triceps, forearms, and shoulders. You can work out your arms even when you're just in front of the television, too!

, Your body will not operate at peak performance if it's dehydrated, point blank. Make sure to drink plenty of water each day since you're training so hard, and definitely drink a glass or two before your run. After, too! You'll need to replenish the water your body loses.


Water is by far the best thing you can drink. However, coffee (black) ingested before a run can give your body a jolt of energy. Just don't rely on it and definitely don't go overboard or depend on it the day of a race. You never know how the caffeine will react with your body and digestive system.

, If you were planning to run a marathon, that'd be one thing. But running a mile is very different -- you do not need to carb load or any of that business. You simply need to not eat about an hour before your run (but make sure you've eaten the latest meal), and concentrate on complex carbs, protein and fruits and veggies. And don't run when you're starving!


A piece of fruit (like a banana, an apple, or peach) can give you a natural, safe sugar rush. An English muffin or some oatmeal is good, too.Try energy gels, like Gu, if you're interested. It's a blast of sugar and energy to your system that may be able to make you reach that finish line a few seconds quicker.

, Your body has to carry itself across the finish line. If you're overweight or have extra pounds for the size of your body type, it is going to slow you down. 5 or 10 extra pounds could make a big difference in your health and increases the amount of work your body has to do. If you have it to lose and can lose the weight, then you should work at it to decrease your run time.


That being said, you need muscle even more. So don't start cutting the calories, dropping weight, and expecting to practically fly when all you're doing is losing muscle. If you're an acceptable weight for your height, you're fine.

, Why? Because the alternative is running and eventually hurting yourself. No brainer, huh? And your time will most likely improve, too! So spring for a good pair from a shop that caters to runners. Too many people grab the first pair they like the looks of. No, no, no -- you need to know exactly what to look for for optimal performance. Talk to the clerk about the perfect shoe for your foot. Here's a few pointers:


The heel and upper portion should feel snug, but not tight. You should be able to slide your foot out when the shoe is laced but not tied.
Feet swell naturally throughout the day and during runs, so make sure there's enough toe room -- about a thumb's width of space.And if you want to be doubly careful, buy your shoes in the evening, when your feet are the largest they're going to get.
Try out the shoe. Put the pair on and take a jog around the store or on their treadmill -- just standing in them won't tell you much. You need to make sure the arch of your foot matches the arch of the shoe. You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it, right?
Unless you have something really wrong with your stride that needs to be corrected, don't splurge on expensive orthotics. It is much better to get a good pair of shoes in the first place than spend hundreds of dollars on something unnecessary.

, So much of our accomplishments really more on state of mind than we realize. If you're close to this 6-minute goal, your mindset may be what's mainly in your way. So invest in yourself and this fun, healthy hobby.


Get some workout clothes. There are pieces marketed as specifically for ""runners,"" but at the end of the day, if you're comfortable moving in it, it's good.
Get a nice towel, water bottle, ""fuel"" belt, stopwatch, etc. Material things may not be what the world's about, but having nice stuff to use will definitely encourage you to use them.

, Create a playlist for this goal and fill it with songs around 190 BPM.When your ears are racing, you may find that your feet can't help but keep time. And when your jam comes on, you'll feel that extra burst of get-up-and-go that you just can't resist.


The Internet is full of ready-made playlists for you to choose from if you don't know where to start. You'll need an iPod or some sort of music player, of course!

, Because who doesn't like a healthy dose of competition to get their juices flowing? Just make sure that friend runs around the same speed you do, or better -- a little faster. If they're dragging you down or running laps around you, you might as well be running by yourself.


Or you could take turns with your friend -- makes the timekeeping a lot easier. And knowing someone is standing at the finish line judging you is quite the kick-starter!

, For each week that you run, try to work on having small, attainable goals. The more and more of them you reach, the more motivated you'll be to keep going. Whether it's to run X amount of miles, complete so many intervals, or to shave 10 seconds off every week, set it and keep your eyes on the prize. Those smaller checkpoints will keep you in line.


And be sure to reward yourself! After every 10 seconds shaved off, treat yourself to something you'd enjoy. You may not think 10 seconds matters, but it sure does add up over time. And for that you deserve something!

For the longer term, make a plan, add variety by having a different running workout each time and tweak your routine, when necessary.;
, Space your sessions to allow for recovery. A healthy mental outlook is important too, exercise should not be done fanatically - take the time to recover with active rest. Read ""Fitness Without Exercise"" by Porter and Samford. A sample, revolving routine might be:


Session One - Jogging in Place with four Wind Sprints and First Steps.
Session Two - Front and Backs and Outside Jogging.
Session Three - Side Ladder Drills (with an imaginary ladder) and Jogging in Place with Three Wind Sprints.
Session Four - Side Gliding, Karaoke, Back Circling and an Outside Walking.
Repeat Session One.

, The workouts could be for fitness, to work out stress, for speed, for agility, to have fun, to build strength etc. Complement your life style with your routine, and for ideas examine the training and results for the different track and field and other athletes.

, Read about sports injuries and the surfaces that athletes play on. Carpet can be very grippy and not allow pivoting depending on your footwear.

, Build up to running in place by doing jogging in place for a few months first. Running in place can only be done on the balls of your feet and will add to your speed and give you boundless energy. Vary your workout with time and intensity. Use music or clock to time yourself and turn on the television and do jogging in place during the commercial breaks. Besides time and intensity variations, use different running stances not just running stances but stances of the sports you enjoy.

, Perform this movement by running quickly for a couple yards, stopping quickly, running backwards a couple yards, stopping quickly, running forward a couple yards, and keep repeating this for whatever amount of time you choose. Be conservative in the distance you choose, and be aware, to avoid running into walls, plants, and other objects. At times, try this: Run backwards and walk forward. Count your steps when running backwards. Running backwards is great for correcting the muscular imbalance, below and above the waist, that results from walking.

, Watch the many ladder drills on internet sites, like You Tube and Google Video, and do them on an imaginary ladder. Running in all directions will shape your leg muscles in all areas and prepares you to move in all directions. After doing the basic, side ladder drill, add other side movements like the glide and karaoke.

, This is great for a small workout area and is very enjoyable to do. With this movement, you will not move away from where you are standing and basically involves taking a step away, not planting that step and returning back to the start position. Alternating steps are the most natural and you could do this:


Tap your left foot forward, tap your right foot forward, and repeat several times,
Next tap your left foot sidewards, tap your right foot sidewards, tap your left foot sidewards, and repeat several times.
Next tap your left foot forward, tap your right foot backward, tap your left foot forward, and repeat several times. This is a natural movement.
Add toe taps to all directions and constantly change them like in dancing. Start with the forward, side and back toe taps, and later add some diagonal taps too.
Exaggerate the steps and add upper body movements for balance. Be creative. Do first steps quick to have a feeling of weightlessness.

, This running drill teaches you acceleration, deceleration and pivoting. A common variation of this drill is to crouch down and touch the floor, with your hand, at the turnaround.

, At an oval, joggers run in the same direction, notice the difference by running indoors in the other direction also.

You might want to go to a store that specializes in running gear and apparel, if there is such a specialty shop located near you.
Tell the salesperson that you are just starting out, and have them evaluate your feet to find the best shoes for you.;
, Starting a running plan isn't quite as simple as just lacing up a pair of running shoes and hitting the road. Before you start, it can be a good idea to read some books or magazines so you can learn about the running experience.You can find books on running at your local library if you don't want to purchase anything yet.
There also are a number of blogs and websites that provide information about running for beginners. These can be helpful resources.

, It doesn't really matter whether you decide you want to run outside, or inside on a treadmill. However, you do want to keep your running location consistent, at least when you're just beginning your running plan.If you've decided to run outside, look for a location that doesn't have a lot of hills. You may want to use the track of a nearby high school or university.
Choose a location that's relatively convenient, based on where you'll be before the time you've scheduled your runs, and where you'll need to be after.

, If you want to get into a running program, walking is a good way to build your cardiovascular endurance and get in the habit of exercising. For your initial outings, you should spend more time walking than running.For example, you might start by walking for two minutes, then jogging for one minute. Keep your jogging at a slow pace, and try to go for 20 minutes. Set the walking/running ratio that's comfortable for you.
After a week, increase the length of time you jog. You also might start jogging at a slightly faster pace.
Keep alternating between walking and jogging, gradually decreasing the amount of time that you walk and increasing the amount of time that you jog. Keep it up until you can comfortably jog the entire 20 minutes.

, You don't necessarily need any expensive or specialty clothing to start a running plan – although salespeople at sporting goods stores will certainly try to sell you on all the latest designer athletic apparel.Generally, you want to wear clothes that are loose-fitting and comfortable. Move around and make sure what you're wearing isn't going to ride up or get twisted while you are running.
If you have breasts, consider getting a sports bra, which will provide more support and keep your breasts from moving around as you run, which can be painful.
If you're going to be running outside, you do have the weather to consider. During the colder months, you generally want to dress in lightweight, breathable layers. Look for clothes that have vents you can use to cool off once your core body temperature increases.

, Drinking plenty of water will help you recover more easily after a run, and also can help prevent cramps by enabling your body to better flush lactic acid so it doesn't build up in your muscles.Make sure you drink plenty of water both before and after your runs. You also want to have a bottle of water with you so you can sip water during your run.

, It may sound like a simple thing, but you want to make sure your toenails are short enough that they won't cut into your other toes or wear holes in your socks. Keeping your toenails well-trimmed ensures your feet are more comfortable on runs., If you're alternating between walking and running, keep time with a watch so you can maintain timed sets. Because your pace will differ as well, you might want to avoid listening to music at first. The beat of the music can throw your pace off.For example, if you're doing five minute intervals, you would start out walking for four minutes and jogging for one. Six repetitions of that five-minute interval would equal a 30-minute run.
When you're first starting a running plan, you want your focus to be on running, not anything else. Pay attention to your steps, your breathing, and the movement of your body.

, There are a number of running apps designed for beginners that can help you build a regular running schedule. Many of these apps provide additional information as well as rewards and tips on staying motivated.Some of these apps are free, while others may require you to pay a small fee up-front or to subscribe and pay a monthly fee for access.
For example, the UK's National Health Service has a free ""Couch to 5K"" app with podcasts and social networking features to get you started and keep you on the right track.

, Because you need to get sufficient rest in between your runs, you don't want to start by running every day. For at least the first few weeks, plan on doing a 30-minute walk/run three days a week.Try to schedule your runs at the same time every day so it becomes habit. This may be difficult if your schedule varies from day to day or week to week, but try to find a time when you'll be free every day.

, When you're starting a running plan, it can be easy to overdo it at first – especially if you haven't exercised much in the past and aren't very physically fit. The ""talk test"" is a good way to make sure you're exercising at moderate intensity.Generally speaking, you should be able to talk while walking or jogging, but not carry on a long conversation. Starting your plan with a buddy can help you measure this because you can talk to them instead of talking out loud to yourself, which you might find embarassing.

, Since you're only running three days a week at the start of your plan, you need to include other types of exercise on your non-running days so that you're getting at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise every day.Swimming and cycling are good low-impact options that will improve your cardiovascular strength and endurance.
Yoga is another option that will improve your posture, balance, and flexibility – all of which will help you improve your running.
Whole-body strength training will help build muscles so your running plan becomes easier to manage and you don't get too sore after runs. Strength train with lighter weights and do more repetitions.

, Although you really should get some exercise every day, when you start a running plan you need to ensure your bones and muscles have fully recovered from the repetitive stress and impact of running.Keep in mind that if you're a beginner, it will take your body at least 48 hours to fully recover from a run. This is why when you're just starting, you shouldn't run more than two or three days a week.
On your rest days, plan a brief, non-impact or low-impact workout such as swimming, cycling, or yoga.

, Once you get to the point where you're jogging more than you're walking, you can start going on longer runs. Within a couple of months, you'll be at the point where you can comfortably jog for an hour.Keep in mind that at this point you're still jogging at a relatively slow pace. This helps your bones and muscles get used to the repetitive impact.
Each month, double your interval time. If you started with five-minute intervals for 30 minutes, on the fifth week you should start doing 10-minute intervals for 40 minutes.

, When you can comfortably jog at a relatively slow pace for 60 minutes, you're ready to start upping the pace. As with your running and your interval time, you want to do this gradually.You can follow the same interval plan that you did with walking and jogging, but this time you want to jog at a brisk pace during the old jogging intervals, and jog at a slow pace during the old walking intervals.
Follow the same plan, but keep in mind that this may take longer than the initial walk/jog phase of the plan. Have patience and be careful not to overdo it.
Adding some strength training work to your overall exercise program can help you develop more speed.

, Hill training is a good way to build strength so that you can become a faster runner. Start with slight hills and work your way up to steeper inclines. Working against gravity will train your body to run faster on flat ground, much the way a baseball player swings a weighted bat before stepping up to the plate.Do your hill training in intervals, just as you did the rest of the running plan. Run up the hill faster, but when you run down the hill try to run more slowly. Control your movement going downhill – don't simply let gravity pull you.

, Strong technique will help reduce the risk of injury and can keep you from developing problems or conditions later on. When you're just starting out, you may want to work with a running coach who can assess your technique and help you correct any issues.Avoid looking down at the ground or hunching your shoulders. This can cause neck and back problems as well as restrict your breathing.
Bend your arms at 90-degree angles and swing them forward and back to help propel you forward. Avoid side-to-side movement or swinging your arms across your body.
If you lean forward slightly and keep your hips forward, you can prevent low back pain. This also helps you land correctly on the middle of your feet, rather than on your toes or heels.

, Once you've been running for a few months, check with local running groups or nonprofit organizations and find out when the next 5K is being held in your area. A race gives you a goal to reach for.Don't think of the race is a competition between you and the other runners, many of whom likely are far more experienced than you. Rather, your first race will set your baseline against which you'll measure later times.
For your first race, you may want to get a map of the race course and run it a few times before the day of the race so you have a little familiarity and can set your pace.

Before you start, be sure to drink plenty of water.,
Be sure that you get a good stretching in.,
Try listening to music.,
When starting, if there are tons of people in front of you at the starting line, don't push to be first.,
Start off slowly.,
Be smart and think smart.,
In the middle of the run, try to keep your mind off things that you forgot to do.,
Always try to find the finish line if you can see it.,
At the end, (You should know you're towards the end when you see the finish line), Take that energy you left and let it all out.",How to Run a Mile Quickly," You'll want to drink approximately .25 of your weight but in ounces. If you drink too much, you will get a cramp which is sure to slow you down. But before the run it isn't all about water.;
, Which includes Hamstrings, Thighs, calves, Biceps, triceps, and your back. You should feel loose and ready to run!

, What also helps to pump you up for the run is music. But you can listen to whatever as long as you like it. But if you don't like it, it won't pump you up. So don't listen to heavy metal to look cool, listen to if it helps you pump it up.

, Go farther back so you have room. Eventually every one will shift around, including you.

, At about a ten minute mile pace. Which means go slow. A jog basically. If people take off running, it may urge you to go and sprint, but you'll lose all your steam in like 30 seconds.

, Sooner or later you'll pass people quickly! You will still have enough energy to keep going. If you feel like you don't have enough, slow it down or take some swigs of water. Then you should be going a little faster.

, Try to keep your mind focused on form and breathing properly. Like in through your nose and out through your mouth always saves energy. But if you can, just keep going with whatever you breath like. Try to sing a song in your head if you can't carry a portable music player with you.

, If you can start to count your steps to see how far you have to go. If you can't see the finish line just keep going.

, As fast as your legs will carry you. Feel the wind in your face and know that it's pride. And once you cross, drink another .25 of water. And also breathe through your nose, it will make you stop panting."

Strengthen your bones by building bone tissue through exercise.,
Wear proper running shoes.,
Start out slowly if you are just getting back into exercising.,
Do low-impact weight bearing exercises to begin with.,
Try some high-impact weight bearing exercises.,
Strengthen your muscles to prevent broken bones.,
Cross train to make sure your whole body gets stronger.",How to Prevent a Stress Fracture1," When you exercise, the physical activity you are doing causes new bone tissue to form, making your bones stronger. In particular, weight-bearing exercises can boost your bone tissue.Weight-bearing exercises include activities that make you move against the force of gravity (ie. jumping, running, etc.) while maintaining an upright position.;
, Running shoes that are meant for high-intensity workouts can help to keep your bones stress fracture-free. These shoes are designed to absorb the force put on your bones when you do weight-bearing exercises. Go to a shoe store and talk to an attendant about shoes made for your specific sport and needs., Another way to get a stress fracture is by suddenly demanding more of your body than you have in a long time. Do not just jump right in to the most extreme workouts you can think of. When your body is not used to exercise, your bones can be pretty weak. When you do work your way up to more intense exercises, do not force yourself to do them for long periods of time where you begin to feel uncomfortable.If you work at a job where you sit at a desk all day and want to start exercising more, do not begin by trying to run a marathon. Work your way into intense exercise by starting out walking, increasing how far you walk each day, and eventually moving into running. Soon enough you will be running further distances.

, Low-impact exercises are a good choice to start with if you are just getting back into an exercise routine or have a condition like osteoporosis.Low-impact exercises include:


Doing low-impact aerobics.
Walking quickly on a treadmill or on an outside route.
Trying out the elliptical machine.

, High-impact exercises can help to build up your bone’s tissue. However, if you have a bone condition or have broken a bone in the past, talk to your doctor before starting up a high-impact workout routine because you could injure yourself.High-impact exercises include:


Tennis.
Jumping rope.
Running or jogging.
Doing high-impact aerobics.

, Muscle-strengthening exercises are exercises where you move something, be it a weight or yourself, against gravity. When your muscles are strong, you are less likely to fall and get a fracture of any kind. Muscle-strengthening exercises include:


Yoga and pilates.
Lifting weights and using weight machines.
Doing crunches and other muscle-building exercises.

, Alternating your daily exercises will help to avoid putting repeated stress on one particular part of your body. Try to alternate between low and high impact exercises each day.


For example, running every day can put more stress on the bones in your feet and legs than if you were to run every other day, and replace certain days with biking or indoor rock climbing.

"

Increase your intake of calcium.,
Get plenty of vitamin D each day.,
Drink more green tea.,
Eat fresh food, rather than canned food.",How to Prevent a Stress Fracture2," Almost all of the calcium in your body gets stored in your bones and teeth, making them stronger. When you don’t get enough calcium in a single day, the calcium will go directly to your bloodstream, rather than to you bones. When you continue to not get enough calcium over several days or weeks, the calcium that is stored in your bones will become depleted, making your bones weaker. A high calcium diet can keep your bones strong and prevent stress fractures.


You can take calcium supplements each day. The recommended amount for adults ages 19 to 50 is generally 1000 mg of calcium a day. However, it is always good to talk to your doctor before taking new supplements.You can also eat your daily amount of calcium. Calcium-rich foods include: beans, broccoli, figs, fortified breakfast cereals, seaweed, spinach, tofu, nuts and seeds such as almonds, sesame, pistachio and hazelnuts, and dairy products like milk and cheese.

, Your body needs vitamin D to absorb calcium correctly. Without enough vitamin D, your body has trouble storing the calcium in your bones and instead keeps most of your calcium in your bloodstream. Because of this, your bones get weak and you are more likely to develop a stress fracture. You can get vitamin D in two ways: through exposing your skin to sunlight, and through your diet. Adults 19 to 70 should try to get about 600 IU of vitamin D a day.Sunlight: When you spend time outside in the sun, your body absorbs vitamin D directly from the sunlight. If you are concerned about getting burned or that your climate is too hot to be in the sun in the middle of the day, you can spend time in the sun between 6 am and 8 am.
Diet: Foods that contain vitamin D include cod liver oil, fish, fortified cereals, oysters, caviar, tofu, soy milk, salami, ham, sausages, dairy products, eggs, and mushrooms.

, Green tea is thought to improve bone density, making your bones stronger. Green tea contains catechins (also referred to as tea polyphenols) which are compounds that stimulate bone density growth. This tea also stops excessive osteoclasts, which can slowly begin to dissolve your bones.Try to drink green tea every day.

, Canned or packaged food tend to contain more phosphoric acid than fresh food. While phosphoric acid in small doses will not do much harm, getting too much of it may affect the calcium in your bones by decreasing the calcium levels. This in turn can make your bones weaker.Phosphoric acid is primarily found in sodas.

Be prepared by knowing the symptoms of a stress fracture.,
Be aware of the risk factors that can lead to a stress fracture.,
Know how a stress fracture is diagnosed.",How to Prevent a Stress Fracture3," If you are concerned about your bone health and think you may be at risk of developing stress fractures, it is helpful to know the symptoms of these fractures so you can deal with it right away if you develop one. These symptoms include:


Pain: It will intensify when you put your weight on the bone or do physical activity, and will decrease when you rest. The pain is often described as sharp and pulsating.
Tenderness in the area of injury: When a stress fracture occurs, the area around it becomes inflamed. The swelling and injury will make the area around the fracture very tender.
Bruising in the area: When you blood vessels break because of a force or blow, your skin will form a bruise. Blood leaks out of the blood vessels and results in red, black or purple skin mark.
Muscle spasms or numbness: When the muscle fibers in the injured area stretch or get torn, the muscle fibers contract at the same time and tight. This results in insufficient blood flow to the affected area. This leads to spasms and an odd feeling or numbness in the affected area.

, Some activities, conditions and lifestyle choices can put you at a higher risk of getting stress factors. If you are concerned about stress factors, or have had one in the past and would like to prevent it in the future, it is helpful to know the risks. They include:


Being an athlete. Sports like tennis or track that require the repetitive stress of your foot striking the ground causes trauma that can lead to stress fracture.Increased activity. An abrupt increase of activity in your life when you are moderately out of shape can lead to a stress fracture.
Having foot problems. People with foot problems can be more vulnerable because of an unequal distribution of force on your feet.
Osteoporosis. This condition makes your bones weak, which increases the chances of getting a stress fracture.
Eating disorders. If you do not get healthy amounts of calcium and vitamin D each day, your bones can become weak.

, If you are concerned you may have a stress fracture, go to the hospital or your doctor’s office. There are several different methods used to determine whether or not you have a stress fracture. You will also be asked to supply some information, like medical history.Your doctor may:


Ask for your medical history and carry out an extensive medical examination.
Do an x-ray of the area that is bothering you.
Get a CT scan done for smaller fractures.

Prepare for running out in the cold, by thoroughly stretching the lower body and upper body prior to exercising.,
Stretch the upper body muscles.,
Stretch the muscles in the legs.",How to Prepare for Running in the Cold1," By stretching the muscles, you help to loosen tight muscles, which helps prevent you from sustaining a potential injury. The stretching also helps to warm up the muscles by increasing the oxygen and blood flow throughout the muscles.

, These muscles include the biceps, triceps, wrists, shoulders, upper back muscles, mid back muscles and lower back muscles. This also includes larger muscle groups that make up the interior and exterior muscles in the back, such as the shoulder blades and latissimus dorsi.

, Perform calf stretches, inner thigh and outer thigh stretches, hip flexor stretches, ankle stretches and shin stretches. Also, stretch the quadriceps, hamstrings and gluteus maximus.

"

Begin slowly.,
If you’re out of shape, and especially if you’re pretty overweight (20-plus pounds or more), start by walking 20-30 minutes, a few times a week.,
If you feel you’re ready for running now, or if you’ve done the above walking routine for at least a month and are ready to incorporate running, start with run-walking.,
If you think you can run without the walking, do it for short periods at first — 10 minutes, then 12, then 15, and so on.,
Remember that the key principle is this: your body will adapt if you give it time.,
Accept that you’ll be tempted to ignore this advice and be more ambitious.",How to Motivate Yourself to Run Regularly1," Most beginners try to go too long or too hard; this is a mistake. You end up getting too sore (some soreness is normal at the beginning of any new activity) or worse, injured.;
, After a few weeks of this, start doing some faster walking intervals — quick walking for a minute or two, alternated with slower walking.

, That’s warming up with walking for 5-10 minutes, then jogging for a minute or so, alternating with walking rest periods.

, Add some time every 2-3 runs, but don’t be too quick to add the distance. And don’t add faster paced running in yet.

, Start slowly, let your body adapt to that, then gradually gradually add time. Later, when you’re used to running (after a couple of months), you can add intensity.

, But don't ignore it; you’ll have a much better experience with running for following it.

Put on sweat resistant undergarments.,
Wear undergarments, sports bras, tank tops and biking shorts or pants that are moisture resistant.,
Use moisture resistant socks when running outdoors.",How to Prepare for Running in the Cold2," This clothing wicks away moisture from the body, which is imperative to staying warm in cold weather.;
, You can then layer your regular clothing on top of these undergarments.

, During the colder months, there is often excess moisture in the air and on the ground, whether it be snow or rain puddles. Keep your feet warm by wearing socks that keep moisture away from the feet.

"
"
Staying warm is imperative to a good workout when running in cold weather, so you lessen your likelihood of straining or pulling muscles when you run.,
Layer your shirts and pants.,
Wear a beanie or wear a hat that covers the head and ears.,
Purchase hand warmers at a sporting goods store and invest in some very warm lightweight gloves.",How to Prepare for Running in the Cold3," Staying warm protects you from getting sick., Wear an undershirt, a regular shirt, a sweatshirt and a hoodie. Wear 2 pairs of pants or wear thermals underneath your regular workout pants.

, By keeping the head and ears warm, you are less likely to become cold. This is because the heat from the body escapes through the top of the head. Therefore, when you sweat a lot, it is very easy to feel uncomfortably cold when exercising in frigid temperatures.

, Keeping the hands warm during cold weather is imperative since cold air can lead to cracked, dry skin and frigid fingers and hands.

"
"
Get a running partner.,
Make a rule: Just lace up your shoes and get out the door.,
Focus on the enjoyment of it.",How to Motivate Yourself to Run Regularly2," Find someone who is a wonderful person to have a conversation with so that you can really look forward to your runs together. It helps to find someone who is reliable too, and that you make sure to wake yourself up and head out the door on time to meet them; you don’t stand your running partner up in the dark! Find someone to meet up with, and you will rarely miss a run.

, That’s all you have to do. The secret is – you’ll run once you get out the door. You don’t have to run long, but as long as you run a little, you’ll continue to build up the habit.

, Don’t focus on how hard it is, or you’ll never keep doing it. Think about the beauty in the surroundings as you run. Enjoy the quiet and solitude, or the conversation if you have a running partner. Use it for contemplation, for stress relief, for release.

"
"
Don't just run.,
Run 3-4 times a week.,
On the alternate day, do strength training.,
Take breaks too.",How to Motivate Yourself to Run Regularly3," Also do strength training.

, Don't ever miss to do stretching for 15 minutes after run.

, This is essential for building up your leg and mid section muscles. Something like the following is useful to try:


One leg squat
One leg balance
Stretching
Glutes building exercise
Focus on the calves and quads
Core exercise.

, And reward yourself for reaching milestones. Strength training added in will make your running experience better day by day.

Consider joining a running club.",How to Keep Running During Snow Season," Lots of people feel intimidated at first to start training outdoors but actually cold weather is ideal for running in. The colder the weather, the less heat stress the body has to go through, which is why so many marathons are held in October and November.Boosting your morale and actually looking forward to your run will make you much more likely to stick with your new running routine.


Think about what some of your main motivations are for running in the snow. For example, you may have some personal goals, such as preparing for a race or wanting to lose weight. Keep these goals in mind as inspiration.
Exercise has been shown to help beat the winter blues, particularly for those suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Running outside helps even more (regardless of the presence of clouds) than indoor light treatments in less time.If you have a hectic work or family schedule, think of the time you spend running outside as your “me-time.” We all need alone time and so running outside can be a great ritual for you to temporarily get away from it all.
Another potential motivator could be staying healthy through the holiday season. The snowy season is packed with gluttonous holidays filled with alcohol, heavy traditional foods, and sugar-laden desserts. You can offset those calories and stick to a healthier regime by scheduling time to run outdoors.;
, Always check the weather before going out on your run. Just because it’s snowy, doesn’t mean that it’s cold enough that you risk getting frostbite and you don’t want to overdress or underdress. Generally you should check the wind chill, which is a calculated estimate using the temperature and wind speed of what the cold feels like to the human body.If it is extremely cold and/or windy, that doesn’t mean you can’t run outside. Just be sure to cover up your extremities in particular, such as your fingers, ears, nose, cheeks, chin, wrists and toes, as these are far from moving muscles that generate warmth and therefore have a higher risk of frostbite.Always wear socks, mittens, hats, and whatever else you need to ensure you don’t expose your skin to the harsh weather.
Watch the wind. Wind protective gear is very important if it’s windy and you can easily check online or on a weather app to see what the windchill is for the day. High winds can cause frostbite which burns very quickly if you haven't taken precautions. Use Vaseline or a similar barrier cream to protect your face and use clothing to keep the wind off extremities. Wear goggles or glasses if needed.
If you plan to run outside regularly and live in an extremely cold area, you may want to invest in some running specific gear, such as running gloves or thermal headbands.

, During the cold season, it’s important to be intentional about your clothing choices. If you don’t know where to start or don’t have any specialized running clothes, you may want to visit your local running supplies store for good gear. Otherwise, the most important thing to keep in mind is that layers are your key to success.


Don’t overdress. Many runners assume they need to bundle up to protect themselves against the cold and while you should make sure none of your skin is exposed, don’t wear too much clothing as the heat and sweat can really build up and trapping the water underneath all that clothing can actually increase your risk of hypothermia.Be sure to wear several, light layers and expect a bit of trial and error until you find the right amount of clothing that protects and warms you through the snowy season.
You may want to invest in winter sports gear made of wicking materials that don’t trap in sweat and allow your skin to breathe while still protecting it from the elements. Some of these specialized clothing pieces and materials include fleece, dri-fit running leggings, light wool, and vests.As a general rule of thumb, you should feel cold when you first leave the house and expect your body to warm up within the first few minutes of running. If after running awhile, you realize you are drastically under-dressed, head back home for another layer before you expose yourself too much to the elements.

, Most runners elect to wear their everyday running shoes but, depending on weather conditions, you may want to add some protective gear.


For example, if there is a lot of snow outside, you may want to add some rubber outsoles or traction devices, such as Yaktrax.
You should also take care in selecting your socks before you go out to run. Toe socks should be avoided as they make your individual toes more sensitive to the cold. Wool or other “wicking” fabrics are preferable to cotton as they are less likely to keep in the chill.With all that being said, stay alert throughout your run and avoid slush puddles and ice whenever possible as no shoes will completely protect you from the lack of traction or the cold water.

, When you first start out running outdoors in the cold, you may want to plan routes that stay relatively near your home so that you can get back quickly if there’s anything you need (such as adding or removing a layer of clothing). Once you start getting the hang of it, however, you can plan routes that are more scenic or exciting to keep yourself motivated.

, Warming up before running is always a smart idea to prevent injury and doing so indoors will help warm your body before exposing yourself to the elements.


Try doing some jumping jacks, lunges, squats, or other cardio exercises until you feel your muscles warming up and your heart rate quickening.

, Stick to cleared sidewalks, groomed running trails and places where you are certain that there is no ice or likelihood of drops under snow cover, such as covered drains, holes or hollows. Sticking to routes that are regularly maintained will lessen your chances of injury.

, This is especially crucial in the winter months as there are potential dangers that are more difficult to see, given the snow and meager daylight.


Watch out for other snow sports enthusiasts. If you are sharing your running space with skiers, sledders and snowshoers, be aware of their trail areas and keep out of their way - do not run or jog on ski and sled trails. Skiers and sledders will move faster than you and generally do not expect to see runners on trails during snow season.
Also be wary of tree roots in parks that might be barely covered in snow, especially as the season begins to thaw.

, One of the benefits of running during snow season is that you’ll be motivated to keep moving to stay warm. Don’t overdo it, but do your best to keep a steady, constant pace while you are outdoors to stay warm and keep your muscles loose and limber.If you are running on icy roads or sidewalks, shorten your stride to improve your footing.If you are running in a lot of snow, keep an upright posture and run with long, aggressive strides. This will help keep you upright and lessen the chance of sliding or falling.

, Cooling down is important in any exercise regimen, but doing so outdoors is not a good idea. Instead, gradually decrease your pace as you near the end of your run and then wait until you are indoors to properly stretch.During your run, the air will feel much warmer than it really is but as soon as you stop, you are likely to start shivering especially as the accumulated sweat will further rapidly chill your body. Having a drastic drop in your body temperature is unhealthy and can also cause your muscles to tighten, which may lead to injury., When you have finished running or jogging, do not hang around outside in sweaty clothing. Doing so can bring on hypothermia. Go inside for that well earned spa, sauna or bath and change into fresh clothes!


Your core body temperature drops as soon as you stop running, so change as soon as you get indoors and finish with your cool down. Change any clothes that are damp and put on clean, dry clothes to avoid getting sick., Running during snow season is very different from other times of the year. Your body will become exhausted far more quickly and will use up its energy reserves very quickly. Drink a lot of water to keep hydrated and carry some snack bars or nuts to keep you sustained.

, Seeing as there’s much less daylight during the winter, it’s more likely that you will be running in the dark. Snow further reduces the visibility of drivers and reflective patches or stripes on your clothing will help drivers to see you.


An additional precautionary measure you could take is wearing a headlamp or other lighting.

, Hopefully you will never suffer an injury or accident while running, but it’s always a possibility so do your best to prepare ahead of time.


Let someone know you are going out and when to expect your return. If you live with a family or have roommates, check in with them so that they know to start worrying if you don’t return when you say you will.Always carry some sort of identification and money. If you do have an accident and have to be transported to the hospital, it will be much easier for the staff to identify you and contact your relatives should anything happen.
Carry your cell phone with you. If you do slip on ice or have another type of accident, you will be able to quickly call for assistance and lessen the risks of getting hypothermia.

, Not only will having a running partner provide you with extra motivation on those days when your bed just feels too cozy to leave, but you two will be able to look out for each other and call for help if either of you suffer an injury.

, If none of your friends are up for the challenges of running outdoors in snow and sleet, look to see if there are any local running clubs. It's a lot more fun and safer to run with an organized running club during winter. Health clubs, gyms and sports stores often organize such groups.

, Small Goals first. Not ""I wanna run a marathon"". That's all good and well buddy, but start with ""I'm gonna run a mile first"". It's best if you pick a spot that is a moderate distance at first. You want to push your self and make sure you give your body a good challenge as you run to and from the spot.

, Hydrate, make a play list on your Music player that will be good to run too, think positive thoughts, and eat a light but high energy giving meal, and warm up those muscles then stretch them. We don't want to pull something do we? 

, Just get out and do it! Run to that point! Don't stop, the more you push your self the better you will be. If you get tired and slow down. It's OK! As long as you try to keep going as fast as you have energy for, you will be working on your run, just don't stop!

, Ignore it! Seriously its no big deal and will go away if you just keep running, how long it takes will depend on the person, but it eventually goes away with practice and pushing your self past it.

, This is important as you do not want to dehydrate, sip your water, don't down half the bottle.

, Jog a bit in a circle or a short distance as you slow down after you are done, stand up and keep your head up and back straight to help your lungs to expand. Stand tall good friend, you just ran farther then you have before!

Ensure you are using proper jogging form.",How to Jog Without Any Lower Back Pain1," Back pain can be a sign of shoe wear and tear. Joggers should replace their shoes at least every year, even if they appear to have little wear and tear on the outside.


Use running shoes for jogging and use cross-training shoes for other exercise. There is a great deal of variety in athletic shoes. Running shoes are meant for forward motion and do not provide much support for side-to-side motion. If you are jogging on uneven trails or during a team sport, you will need a shoe that also has side support to prevent injury.
Make sure there is a thumb-width between your longest toe and the end of the shoe. This wiggle room will ensure you have enough space for each footfall. Always buy the right size that is not too tight or loose.;
, This will increase the cushion on the bed of the shoe and prevent fallen arches and other injuries. Foot injuries can also cause low back pain because the structures that support the back are weak.

, This will prevent injury by making sure the feet aren't too flexible.

, The hamstring runs from the back of your thigh and connects with your buttocks and lower back. Runners often have very tight leg muscle, which can cause pull on muscles in the lower back.


Do the knee to chest stretch 3 times on each leg. Lay on your back with your knees bent. Lift 1 knee toward your chest and grasp it with both hands. Pull it lightly toward your chest for 10 seconds. Switch legs. Increase the stretch slightly with each repetition.
Do the single leg stretch 3 times on each leg. Lay on your back with your knees bent. Raise your right leg and grasp it on the back of the thigh. Straighten your left leg onto the ground and try to straighten your right leg up in the air. It can remain slightly bent. Pull your leg gently toward your chest and hold for 10 seconds. Switch legs.
Do a piriformis stretch if you have pain in your buttocks and lower back. Stand next to a tall counter or surface that is approximately at hip height. Rotate your right leg and place it atop the surface. Make sure you are very close to the counter. Lean forward with your back straight. You should feel a deep stretch in your buttocks and hips. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides.

, Choose a rubber track or soft earth over concrete. Jogging is a high-impact sport that causes shock waves to travel up your spine every time you hit a hard surface.

, Walk for 1 to 2 blocks before you start to jog. Start slow and slowly build up speed after the first half of a mile.

, Alternate your jogging sessions with Pilates or yoga to strengthen individual muscles throughout your entire body. Train with light weights or resistance bands 2 to 3 times per week.


Jogging mainly trains your legs, heart and lungs. It is not a total-body workout that will protect your muscles from injury. In fact, if you only jog and do not tone your abdominal, back, shoulder and buttock muscles you are still at risk for back pain and injury.

, Ask a friend or expert to watch you while you run, in order to ensure the source of your back pain is not incorrect running posture or footfalls. The following are things to watch out for:


Do not land on your heels. A proper running motion should strike the ground mid-foot. Striking the ground on the heel will jar your spine.
Ensure your body is aligned directly above the feet. You should not be leaning forward while you run. Check that your hips, trunk and shoulders are all aligned.

Determine your maximum heart rate before you begin your treadmill workout.,
Run or walk on the treadmill until you reach at least 70 percent of your maximum heart rate.,
Use the heart rate monitor on the treadmill.,
Run or walk at between 70 percent and 85 percent of your maximum heart rate for as long as you can.",How to Get The Best Workout On a Treadmill1," All you have to do is subtract your age from 220. So, if you are 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is 180.;
, The American College of Sports Medicine says that when you hit this target, you maximize the amount of fat and calories you burn.

, Most machines in gyms and fitness clubs have a monitor that measures your heart rate; you simply need to put your hands in the designated location.

, When you get tired, slow your pace to a jog or a steady walk and then build back up to the 70 to 85 percent level again.

Pay attention to your surroundings.,
Stay on the sidewalk or multi-use trail.,
Always look both ways before crossing the street or any other lane of traffic flow.,
Familiarize yourself with local traffic laws--and your responsibilities as a pedestrian--whether you're at home or traveling abroad.

,
Predict vehicle movements by looking at the driver inside the car, not by looking at the car.,
Stay sober.",How to Walk With Safety in Mind1," Not only can this save you from inattentive drivers, it also gives you the best chance of spotting early warning signs there might be a problem--such as somebody following you--and makes you look less like an easy victim.;
, If no designated walking path is available, stay as close to the side of the road or parking lot aisle as possible and walk facing the flow of traffic. Note that in the United States, vehicles drive on the right, but in some island nations such as Great Britain and Ireland, vehicles drive on the left.

, Although rare, drivers do sometimes go the wrong way down one-way streets or drive on the wrong side of the road.

,, You'll be able to quickly tell whether the driver is paying attention and aware of you or not.

, Walking while under the influence of alcohol increases your risk on many levels."

Gear up for the running.,
Wear 2 layers of socks.,
Wear running shoes that have decent traction, so you can maintain traction on icy or snowy surfaces.,
Now that you're all geared up, put on your gloves or mittens.

,
Warm up.,
Head outside and make your way to your favorite trail.,
Start jogging!,
Jog home and enjoy a warm cup of tea or water.",How to Jog in Cold Weather," If you can, apply moisturizer on your skin to keep itching and dryness away. Invest in good ski-mask or hoodie that will protect your neck, head and face from bitter wind. Pull a knit or fleece cap over your ears and wrap a scarf around your neck and mouth if you don't have a ski mask. Find a lightweight but warm winter jacket for you to wear. These are usually fleece. Gear up under it with a t shirt (long sleeved or short sleeved) and a sweatshirt. Too warm will cause you to sweat after a few seconds of running. Wear leggings and sweatpants, or long underwear and sweatpants.;
, The inside layer can be a thin tight cotton sock, and the outside layer should be warm, luxurious fleece or cotton sock.

, Trail-running shoes work very well. If there is too much snow, try lightweight boots that bend with you but wick off snow and moisture.

,, Before jogging, jump up and down or run in place. Stretch out tired muscles. Break a sweat.

, Walk for 5 minutes to loosen your muscles. Then stop to take another stretch if you'd like.

, Avoid snowy clumps or jog very slowly over them. Thick areas of snow are maneuverable if boots are worn, but ice should be carefully and slowly walked over. Safety is number one. Your biggest danger when jogging in cold weather is water or ice on the ground. Slipping and falling onto ice hurts. No matter how you want to burn those calories, do NOT run over these patches! Feel the cool wind on your face and breathe in the fresh air. Keep your breathing even.

, Doesn't jogging in the winter feel good?

,Maintain a speed which you can sing a song without running out of breath

,
At first it will feel like your muscles will give out, but keep pushing.,
Grab any music playing device!,
Get a pedometer.,
If you are in pain, slow down to a walk and let your muscles rest for about 5 minutes, but no longer than 10 and then continue to trot again.,
Never give up!",How to Lineman Trot (Jog/Walk),";
,,,, After about 30 seconds from the moment you feel the burn in your legs, just focus on breathing and you will soon forget about the burn in your legs, and eventually your body will become used to it.

, Although its optional; having music can really give your mind something to focus on for anyone who feels the burn in their legs.

, Optional but highly recommended. At first you may not be able to do a trot for long, but soon you will be able to do it without stopping. And until you can do it without stopping, get a pedometer to measure how much trotting you did and for how long, compared to jogging.

, If the pain has not gone away and you are finding yourself unable to walk or nearing that point, seek medical attention immediately.

, Like most things in life that require hard work, you will find yourself wanting to stop and go inside after a small workout. Don't!!! Or else you will find that every time you feel that burn that you don't like, you give up.

Stop jogging if you experience acute lower back pain.,
Restrict your activity for 2 days.,
Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Ibuprofen.,
Apply ice packs to the affected area for 10 minutes at a time.,
Apply moist heat, such as a microwaveable rice bag or a shower, onto muscles that are in spasm.,
Do very gentle stretching exercises.,
Do low-impact cardiovascular exercise, such as walking, swimming or elliptical training for 1 to 2 weeks after the injury.",How to Jog Without Any Lower Back Pain2," This is most likely a sign of muscle strain. Lookout for symptoms of nerve pain or numbness in your hips, legs and feet.


Get a doctor's appointment if you are experiencing extreme pain or numbness in your legs. This could be a sign of a structural problem, such as a herniated disk impinging on nerves.

, You don't need to lay in bed, but you should avoid exercising and excessive sitting or standing.

, This can bring down the swelling from a muscle strain. Take the bottle-recommended dose for 2 to 3 days.

, Do this 3 to 5 times per day, leaving a few hours between applications.

, It is a good idea to wait 2 to 3 days before applying heat to a sprain, because it can increase inflammation.

, Start to take small walks throughout the day. These exercises can start to stretch the muscles and increase circulation.

, After the back pain recedes, start with gentle jogging and preventative measures.

Increase the speed on your treadmill to the point where you are walking or running with intensity.,
Start at a low speed and build your way to a higher speed gradually.,
Run hard during intervals.",How to Get The Best Workout On a Treadmill2," This will raise your heart rate and increase the distance you cover as well as the number of calories you burn during your workout.

, For example, walk for 5 minutes at a speed setting of ""2"" and then raise it to a ""5"" for 10 minutes. Continue increasing the speed until you are running.

, Set the speed on your treadmill to an easy jog, and then increase it for 3 to 5 minutes so you are running fast. Then, bring it back to a jog.

Gradually increase the incline level.,
Look for pre-programmed settings on your treadmill.,
Combine different incline levels with different speed intervals.",How to Get The Best Workout On a Treadmill3,", Raise it to a 3 and then a 5, continuing until you feel like you are walking or running uphill. This will give your legs and lower body a great strength workout and increase the number of calories you burn.

Wear highly visible clothing, especially if you're walking during the morning, evening or night hours or in reduced visibility.,
Avoid wearing expensive jewelry that might make you a target for robbery.,
Walk with a partner whenever possible, or at least tell somebody reliable which route you're taking and when you'll be back.,
Don't listen to a portable music player as you walk.",How to Walk With Safety in Mind2," If you're walking in the dim or dark, wear clothing with reflective tape on it. If you don't have any reflective clothing, you can purchase reflective tape to sew or glue onto the backs of your walking shoes, around the cuffs of your jacket and pants, or in stripes down your arms and legs.

, It won't help your workout anyway.

, Then stick with the plan.

, This makes you look like an easier target, and makes it hard to stay properly aware of your surroundings.


If you can't give up on listening to music as part of your workout, at least ditch the ear buds in isolated areas where you need to be the most aware of your surroundings and personal safety.

Use a dependable dumbbell, one that the plates will not slide off.,
With the dumbbell between your legs, grasp the dumbbell with your chalked (magnesium carbonate) hand.,
Pull the dumbbell with you arm straight and with your legs and back.,
Once you have the above step wired into your nervous system, add a little backswing of the dumbbell after lifting it off the floor and before pulling.,
The back (spine) should not be twisted, or rounded or arched.,
At the end of the pull, when your body is almost straightened, use your calves, a shoulder shrug, front deltoids and biceps to power clean the dumbbell to your shoulder.,
Do not press the dumbbell yet.,
After pressing the dumbbell to lockout, lower it with control to the shoulders and to the floor between your legs.,
Observe your back, in the bottom position, in this and other lifts to check that your back is straight and not twisted.,
Use control when lowering the dumbbell.,
Finished.

",How to Do a Dumbbell Clean and Push Press," The hex locked, fixed weight dumbbell or a spin locked dumbbell are good choices. The hex locked dumbbells are adjustable, but not easily, with an allen wrench. fixed weight dumbbells are solid dumbbells, they cannot be disassembled and there is absolutely no chance that a plate will fall on you (there are no plates). The disadvantage with solid dumbbells are that there is some torque because unlike the hex locked and spin lock, there is no revolving sleeve. The spin lock dumbbell has a collar that is threaded on so it is safe, and the disadvantage of this dumbbell is that the bar protrudes out on both ends.;
, The dumbbell's initial position on the floor is between your legs (straddled). The other hand is placed on the lower thigh (of the same side the hand is on, i.e. if the dumbbell is grasped with the right hand, the left hand rests on the left lower thigh), and should also be chalked. Chalk can be bought at sporting goods stores and is used to absorb perspiration thus strengthening the grip.

, The other arm is bent and is pushing down on the lower thigh (this is like when your are getting out of a chair, and press your thighs with your hands, for extra strength). The pull should be accelerated up and not yanked up.

, The short backswing gives the lift a little head start and feels natural because this lift, more than the hang dumbbell power clean, is elliptical in its upward path.

, The knee should track over the feet. For the initial pull the weight should be throughout the foot and not on the balls of the foot.

, Use a slight dip at the end to get under the dumbbell.

, Stand up straight first, bend your knees and forcefully push the dumbbell to full extension with your legs, hips, lower back and the muscles normally used for pressing.

, After each repetition, place the dumbbell on a foam kickboard. A hallway runner folded several times works as well to gently drop the dumbbell on. The kickboard shortens the movement a little, dampens the noise, and protects the floor. This is one repetition. Alternate with the left side hand during the set or from set to set.

, Do not lift a dumbbell or any object with a rounded or twisted back. The spine must, for the most part, be rigid and not twisted because the spine was not made to have a lot of rotation. Rotate your body around your spine. Look at golfers when the swing their clubs, they are not rotating their spine - they are twisting their body around their spine.

, When observing lifters lower weights, it may look like they are just letting it fall. Unless they are using bumper plates, they are actually controlling the weight on its descent to avoid damage to the floor, the equipment and to avoid damage to their shoulders and back. With a good padding on the floor, the negative would be more like a controlled drop, but nowhere close to a free fall drop used by Olympic lifters dropping their barbells with bumper plates. With too much control, in the negative, the biceps will be the weak link. Use good form when lifting and lowering the dumbbell.

Power: The motor ensures a good exercise and a long life out.,
Determine how the treadmill will be used.,
Decide the speed range of the running machine.,
Think about workout time.,
Decide where to place the treadmill.,
Don't forget about its maintenance.,
Ensure that you have warranty.",How to Buy a Treadmill for Your Home,";
, For example, if you use the treadmill just for walking, a basic model would be suitable for your needs. If you use the treadmill a lot, you should go for a high durability treadmill.

, There are two types of treadmill’s controller:



Analogue control treadmill changes the speed faster than the digital control ones, but the sensor can over time be interfered with via external impacts like overheating, dust...

Digital control treadmill has a high durability and cannot be affected with external impacts, making it much better and safer. Thanks to this control system the speed changes smoothly.

, For example, a tall person will have a bigger stride and would benefit more from a larger running space.
The number of users will tell you how heavy duty the machine should be and a model with variety of programmes could be a good choice for different needs.

,,
Running belt: It should not be any larger than necessary and stay away from overly thick belts. The more belt surface area, the harder the power system has to work to keep it all going.
Shock absorption: A cushioned running deck with good shock absorption is essential for reducing wear and tear on the joints. Make sure the running deck has a shock absorption system with a minimum of 6 pads.
Incline: It help to burn calories much quicker. There are two types of inclination:

Manual: Manually adjust to change the level.
Automatic: Use a motor that change the inclination.


Noise: All treadmill makes noise, but a reasonably quiet machine generally means less friction and wear.
Heart Rate Control: get a treadmill that measures your heart rate, this is vital information to see when you exercise. The best option is a running machine with heart rate sensors.
Programmes: provide variation in your workout. If you just want the running machine for walking or running at the same speed, you will not need a treadmill with variety of different programmes.
Folding: A folding treadmill makes storage and transportation pretty easy.

, Think about the use you will give to the running machine lose weight, tone up, rehabilitate.

, If you use the treadmill just for walking, a basic model would be perfect. But, if you love running, a treadmill with a high speed is the machine you are looking for.

, A normal use would be around 30 minutes per day for two people. For every extra 30 minutes go for a better quality treadmill.

, If you live in a reduced space, purchasing a treadmill that can fold up into a standing position for easy storage may be your best option. In addition to the size of the unit itself, it also is important to leave some space around the machine while it is in use.

Calculate your LBM using your height and weight.,
Calculate your LBM from your body fat percentage.,
Learn your body fat percentage from a skin fold assessment.",How to Determine Lean Body Mass1," Though not a perfect measurement, you can calculate a good estimate of your body fat percentage just using a formula with your height and weight. Enter your weight in kilograms for “W” and your height in centimeters for “H” into this equation to get your lean body mass (in kg):Men: Lean body mass = (0.32810 × W) + (0.33929 × H) − 29.5336
For women: Lean body mass = (0.29569 × W) + (0.41813 × H) − 43.2933
Note: 1lb = 0.453592kg, and 1in = 2.54cm
You can also go the easy route and use an online calculator like this one here.;
, Use a technique listed below to determine your body fat percentage. Divide your percent body fat by 100 to make it a decimal, then multiply that by your total weight. For instance, if you weigh 200 pounds and have learned that your body fat percentage is 20%, multiply 200 x 0.20. This is your fat in pounds (200 x 0.20 = 40 lbs). Subtract that from your total weight to get your lean body mass; in this case, 200 - 40 = 160lbs of lean body mass!


It doesn’t matter if you calculate your weight using pounds or kilograms as long as you use the same measurement throughout your calculations.

, A skilled practitioner can estimate your body fat percentage by pinching three, four, or seven different parts of your body and measuring the skin fold thickness with calipers. Learn your body fat percentage by plugging these numbers into a formula or using a conversion table.This is a relatively inexpensive option, but the results may not be very accurate.Some trainers at the gym, personal trainers, or sports therapists may be skilled in this technique. Find someone who does it often and knows how - check at your gym!

When buying hiking poles, buy the ones that are easily adjustable such as those with the twisting lock.,
Cut two short lengths of cord and tie your retracted hiking poles together when you are not using them.

,
Before using these poles, you should do some upper body exercises.,
Adjust your pole lengths to heights a bit higher than if you were using a cane.,
Shorten the poles when going uphill and lengthen them when going downhill.

,
After a rain, some parts of your hike will have ruts with water in them, use your poles here and walk on edge of the trail.,
Generally, adjust poles so they are the same height.,
When scrambling, toss your poles to where you are getting to.,
Make a shoulder strap and carry the two poles behind your back for when you are not using them.

,
Use the poles like when you are walking by swinging your arms naturally.,
For a change of pace, use the two poles together like how cross country skiers do.,
Hold the poles in different ways to avoid hand fatigue and in some cases to maximize their use.",How to Walk With Two Hiking Sticks," The higher priced ones have more durable hand grips, but otherwise the lower prices ones' locking mechanisms are sturdy.;
,, A low intensity chest and upper back exercise with light dumbbells or cables will do. Washing a car, housework, or some other lite activity can get your upper body in condition for using these poles also.

, On the trail, you must have some leeway because of the uneven ground.

,, Before walking on the edge of a trail, inspect the edge for safety reasons. If the other edge is safer, use that other side.

, When your arms get fatigued, adjust the pole heights. In some situations, where the ground is sidewards sloped make one hiking pole longer than the other. For example, if you are going through a long stretch where one of your poles is in a rut, adjust that pole's height higher.

, In other cases, scramble with one hand and hold the poles in the other.

,, Mimic the poling techniques of cross country skiers.

, When using the poles, in unison, alternate the leg you are assisting. Be creative, discover what works through experience and enjoy the process.

, For example, holding the pole handle in the middle of your palm, like a walking stick with a rounded end, is very strong.

Time your isometric effort.,
Mimic the various free weight exercise with isometrics.,
Be creative and do isometric exercises that cannot be done with a barbell or machine.,
If you are using isometrics over a full range of motion, then test your strength with a free weight with a full range of motion.,
Train with isometrics after training with free weights.,
Before testing your strength, you must have kept a training log that had sufficient detail concerning sets, duration of an isometric effort and the intensity level.,
To convert what you can do with a free weight:


Add the total amount of isometric work you have done.,
When choosing a weight for your top set, you must also look at your training log and estimate your strength level based on your long term training.,
You must have technique.",How to Convert Isometric Strength to Isotonic Strength," Choose short efforts, between 2.5 to 10 seconds, and do many sets, usually, to cover a full range of motion.;
, With a power rack type of setup, it is very simple to mimic isometrically the press, bench press, squat, deadlift, shrugs, pulls, cleans and curls.

, For example, pushing a wall may strengthen your legs but your strength will transfer over to the strongman stunt of pushing a car and not for doing a barbell squat.

, If you are testing your strength with a partial range of motion isometrically, then test your strength with a partial motion.

, For example, you have trained with weights for several years at a gym, but you now have very little time to go the gym. Instead, at home you do a quick but intense program of isometric squats in your power rack. There are no weights to change and it is quiet and safe. In essence, to test your strength with a free weight, you must have experience and good technique.

, For example, you did a squat routine with 11 efforts of 7.5 seconds each with the final 3 efforts at high intensity.

, If you did 11 efforts at 7.5 seconds each then you have done a total of 82.5 seconds.
Next, choose a free weight squat set/rep scheme that would take 82.5 seconds. For 82.5 seconds, you might allocate about 20 seconds for the first set, 15 seconds for the second set, and finally 45 seconds for the top set. Time yourself, or someone else, in the amount of squats that can be done for a warm up set and a top set.

, With the squat again, if you have been training seriously with the squat isometrically for a year, then your strength level will be fairly high and your might choose as your top set 90% of your previous free weight personal record. An experienced strongman will know that it takes years to to build strength and one year is not enough to build great strength if you have a full training routine, of which strength is a part of, and other demands such as a job, school, family, socializing, and other interests.

, In your regular squat routine do: isometric squats, calisthenic squats and squats with a dowel on your shoulders. Do the dowel squats for form.

Use a bioelectrical impedance scale.,
Pursue hydrostatic weighing.,
Get a DEXA scan.",How to Determine Lean Body Mass2," You may have seen a bioelectrical impedance scale at your gym or personal trainer’s office. These scales have electrodes you stand on, and they send gentle electricity through your body to measure your body fat percentage (fat and muscle conduct electricity differently).They are safe and you don’t feel a thing. Simply stand barefoot on the scale and follow the instructions.


Some scales will tell you your LBM directly, though most will probably just determine your body fat percentage.
You can purchase one of these scales to use at home to keep track of your body fat percentage over time.
This is an easy-to-use method, but is not always very accurate.

, Hydrostatic, or underwater, weighing compares your weight on land to your weight while completely submerged in water. A skilled technician can then calculate your body fat percentage. This is a very accurate method, but it can cost between $40-60 on average. Find a research lab or performance center who does underwater weighing near you.A “bod pod” (or air displacement plethysmography machine) is similar to hydrostatic weighing, except it uses air instead of water. It is pretty accurate when testing people who are close to a healthy BMI, though may be less accurate for very lean people.Research your area to find one near you.

, A dual-energy x-ray absorpiometry (DEXA) scanner is used like an x-ray – it’s a harmless and very accurate, though probably expensive, procedure. It is usually used to measure bone density and monitor osteoporosis. This is a very accurate option, but you have to see a medical professional that provides DEXA scans. It may also be expensive.Talk to your family doctor for more information.

Start out easy.,
Set your goals.,
Adopt a proper posture.,
Level up your walking.,
Cool down.,
Monitor your progress toward your goal each day.",How to Walk for Exercise Indoors1," If you are new to walking for exercise — especially if you are overweight or lead a sedentary lifestyle — it’s important not to push yourself too hard when you first start walking indoors for exercise. For instance, walk only a mile or two (two to four kilometers). This way, you’ll be able to build endurance and speed over time.Before you begin walking, consult a doctor. Share with your doctor that you intend to begin walking for exercise indoors. Your doctor can give you a checkup to ensure walking is a good exercise for you. This is especially important if you have health issues or lead a sedentary lifestyle.;
, Identify your exercise goals. Are you just walking indoors to increase flexibility and overall health? Or do you have a specific weight you’re trying to get down to? Whatever your goal is, stay focused on it by writing your goal on a piece of paper and place it somewhere prominent like the front of your fridge.Be realistic when setting your goals. “Lose 100 pounds in a month” is not realistic. “Lose 5 pounds in a month” is more realistic.
Don’t feel that you’re locked in to your goal once you’ve set it. You can scale your goal up or down once you begin walking indoors for exercise.

, When walking, keep your head up and eyes forward. Your neck and spine should be aligned. Relax your facial muscles, shoulders, and neck, but tense your stomach muscles slightly. Pump your arms a bit as you walk, but don’t clench your hands into fists. Alternate left and right arms, and let your hands pass by your body at about hip-height. Roll your foot off the ground from heel to toe., There are many ways to get more out of your walk. You could walk further each day to burn more calories. Or you could walk the same distance but increase your speed. Eventually, as you feel more comfortable with your ability to walk indoors for exercise, you should try to do both.Aim to walk at least 10,000 steps each day.
Besides walking faster and longer, walk more often. Instead of walking three days each week, for instance, walk four or five.
Try walking up and down stairs.
Another way to increase the intensity of your walk is to add weights. Place weights in a backpack with well-fitted straps, or add resistance exercises such as calf raises, standing on one leg, or wall pushups. Do not carry dumbbells or wear ankle weights when walking, as this can lead to injury and puts too much strain on your joints.
Try a high-knee walk. A high-knee walk involves lifting your knees as high as possible when stepping off the ground. This increases the intensity of your walk and burns calories faster.If you keep your foot extended outward as you lift your knee, you will give more work to the thigh muscles.

, As you approach the end of your walk, slow your pace down gradually over a period of about five minutes. Once you’re done walking for exercise indoors, do a few simple stretches. For instance, swing one leg backwards and forwards five times as if it’s on a pendulum. Switch to your other leg and repeat.Roll your head around your neck in a slow gentle circle. Rotate first clockwise, then counterclockwise. Rotate five times in each direction.
Tilt your head from side to side 10 times.
Rotate your arms forward five times in small, tight circles with a radius of about 12 inches (30 centimeters), then backwards in circles of the same size. Repeat, but make the circles larger.

, A good way to monitor your progress is by using a fitness tracking device. FitBit, for instance, can monitor how many steps you take, how many calories you’ve burned, your pulse, and how long you walked. These devices automatically log data on your walking habits over time, and allow you to share your walk via social media if you’d like. This is a great way to share with others what you’re doing and get positive feedback on your exercise habits.Of course, you could monitor your progress the old-fashioned way, by keeping a small logbook or journal of your walking habits. Make a note in your log of the date, time you spent walking, and distance you covered.

Do push-ups to work your arms and chest.,
Do handstands against the wall to build your shoulders and back.,
Do dips to work out your arms.,
Do planks.,
Do crunches to build your abs and core.,
Use a gallon of milk, a heavy book, or home dumbbells to perform basic curls.",How to Build Muscle at Home1," Push-ups are the bread and butter of home workouts. Make sure your form is good to get the most out of it. Your spine should be straight and in line with your butt, which isn't sagging. Your palms are generally a little wider than your shoulders, but you can go wider for a better chest workout and narrower for a better arm workout. In addition, you should mix in incline and decline push-ups for better overall muscle growth.


Incline push-ups work different muscle heads. To do them, simply plant your arms on a low coffee table or chair so that you're angled up.
Decline push-ups require your place your feet 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) above your hands, then performing normal push-ups. Remember to keep your head up and spine straight.
Each set should be eight to twelve reps. You might try doing up to three sets.;
, Not for the faint of heart, handstands are nonetheless great multi-muscle workout. To get into position, crouch with your back to the wall. Plant your hands on the ground and ""walk"" your feet slowly up the wall. From there, use your toes for balance, and slowly lower your head to the ground, pushing back up to complete one rep. Try to get three sets of ten in.









If you're too nervous for this, you can cheat with a high table. Place your feet on the table with your thighs and torso hanging over the edge, enough that you can place your hands on the ground. Then do a push-up with your head hanging straight down. This is often called a pike push-up.

, For good dips, you'll need a sturdy bench, table, or chair roughly 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) above the ground. Place your hands behind you on this bench so that your butt is in the air and your knees bent 90 degrees. With your feet firmly on the ground, lower your butt to the ground until your arms are bent at roughly 90 degrees. Push back up. Repeat for three sets of up to 15-20 reps.








, Planks are a great way to work your entire core, and they are easily adapted for an extra challenge. To do one, get in push-up position. However, instead of placing your palms on the ground, rest on your forearms. Tighten your butt muscles and straighten your spine -- you should be able to rest a broom between your neck and butt. Hold this position for one minute, rest, and repeat two more times.


Side planks are when you open your body, resting on one forearm and the outside of the same foot. Again, keep your spine straight by focusing on keeping your butt up.
Plank to Push-up: Start in a plank position with your arms shoulder width apart and your feet hip width apart. Move down onto your forearms so that you are now in a forearm plank, then lift yourself back up to a full plank position. Do 12 reps in each set., Crunches are still some of the best possible ab workouts out there, so get working. Lay on your back with your feet planted and your knees bent. Supporting your neck with your hands, raise your shoulders 6-8"" off the ground, hold for one second, then slowly lower yourself back down. Immediately bounce back up, keeping your eyes on the sky and making your movements slow and deliberate. Aim for three sets of eight to twelve reps.Straight Leg sit-up: Lay on your back with your legs extended fully, the reach your arms up towards the ceiling and perform a sit-up, keeping your legs straight. Bring your arms down, trying to touch your toes, and then slowly lower back down. Do 10 reps., While the rest of the exercises require little to no equipment, most upper body workouts require some sort of resistance in order to be effective. Once you have a weight you can comfortably hold, try out:


Bicep Curls
Tricep workouts

Shoulder raises.Bent Over Rows

Walk in a large building.,
Walk at home.,
Walk on an indoor track.,
Walk at the gym.,
Try a treadmill desk.",How to Walk for Exercise Indoors2," You could walk in a mall, underground shopping center, or large office building. The best private buildings for walking have plenty of wide, open space and lots of room for you pass by others while on foot. They should also have stairs you can go up and down for a more intense workout. Think of large public buildings near you and identify which buildings might best facilitate walking indoors for exercise.If you’re walking for exercise with a baby, you can bring your stroller with you to malls and shopping centers. This will not only give you a great round of exercise, but also give your baby exposure to new, interesting sights and sounds.
Elderly people might also feel most comfortable walking in a shopping center.
Be sure to call ahead to find out what the shopping center’s hours are.

, This is the most convenient place to walk for exercise indoors. If you have a treadmill, you can use it to get a great workout. But even if you don’t you can walk up and down your stairs for an extended period to get your heart pumping. Best of all, when you’re done walking for exercise at home, you can jump right in the shower to clean up.If you’re really cramped for space at home, just march in place. It might seem silly, but it gives you the same range of motion that walking does. Stand in front of your TV and enjoy a movie or show while you march in place.
Treadmill machines cost about $500., If you’re looking for a flat, even surface to walk on, indoor tracks are the way to go. Plus, most tracks tell you exactly how far it is around the circuit, so you can easily measure the distance you’re walking if that’s something you want to do. Many colleges, universities, and high schools allow the public to use their indoor tracks.There may be a small fee for using the track.
Gyms might also have indoor tracks.
Walking around the track might get boring, so bring a portable music player or a friend to talk to.

, If you don’t have a treadmill at home and don’t want to invest in one, or just want an environment more conducive to walking for exercise, the gym is a good option; however, membership fees can be expensive. Shop around for a local gym that isn’t too costly, especially if the only thing you intend to do there is walk.


Once you’re done walking for exercise at the gym, try lifting some weights and taking advantage of the other exercise equipment the gym offers. That way, you’ll get a well-rounded exercise routine.

, A treadmill desk is a slow-moving treadmill with a computer station attached to the console at the front end. They are a great way to get some exercise in while you work. If you have a treadmill at home with enough space for your laptop, you might be able to create a makeshift treadmill desk for yourself. But specially-designed treadmill desks are available from office supply stores, and many workplaces are beginning to incorporate them into their offices too.Wear comfortable running/walking shoes at the treadmill desk, just as you would when walking at the gym.
Walking and working can both be tiring on their own. When combined, they can be particularly exhausting. You might want to work one hour at the treadmill desk, then take a break before going back to it."
"
Get comfortable shoes.,
Wear layers.,
Bring some edibles.,
Use a pedometer.",How to Walk for Exercise Indoors3," Without the right shoes, walking for exercise can be very unpleasant and even painful. Walking shoes should offer adequate arch and ankle support. If you have a pair of shoes that you’re already happy to walk in, continue to use them when walking indoors for exercise. If you don’t have a comfortable pair of walking shoes, however, visit your local shoe store and talk to a specialist. Let them know that you’re looking for shoes for walking indoors. Try on several pairs to find the one that is most comfortable for you.Be sure to pick up a few pairs of comfortable, breathable socks, such as those made from polyester or acrylic., Wearing layers means that you clothe yourself with several thin pieces of clothing on your torso. You can then remove them if you later feel too warm. This is a good idea because you can never know what the temperature of the gym or indoor walking space will be.For instance, you might wear a t-shirt, a long-sleeved shirt, a sweater, and a light windbreaker. If you feel yourself working up a sweat while walking for exercise indoors, remove a layer or two as needed.
Place excess layers somewhere they won’t be forgotten if you aren’t walking at home.

, If you’ll be walking outside your home for a long while, or intend to walk for exercise only as one part of your workout routine, you should pack some water and a snack. It’s hard to work up too much of a sweat while walking for exercise, but it’s a good idea to stay hydrated anyway. In addition, a healthy snack like a granola bar or a banana can help you boost your energy levels if necessary before or after your walk., A pedometer is a small device that tracks how many steps you take. They clip on easily to your clothes or slip into your pocket. At the end of each day, remove the pedometer and record the number of steps you took in a log book or spreadsheet. This will help you monitor your progress and keep you motivated to continue.Once you know how many steps you took each day, try to increase the amount of steps you take each day incrementally until you’re walking indoors for exercise about an hour each day.
If you want even more data about your walking and exercise habits, think about investing in an activity tracking device.

"
"
Find opportunities to walk in everyday situations.,
Walk during a break.,
Make it a habit.,
Walk when you have time.",How to Walk for Exercise Indoors4," Look to integrate indoor walking into your everyday routine. For instance, walk around the inner perimeter of the grocery store before doing your shopping. Take the stairs instead of the elevator (unless you have more than three or four flights to climb). This extra bit of exercise each day adds up.You could also behave inefficiently in order to purposely increase opportunities for walking. For instance, instead of taking all your laundry out of the machine at once, take just one shirt out, then walk to your dresser and put it away. Return to your washing machine and repeat until the laundry is completely put away.

, Use your lunch hour to get some walking time in. If you work in or near a large office building or mall, it’s easy to find time to walk during your break. Walking when you’re on a work break is not only great exercise, but it can help you relax and return to work feeling refreshed. Plus, walking will help you digest your lunch better., Like any exercise routine, make time to walk for exercise each day. Put it in your schedule. This will ensure that you don’t just go walking a few times and then never do it again. Even if you only have 10 – 15 minutes each day to walk, write it in your planner or make a reminder alarm in your phone.Be realistic when scheduling your walking time. Don’t schedule more time than you can actually spend.

, The great thing about walking indoors is that you never have to worry about the sun going down or the weather changing suddenly. There is no bad time to walk indoors for exercise. Identify a time (or a few times) you can walk indoors each day and put it in your schedule. You could choose to walk:In the morning, before work or school
In the late morning or early afternoon, when you break for lunch
In the evening, when you’re home from work and looking for a good way to unwind

"
"
Turn on the TV.,
Bring a portable music device.,
Bring a friend.,
Join a club.",How to Walk for Exercise Indoors5," If you’re walking at home, a good place to put the treadmill is in front of the television. That way, you can enjoy a show or movie while getting a great workout. If you’re at the gym, bring a tablet or phone with a large screen and place it on the console where the treadmill’s controls are. Stream shows from your device while you walk.Many gyms offer treadmills with televisions attached, or in front of the treadmill. Call local gyms to find one that offers this feature.

, One of the great things about walking indoors is that you don’t have to deal with the many challenges that you do when walking outside. Since there’s no automobile traffic, cracked sidewalks, irregular lighting, or roots and branches to contend with, walking while listening to a portable music device is perfectly alright., Walking together is a great opportunity to catch up and bond with a friend or family member. Plus, it will keep you motivated and excited to walk indoors for exercise. If you have a friend or family member who is also looking to get more exercise, invite them to join you.If you can’t get a friend to accompany you, bring a phone (preferably with a wireless headset) to chat with friends and family while you walk.

, There are many walking clubs that exclusively or occasionally walk indoors. Check your local community bulletin or online events calendar to locate a walking club near you.If you can’t find a walking club near you, consider starting one. All you have to do is act as the coordinator. Post a flier in your local library or reach out online through sites like Meetup.com or Craigslist.org."

Use intense bursts of cardio to build leg muscles quickly.,
Do wall sits.,
Do squats.,
Do donkey kicks.,
Try glute bridges.,
Work on your lunges.",How to Build Muscle at Home2," While most people don't equate building muscles with cardio, there is a variety of exercises you can string together to build lean, powerful leg muscles. Take 5-6 exercises and perform each one for 60 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds, then move on to the next one. After you finish all six exercises, rest for 4-5 minutes, then repeat 2-3 more times. You're legs will burn, but you'll quickly whip them into shape:


Jumping jacks
Lunges
Burpees -- do a jumping jack, then drop into a push-up. Repeat.
High Knees -- bouncing from toe to toe lift each knee as high as possible. You want to touch the floor as little as possible.
Lateral Jumps -- jump to one side, landing on one foot, knee bent, then explode back and onto the other foot.
Oblique twists

Box jumps or simple plyometric workouts., With your back to the wall for balance, ""sit"" down so that your knees are bent 90 degrees and your butt hangs in the air as if you were in a chair. Hold this position for one minute. Rest for 30 seconds and repeat two more times., To perform a squat, stand with your feet hip-width apart, back straight, head up, bracing your core. Put your hands on your hips or straight out in front of you, whatever is more comfortable. Lower yourself down into a squat as if you were about to sit in a chair. You want to keep your spine straight and your knees right above your toes, not leaning forward. Focus on dropping your butt. Do this 10 times, then do another 2 sets after a short a rest.









Bulgarian Split Squat: Put your front foot flat on the ground and place your rear foot on a surface like a coffee table or your couch. Lower down into a squat, and then lift yourself back up. You can keep your hands out for balance, or on your hips. Do 12 reps on each leg., Get on your hands and knees and kick one leg out and up, keeping it in a 90-degree angle. Do 12 reps on each leg., Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor. Lift your glutes off the ground to form a bridge. Lift your left leg up, keeping your hips up, and then lower your left leg down before doing the same move with your right leg. Do 10 reps with each leg.







, Lunges are a great way to build butt, hip, and hamstring muscles. To do one. Step one foot roughly 3–4 feet (0.9–1 m) in front of you. Your knee should be bent roughly 90 degrees. Lower your butt straight down to the floor, keeping your front knee over your toe and bending your back knee to the floor. Push back up and switch legs to finish one rep. Perform 10 on each side, then rest before 2 more sets.








If you have dumbbells or weights you can make the workout harder and significantly increase your conditioning. Even a gallon of milk in each hand will help.

Make a workout schedule that hits every muscle group twice a week.,
Focus on great form, not extra repetitions, to gain muscle quickly and safely.,
Do yoga to stretch muscles with a full-body workout.,
Push yourself so that the last 2-3 reps of every set are difficult, but not impossible.,
Eat a balanced diet that is heavy on protein but low on fat.,
Consider buying some basic home-gym equipment if you're serious about working out.",How to Build Muscle at Home3," Developing an effective workout schedule is not something you need a trainer to do. There are several simple, easy to remember guidelines to follow that will allow you to get the most out of your workouts, building muscle quickly and safely.


Allow 1-2 days of rest between similar workouts. If you work out your chest muscles on Tuesday, don't work them again until Thursday or Friday.
Group similar muscle groups for workouts. For example, since many chest exercises also work out your triceps, group these exercises on the same day.
Provide 1-2 rest days where you go for a short run or avoid hard physical activity. Your body needs time to rest and recover to build muscle.

, Doing ten proper push-ups is far more effective than fifteen bad ones. You want every exercise motion to be smooth, fluid, and slow, not herky-jerky and awkward. While each exercise is different, some general tips include:


Inhale as you come up, or relax. Exhale on the exertion.
Keep your spine straight, not curved or bent, as much as possible.
Hold each exercise for 1-2 seconds at the apex, then slowly move back to resting position.

, Yoga is another option for working out larger muscle groups, as it helps you strengthen your muscles and gain flexibility. Easy, calm sessions are great for rest days, and you can push yourself with harder workouts to mix up your routine. If you're struggling to find exercises that you enjoy without gym equipment, yoga might be the simple answer.


Youtube contains a treasure trove of yoga workouts for any skill level, so don't feel intimidated if you're new to yoga -- you can practice in your own home with little equipment.

, If you really want to gain muscle, you're going to need to push yourself. Your own body is the best indicator of your workout, so keep working the muscle until it is tired. You should be struggling slightly at the end of each set, and the last 2-3 exercises you do should require full concentration and effort.


Make goals in advance. If you decide to do three sets of twenty ahead of time, you're more likely to finish the set while you're sweating. Then, if it is too easy, you can always add more.
Pushing yourself is different from courting injury. If your joints, bones, or muscles hurt, as opposed to just feel sore or tired, you should stop and rest.

, This doesn't mean that you need to be pounding protein shakes every day or cutting out every dessert. A good diet is a balanced diet, focusing on whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, eggs, and beans.


A glass of low-fat chocolate milk is an excellent post-workout snack.
Switching from white bread and pastas to whole grains is a great way to immediately eat healthier.
Avocados, nuts, olive oil, and eggs all contain healthy fats. The ones to watch out for -- butter, cream, lard, etc. -- are almost always the foods you already know are unhealthy.

, There is a large variety of equipment that can help you perform new exercises and challenge yourself further, but you don't need expensive machines to do it.


Resistance bands are adaptable, come in a variety of ""weights"" and can be used for thousands of exercises.
A basic set of dumbbells is a cost-effective way to add some weight to your workouts.
Pull-up/chin-up bars are designed to fit safely into most door frames, and many models can be used for dips and incline push-ups as well."

Eat adequate amounts of protein.,
Consider drinking a protein supplement.,
Consume an adequate amount of calories each day.,
Increase your potassium intake with fruits and vegetables.,
Cut down on the amount of grains you consume.,
Focus on weight bearing cardio exercises.,
Include regular strength training.,
Regularly increase the intensity and frequency of your workouts.,
Avoid alcohol after your exercise sessions.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Take a Vitamin D supplement.,
Stop smoking.",How to Combat Muscle Loss As You Age," Protein is an essential nutrient to overall health at any age. However, it takes on a very important role as you age by helping preserve your muscle mass.


Studies have now shown that protein needs change as you get older. You actually need more protein each day and at each meal than someone of a younger age.In fact, studies have shown to maximize protein synthesis, you should aim to eat a about 25-30 g of protein at each meal. This will generally put your total daily protein goal around 90 g each day.
In order to meet these higher protein needs, you'll need to eat 2 servings of protein at each meal. Measure out a 3-4 oz portion of protein at each meal. Try foods like: eggs, poultry, lean beef, pork, low-fat dairy, legumes, tofu and seafood.
If you have difficulty chewing tougher or denser foods, choose softer proteins like dairy, eggs, legumes, tofu, seafood and ground meat.;
, If you have difficulty meeting this need, consider drinking liquid protein supplements daily. These are available over the counter and can help increase your protein needs.

Eating 25-30 g of protein at meals can be difficult. This is a high goal for a meal like breakfast. So to help you meet this goal, you can drink a protein supplement.
These liquid drinks come in shake form or fruit juice beverage. You can drink this along with your meal to easily meet that high goal of 25-30 g.
For example, 2 eggs will give you about 14-15 g of protein. If you add a piece of cheese to that meal, you'll be up to about 20 g of protein. However, this might be too much food for you. Adding a 10-15 g protein supplement can allow you have something smaller but still meet your needs.

, Although protein is essential as you age, you also need to make sure you're eating an adequate amount of calories everyday. As you age, you may not eat as frequently which can lead to a an insufficient amount of calories.


Older adults may not eat enough calories daily due to a few reasons. As you age, you may find it difficult to chew or digest foods, you may have a decrease in appetite or after the loss of friends or a spouse, may not enjoy eating alone.
When you do not eat an adequate amount of calories, your body will naturally begin to lose weight and muscle mass overtime.Everyone's calorie needs are different, but most older adults may need around 1500-1700 calories daily.
Also, to make sure that you're eating just the right amount of calories, weigh yourself regularly. You don't want to lose or gain weight. Your weight should only fluctuate a few pounds week to week.

, While studies have shown that increased protein is essential to prevent loss of muscle mass, they also showed that increased potassium is just as essential.High levels of protein in your diet can lead to low levels of metabolic acidosis or increased blood acidity levels. This can contribute to both muscle mass and bone loss overtime.
However, increased potassium intake can help offset this acidity in the body preventing the negative side effects of increased protein. Both fruits and vegetables are naturally high in potassium and should be included at every meal and snack.
Measure out a serving of fruit, vegetables or both at your meals. You need to aim for about 5-7 servings daily.
One serving of fruit is 1/2 cup or 1 small piece. One serving of vegetables is 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens.High potassium fruits and vegetables include: apricots, bananas, broccoli, cherries, chickpeas, kiwi, lima beans, lentils, peas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and white beans.

, The typical Western diet is high in protein and cereal grains while being lower in fruits and vegetables. To help support the formation of muscle mass, cut down on the amount of cereal grains you eat each day.Cereal grains like bread, rice, pasta, and other grain-based foods can still be apart of your diet, but just in smaller amounts. Aim to have 1-2 servings of these foods daily and focus instead on protein, fruits and vegetables.
When you do choose to include a grain in your diet, choose 100% whole grains instead of refined grains (like white rice or white bread). These are high in fiber, protein and other nutrients that are beneficial to your diet and health.Also, measure out the appropriate portion size as well. Grains should be measured out to 1/2 cup of cooked grains or about 1 oz per serving., Cardio exercises don't always get included in recommendations for preventing loss of muscle mass. However, weight bearing exercises should be included regularly.


Weight bearing exercises are any activity that forces your body to work against gravity.Regular weight bearing exercises have been shown to help prevent the loss of muscle mass, but also prevent the loss of bone mass as well (or osteoporosis).
It's typically recommended to do about 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercises each week. Make sure to do them at a moderate intensity.Weight bearing cardio exercises you can do include: walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing sports or dancing.

, When it comes to preserving or increasing muscle mass, strength training plays a critical role. Combined with weight bearing cardio, you'll be able to delay or prevent loss of muscle mass.


Strength training exercises help strengthen your muscles and bones. In addition, it can help not only prevent loss of muscle mass, but also increase muscle mass as well.Aim to do strength training exercises at least 1-2 days a week. Work every major muscle group and workout for at least 20 minutes per session.You can try weight lifting, weight lifting classes, yoga or pilates. All of these will help strengthen and build your muscle mass.

, You may not realize, but doing the same work out every week won't maximize your muscle mass. You have to continually increase both the intensity and frequency of your exercises.Studies have shown that if you don't regularly increase the intensity of your exercise (by increasing the heaviness of the weight), your progress will slow or plateau and can even start to reverse itself.
To prevent this from happening, regularly increase how much weight you're lifting, how often you're working out and how many reps you do per set.
For example, if you've gotten used to lifting 5 pound dumbbells and this is no longer difficult for you, increase to an 8 pound dumbbell. Or if you can easily do a set or 8 bicep curls, increase to 10 or 12 bicep curls per set.

, An interesting note to remember, is that its not recommended to drink alcohol after you exercise. This can prevent the necessary recovery and repair that eventually leads to stronger and bigger muscles.Drinking alcohol within an hour of exercising can disrupt the flow of hormones that are needed to synthesize and produce new muscle mass.
You don't have to completely avoid alcohol the day you exercise, but at least do not consume any within an hour or two of finishing your workout.
If you do enjoy a glass of wine or other alcoholic beverage in the evening, consider working out in the morning or afternoon so you can still enjoy your drink without worrying about disrupting your hard work.

, Outside of nutrition and exercise, there are other lifestyle factors that you can change to help preserve your muscle mass. Getting adequate sleep is a something that you should be focusing on as well.


Health professionals note that its during rest and recovery (during sleep) that the most gains in muscle mass and strength are seen.Without adequate sleep, your body cannot effectively regenerate muscle.
In addition, its during sleep that your body releases human growth hormone. This hormone is only released during sleep and helps repair and build lean muscle mass.
Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep each night. However, you may need up to 9 hours depending on your body's needs.
Shut off all the lights and electronics before you go to sleep. This allows your body to fall into a natural sleep.

, Your diet won't always provide enough of every nutrient you need to maintain adequate health. Vitamin D is something you need to consume adequate amounts of to help support muscle mass.


Vitamin D is difficult to get into your diet and is more difficult to make from the sun as you age. Studies have shown that upwards of 78% of older adults have a Vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D is not only important for adequate bone health. Studies have shown that normal levels of Vitamin D are associated with better skeletal muscle function which was associated with increased strength and decreased amount of falls.
Older adults typically need about 600-800 IU of Vitamin D each day.Focus on Vitamin D rich foods like fortified milk, egg yolks, fatty fish, or fortified orange juice.
If you still need additional Vitamin D, talk to your doctor about taking a daily Vitamin D supplement.

, Another lifestyle habit that's been associated with decreased muscle mass and function is smoking. Discontinue this behavior as soon as possible to help improve your muscle mass.For starters, smoking is associated with decreased physical activity and decreased nutrition. These two factors will have a negative effect on your lean muscle mass.
Smoking promotes that break down of lean muscle mass and also slows the body's ability to synthesize new muscle mass.
If you currently smoke, consider quitting soon. Either try to quit cold turkey or talk to your doctor about taking a prescription medication to make quitting more easy.

Set a goal that has a concrete result, like getting your body mass index (BMI) to a certain number, losing a certain number of pounds, or taking an inch off your waistline.


If you are new to working out or are returning to the gym after a long period of time, start slowly. You won’t build your body fast by pushing yourself too hard and getting injured.
It may take longer for you to see results if you haven’t kept a consistent workout schedule, so stay patient and consistent.
Focus on strength, not necessarily on gaining a certain amount of muscle. Increasing your overall strength allows your body to better recruit muscle fibers, allowing your physique to change faster.
The reason for developing a realistic workout schedule is that it will keep you on the fastest track to building your body quickly. Realistically, men can expect to build at most 2 pounds of muscle per month. Women can build at most 1 pound of muscle per month. However, this kind of gain is from a frequent workout schedule of about five to six days a week.;
, Be realistic about your overall schedule and how much time you can devote to working out. Maybe you only have 30 minutes a day to work out, or you have a few days a week where you can do more.


Knowing how much time you can devote to building your body will help you develop a schedule and routine that will maximize your growth quickly. By having a consistent schedule that you keep to, you train your body to expect to be in an anabolic state more often. This helps faster growth.
Aim for between three and five workouts per week, depending on your schedule. If you can only workout a few times a week, try to block out enough time so that you can workout for about 60 to 75 minutes.
Evaluate your current fitness level and experience. If you are newer to working out, then you want to populate your schedule with less strenuous workouts at the beginning to prevent injury.
People newer to working out will typically see gains faster because the body isn’t used to strenuous activity and having to repair muscles. However, after the initial shock, your body finds a pattern. Don’t stop just because you may see quick results.

, The fastest way to build your body is to train multiple muscle groups at once, and make sure that during your weekly routine you are training every part of your body. It’s also important to switch up your training. Lifting the same weights or running the same two miles every couple of days won’t deliver quick gains. By training multiple muscle groups at the same time instead of just focusing on one, you get to exercise these groups more often, leading to more frequent growth stimulation.


This doesn’t always mean doing full body workouts. This means that during the course of a week, you hit each muscle group.
If you decide that you can realistically workout three days a week, build a schedule that will allow you to workout your whole body by the end of the week. For example:

On day one, work your chest shoulders, and triceps. Follow-up this exercise with 15-30 minutes of cardio on a stair climber or elliptical. You can also go hiking or cycling hills outside.
On day two, train your back, biceps, and abs. End with 15-30 minutes of cardio, preferably on a rowing machine or an elliptical or AMT with pushing handles. You can also go swimming.
On the third day, train your glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves. Afterwards, try rowing or swimming for cardio.Make sure that you also get enough rest. The key to success is working the right body parts at the right time, while still getting a good amount of sleep. Muscles actually grow through a cellular process where your muscles repair themselves by fusing fibers back together after a workout., You should work out no more than five days a week when it comes to lifting weights. This is because overtraining and injury can occur, resulting in you not seeing results.


During the first couple of weeks, focus on building strength safely. This means lifting slightly heavier weights at lower reps, and resting for about two minutes so your muscles don’t fatigue. After you’ve begun to build mass, do more intensive workouts with higher reps and lower weights to tone your muscles while still building. Rest times on lower weights should be around one minute.Don’t overtrain because you're not getting bigger quickly enough. Trying to speed up the process will make you feel too sore to want to work out. A diligent workout plan can show results of about half a pound of muscle gain a week in men, and about half a pound every two weeks in women.Cardio can be done every day, if you wish, and is very important when it comes to shedding any unwanted fat. Do cardio after you workout, not before, to ensure that your body can perform at a peak level, as cardio will tire you out.

, Remember that you want to be working out larger muscle groups, spending different days focusing on different parts of your body. In addition, remember to populate your schedule with different, more advanced routines as you progress. If you want to see fast progress each week, you have to advance your routine each week.


Start by adding five pounds to the weights you lift each week. Add an extra set to your routines at the end of the week to prepare for upping the weight the next week.
If you workout your chest, triceps and shoulders on Monday and/or Thursday, focus on your back and your biceps on Tuesday and/or Friday. On Wednesday, work out your legs and add some cardio to your routine.
Find a good workout that fits your body and goals. If you want to build size and strength, vary your rep ranges depending on the workout. Start with low rep sets (5-8) with heavy weights on one day, and then lower the weight while increasing the reps (12-15) on the next day you work that muscle group.
Varying your weight and reps will keep your muscles guessing, forcing them to adapt to varied routines increasing strength.Remember that you can and should add weight to your workouts each week. So even on the lower weight days, you want to be increasing how much you lift. Increase the weight slowly over time for the best results. For dumbbells, increase the weight by one to two pounds each week. For plates, you can increase it by five pounds.

, Cardio can help you get energized for the start of the week.



Run a couple of miles, swim, do some bodyweight workouts, or even yoga during the weekend to help your body stay focused.
Though you might think cardio will burn your muscle and your fat from putting your body in a catabolic state, 30-45 minutes of cardio a week can actually help build muscle. Because cardio workouts increase the number of capillaries in your muscles, you can get more oxygen and other nutrients flowing through them to build mass and increase recovery time, ultimately building your body up faster.

, Most gyms or fitness clubs have staff members that can help you build a diet and exercise plan that’s tailored to your body. A trainer can also lead you through workouts and keep you on track.

, Having a trainer aiding you will help you learn how to work efficiently and get the most from your time and efforts in the gym.


Trainers will also monitor your progress, guide you on a well-balanced diet, stay properly hydrated, and help you get proper rest and recovery.
Achieving your goals should be rewarding both mentally and physically. With hard work, a sensible and healthy diet, and proper rest, you will get the body you’ve always wanted.

, For this particular routine, try to keep workouts in the 45 minute range to avoid producing excess cortisol. Excess cortisol can increase health risks and affect sleep, digestion, and mood levels.For this routine, rest 60-90 seconds between each set.
When following this plan, workout with a 2-on-1-off routine for the fastest results. This routine will also allow for enough variety in which days you workout to keep your body guessing.
The weight you use will vary depending on your current fitness level, and the exercise you are doing. Pick a weight that will challenge you, but not completely exhaust you.
This is a good routine to start with. Once you’ve completed it, start a new routine to keep seeing quick results.

Train two or three times a week.,
Work out hard.,
Practice explosive reps.,
Get plenty of rest between workouts.,
Prioritize weights over cardio.",How to Build Leg Muscles1," Many people think that to build muscle you have to train every day, but that's not the case. Muscles get bigger when they get small ""breaks"" in training, and get stronger when they build up again during REST days. So don't exercise the same muscle groups two consecutive days. Rotate muscle groups so you're training your arms, back, chest, and other areas on the days you aren't working out your legs.


Making sure to work out your other muscle groups is important when you're working on your legs. Don't neglect the rest of your body!;
, Make your leg workouts count. They shouldn't last more than 30 minutes, but those 30 minutes shouldn't feel comfortable. You want to go all in and maximize the workout, putting a lot of pressure on your muscles so that they break down and build back up stronger.


For each exercise, you should use an amount of weight that you can lift for about 10 reps before you have to stop. If you can lift an amount of weight 15 times without stopping, you aren't lifting enough. If you can't lift it more than 5 times without needing a break, you're doing too much.
Some trainers recommend ""training to failure,"" which is the practice of repeating an exercise until you can't do even one more rep. This is said to build up the muscles more quickly, but it can cause injury if done incorrectly. Work with a trainer to figure out which technique is right for you.

, Many bodybuilders train with ""explosive"" movement, but this can cause injury if you push yourself too hard or use the wrong technique. If you're interested in these quick, forceful motions, take the time to learn them correctly:


Start with a lighter than usual weight.
Always use a slow, controlled release on the eccentric (the lowering or lengthening part of the exercise).
Pause and contract the muscles at the low point of the exercise.
Explode into the lift or push. Start with a short range of motion and increase the distance gradually as you train.
Keep your joints slightly bent at peak range of motion to prevent damage to connective tissues.

, Muscles get stronger during the time between workouts, when the fibers heal and strengthen. That's why it's mandatory to get plenty of sleep every night when you're training heavily. On the days when you don't work out, let yourself rest. Don't go on a 10-mile hike or bike all day long - it's okay to put your feet up and relax.

, Cardio promotes long, lean muscles instead of bulky ones. However, it takes many hours of running to undermine a heavy weight training routine, and 150 minutes of moderate cardio every week is still important for good health. If you are serious about bulking up your legs, get your cardio in by swimming or by using a rowing machine. You can limit cardio to 30 minute sessions after your resistance training, but do not skip cardio completely.

Practice with light weights first.,
Work out your thighs with barbell squats.,
Do stiff-legged deadlifts.,
You can build most of the leg at once.,
Do calf raises.,
Build inner thigh muscles with sumo squats.",How to Build Leg Muscles2," Using the wrong form or overexerting yourself can cause knee injury, spinal compression, and back injury. Always practice the proper technique for each exercise with light weights first. Move on to a more challenging weight only when you have perfected the proper form.

, This is a great exercise for building up those thighs. You'll need a barbell bearing as much weight as you can lift 8-10 times without needing to put it down. Hold the barbell with both hands over your shoulders. (You can use dumbbells instead if you'd like).


Start with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Bend your knees and squat, moving your butt toward the ground. Keep squatting until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep your shins vertical and your knees aligned vertically above your feet.
Push back up and repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.

, This works your hamstrings, making them bigger over time. Load a barbell with as much weight as you can lift for 10 reps, and set it in front of you on the ground. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
Bend at the waist, keeping your back straight and your knees at a slight bend. Grab the barbell with both hands.
Keeping your knees at a slight bend, lift the barbell so that it rests against your thighs, then lower it back to the floor.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.
Warning: locking your knees during this lift greatly increases the risk of injury, even for advanced lifters. Only the most extreme body builders use this technique after years of training.

, Stand within arm's reach of a wall and try the following exercise:


Lift one of your legs and bend it. Keep your right hand on the wall for support.
Now stand on the toes of your left leg. Keep your body straight.
Now bend your leg as if you are going to take a high jump.
Even when you bend your leg, stand on your toes.
Now lift your body with that leg with moderate speed.
During this entire cycle, stand on your toes and of course on only one leg.
Repeat this for 10 times or even 20 times if you are strong enough. Repeat the same with another leg.
Keep increasing the number of times you lift your body as your legs get stronger.
This is hard at the beginning, but you will get used to it.
This strengthens your calf muscles as well as the upper leg and gluteals.

, This exercise pinpoints your calves, which are notoriously hard to buff up. Hold a barbell or dumbbells over your shoulders. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Raise up on your toes, then set your heels back down on the ground. Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.Single leg calf raises are even more effective than using weight, and help work the stabilizing muscles in the ankle.

, This exercise targets your inner thigh and gluteals:Stand in a wide stance with your feet turned outward at a 45º angle.
Hold a kettlebell in front of you with both hands.
Slowly bend into a squat, keeping your back straight and your knees over your toes.
Squat as low as you can comfortably get, then return.
Repeat 10 to 12 times for 3 sets.

Eat high-calorie meals.,
Get lots of protein.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Build Leg Muscles3," To get bigger muscles, you need extra fuel. The calories you consume, however, should not come from fast food and junk food - eating too much of those will just slow you down. Eat plenty of calories from healthy, whole foods to keep your body feeling powerful.


Eat lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy.
Nuts, avocados, and whole grains are also great.
Eat tons of fruits and vegetables.
Choose healthy fats provided by seed and nut oils, coconut oil, and olive oil. Minimize the trans fats and animal fats found in processed and fried foods.

, The body uses protein to build muscles, so you'll need extra during this time. Eat beef, pork, chicken, fish, eggs, and cheese. Eat beans, legumes, and tofu for non-animal protein sources. If you are struggling to get enough protein in your diet, try protein shakes or drink more milk.


You can try supplements such as creatine. Studies show that creatine supplements can safely help build up the muscles when taken with daily meals.

, Your body will need more water than usual to stay hydrated when you're training heavily. Water also helps flush toxins from the body and is essential for healthy digestion. Aim to drink at least 10 8-ounce glasses of water every day while you're training.

Find a good training program.,
Work out to a routine that works for you.,
Work different muscle groups each time you exercise.,
Begin weight training.,
Consider a bodyweight routine.,
Understand the pros and cons building muscle over the age of 45.,
Examine the different types of weightlifting.,
Work out at home.,
Get your heart pumping with cardio training.Cardio routines vary in their intervals and intensity.,
Take the stairs.,
Relax and recover with yoga.",How to Build Muscle in Women over 451," You should develop a training routine that fits your goals. There are a number of ways to tailor an exercise routine to best fit your lifestyle.


The best option would be to hire a trainer to put together a program specifically tailored to your needs. Unfortunately, this can be expensive.
There are many training programs you can buy online these days but again, they can be somewhat expensive if you are on a limited budget.
Look online and at your local library for information about resistance training programs. You can use weights or put together a good body weight program for yourself. You are the expert when it comes to your body!;
, Depending on the type of workout routine you choose to do, you should create a workout routine that you will follow.


The CDC recommends that you get 150 minutes of moderate-level activity or 75 minutes of high-intensity activity per week to maintain your current weight.Aim to combine aerobic exercise with at least two days of muscle-building exercise, like weight-lifting, each week.Don’t forget to warm up and cool down. To avoid injury, you should warm up your muscles before you start to vigorously exercise. This may include 10 – 15 minutes of walking or stretching. Repeat this to cool down your body after your exercise. This will help reduce muscle soreness.

, Ideally, you want to be training your entire body and not just one area. Make sure your routine focuses on each area of your body. Switch which muscle groups you are working in between sets or days to help give your body a chance to rest.


Work out at least three days a week. You want to make sure your are exercising your muscles at least three days a week and that you give yourself rest days. Rest days will help your muscles relax and recover in between training.

, Lifting weights is a great way to build strong muscles and to help tone your body. However, starting a routine can be daunting, especially for beginners. There are a few tricks to help you get started.


Research machines and weights. Before you jump into using every machine at the gym, ask for a run-down on the functions of each machine. Be sure to ask what muscle groups the machine targets so you can develop a routine that works for you.
Be consistent. Once you have started to work out, be consistent for at least two to four weeks. Try to work out on the same days or times to develop a routine.
Develop good form. You do not want to start lifting a ton of weight right out of the gate. Practice forms before you add more weight to your routine.

, A bodyweight routine does not involve any equipment. This routine relies solely on your own body weight. Exercises include push ups, squats, sit ups, pull-ups.This exercise can be helpful as it can be done comfortably in your own home without paying gym fees. These types of exercises can have the same health benefits as using weights or machines.

, While maintaining a healthy lifestyle can have many benefits, safety may be an issue.


Studies have shown the working out after age 45 can help reduce and even reverse any age-related muscle loss.Lifting weights and gaining muscle can even help with heart disease.Each year, over 88,000 women between the ages of 45 – 65 have heart attacks.You have to consider safety when lifting weights. Not having proper form or trying to lift too much at one time may cause injury such as broken bones or torn muscles.When first starting out, it is best to consult a professional.

, Traditionally, there are five types of weightlifting programs: bodybuilding, powerlifting, circuit training, isometric, and high-volume training. Each of these training types of both benefits and downfalls.


Bodybuilding — This routine solely focuses on building muscle mass. You will be focusing on one muscle group per workout. Typically, bodybuilders lift every day. The cons of this is that, while your muscles are getting bigger, you might not be gaining additional strength.
Powerlifting — Like bodybuilding, powerlifting helps to gain muscle mass. However, powerlifting focuses on lifting the heaviest weights possible rather than focusing on appearance. You may be lifting heavy weights for shorter reps.
Circuit Training — Circuit training will put your body through a routine of short workouts such as 20 box jumps, 20 jumping jacks, and 10 pushups in quick succession. This will help your body burn fat and keep your heart rate up. This, however, might not help you build muscle mass.
Isometric — This helps builds stamina. Isometric training allows you to hold a weight in a certain position without going through a range of motion. This will probably not help you burn fat as quickly as circuit training, but will help you with stamina.
High-volume training — This type of training helps the body achieve as many sets as possible in a workout. For example, you will try and achieve as many pushups as you can in a one minute period. This can be intense and is not necessarily recommended for beginners. Like circuit training, it can help to burn fat. , Some daily activities can be an effective form of exercise. According to the CDC, doing 30 minutes of heavy yard work (such as chopping wood or raking leaves) can burn around 220 calories. Simply walking (4.5mph) for 30 minutes can burn around 230 calories., These workouts are designed to build endurance but are not necessarily designed for gaining muscle mass.


There are many types of cardio programs you can try. Find one that you like so you are more likely to keep at it! Try biking, hiking, jogging, swimming, rowing, or dancing.Cardio helps you use oxygen more efficiently to pump blood to your organs. This will increase your heart rate, and help you burn calories.Remember that you should not just do cardio alone, as the muscle mass and improved bone density will come from resistance training.

, One simple way to add cardio to your day is to use the stairs instead of taking an elevator. Climbing stairs will get your heart pumping and also help to tone your legs and glutes., It is important to let your body rest at times so that your muscles can repair themselves. You do not want to overexert yourself and cause harm to your body. Doing low-impact workouts such as yoga is a great way to stay active but to recover from more intense workouts.

Do sit-ups with a ball and a friend.,
Organize “crazy races” to build different muscles.,
Spell out your alphabet with your legs to work your core and legs muscles.,
Use resistance bands for “light” weight training.,
Stretch when you are done.,
Know that you should not lift weights until after puberty.",How to Build Muscle (for Kids)1," Running, biking, swimming, playing sports, and tromping around the woods all build muscles naturally, and this is often the safest, most fun way for kids to build muscles.Grab a group of friends and play a game of basketball, start a scavenger hunt, jump in the pool, and wrestle in the backyard – just like many adults “cross-train” to build muscle with different activities, kids can secretly build muscles while playing.;
, Just because kids are flexible and full of energy doesn’t mean they can skip the warm-up. Do 5-10 minutes of light aerobic activity, like walking, jogging, or jumping rope, before working out to get your muscles loose and your blood flowing., Kids should not just take an adult’s workout plan and scale it down. Not only can this be dangerous, kids have an energy level and natural flexibility that allows them to do a variety of exercises without needed weights. Perhaps more importantly, these exercises are easily turned into games or small competitions, making them much more fun to get through then a trip to the gym.


Traverse monkey bars to do modified ""pull-ups,"" or offer to push your friends on the swings to build arm muscle.
Hops, skips, and lunges all use your body weight to train your leg muscles.
Climbing, whether at a rock wall on the playground, is a great workout for your arm and leg muscles.

, One of the best exercises for upper body muscles is still one of the simplest. Lie on the ground with your hands and toes touching the floor. Push your entire body up with both hands until your elbows are barely bent, then lower yourself slowly down towards the ground. When you are about 6 inches from the floor, push up again and repeat. Try to get 10 in a row, then rest for 1-2 minutes and try again.


Keep your butt down, even with your shoulders.
Keep your back straight.
Your hands should be shoulder-width apart. However, the further apart they get the more you work out your chest muscles. The closer together your hands are the more you’ll work your arm muscles.

, Sit across your friend with your knees bent and your toes facing each other. One of you should have a ball in your hands. At the same time, bend up from your stomach so that you are looking each other in the eyes and pass the ball. Only your feet and butt should still be touching the ground. Keep doing sit-ups and passing the ball until one of you is too tired to continue.


Keep your feet on the ground the entire time, and try to keep your shoulders lined up with your partner's.
Focus on using the muscles around your stomach, your abs, to pull you up each time., There are tons of fun variations to a normal race that activate certain muscles and encourage kids to exercise without knowing it. Try making a relay race that switches between the following exercises to encourage great upper body strength.



Bear crawl: With your hands and feet on the ground, stick your butt high in the air and run forward on all fours. You’ll be surprised how quickly you get tired – many football and rugby teams still do this for strength conditioning.Crab walk: Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your feet and hands on the ground. Lift your butt and walk forward, backward, or side to side to exercise your arms, abs, and thighs.

Burpee: Jump forward with both feet. When you land, get down and do one push-up. Then get up quickly and leap forward again.

Moon lunges: While they look slow, these are great hip and leg building exercises. Take the biggest step forward you can with your right foot, then lower your left knee and your butt slowly towards the ground. Stand up and repeat with your left leg., This exercise isn’t for the faint of heart, but it is a fun way to work some thinking and competition into your exercises. Lay on your back. Lift both legs together and point your toes down so that they form a long, straight pencil. From here, spell out the alphabet with your legs. How far can you get?


It is often easiest to keep your hands underneath your butt for balance.
Make a “Work-out Spelling Bee” by challenging friends to spell words with your legs. Not only does spelling count, but you have to get through the word as well.

, Resistance bands are a long, stretchy, exercise tools that allow you to safely simulate weightlifting. Imagine them as large rubber bands—as you pull on them, they resist you and want to snap back together, making them harder and harder to pull on. Some exercises to try include:


Stand on one end of the band with your right foot and hold the other in your right hand. Keep your elbow in the same place and pull the band up towards your chest with your hand. Do ten, then switch hands.
Hold an end of the band in each hand. Stand on the center of the band with both feet, legs shoulder-width apart. With your arms wide apart (like you were surrendering), push the ends of the band up to the sky. Keep your knees slightly bend.
Hold an end of the band in your right hand and step on the other end with your left foot. Keeping your back straight, twist at the hips towards you left foot as if you were trying to touch your toes with your right hand. Twist back out and pull the band high up to the right side of your body. Think of doing a classic “disco dance,” or pulling the cord to start a lawnmower.

, Cooling down helps you muscles relax, making them more effective the next time you need them. Do some light stretching when you are finished to feel great the next day.


Make sure you take time to rest. Your body needs time recover after a workout, so don’t exercise the same muscles two days in a row., Trying to lift difficult weights and “get huge” is not only impossible for young kids, it is unhealthy. Your muscles, tendons (which attach muscles to bones) and ligaments (which attach bones to other bones) are not fully developed, and could tear under the stress. Be patient and wait on weights until you are a teenager.Small weights, ranging from 1-5lbs, can be safely substituted for resistance bands in younger children.
Body weight exercises are much better for younger kids. You can still build muscle without injuring yourself.

Stop smoking.,
Talk with your doctor.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Build Muscle in Women over 453," Smoking can cause a number of disease that can hinder your health goals. It is a deadly habit, and one that should not be continued. Quitting smoking will help you stop the damage that tobacco is doing to your body, and will help you regain lung capacity for easier breathing., Before you begin any sort of exercise routine, talk with your doctor to find out what is appropriate. You do not want to cause injury to your body by jumping into an unfamiliar routine.

, It is especially important to stay well-hydrated if you are doing any sort of resistance (muscle building) training. One of the side effects of dehydration is a decrease in strength.If your strength is not at it is optimum level you won't be able to train effectively.


A good rule of thumb is to drink half your body weight in ounces of fluids (this includes the water found in foods, and beverages like milk and juice).If you weigh 160 pounds, you'll need to drink at least 80 ounces of fluids every day. On days when you are exercising, you will need to drink more to replenish what you sweat out., Resistance training causes tiny micro tears in the muscle fibers. As you sleep your body repairs these tears.This is the process used to build bigger, stronger muscles. If you are training you need eight hours of sleep every night.

Eat enough protein.,
Shake it up with protein powders.,
Eat the right kind of carbohydrates.,
Supplement with vitamins.,
Avoid fad diets.",How to Build Muscle in Women over 454," Diet is of course important for all around health, but when it comes to building muscle the most important aspect is protein intake. An average amount is 0.8 grams per pound of body weight. For example, if you are that 160 pound person, 160 x 0.8 = 128 grams of protein per day.


That may seem like a lot but when you start adding it up you'll be surprised by how much protein you can find in vegetables, nuts, and seeds to supplement or replace your animal protein intake. There are many supplements as well but try to find one without artificial sweeteners. Protein shakes are more likely to be healthier than protein bars.

, One way to get your recommended daily protein is to supplement your diet with protein powders. You can use the powder to make delicious smoothies, shakes, or baked goods.

, Eating high-glycemic carbs (like white bread and pasta) can raise your blood sugar. This can contribute to weight gain and diabetes. Switch out high-glycemic carbs for low ones, such as those found in peanut butter or apples.There are both simple and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbs are made up of fewer sugar molecules than their complex counterparts. They are a quick source of energy, but are not providing your body with many nutrients or vitamins. These carbs include table sugar, jams, jellies, soft drinks, honey, and maple syrup.Complex carbohydrates provide essential minerals, vitamins, and proteins but also turn into glucose like simple carbs. Complex carbs are much better for you body and can be found in foods like peas, beans, vegetables, and whole grains. , As our body ages, we lose bone mass and density.It may be beneficial to supplement your diet and exercise with vitamins (like calcium) that can replace what you are using.Always talk to your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine. They can be harmful to your health if taken in too high of dosage or may negatively impact a pre-existing condition.

, Your goal in gaining muscle is to develop a routine that will work for you. Popular diets go in and out of fashion because they are often not scientifically backed or proven. Avoid these diets by sticking to a medically approved diet and exercise routine.

Start lifting after you’ve hit puberty to build muscle.,
Focus on light weights with lots of reps, not lifting a ton of weights a few times.,
Build a program around the basics.,
Aim to work out 3-5 days a week for no more than an hour each day.,
Make sure your technique is perfect.,
Eat and drink water within 30 minutes of exercising to fuel muscle growth.,
Know that supplements are no excuse for good nutrition.,
See a doctor before starting any exercise program.",How to Build Muscle (for Kids)2," Teenagers can start to build muscle in the gym after puberty. In fact, teenagers may be able to build muscle faster than adults. The hormones that cause a teenager to grow rapidly in puberty increase your metabolism and increase muscle growth.Most children can start lifting weights at age 12-14, but the signs that someone is going through puberty include:


Beginning body odor
Acne
Beginning to grow body hair (males)
Shoulders widening, chest growing (males)
Begin to develop breasts (females), The safest, most effective way for teens to gain muscles is to have proper form and safe lifting habits. As you first start out, you might be able to bench press a lot of weights once or twice, but your form will suffer as you try to force the weight up. Try to do 8-12 reps of something with a weight that challenges you but feels comfortable.A “rep” is when you do an exercise once. Aim for 8-12 reps
A “set” is a collection of reps. After one set, rest for 1-2 minutes before continuing. Aim for 3-5 sets of each exercise.

, While every magazine rack in the country touts “the best new workouts to gain muscle,” the classic exercises are still some of the best. Most of these are “compound lifts,” meaning they work out multiple muscles at once for quick results.Start your lifting program by learning the following exercises before moving on to more complex, sport-specific lifts:


Bench Press
Shoulder Press
Squats
Deadlifts

Rows, Remember, your body is still growing and will react negatively to working out too often. Don’t push yourself thinking you will get better results – you may only hurt yourself and set your training back. Shorter sessions done frequently will help maintain proper form and keep your muscles healthy.Work out on non-consecutive days so that you get a rest in between each session.
Hour long workouts allow you to focus on your technique without getting too tried to pay attention to form., This is the best thing you can do to grow muscle quickly and safely. Do not try to teach yourself how to lift, you need a coach, parent, or personal trainer to spot your mistakes and show you how to fix them. Some things to focus on include:


Keep your back straight. Your lower back should never bend while lifting weights. To avoid it, focus on keeping your chest puffed slightly up and your shoulder blades back.
Never fully extend your joints. Instead, push the lift until your joint is just slightly bent before returning to rest position.If you feel pain, stop. ""No pain, no gain"" is a myth -- while an exercise should be difficult, sharp pain in your muscles or joints means you are doing something incorrectly.

, Your muscles need protein and energy to grow strong, so make sure you get the calories you need to build muscle. While you don’t need to overload on protein, Try to get some in your system shortly after a workout. Make sure you drink 2-3 glasses of water after working out to rehydrate as well. Good foods for muscular gain after a workout include the following:


Turkey or chicken sandwich
Trail mix
Peanut butter and jelly
Protein, granola, or fruit & nut bars., Supplements claiming that they can “build muscle fast” or help you lose weight in weeks are generally not safe, especially for teenagers with developing bodies. You should focus on eating a healthy, balanced diet and refrain from “quick fixes” that may or may not work.


A good, balanced diet mixes in protein (chicken, fish, eggs), complex carbs (oatmeal, sweet potatoes, beans, whole wheat) and fruits and vegetables every day. A good diet will fuel your body and help you make the most of your workouts.
Never use steroids to supplement your workout, as these ""methods"" of gaining muscle can create health problems for years to come., Ask your doctor about starting an exercise program at your yearly check-up. Make sure there are no medical concerns you should know about and talk to them about developing a safe exercise program for your body. While you may feel ready to pump some iron, your doctor will have specific advice to help you get the most out of your exercises.

Remember that kids are not likely to grow muscles before puberty.,
Focus your energy on strength training, not weightlifting.,
Know that a child can start strength training around age 7 or 8.,
Focus your energy on strength training, not weightlifting.,
Prioritize proper technique over big muscles.,
Always supervise a child as they learn strength training.",How to Build Muscle (for Kids)3," The hormones needed to grow big, bulky muscles come with puberty, so do not push a child to lift weights or start training plans when they cannot even reap the rewards.Kids will start to build muscle naturally as teenagers, but kids should be focused less on growing muscles and more on being healthy.

, Weightlifting, body building, and power lifting can all be very dangerous to a child’s still-developing muscles. Strength training, however, is focused on proper technique and safety instead of lifting the biggest piece of metal you can. Weightlifting as a child can damage a kid’s growth plates, which are pieces of cartilage still turning into bone, injuring a child for life.Make a distinction between increasing muscle strength and “bulking up.” Talk to them about the benefits of having lean muscles such as a healthy weight, improved performance in sports, and higher self-esteem. Let them know that it is impossible to ""bulk up"" a lot of muscle before puberty., If a child can follow directions well and expresses interest in getting stronger, you can safely begin a light workout plan as early as 7 years old.


If a child is ready to play organized sports, they are generally ready to start a strength program.

, Since most children cannot actually build muscle, you should work on the proper exercise techniques to prevent injury, learn good mechanics, and set a good foundation for later workouts. Some things to look out for include:


Keeping your back (spine) aligned. Your lower back should never bend forward or backward to make a stretch easier. Focus on keeping your chest up and shoulder blades back so your back is flat.
Never “hyperextend” a joint. Hyperextension is when you bend a joint slightly the opposite direction as it is supposed to, like straightening your knees so much that your legs curve backward.Work on healthy running form. Good runners keep their backs straight, land in the middle of their feet (not on their heels) and take medium sized, quick strides instead of long steps., Kids are trying to learn complex motions at the same time as they build muscles, and this is difficult when they are first starting out. You need to watch kids and help them fix posture, avoid injuries, and work out effectively to avoid injuries.

Use the weight of your body instead of buying weights.,
Use Compound exercises rather than isolation exercises.,
Running is free and helps cardiovascular strength.,
Listening to music on the radio is a cheap way to motivate yourself.,
Buy lots of food in bulk and try to eat 5 small meals a day (every two hours).,
Drink plenty of water after exercise.,
Get plenty of sleep and build in at least three rest days a week.

,
If you want to plan a regime there are many free training programs/schedules in books and on the internet.",How to Build Muscle Cheaply," This is called Calisthenics or Dynamic Tension and was pioneered by Charles Atlas. Improperly-used equipment can be dangerous, using your body carries much less risk of injury. Militaries tend to use your body rather than equipment in their training.;
, The following are compound exercises for groups of muscles and the top 3 most effective for beginners and comprehensive for the whole body.

Press-ups instead of bench presses are good for upper body strength. Put your feet on your bed and your hands on the floor for incline press-ups and a wall for handstand press-ups.






Sit-ups or super sit-ups are great for core abdominal strength.






Squats or burpees are good for leg strength. So is using stairs rather than the elevator in buildings.







, Swimming in your local public pool is usually cheap and a good way to build strength. Jump rope or skipping rope is a cheap piece of equipment for cardio which takes up little space but easily as good as most other expensive equipment which takes up lots of space.

, You don't need an expensive iPod or Mp3 player. Most exercise videos only get watched once so borrow them from a public library if you must.

,


Skimmed Milk is cheaper than protein powder. Longlife or UHT is even cheaper.
Tuna and chicken are cheap meat and sources of protein.
Pasta, beans and nuts are cheap carbohydrates.

, Tap water if it is safe in your country.

,, Both of these resources can be accessed free from your local public library.


Non-equipment cheap fitness gurus include Charles Atlas and Jack LaLanne.

Lift weights for at least 30 minutes 3 days a week.,
Take breaks between weightlifting days.,
Aim for muscle fatigue.,
Perform 1 repetition every 2 seconds.,
Rest for 1 minute or less between sets.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Do compound exercises.,
Do compound exercises every other day.,
Plan your meals based on your workout.,
Eat plenty of vegetables.,
Choose your fruits wisely.,
Consume whole grains.",How to Build Lean Muscle," You can use machines, free weights, TRX bands, weightlifting classes or a combination of these choices.


Never go into weightlifting blind. It requires correct posture and positioning to correctly target muscle fibers. Take an intro to weightlifting class, buy some sessions with a personal trainer or take classes to learn the basics.;
, Do your weightlifting sessions every other day to give your muscles time to rebuild and strengthen. Do cardio to burn off extra fat on your ""resting"" days.

, The best results will happen when you push your muscles until they can no longer do the lift or exercise on the last step. You will tear and rebuild a leaner physique with this method.


Muscle fatigue requires some strategy. If you are training for an endurance event, it is recommended that you do 10 to 15 repetitions and 3 sets of a slightly lower weight. If you are training for a speed or sprint event, you can train fast twitch muscles with 6 to 8 repetitions and 3 sets of a heavier weight. The right amount of weight is defined by weight you cannot lift any more after your third set.
If you are short on time, it's better to choose fewer exercises, but do them until your muscles can no longer perform. A few reps will not build lean muscle.

, This timing seems to be more effective than 1 rep every 4 seconds.

, You can rest for longer between different exercises, but studies have shown that short rest times, especially with light weights, are better.

, You should aim for 16 oz. (0.47l) of water per every half an hour of a hard workout. Muscles that are hydrated perform better and you will get more out of your workout.

, These are the exercises that work more than 1 muscle at once, and usually ask you to do more than a single movement. The following are good compound exercises to try:


Push ups. This exercise works your core and your muscles. Get into a plank position. Check that your body is flat in the mirror. Then, lower yourself as far as you can go while maintaining the plank and push back up. For a better compound push up, do knee lifts while you push up or move your hands in and out between repetitions to target triceps, chest and biceps.
weightlifting on tip toes. Put your feet in a ballet first position. Raise up on your tip toes, and move your heels together. Perform bicep curls while you balance to target your calves, thighs, glutes, abs and arms at once.
TRX bands. These weightlifting devices are extremely versatile. You can do rows, chest presses, bicep curls, tricep curls, push ups and much more. Your body is in a plank position to work your core while you lift.
Burpees. Often touted as 1 of the best total body exercise, a burpee combines jumping, squatting, push ups and core work. Start with your knees hip width apart. Squat until your hands touch the ground. Jump your feet back into a plank position. Jump your feet forward and jump up. Extend your arms toward the ceiling as you jump. Repeat as many times as possible in 1 minute.
Kettle ball workouts. These weights are designed for dynamic use. Hold the top of the kettle ball. Squat and set the ball on the ground. Lift it and rise from the squat.

, Unlike traditional free weight and machine exercises, they are designed for a full body workout, so rest the muscles and do cardio the day after you do them.

, Each day your meals should include the following:


A breakfast that is between 300 and 600 calories within 90 minutes of waking up. Your muscles will not be told to store fat, and you will get a leaner body.
A meal 2 hours before you workout. Try to schedule lunch or a large snack so that you will have enough time to digest and use the calories as you train.
A protein rich snack after your workout. If you can eat a protein rich meal within an hour of working out, it is preferable. However, a high-protein snack that includes low-fat cottage cheese or yogurt, almond butter, whey powder, eggs, fish or poultry will help to heal muscles more quickly.

, They should cover half your plate at all meals. Spinach is an excellent source of glutamine, which encourages lean muscle growth. Beets are a source of betaine, which helps repair joints.

, Apples, oranges, bananas and cantaloupe have nutrient benefits that help muscles develop, in addition to high fiber.

, Brown rice, quinoa and sprouted grains are complete proteins in addition to adding fiber and taste.

"
Variety - Add variety to your exercise routine.,
Rest Time - Shorten your break time between exercises.,
Common Motions - Utilize motions that are more common in your every day life.,
Posture & Balance - Practice excellent posture and balance in all of your exercises and throughout your life.,
Core - Engage the core in every exercise.,
Weights & Cardio - Be sure to combine resistance training for building muscle with aerobic training to increase endurance and overall capacity.

,
Interval Training - When performing cardiovascular exercises train in ""sprint intervals"" or pre-determined periods of maximal exertion followed by specific rest periods.,
Stretch - Spend as much time as possible stretching.,
Rest & Recover - After exercising allow your body adequate time to rest and recover.",How to Build Functional Strength," Use different forms of resistance (dumbbells, stretch bands, cable machines, kettlebells, sandbags, etc) and different set/rep patterns. Try exercises from various angles as well to create a challenge for your body.;
, Try supersetting exercises (performing two different exercise sets back to back without a break). This will increase your overall endurance and anaerobic capacity.

, For example, how often do you find yourself lying on your back and lifting something heavy over your chest? Probably the only time is in the gym doing bench presses. Instead, work on more common movements or change the exercise to perform it from a more common position. With bench press some examples include push-ups, standing cable press, or even punching motions with a stretch band or cable machine resistance.

, Typically when we need strength we are on our feet, so spend most of your exercise time on your feet.

, Try to use your glutes for balance when standing, your hips and obliques to generate twisting force, and your abs to create a tense and balanced position for the appropriate exercises.

,, The rest periods should be only long enough to allow the heart to recover and fall back into an aerobic pace.

, Flexibility will greatly reduce your chance of injury during training and helps to create a more balanced physique.

, Eat healthy, natural foods that are high in protein and low in processed sugars and saturated fats."

To be successful with your triathlon swimming, you need to be comfortable with completing the distance of the swim, before spending time building the speed at which you are able to cover this distance.

,
A triathlon swimming endurance session is different for everyone.",How to Build Endurance for Triathlon Swimming1,", The key is that it should enable you to swim further, or for longer at a given pace. In other words, it should improve your endurance.

"
"
Extensive Endurance: Long swims that are well over race distance and at a steady, comfortable pace.,
Intermediate Endurance: Slightly shorter efforts, that are closer to your race intensity (especially for the Sprint Distance) and could be described as Uncomfortably Comfortable.

,
Intensive Endurance: Hard endurance efforts.",How to Build Endurance for Triathlon Swimming2,";
,, For stronger swimmers this is probably close to their sprint, or maybe even Olympic distance race pace.

"
"
This uses long repetitions.,
The idea is to use repetitions of a distance, that, at is of a pace you find challenging, but not really hard.,
So for a triathlete competing in a Sprint race who finds the distance (750m) challenging, your Extensive Endurance Swim session might look like this:


5 x 200m at a comfortable aerobic pace.,
There are a variety of ways of making this session fit each individual.,
Remember though, that you are trying to progress the endurance aspect, so the total distance of the main-set must extend beyond your race distance.

,
Ideally you are aiming to include longer and longer repetitions with less and less recovery.

,
When you are able to maintain that steady controlled breathing for 1.5 – 2 times your race distance on a regular basis, you have begun to develop a good endurance capacity for your speed.",How to Build Endurance for Triathlon Swimming3," How long these are is up to you. You should swim at a pace, that means you can keep your breathing under control. You might find your arms getting tired, but this will adapt quite quickly.

, In between the repetitions, you have short periods of rest, to allow you to repeat this. Don't try to do repetitions over too long a distance, otherwise your technique could fall apart as you tire.

,
1 minute recovery between the efforts.
The pace should be comfortable. Over time you would look to build up the number of repetitions and then the length of the repetitions.

, If you find the 200m quite long, use shorter efforts with less rest, until you build up the muscular endurance in your shoulders.

,,, Now, all you need to do, is go faster!!

"
"
This type of endurance is around the intensity at which beginner triathletes might swim their Sprint Distance Triathlon, or the intensity at which more experienced/stronger swimmers, might do an Olympic or even a Long Distance triathlon (although you would have to be exceptionally fit for this).,
Breathing should still be under control, but now it’s a bit more of an effort.

,
Developing greater endurance at this pace and intensity will help you to exit the water and transition on to the bike much better, and will help the latter stages of the swim.

,
For a Sprint Distance moderate swimmer these sessions might start out something like this:


10 x 75m at an intensity/pace around your target for the race, with about 10 seconds rest.

,
As you become more proficient at this it could develop to as much as:


20 x 100m at race pace with about 10-15 sec rest between each rep.

,
It would require a significant amount of training to progress this far, but for more advanced swimmers, this is a reasonable progression.

",How to Build Endurance for Triathlon Swimming4," It is quite hard, but not really flat out. It should feel uncomfortably comfortable!

,,,,,"
"
This is not really an endurance training session, for less-than reasonably well-trained and experienced swimmers.

,
The intensity is hard.,
To improve the duration of the swim training, you can sustain above your race pace, you need to be able to swim at a faster pace, and have short rest intervals, to allow you to complete a greater total distance than you would otherwise be able to at this pace.,
This is a VERY HARD session that you need to be technically very competent, to get the most out of.,
The early part of the session will feel OK, because you are swimming quite a short distance, and having with a good rest.",How to Build Endurance for Triathlon Swimming5,", It would correspond to an experienced, strong swimmer racing the Sprint distance.

, So a session might look like this:


8 - 10 x 100m at 1 – 2 seconds faster than race pace, with 20 seconds recovery.
This could develop into 2 sets of a similar session, initially starting with a slightly lower number of repetitions:
2 sets of 7 x 100m @ race pace – 1 second, with 20 seconds recovery and 5 minutes between sets.

, Otherwise, you will find that, under fatigue, your stroke technique goes, and you will be working very hard, but missing the times by quite a margin.

, By the time you get to midway, you should find that the 20 seconds recovery, is only just enough to get your breathing back under control. And by the end, you will be gasping for breath as you start the last few repetitions, and the recovery will be essential!

Perform a bench press.,
Perfect your squat.,
Do weighted squats.,
Perform other compound exercises.,
Do lunges.",How to Build Muscle with Compound Exercises1," Bench presses are great because they work out your chest and arms. Bench presses can be done flat or on an incline or decline. You can use barbells, dumbbells, or a machine to perform these exercises.


Avoid locking your arms.
Breathe in as you count to ten.
Push the weight up slightly and exhale.
Inhale as you bring it down to your chest.
Push it up and repeat up to 12 times.;
, Squats are great compound exercises because they exercise your lower body and core. By performing squats, you’ll make considerable strides toward building lower body muscle, as well as your upper body. Ultimately, squats are seen as one of the most challenging and classic compound exercises.


Stand with your feet separated by a shoulder width.
Push your shoulders back.
Extend your arms out parallel with the floor.
Breathe in as you count to ten.
Move your hips backward and down slowly.
Breathe in as you move down, and breathe out as you push yourself away from the floor., Weighted squats are one of the best compound exercises because they work out your lower and upper body together. In fact, if you could only choose one exercise to complete, the weighted squat would be your best bet. It works out both your lower body, core, and upper body.


Position yourself behind the weight.
Stand with your feet separated by a shoulder width.
Slowly bend your knees until your thighs are parallel with the ground.
Grab the bar, lift it, and move upward until your legs are perpendicular to the ground.
Exhale as you are almost straight.
Make up to 12 repetitions., Compound exercises work out several muscle groups at one time and are one of the best ways to achieve a ""total"" body work out. Other popular compound exercises include:


Dips. To do a dip, pull yourself up onto two dip bars and lower your body so that your shoulders are below your elbows. After you've achieved this, move up so that your arms are straight. Dips can be risky if you do not have much upper body strength. If your upper body strength is not sufficient to hold your entire body weight, then try doing some bench dips.
Rows. To row, use a rowing machine or exercise machine that has a rowing option. Use your feet to push and your arms to pull to complete your row.
Pull-up. To do a pull-up, use a pull-up bar to pull your body upward as far as you can go., Lunges are a great exercise to include in your compound workout routines. To do a lunge, start with both of your feet together. Then, take a giant step forward with one leg. As you do so, lower your back knee down towards the floor so that both of your knees are close to a 90 degree angle. To exit the lunge, step back with your forward-most foot so that your feet are together again.Try doing lunges while holding a pair of dumbbells or a bar. You can do with bicep curls while doing regular lunges, or try combining lateral raises or upright rows with side lunges.
Keep your knees aligned over your ankles. Do not allow them to go forward towards your toes.

Rest as often as possible in the first few weeks after giving birth.,
Stretch the muscles in your limbs and back the day of your vaginal delivery.,
Stretch after having a cesarean section by beginning with breathing exercises.,
Begin aerobic activity about 2 weeks after a successful vaginal delivery and 3 to 4 weeks after a cesarean section.",How to Create a Postpartum Exercise Routine," While activity may feel like what your body is craving, healthy activity cannot be completed unless your body is fully rested.


The birth process places a lot of strain on your body. Tissue that is torn must be allowed to heal, and the body needs to be rejuvenated to increase energy stores. Exercising without rest can actually do more harm than good. In any exercise routine, experts recommend periods of rest after a particularly strenuous exercise session.
The birth process can be considered an especially strenuous period of exercise that uses a variety of muscles. Rest is necessary after such an exhausting experience. New parents may find it difficult to rest sufficiently because of the added stress of caring for a newborn. This is why it is doubly important to rest as often as possible, whenever you get the chance.;
, By starting your stretching routine immediately after delivery, you can prevent muscles from stiffening. Stiff muscles are more difficult to stretch than muscles that are simply fatigued. Don't overstretch or overexert yourself: slow consistent stretches that extend just until tightness is felt are the best exercises to do in the first few days after a delivery.


Lie on the floor with feet close to your buttocks and your back pressed firmly into the ground. With your arms relaxed lightly at your sides and your muscles relaxed, use your abdomen to raise your head and chin slightly off the ground. Perform this exercise 5 to 10 times, twice daily. Work slowly up to 20 times. When this exercise is comfortably mastered, progress to upper body curls.
Lie on the floor in the same position you used with the head curl ups. With your arms relaxed and your head aligned with your spine, lift your shoulders and head off the ground for 3 seconds. Exhale slowly as you lower your shoulders and head to the floor. Do not use your neck muscles to lift your head: the lift should come from your abdominal muscles. Perform this exercise 5 to 10 times, twice daily.
Exercise the pelvic region by standing or sitting with your legs spread apart. Contract your pelvic muscles by squeezing the internal organs upward. The motion is similar to stopping a stream of urine. Squeeze these muscles 3 or 4 times in succession and repeat as many times as is comfortable throughout the day.
Stretch the legs by lying with your back flat on the floor and your knees bent. Stretch one leg out, hold it, and pull it back in slowly. Repeat this action with the other leg. Continue stretching your legs with this exercise until you can stretch both legs simultaneously.

, Breathing exercises help to remove the buildup of mucus that may be caused by the anesthesia. This mucus accumulates in the lungs and is a side effect of both the medication and the slowed breathing that is caused by anesthesia. When breathing slows, the lungs do not fill and empty completely, causing moisture and mucus to accumulate.


Begin slowly, performing 5 deep breaths every hour you’re awake. Breathe deeply through the nose and mouth. You will feel oxygen-rich air filling your lungs, and you may notice a point when your breath feels wet or raspy. This sound and feeling means that air is reaching the mucus-covered portions of the lungs. After the deep breathing, perform several huffing breaths. A huff is a forceful expulsion of air similar to a loud, abrupt laugh. Spit out any mucus that is dislodged from your lungs. Performing this step regularly will ensure that your lungs return to their healthy, normal potential.
Continue with similar stretching exercises for a cesarean section as were listed for a vaginal delivery. Be careful not to stretch the stomach too soon or place any unmerited stress on the cesarean section scar tissue.

, Start with short, brisk walks until you feel comfortable enough to progress further without becoming exhausted. Slowly build your aerobic exercise routine up until you are keeping your heart rate elevated for 30 minutes or more. Perform aerobic activity at least 4 times a week in order to remove the accumulated body fat caused by pregnancy or breast feeding.


Begin your aerobic workout at a 50 percent exertion level. Gradually work up to a 75 percent exertion level. After 8 to 12 weeks, you can work up to a 100 percent exertion level.

Build strength and endurance together.,
Correct muscle imbalances.,
Concentrate on full-range-of-motion exercises.,
Increase sets and repetitions gradually.,
Warm up before stretching.,
Stretch both sides of your body.,
Use dynamic stretching before your workout and do static stretching after your workout.,
Use weights to increase certain stretches.,
Incorporate stretching before and after your workout.,
Limit your recovery time between sets.,
Combine strength training with cardio.,
Choose compound and hybrid exercises.,
Add plyometrics.,
Try a variety of activities.",How to Build Muscle Endurance," Typically, at the gym you would do fewer repetitions with heavy weights to build strength, and more repetitions with light weights to build endurance. Doing both together in one routine allows you to build muscle strength, size, and endurance all at the same time.Design a routine that involves four exercises for each muscle group. Each exercise should target that muscle group in a different way, requiring movement from a different angle, or with different grip positions. You can use dumbbells, plate loaded bars, and machines or body weight to do strength training exercises.
For the first exercise, you'll do four repetitions per set with the heaviest weight you can handle. Do three sets with a brief rest of a minute or two in between.
Your second exercise uses lighter weights, with eight repetitions per set for three sets.
For your third exercise, choose even lighter weights and do three sets of 12 repetitions each.
In your fourth and final exercise for that muscle group, do three sets of 16 repetitions with the lightest weight.
For example, to build the strength and endurance of the muscles in your back, you might start with T-bar rows for your first, then do wide-grip lat pull-downs, move to one-arm dumbbell rows, and finish off with straight-arm pull-downs.;
, In your strength training, you may focus on one muscle group more than another. If parts of your body are stronger than others, this imbalance causes your body to work inefficiently. That inefficiency not only decreases your muscle endurance, but also makes you more at risk for injury.You might recognize significant muscle imbalances from viral images you've seen on the internet that show bodybuilders with skinny, underdeveloped legs and a massive upper body. These images typically are captioned with a caution not to ""skip leg day."" While your imbalance may not be that significant, you probably have a general idea of which muscle groups need more work – typically, the ones you don't enjoy, or even dread, working on.
You can find more specific muscle imbalances by looking to common muscle group pairs. If a particular muscle is consistently tight, or always sore after a workout, it may be that its opposing muscle needs to be strengthened. For example, if your triceps are tight and sore, strengthening your biceps can improve this (and vice versa). If you have tight hamstrings, work on your quadriceps, abs, and hip flexors.Bringing the weaker muscle groups into balance with the others can go a long way towards building muscle endurance. Keep in mind that all of your muscles ultimately work together, even if certain exercises work particular parts of your body more than others. If one group has to pick up the slack for the others, efficiency suffers.

, Exercises that employ your full range of motion enable you to work the entire muscle, as well as improving your flexibility. Flexibility is not only essential to helping prevent injury, but can help you build muscle endurance by encouraging your muscles to work more efficiently.With increased flexibility, you'll be able to move more deeply into exercises which require a full range of motion, such as squats. This enables you to work your muscles more effectively. Greater range of motion accesses greater length of the muscle and hence more muscle fibers. Perhaps more importantly, increased flexibility enables you to consistently perform exercises with correct form, which can help prevent strains and injuries.
Full-range-of-motion exercises improve the function in your joints and reduce stress on your tendons. They also will keep the muscle groups surrounding those joints from being overworked.
Using your full range of motion, over time, will increase your muscle strength as well as your muscle endurance.You can use your full range of motion on nearly any exercise. For example, if you're doing squats, make sure every repetition is a full squat, rather than the shorter ""pulse squats"" that only employ about a quarter of your full range of motion.

, If you continue to do the same exercises with the same level of resistance for an extended period of time, eventually you'll get no benefit from the exercises. Progressive overload is the key to continually building muscle endurance.It only takes your body a couple of weeks to adjust to resistance, so you should be increasing the amount of weight you use at least that often.
Along with increasing resistance, you also should increase the number of repetitions you do. This doesn't just apply to weight lifting. If you're running, for example, you should increase the distance you run every couple of weeks to increase your cardiovascular and muscular endurance.

, Before doing any kind of stretching exercises, increasing your body temperature by one or two degrees is essential to get blood flowing to the muscles you intend to stretch. Otherwise, you could end up injuring yourself.Your warm-up doesn't have to be complex. A simple 10-minute walk or jog typically will do the trick.
You may also want to incorporate lunges or squats, particularly if your stretching or strength-training exercises for the session are going to be focused on your lower body.
If you're doing a whole-body workout, you might try a five-minute walk or jog followed by five minutes of jumping rope or jumping jacks to get the blood moving to your arms and shoulders.

, Just as the strength of your muscle groups should be balanced, so should your flexibility. The dominant side of your body may naturally be more flexible than the other, which means you have a deficit to make up.To increase your flexibility for the purposes of building muscle endurance, you should stretch each muscle group every time your exercise. If your non-dominant side is weaker or less flexible, start there and then work on your dominant side.
With all stretching, go as deeply as you can without feeling any pain. Stop when you can feel tension, but before the stretch hurts. You should only feel a pull, not intense burning.
If you've not done a lot of stretching or are particularly stiff, you may want to work with a certified personal trainer in the beginning. They can ensure that you're using correct form and aren't going too far or putting too much stress on your joints.

, Slow, controlled movements that work through your entire range of motion are better suited to building muscle endurance. These stretches also mimic many of the motions you'll use in your full routine, which can enhance your performance.You may be accustomed to static stretches, in which you move into a position to stretch a particular muscle group, hold the stretch for several seconds, and then release. With dynamic stretches, your body is continually moving. This makes them ideal for a continued warm-up at the beginning of your workout.
Start with basic movements, such as neck rotations, shoulder circles, and arm swings. Keep your movements slow and controlled. Breathe deeply and make every movement with intention and focus.
Your movements should be smooth and continuous. Go as far as you can, moving through your full range of motion. If particular muscles are tight, push them as far as you can without pain.

, Using weight with static stretches may help to lengthen your muscles. However, keep in mind that this type of stretching may be too extreme for some people and it can lead to pulling a muscle. Start with unweight stretches and only move up to this form of stretching if regular static stretching becomes too easy for you.


For example, you can do a chest stretch using lightweight dumbbells. Lie on your back on a weight bench with your legs hanging off the end or flat on the floor. Lift the dumbbells to a contracted position over your chest, then slowly lower them so your arms are at your sides. Lower as far as you can without pain, feeling the stretch in your pectoral muscles. Hold the position for about 10 seconds, then slowly raise them back to the contracted position above your chest.
You can also stretch your biceps and triceps using dumbbells and a weight bench at a 60-degree incline (or lying completely flat for a deeper stretch). Lean back on the bench and curl the dumbbells, then lower them slowly into a maximum stretch for your biceps. Extend your arms straight up and then lower the dumbbells to either side of your head for a triceps stretch.
It's possible to add resistance to almost any static stretch, using dumbbells, wrist and ankle weights, or resistance bands.

, Stretching encourages the growth of fascia, the connective tissue that holds your muscles in place. Not growing this connective tissue as you are building muscles can inhibit your ability to build both strength and endurance over time.Dynamic stretching may be better to do at the beginning of your routine, while static stretching works better as you're entering your cool-down phase.You don't have to limit your stretching to a dedicated ""workout time,"" however. There are plenty of basic stretches that you can do throughout the day, such as when you are sitting at your desk at work. These stretches not only keep your muscles active, but encourage the continued growth of fascia. For example, you can do neck rotations after working on the computer for an hour, or stand and do shoulder circles or arm swings.

, If you're trying to build muscle endurance, you don't want your muscles to recover – you want them to continue to work for longer. When you exercise, particularly during strength-training exercises, shorten your rest breaks and take fewer of them.To really build muscle endurance, you should be working yourself to your limit at every session. Try not to stop until you feel as though you absolutely must, or you can no longer complete the repetitions or movements with good form.
You can push yourself this way and build muscle endurance without fancy equipment or a gym membership. For example, you can do 10 pull-ups, 10 squats, 10 push-ups, and then 10 sit-ups. Do each exercise back-to-back with no rest. At the end of that set, if you can no longer continue, take a brief rest, then go through the circuit twice more. Keep in mind that this builds cardio endurance, but not skeletal muscle endurance unless the exercises are repeated to failure.
You also might replace the traditional rest time with a cardio interval. For example, do a set of strength-training exercises, then jump rope or jog in place for 30 seconds, then return to another strength-training exercise.
An added benefit of decreasing your recovery time between sets is that you may find your exercise sessions don't take as much time out of your day.

, When you divide your training regimen into ""strength days"" and ""cardio days,"" you'll have a difficult time building muscle endurance. To successfully build endurance, you need to engage all of your energy systems at once.Working out in intervals is a good way to do this. For example, you might use a bench press, then jump rope for a minute, then do squats, then do overhead presses, then do crunches.
Set your intervals so that upper-body movements are followed by lower-body movements. This gives your muscles a little more recovery time even though your body is constantly moving.
When you're doing strength-training exercises, try to do your repetitions as quickly as you can while still maintaining good form.

, Compound exercises require using more than one joint, while hybrid exercises combine two distinct types of movement into one exercise. Doing both of these together increases the whole-body component of your routine, which will help you build muscle endurance.Squats, push-ups, and pull-ups are examples of compound exercises. Bicep curls, on the other hand, are an example of an isolated exercise – they only focus on your biceps, with some work being done by your other arm muscles, but nothing in your lower body.
Combining two compound exercises, or one compound exercise with an isolated exercise, produces a hybrid exercise. For example, you might do a squat with an overhead press. The more muscles you involve in each exercise, the more your heart is stimulated. This increases both your muscle and cardiovascular endurance.
Adding an isolated exercise to a compound exercise, such as doing lunges with bicep curls, is a good way to build muscle endurance while also targeting a particular muscle group for more intense exercise. This can be especially helpful if you are trying to correct a muscle imbalance.

, Plyometrics involves explosive movements that stimulate the development of fast-twitch muscle fibers to increase your speed and power. While this might not sound so much like endurance, these movements require a lot of energy and will present a significant challenge to your muscles.Full plyometrics routines are designed primarily for professional athletes, and can take quite a toll on the body of beginners or amateur workout enthusiasts. However, you can borrow some of the more basic, lower-impact plyometrics movements and incorporate them into your regular workout regimen.
For example, you might include a set of burpees or jumping knee tucks between regular strength-training exercises. Keep in mind that even activities such as jumping rope are technically plyometrics exercises.

, In as little as a couple of weeks, your muscles are going to get used to doing even the most well-crafted exercise routine. Switching up activities keeps your muscles from being overused because you're asking them to move in different ways. If you want to build stamina and endurance, it's important to be agile and able to adapt to different movements.One way to ensure you have constant access to a variety of different fitness activities is to join your local gym or fitness center. Most offer many different classes that you can jump into periodically to challenge your muscles as well as motivate yourself mentally.
If joining a gym is out of your reach, you can still increase the variety in your training regimen by planning several different routines and rotating them. One way to ensure you don't know what to expect (physically or mentally) would be to provide each routine with a number. Each day, draw a number or use a random-number generator online to pick the routine you'll do that day.
You also might consider joining a community sports league, if there's a particular sport that you enjoy. Playing a sport is a good way to add variety to your training regimen, and most sports also build muscle endurance.

Familiarize yourself with your aerobic routine.,
Determine the type of music you will need for the aerobic routine.,
Preview a variety of songs from the genre you selected.,
Select music with a tempo that matches your routine.,
Organize songs in your playlist so they align properly with your aerobics routine.,
Rotate your aerobic music song selections regularly.",How to Choose Music for Aerobics," This will help you determine the type of music you need, as well as the tempo.


Practice the aerobic routine until you are familiar enough with the routine to select music for it. This is especially helpful if you are the instructor of an aerobics class.
If your aerobic routine is based on an instructional video, watch the video several times until you feel comfortable enough to select music for your routine.;
, Different types of aerobics may require a specific music genre or style.


Choose a music type from the genre your aerobic routine is based on. For example, choose upbeat dance or techno music for dance aerobics, hip-hop music for hip-hop aerobics, or upbeat jazz music for jazz and funk aerobics.
If the aerobic routine is very specific, such as country-style dance aerobics, consider choosing upbeat pop-country music for the routine.

, This will allow you to develop the ideal playlist for your aerobics workout.


Perform an Internet search to locate artists and songs from the genre you selected. Many websites will allow you to listen to the song in its entirety for free or provide you with a sample of the song to help you determine if you want to purchase it.
If you do not have Internet access, visit a retail store that specializes in music in your local area. Some stores may have listening stations or allow you to preview the music before you purchase it.
You can also tune in to a local radio station that plays music from the aerobic genre you have chosen to generate ideas for your playlist.

,


Perform part of your aerobic workout as you listen to the music or visually picture the aerobics routine in your head to determine whether the tempos match with one another.
The music tempo you need may vary depending on your aerobics routine. Most aerobic dance routines fall in the tempo range of between 130 and 160 beats per minute, whereas step aerobics may have a range of between 118 and 125 beats per minute.
Choose slower tempos for the stretching, warm-up and cool-down parts of your aerobics routine. Usually these tempos will fall within the range of 100 and 120 beats per minute.
You can also look for compilation albums or music collections designed specifically for aerobic workouts, which already contain song selections with tempos that fall within the appropriate ranges.

,


Place the slower, more melodic songs at the beginning and end of your playlist for the stretching, warm-up, and cool-down phases.
Place all of the intense, fast-tempo song selections in the middle of the playlist during the most intense phases of the workout.

, This will prevent you or your aerobics class from becoming bored or losing interest during workouts from listening to the same music repeatedly.

Complete a full workout.,
Work different parts of your body.,
Build a balanced weekly routine.",How to Build Muscle with Compound Exercises2," Some people favor doing complete workouts instead of working out specific muscle groups. Because of this, compound exercises are one of the best types of exercises to create a challenging full workout routine.


Work out your lower body, core, and upper body on the same day. For instance, complete 3 to 5 sets of bench presses, squats, and planks.
Consider limiting the total number of your sets to no more than 25.
Make sure to rest at least a day before completing another routine.
Try to exercise three times a week for the best results., Another approach to performing a routine is to focus on different parts of your body on different days. This way, you’ll give certain muscle groups time to rest and heal in-between workouts.


For your lower body workout, consider squats, 10 to 20 minutes on the erg/rowing machine, and lunges. Consider doing 4 to 6 sets.
For your upper body workout, consider dips, bench presses, and pull-ups.
Limit your sets to 6 repetitions.
Be conscious of what types of exercises you are doing and try to categorize them appropriately. This is especially difficult because compound exercises use more than one muscle group at a time. You can classify exercises appropriately by grouping them based on the type of muscle that is used the most in a particular exercise. Group squats with leg presses – both focus on lower body strength., You also need to make sure you balance your overall exercise routine. This includes making sure that you rotate your compound exercise routine with any cardiovascular exercises you engage in.


Since some forms of compound exercises also count as cardio, such as using an elliptical or rowing machine, so you might consider doing compound exercise routines on one day and then doing sustained cardio exercise on the following day. For instance, try doing an upper body workout that includes some cardio on Mondays and Wednesdays. Then, do a compound workout that includes cardio on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And then on Fridays and Saturdays, do a cardio-only workout, such as walking.
You may also consider doing compound exercises in the morning, doing cardio at night, and then resting the following day.
Make sure to rest a day between exercising the same muscle group. In addition, consult a doctor or personal trainer if you have any unexpected pain or other problems."
"
Consume enough protein.,
Eat a well-balanced diet.,
Consult a trainer or physician.",How to Build Muscle with Compound Exercises3," Perhaps the most important part of building muscle is to consume enough protein. This is important, as protein is the building block for muscles. Without it, your compound exercises won’t have the desired effect.


Healthy men should consume 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Healthy women should consume 1 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.
Consult a nutritionist or doctor if you have special dietary needs or a condition that might impact the way your body processes protein., While meat and protein are important in order to build muscle with compound exercises, you also need to maintain a well-balanced diet. This is important, as without the proper nutrients and vitamins, your body won’t function as the well-oiled machine you want it to be.


Make sure you consume enough fiber.
Make sure you consume enough vitamins, like A, B, C, and D.
Avoid processed foods such as sausages, hot dogs, prepackaged meals and simple carbohydrates such as pastries, crackers, cookies, white bread, pasta, white rice, soft drinks, and alcohol., Depending on your age, general shape, and specific circumstances, you should consult a trainer or physician. This is important, as any health conditions you have may be negatively impacted by your exercise routine. In addition, a personal trainer may also instruct you on proper ways to exercise so you don’t hurt yourself.


Talk with a trainer before beginning any serious exercise routine. You may be able to schedule a one-time consultation. You may also be able to briefly speak with a trainer at a gym you attend.
Consider watching training videos on YouTube or other websites to learn more about the correct way to perform compound exercises.
If you have a cardiovascular condition or muscular-skeletal problems, you should talk to your physician before starting an exercise routine."

Reward yourself.",How to Balance Work and Going to the Gym," Sometimes it can be difficult to think of a time to exercise. You may think back on your day and wonder when in the world could you fit in a trip to the gym or even just a few minutes of exercise. Writing out your schedule can help.Sit down and write out a very detailed timeline and schedule of your typical workday. Start with when you get up, how long it takes you to get ready, what time you leave for work, etc. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be to find time in your day.Once you have your schedule and timeline written out, search for a time that would be good to schedule in a workout or a trip to the gym. Also consider if you could rearrange things in your schedule to make more room for a workout.
In addition, find some back up times. If you run work late at work on Monday, where can you fit in a workout on Tuesday?
You may not find room for a workout every day or enough time to fit in an entire trip to the gym. That's OK. Even 10-15 minutes is enough time to fit in a short exercise session.;
, After looking at your daily schedule and working on your calendar you may realize you'll need to different types of workouts on different days depending on how much time you have.


Have a list of different types of activities of varying lengths. This will give you much more flexibility in your schedule to fit in a workout.
If you have at least an hour or so, this is a great chance to hit the gym and do a combination of cardio and strength training. You'll have plenty of time to do adequate amounts of each.
If you have only 30-45 minutes, choose to do either cardio or strength training. You could try to squeeze in both, but you may have an easier time just doing one or the other.
If you just have 15-20 minutes, try an ultra fast workout. There are many available online, on workout DVDs or in magazines. They usually combine both cardio and strength training so that it elevates your heart rate rapidly.

, Once you know what time of day or between which activities you can fit in a gym session, start creating a workout calendar.


Schedule in your exercise for the entire week on your calendar. You can even schedule in an entire month if you feel that'd be helpful. This will help you keep you on track of what time you're going to exercise, where and what type.Also, scheduling in your exercise in a planner or calendar like a doctors appointment or important meeting can help you stick to your plan.

, Being prepared and ready to exercise can help weed out some excuses of why you can't fit in the time to be active.


Sometimes it's difficult to go home after a long day, change for the gym, and then go back out. Change into your gym clothes at the office or bring your pre-packed bag with you right to the gym after work.
If you prefer to hit the gym in the morning or exercise in the morning, bring your work clothes and toiletries with you to the gym so you can leave right to work.
In addition to getting your gym bag packed in advance, you could lay your workout clothes for an early morning exercise session or even wear your workout clothes to sleep.

, You may not be able to do your ideal gym workout everyday. Even though each day may not be perfect, getting in even a few minutes of activity is better than none.


Many definitions of exercise, especially cardio, says that you need to do the activity for at least 10 minutes. If that's all you, then you're meeting those minimum guidelines.
The USDA suggests getting in 150 minutes of exercise each week. If you just did a 10 minute walk or short work out 3 times a day, 5 days a week, you'd meet that goal.

, When you go to gyms these days, you'll notice that many have a large variety of cardio equipment. Find the right type of machine for you and one that you enjoy.


Since cardio exercises will most likely make up a large part of your exercise during the week (that 150 minutes each week), you'll want to make sure that you find an activity that you enjoy.
Try out each of the cardio machines at the gym. If you're not sure how to use some of them, ask a personal trainer or gym staff member to help you.
If you don't enjoy doing cardio inside the gym, see if there is something you can do outside. Running, jogging and biking are all activities that may be more enjoyable for you outside of the gym.

, One way to get you into the gym and more excited about your workout is trying out a few group classes. These are fun and enjoyable ways to get moving.


Group classes may be more enticing to you and more motivating for you to get to the gym due to the group aspect of it.You may meet friends and get to enjoy your 7 pm class every week. It's fun to hit the gym hard with friends in a group.
Many gyms offer a wide variety of classes that are geared to many fitness levels. Try out a few that you think would be fun. Try: aerobic dance classes, water aerobics, weight lifting classes, yoga, pilates or even kickboxing.

, Studies have shown that one way to stay motivated and get to the gym is working out with a friend.Ask friends, family members or coworkers to go to the gym with you. This will be especially helpful if you need to exercise early in the morning or later in the evening. Having someone to ""feel the pain"" with you is nice.
It might also be helpful and motivating to start a little friendly competition. If you're a competitive person, this might keep you on schedule., One of the reasons people give up on working out or begin to skip the gym is because they get bored of their routine. Prevent this by changing it up.Getting on the treadmill each day for 45 minutes might get old after awhile. Even doing the same weight lifting routine can get boring. Switch up the activities you do throughout the week to prevent you from getting burnt out.
In addition to changing the type of exercise you do, consider alternating between some outside activities and some gym exercise. Some days you may enjoy a nice walk outside, while other days you may want to spend more time lifting weights at the gym.
Also include more fun and non-traditional activities for exercise. A bike ride through the city, a hiking trip or kayaking tour are all fun and innovative ways to get in some physical activity.

, Sometimes even no matter how much time or how prepared you are to hit the gym, you're just not in the mood. Give yourself an extra boost by writing out some reasons why exercise is beneficial.


Both cardio and strength training activities offer you a wide range of benefits. Some include: decreased risk of osteoporosis, increased metabolism and increased ability to burn calories, decreased risk for diabetes and high blood pressure, improved sleep, improved mood, and increased energy.Exercise may also make you feel proud of yourself, happy, content, energized and ""on track"" with any healthy eating plans you may be following.
Write out some of these benefits as they apply to you. When you're not feeling up to working out, try reviewing some of these benefits a few times in your head. You might just get the little extra bump in motivation you need.

, Some studies have shown that if you spend some time visualizing yourself working out, the more likely you are to actually follow through with your work out.If you workout in the morning, take 5 or 10 minutes at night to visualize yourself working out. See yourself getting up with your alarm, getting dressed and going to the gym. Follow a similar pattern even if you workout in the afternoon.
Also visualize and imagine how you feel after a workout. Concentrate on those positive feelings.

, Rest days are an important part of your physical activity routine. In addition, life might get in the way and force you to have a day off. Plan for these in your mind so they don't stress you out.Everyone goes through busy seasons at work, meetings that run late or bad traffic on your commute to the gym. That's fine. If you missed your work out or didn't have the time, take the day off. Get back to your regular schedule as soon as you can.
Think of ""missed days"" as your day off or recovery time from exercise. These rest days are important to your recovery and the repair of your body and muscles after a few days of exercise.

, Nothing is more motivating than a reward. Set up some enticing rewards to help you stay motivated and on track with your exercise plan.


Decide what you need to do in order to earn a reward. Maybe it's going to the gym 3-4 times a week for an entire month, doing 150 minutes of cardio each week or running 15 miles a week.
Schedule in a reward once you meet that goal. It might be purchasing a few new workout songs, getting a new workout shirt or even something more luxurious like a massage.
If you're trying to lose weight or stick to a healthy eating plan, you may want to avoid rewarding yourself with dinners out or other food related activities.

Do anything to keep fit.,
Consider shorter fitness bursts.,
Try ten minute bursts of fitness.,
Don't berate yourself about not enjoying exercise.",How to Create a Consistent Workout Plan for Regular Exercise," Any fitness exercise counts. For many people who aren’t regularly exercising now, they might avoid exercising as it seems they need to be huffing and puffing in order to get any benefit. This is not true. Simply raising your heart rate and your breathing level a bit is an indication that you are working out to a reasonable level. You are stressing your body just a bit, causing it to become stronger and fitter. As a result, any activity which impacts the body in this way is beneficial. You might want to walk further from your car to your office to add some daily physical activity, for example. Or you might want to get off at an earlier bus stop to add a short walk to your day. Even cleaning around the house can be considered exercise if you are beginning to feel the burn.;
, These are better for you than prolonged exercise anyway. Working out for ten minute or fifteen minute bursts will help you fit exercise in, while also making the most of the time you have. Since these are shorter periods of time, you will be able to work out harder than you might for a longer period of time. This is going to help you burn more calories and keep your fitness levels high. In addition, since you will be able to fit the fitness into your schedule more easily, you will have a greater chance of sticking to the plan for the long haul.

, Try adding ten minute bursts of activity throughout your day, adding up to as much activity as you like. You can always find a spare ten minutes in your day to walk around the block or perhaps to clean up the house. In this way, you can keep your fitness levels up without interfering with your life or with the needs of your family.

, Fitness isn’t necessarily something that comes naturally. You need to be committed to getting fit in order to ensure you stay healthy. With these shorter sessions of activity, you can make fitness a priority – and still manage the rest of your life.

Create healthy habits when you’re young.,
Acknowledge that your body is changing.,
Seek out supportive people.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Avoid Middle Age Spread1," Don’t wait until you’re 50 to start eating right and working out. The easiest way to have good habits when you’re older is to start them when you’re young, then simply adapt them as your body changes. You might feel challenged trying to change your diet or find time in your schedule to exercise – remember that practice makes perfect, so start today!;
, With age come changes in your hormones and metabolism. You will start to lose muscle mass and gain a little more fat overall, which means your body doesn’t burn calories like it used to. The first step to preventing unwanted weight gain is recognizing that you may need to improve your habits just to keep your current shape. Start eating a healthier diet, increase your amount of physical activity, or both.If you have always lived a healthy lifestyle, keep it up! Do not be discouraged if it becomes harder to maintain your fitness and shape over time.

, Surround yourself with friends and family who encourage your goal of maintaining a healthy weight.Include others in your shopping and meal planning and cook healthy meals together. Have a “gym buddy” or “walking partner” and hold each other accountable for getting your exercise. You’ll find it easier to maintain good habits when supportive people are involved.


Help your friends and colleagues avoid middle age spread, too. Set a challenge to all lose weight and keep fit together.

, People who do not get enough sleep tend to snack more and consume more calories.Being sleep-deprived can also affect your mood and energy, making it harder to stay active. Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night.Tips for getting good sleep include:Follow a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up around the same time each day.
Don’t nap too much during the day.
Avoid caffeine after 4pm, or earlier if you’re sensitive to caffeine.
Use your bedroom only for sleeping to train your brain that “bed” means “sleep.” Don’t watch TV in your bedroom.
Develop a relaxing bedtime routine. Have a warm bath, read a book, give yourself a hand massage, or have a cup of decaf tea.

Find your pace.,
Establish a Breathing method.,
Try not to change.,
Be consistent.",How to Breathe Correctly During Exercising," If you're dancing or doing yoga or even running, there might be music in the background. Find the beats in your song and try to breathe along with them. If it's a fast song, breathe maybe every 2-4 beats. If you're running breathe along with your pace. Breathe in and out every 4-8 counts. Count to keep time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.;
, Decide how you're going to breathe. Most people like to inhale through their nose, hold it for however long they need, then exhale through their mouths. Exhale slowly so you can keep up with your counts and don't breathe super loudly like Darth Vader. This will waste energy and get annoying.

, While you can change your breathing pace, it's better not to. If you are going to, make sure you have the counts in your head.

, No matter how tired you are, try to keep breathing. If you feel lightheaded or anything, though. STOP. Take a break. Remember that the breathing is there to help you not to hurt you.

Decrease your caloric intake.,
Eat breakfast every day.,
Replace bad fats in your diet with good fats.,
Base your meals on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.,
Cut down on sweets.,
Minimize your alcohol.",How to Avoid Middle Age Spread2," You may need to eat 200 fewer calories in your 50’s than you did in your 30’s and 40’s. However, getting vitamins and nutrients is just as important – and keeping up your calcium and vitamin D is even more important now to prevent osteoporosis.Limit calories without losing nutritional value by choosing the right foods.It will help to keep a food journal. Write down what you eat every day. Look at food labels and record the calories you’re getting from your foods. Take into account what is a serving size for what you’re eating – if the label lists an item as 200 calories but you’re eating three times the serving size, that’s 600 calories!

, Studies have shown that people who eat breakfast every day tend to gain less weight than those who skip breakfast. Start your day with a healthy meal to kick start your metabolism and boost your energy. Have egg whites, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, whole grain oatmeal, or fresh fruit.

, Bad fats are those from red meat, butter, margarine, and shortening. Decrease how much of these you eat as much as possible. Cook with olive oil instead of butter; olive oil contains good fats that are much healthier for you. Replace red meat like beef and pork with poultry like chicken or turkey. Eat lots of fatty fish, which contain good fat and lots of nutrients. Salmon, mackerel, and herring are great options. Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy.


Get protein from unsalted nuts, seeds, soy, and beans.
Limit eating takeout or fast food to once a week., Fresh fruits and veggies contain important nutrients and low fat content. Fresh and frozen is better than canned – canned fruits and vegetables often contain high amounts of salt and additives. Eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.Make the bulk of your meals with whole grains, which have tons of fiber – choose whole wheat bread, rice, pasta, oats, and quinoa.


Avoid white bread and other refined sugars.
Eat a variety of vegetables – dark leafy greens, red and yellow veggies, peas and beans, and starches., Sugars add lots of calories to your daily diet. Cut down on cakes, pies, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, and candy. Avoid other common sugar-heavy items like soda, energy drinks, sweetened tea and coffee, and flavored water.Spice up regular water with natural flavors like lemon, lime, or orange slices. Try mint, cucumber, or even basil for fun flavors.
You don’t have to completely eliminate sugar – it’s okay to treat yourself. Don’t make sugar a part of your regular diet, though.

, Alcohol contains a lot of sugar and extra calories. Other than the health effects of alcohol, consuming it regularly can make it much harder to maintain a healthy weight.Limit your alcohol to one drink a day at the maximum, and even less if you can.

Get at least 10,000 steps daily.,
Watch TV less than 2 hours a day.",How to Avoid Middle Age Spread3," Ideally, create a workout schedule that gets you moving for 30 minutes a day at least 5 days a week.That gets you to 150 minutes of activity weekly, a great goal if you’re doing moderate aerobic activities like quick walking, biking, or swimming.


If your workouts are more vigorous, like jogging, you can shoot for 75 minutes a week of activity.

, Aerobic workouts are those that increase your heart rate and breathing rate. They help you keep weight off by burning calories, and minimize your risk for heart disease and diabetes. Walking, slow jogging, biking, and swimming are good options.Opt for swimming if you have joint pain; it’s a great non-weight bearing aerobic exercise.

, Do strength training exercises at least twice a week to build muscle and help increase your metabolism.Lift weights or use exercise equipment at the gym – but always have a professional show you how to avoid injury. Try some other exercises to build muscle; tips for doing these can be found at https://nihseniorhealth.gov/exerciseandphysicalactivityexercisestotry/strengthexercises/01.html:


Wrist curls, arm curls, chair dips, elbow extensions, and seated rows.
Knee curls, back leg raises, toe stands, squats, and lunges.
The main way to minimize belly fat is to burn calories, but it won’t hurt to strengthen your core to tone your abs and have more strength for other workouts.Do crunches, plank, bridge pose, segmental rotation, quadruped, and superman.

, Studies suggest you’re less likely to gain weight if you walk at least 10,000 steps a day.This equates to about 5 miles (8 km).Try to increase your daily steps by about 500 steps per week until you reach your goal.


FitBit is a great tool to monitor your steps. It’s a small watch you wear that keeps track of your heart rate, steps you take, miles you walk, and more. Or get a simple pedometer or use an online tool to monitor your steps.
Easy ways to increase your steps are taking the dog for a walk, using the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away from your destination, window shopping, walking to visit neighbors or run local errands, and even getting up to change the channel on the TV., Cut down on your couch time by limiting TV viewing to under 2 hours a day. People who watch fewer than 2 hours of TV a day tend to gain less weight than those who watch more.Take a walk outside after dinner instead of sitting in front of the TV.


If you can’t miss your favorite program, do light to moderate exercises while you watch. Do squats, crunches, or even just jog or walk in place.

Look in the mirror each morning and remind yourself that you love yourself.",How to Be Happy With Your Body1," Check yourself out from eyes to toes, noting everything that makes you smile, no matter how small. The urge to be critical about things you don’t like will be high, but that’s okay! When you feel yourself getting critical simply move on down your body. Don’t even give these critical thoughts the time of day, and certainly don’t harp on them.If you’re convinced that “there is nothing to love” about your body, then you need to slow down. From beautiful rose cheeks to strong, powerful legs, really admire yourself instead of jumping straight to negatives.
Love yourself first, and loving your body will only get easier.;
, Start with your body, but don’t end there – cover all of your amazing qualities to see that it isn’t all about the your exterior. A big issue with people’s self-esteem is that they start to believe the only thing that matters is their body, putting too much weight on their appearances and not who they are overall. You don’t judge people purely on their body, and people don’t do the same to you.


Attractiveness is not determined by your appearance only. In study after study, participants are ranked as more attractive after people get to know them, and know they are a good person., Simply looking and smelling nice each day will do wonders for your self-esteem. Furthermore, take a few minutes each day to develop your own routine. It can be a facial cream, a slow, hot shave, or simply moisturizing before bed. When you treat your body like a temple, it will start to look at feel like one too.

, It is amazing how much the way you hold yourself dictates your appearances, and even self-esteem. Good posture isn't just about looking ""strong,"" it actually aligns your spine, muscles, and even organs to work more efficiently, meaning you feel better too. In general, you want to think of being upright to improve your posture:


Chin up, parallel to the floor.
Ears line up over your shoulders.
Shoulders line up over your hips.
Hips line up over your knees.
Knees line up over your feet.

, A daily affirmation of how awesome you are is one of the best ways to simply, quickly, and easily reinforce the importance of you in your own life. Give yourself a smile and remind yourself not to hate on your own best friend. It may feel a little corny at first, but that’s okay! This isn’t about being perfect or cool, this is about you being you. And, paradoxically, this desire to just be yourself and not worry about perfection will make you more attractive!


At the very least, banish put-downs in front of the mirror. Don't criticize your reflection, and break the habit of doing so."

You don't have to be intimidated by fancy exercise machines and weight-loss jargon, you don't have to get locked into expensive gym memberships and commitments. All you've got to do is start moving at your own pace, and learning to enjoy being active.


Start walking for 15 or 20 minutes a day, just a mile or two in a loop around your neighborhood. Walk at a comfortable pace, quick enough that you might build up a light sweat by the time you get back to your house. Make it comfortable. Regular walks will get you in shape for more strenuous exercise.
Consider working more walking into your daily work commute, or by walking to school with friends instead of taking a short drive. Vary the route you take to keep things interesting.
If you feel bored or uninspired by your walks, listen to music, audio books, or talk on the phone while you do it to maximize the time. Stay busy and stay active.;
, Recent studies reveal that sitting for long periods of time can have a negative effect on overall health and lifespan. If you work somewhere you generally sit for many hours a day, consider working at a standing-desk, or just standing up and doing your work whenever possible. If it doesn't require that you sit, stand up and use your legs. You'll likely notice a difference in your energy levels and feel better at the end of the day, rather than more tired.


Treadmill desks are also increasingly common at workplaces and in the home. If you've got an old treadmill gathering dust in the basement, consider getting or setting up a make-shift desk on which to do your work while walking at a casual pace.

, Many of us are in the habit of relaxing with screen time in the evening, and it's tough for workout sessions to compete with your favorite entertainment. The good news is, it doesn't have to! There are several simple changes to your routine that can make your Game of Thrones addiction motivation to exercise, instead of a barrier:


Scoot the couch back and stand while watching. Try doing squats and lunges, stretches, or leg lifts while watching. Even standing and sitting repeatedly is a form of exercise.
Challenge yourself to a certain number of push ups or sit ups during each commercial break.
Move a stationary bike or other exercise machine where you can use it while watching the screen.

, It won't help to push yourself so hard that it makes you miserable. Choose a set that feels doable for you, whether that's 30 seconds of walking in place or 20 push ups. A comfortable, achievable set that you can repeat several times will help you develop good habits and build up to more strenuous exercise.Take a short rest and stretch your muscles after each set. Other than loosening your muscles and warming them up for activity, stretching will also help you avoid the soreness that can turn beginners off of sudden exercise. If you go play basketball for the first time in several years, you're likely to be sore the next day, making it unlikely that you'll be enthusiastic to go again soon. Stretching will help alleviate that soreness., Don't overdo it at first. A good way to ease into becoming more active is to try a new physical activity for at least, but no more than, 20 minutes a day in the beginning. Tiring out your muscles by doing too much won't do your body any favors, but you need to stay at it long enough to get your heart rate up to feel the benefits of your new active lifestyle.

, Pick a time that will be convenient, or identify a time that you're usually inactive, or use for television-watching, which you could replace or supplement with some tiny activity.


One of the most common things that keeps people from getting active is that they don't have time. But, if you usually watch TV or mess round on the internet for a couple hours each night, taking 20 minutes from the routine will still leave you the relax time you need at the end of a long day, but gives you the opportunity to get a little more active at the same time.

, Help yourself reinforce new habits by acknowledging the improvements that exercise brings to your life. Even in the short-term, exercise can boost your mood and improve your sleep patterns. In the long-term, an active lifestyle provides you with a more capable and comfortable body. Stay focused on these benefits. If your exercise routine isn't making you happy, adjust the schedule or the type of exercise until you find one that does. Staying fit is a long-term project, and it's okay to take a while to find the right approach.

, If you're a gamer, consider dropping the Xbox controls and playing a physical game in the great outdoors. You don't have to be an expert to play informally at the park with friends, or join a beginners' league for a sport of your choice that'll get you moving and having fun in a light competitive atmosphere.


If you like traditional and team sports, consider:

basketball
touch football
soccer
softball
tennis


If you're not a fan of traditional sports, but want to actively compete, consider:


ultimate frisbee or disc golf

kickball
humans vs. zombies
Parkour
capture the flag
paintball



, If competitive sports aren't your thing and you prefer the pristine sounds of nature, take up hiking. Contemplate your life in solitude, and traverse as many miles as you can on foot. Seek out the great hikes in your area, checking out state and national parks for scenic vistas and beautiful trails. It's one of the cheapest and most rewarding ways of getting active and appreciating natural beauty.

, If you have trouble keeping to a routine yourself, or you just want to get active under the guidance of an instructor, sign up for a regular aerobic exercise class that'll get you moving regularly in a structured environment. Meeting up in a public place with strangers can be a good way of both motivating you to keep up and not caring how you look. It's just a bunch of strangers, after all. The differences are subtle, and not that complicated:



Aerobics is high-energy cardiovascular exercise

Zumba is a dance-aerobics that's fun and energetic, and done to music

Yoga is an ancient series of difficult poses and stretches that build strength and flexibility

Pilates is like a combination of core-strength training and aerobic yoga
If you're going to commit to a gym membership, you can also take advantage of the weight room and the pool, good ways to get active and use fancy equipment you don't have at your own house. It can be fun!

, If you enjoy regular walks, consider amping them up a bit into jogging and invest in a good pair of shoes. Start slow and build up gradually, finding good paths to run on and explore. The more you run, the more you might enjoy it, and start considering training for a 5K, or even a mini-marathon once you take the plunge.

, Cities and towns have never been more bike-friendly. Most towns have lanes specifically designated for bicycles, and drivers are increasingly smart around people on bicycles. Visit a bike shop to get a bicycle right for the road, or consider getting a mountain bike and taking up off-road bicycling if you live somewhere with good trails.

, Who ever said exercise had to be a bummer? Head to the club on Friday night and burn calories dancing to your favorite tunes, or just crank up your own favorites and dance in your sweatpants. No one's watching.

, Even if you're just trying to get walking every day, having someone to walk with can make a huge difference in your commitment and your attitude. If you don't feel up to getting outside and moving around, it'll be harder to cancel if you've already made plans to meet and start walking. Find a regular time that works and make it an unspoken rule that you'll always meet at that place and time to get active together. Make it difficult to cancel.

, Staying routine with your activity is the best way to make it easy on yourself and integrate it into your life. If you've got free time in the morning you might commit to exercise and activity, wake up earlier and get moving. If you've got lots of lazy time in the afternoon, get active then. Start with your 20 minute portion and expand it when you feel ready to, if you feel ready to.

, Sometimes, when you first start exercising, you'll be quite sore, even if you do the proper stretches and take it easy. The next day when you get up, getting active might be the last thing on your mind. Push through. Typically, muscle soreness will last for three days before your muscles get used to the new activity. That's not to say that you'll never be sore again, but ensure your commitment by pushing through those first three days.

, Treating yourself for successfully introducing activity into your life will help you stick to it. Give yourself something to look forward to. If you're going to be enjoying your new active lifestyle, why not get some new exercise clothes? Get those new hiking boots you've had your eye on after bagging a long trail, or check out a new fancy restaurant after exercising and eat something healthy. Make it easy on yourself.

Continue your activity goal outside of work.",How to Avoid Sitting at Your Desk Too Long," It can be tough to figure out just when you can take more steps or be more active at the office. This is especially true if you're super busy during the day and find that your day flies by.Set alarms or reminders for yourself to move. This can help draw your attention to your activity level and help you focus on getting in enough movement or steps during the day.
Email reminders are a great way to grab your attention to get up and move. Most email systems allow you to schedule reminders and alarms that pop up on your computer screen and even your phone.
Schedule walk breaks into your day as well. Block off 10 minutes in your schedule to go for a walk or do some office exercises. Pencil it in, ask an administrative assistant or front desk employee to put it in your schedule or mark it off yourself.
Some pedometers, especially the wristbands and watches, will vibrate or beep whenever you've been sitting for more than an hour at a time. They're a great reminder to get up and move.
It’s important to get up every 30 to 60 minutes. Research shows that light activity for as little as 2 minutes every hour has significant health benefits.;
, Drinking more water is always a great idea to improve your overall health, and it's also a good way to get you up and moving more than you normally do on a typical workday.


The more water you drink, the more you'll be getting up to fill up your water bottle (or get another glass) and the more often you'll be getting up to use the restroom.
Aim for at least eight glasses of clear, hydrating fluids everyday. Go with water, flavored water or even decaf coffee and tea. You may even want to aim for 13 glasses if you're fairly active.If you can, when you get up to use the restroom, use a facility that's farther away from your desk. Use a bathroom on another floor or further down the hallway to get more steps in.
Also, consider using a smaller water bottle. Instead of a 32 oz bottle, purchase an 8 or 16 oz bottle that you'll fill up more often.

, Many studies have recently linked an increase in steps (or meeting that new ""10,000 steps per day"" goal) with a variety of health benefits (like reduced blood pressure).Although you don't have to meet a certain number of steps daily, working towards a goal can help you avoid sitting too long at your desk.


Walk on your lunch break. If you have the opportunity to, take a walking lunch break. Go for at least 10 minutes if you can. Walk outside, walk laps around the building, or take the stairs a few times.
Walk to deliver messages to your co-workers. Instead of sending the usual email, try to get up and deliver messages in person (maybe with a post-it note) to your co-workers instead.
Take the stairs instead of the elevator if your office building has multiple floors. This is an easy way to get in more steps and get your heart rate elevated.
Ask to do small meetings while walking instead of in the conference room. Walk with a small team instead of sitting down for an hour in the conference room.

, If you have a customer service position, or answer the phones or talk on the phone the majority of the day, it can be difficult to actually get away from your desk. However, you can try a variety of things to get yourself up from sitting too long.


Even if you just stand while you talk on the phone, that's an improvement over sitting all day long. Studies have shown standing more helps your blood sugar returns to normal much quicker after a meal, you burn more calories during the day and improve symptoms of arthritis.When you're on the phone, aim to stand as much as you can. Maybe you stand every other phone call or stand for 10 minutes and then sit for 10 minutes and then stand for 10 minutes.
Make sure to distribute your weight equally on both feet so you don't end up with a sore hip or leg. Also keep shoulders down and back to maintain good posture.
Ask your company for a phone headset so you're not tied to your desk by your phone cord. This allows you to stand and walk around as you talk.

, In the event you just cannot get away from your desk, there are some exercises you can do at your desk just to move your body around more.


There are a whole host of desk exercises that you can do at your desk. These help get your heart rate elevated, promote better posture and burn more calories compared to sitting still.You can try anything from doing a quick yoga routine in your office, doing sitting leg raises or doing push-ups on your office floor.
Choose exercises that you're capable of doing and that will work with your particular office environment.

, Another way to make moving more and taking more steps at work easier, is by getting your entire company involved. Talk to your boss or HR department and to help get your whole office environment focused on standing and moving more during the day.


You're probably not the only one in your office that would benefit from moving around more during the day. Ask your friends or co-workers if they'd like to start a walking group at lunch, come a little earlier to walk before work or host a small yoga session in your office.
Ask for a walking or standing desk. Consider talking to HR department or your boss about the ability of getting a walking or standing desk for your office.
Remind you company of the health benefits more movement provides. This may help decrease the use of health insurance and days out sick by employees.

, If you find that you are not able to get up every 30 to 60 minutes, then begin developing a habit of fidgeting while sitting. A study demonstrated that those who fidget had lower health risks than those that didn’t fidget., One particularly good exercise to try to include at work is yoga. Not only does it count as additional activity, but it's also associated with decreased stress and improved posture.You don't need to spend a lot of time practicing yoga at the office. Even a 10 minute quick routine can help provide some benefits.Bring your mat to work (or buy one for your office) and schedule in a yoga session most days. Start with some simple stretches like downward dog, warrior one and two, chair pose, eagle pose or upward facing dog.
If you can't find a space to yoga in your office, look up a local yoga studio or gym and see if you can fit in a quick workout (maybe even only stay for half) during your break or lunch break.

, If you're interested in keeping up your strength or building muscle, try incorporating some resistance training exercises like push-ups or dips.


You can try doing traditional push-ups on the floor (especially if you have a private area to do them) or try doing them on the wall or your desk.
You can also do tricep push-ups as well. You can use the arms of your chair or the side of your desk to lower yourself down.

, Another super easy exercise to fit into your office are lunges and squats. They do not require any equipment and can be done anywhere.


Make sure you have enough space to do lunges. If you have a very small office or cubicle, you may need to find another space so you enough room to do lunges safely.
You can do traditional front lunges or backwards lunges for less of a strain on your joints and muscles.
Squats are a small exercise that do not require a lot of room. You can do a traditional squat or a chair squat where you sit down on your office chair and then stand back up again.

, This particular exercise is another easy one to do at the office as it requires no equipment (though having a desk helps). It can help strengthen your legs and gets you up from a seated position.


Standing leg or calf raises are an ideal exercise for those wanting to get up and move more. This exercise in particular helps improve and promote circulation which is great after an hour or two of being seated.Standing calf raises are just an exercise where you raise yourself onto your ""tippy toes"" and hold that position for a few seconds before lowering back down to flat feet.
You can use a wall, back of a chair, or your desk to help you support yourself and maintain your balance.

, If you cannot get away from your desk or your desk chair, there are leg exercises that you can do while sitting. Leg raises are ideal for those that need to sit longer than they'd like.


Seated leg lifts or raises are great for anyone of any fitness level. Again, they require no equipment (except a chair to sit in) and can be done at any time of day.
As you're sitting on the phone or typing emails lift one of your legs straight out in front of you and hold for a few seconds and then lower that leg back down. Repeat with the opposite leg and alternate sides a few times.
You may try doing a few sets of these throughout the day or do them while you're listening into a conference call.

, Although there is a vast array of health benefits associated with moving more or standing more at work, you should also focus on making sure you meet the recommended weekly minimum of aerobic exercise.


The CDC and USDA recommend that all healthy adults participate in about 150 minutes of aerobic or cardio exercises each week, which is 30 minutes five days a week.This amount provides other health benefits in addition to the ones associated with increased activity at work. Structured cardiovascular exercise is associated with a healthier weight, decreased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, improved mood and improved quality of life.In addition to your desk exercises, aim to include other activities like: jogging, walking, using the elliptical, dancing, taking a spin class, hiking or doing an aerobics class.

, Like cardiovascular exercise, its equally important to include structured strength training each week. These exercises also provide additional health benefits.


The CDC recommends that healthy adults participate in 20 minutes of strength training (making sure to work every major muscle group) at least one day a week.Strength training comes with its own specific health benefits. These exercises have been associated with increased bone density and improved bone health, increased or maintenance of muscle mass and increased metabolism.Include exercises like: yoga, pilates, using free weights or weight machines.

, Although sitting down to watch a good show or movie can be a relaxing way to end your day, there are consequences associated with the additional sitting. Try to avoid watching TV as often as you can.


Studies have linked watching more than two hours of TV daily with a 50% increase of death from any cause (like diabetes or stroke) and a 125% increase in risk of events associated with heart disease (like chest pain or heart attack).Track how much TV you typically watch during the week. If you're averaging more than 14 hours a week, think about other active ways you can spend your time instead.
Consider ending your day with a walk with your spouse, friends or family or do some light stretching or yoga for an evening of relaxation.

, It's a great idea to try to get up and move more during your work day so you're not sitting for extended periods of time. But many people also spend their time at home sitting or being sedentary.


Try to continue your activity goal outside of work. For example, even if you've done a mini yoga routine at lunch and took two walks breaks, don't come home and watch TV for three hours before you go to sleep.
Find ways to keep your activity levels high outside of work. Think about times where you typical sit for longer periods of time or when you watch the most TV. These are times when you need to consider adding in more activity.
You can try: standing or doing some of the same work exercises during TV commercial breaks, taking a walk after dinner or doing household chores when you get home.

Be grateful for what you have, both physical and mental.",How to Be Happy With Your Body2," Don’t feel like you need to jump into the gym for an hour tomorrow – rushing into difficult workouts only makes it more likely that you won’t stick with the habit. Instead, find something you love, whether it is yoga, biking, disc golf, or just walking the dog, and start incorporating it into your daily schedule. Even 10-15 minutes each day is a good start, and as you get stronger you’ll naturally start exercising for longer periods.


Don’t exercise solely to lose weight, though it helps. Exercise is also proven to release stress, improve mental health and clarity, and improve feelings of self-esteem.
Try to do 10-15 pushups and situps during commercial breaks of your favorite shows. Grab the stairs over the escalator. Anything that gets you heart pumping through the day will help.
Picking an exercise habit you actually enjoy doing is key to sticking with it., We are what we eat -- and that is not just a cliche, it is the truth. Even if you struggle to cut junk food, adding in more fruits and vegetables will give your the vitamins and minerals needed to feel great every day. Furthermore, it can help you replace the occasional junk food to feel more full. Instead of eating ice cream, have frozen yogurt of sugar- free ice cream (it's not bad at all). Instead of having chips of any kind, have pretzels or nuts or healthy popcorn. Instead of having fountain drinks loaded with sugar, try diet kinds.

, This is one of the few cases where “retail therapy,” is not just a joke. The clothes you wear have a significant impact on how you look and feel, accentuating your favorite qualities and downplaying those that make you self-conscience. The only way to know what you like is to go try stuff on, and the experience alone is a great way to have fun in your body and look at yourself in a sexy new light., Being happy with your body doesn't mean you don't want it to change -- and even the happiest people are comfortable enough to say, ""I know I can improve."" That's because working on something and seeing growth is one of the best ways to improve your self esteem. Maybe you want to cut some belly fat, or clear your skin up, or work on your posture. This seems daunting all at once, but by themselves each goal is much more manageable. And, once conquered, the other goals will only get easier, too.Having a plan makes all issues and worries much easier to get your head around.

, Thoughts like “I’m lazy and useless,” “no one will ever find me attractive,” or “I hate my body” are not only hurtful and wrong, they create traps of self-doubt that it is very hard to climb out of. The first step to being happy with your body is to stop being your own worst enemy, which means countering these thoughts with far more realistic ideas. For example:


”I’m not lazy, and I’m certainly not useless. I’m already finding ways to work on my body image, being proactive where most people are not.”
”Saying ‘no one will ever find me attractive,’ is selfish and untrue – I can’t control others, but I can control myself, and that is one very, very attractive quality.”
”I am my body, and I don't hate myself. I may be unhappy right now, but I've done great, fun things, and that will only continue.

, Don't let the media and photos from the internet put you down. Facebook and the media are notorious for creating an unrealistic standard of beauty that does not exist -- it is simply the culture of only sharing what is beautiful, even if that means Photoshopping real people to look more attractive than they really are. Try cutting your social media diet down if you're having trouble with this step.Comparing yourself with others is a fool's errand, because you can never really be or understand them and their own faults. More often than not, you're simply projecting your insecurities.

Everyone is insecure about their body once in a while. You're not alone, and that should be comforting. If even the people you call ""attractive"" get unhappy about their body every now and then, then you can't put too much stock in your own self-criticism.

, Your weight is only one small, small measure of your body -- and it is not a very good one, at that. The number of pounds you weigh not only fluctuates 3-5 pounds throughout the day and month, making an accurate reading difficult, but weight is necessarily tied to muscles, height, and body type. As such, it is not a great single indicator of your health or body image -- but people still get obsessed over that little number. Focus more on body health, not the image on a scale, to both look at feel healthier.

, Gratitude and thanks will make you appreciate what you have, even if you don't feel happy about it at the moment. Remember that you have a wonderful, working body, internet access, and the desire to make yourself better -- none of which should be taken for granted. If you can't get yourself to be happy with your body just yet, try to be appreciative of your opportunities first. The happiness will soon follow."

Make the time.,
Find an activity you enjoy.,
Stay accountable.,
Start with reasonable goals.,
Track your measurements.,

Drink water!,
Stay motivated.,
Get creative.",How to Start Your Own Exercise Regimen and Stick to It," It might seem like you don't have enough time in your day for exercise, but you probably do - you just have to make it a priority. Here are some ways to do it.


Set an appointment. Pick out the times when you want to exercise, and schedule ahead. Keep your appointment with yourself ironclad, and don't let other engagements interfere. If you keep a calendar on your phone or computer, set alarms that will remind you of your workout time.
Replace a habit. Most of us have some unnecessary and not particularly enjoyable habit, such as watching TV, that could be replaced by (or added on to) exercising. Ask yourself how much time you spend on this habit, and whether or not you could exercise at the same time. If the answer is yes, make a new rule that stipulates (for instance) that you can only watch television if you're exercising at the same time.
Use it as social time. If you have a standing appointment with a friend or family member to spend time together, see if he or she is willing to incorporate exercise into that time. Instead of doing step aerobics together, though, consider doing a more social activity, like playing a game such as tennis or dancing.
Routine is the key. After about 2 weeks of the routine, you will find it a lot less of a chore.

, If you like exercising, you're more likely to stick with it. Not all workouts are at a gym: try biking, inline skating, rowing, skateboarding, swimming, hockey, or a rugby team; you could even dance in your bedroom with an iPod. Enjoyment is the key to sticking with it.


If you get bored while you exercise, try participating in a more social activity such as a team or intramural sport.

, Keep track of when you exercise and for how long. Make notes in your calendar, or keep an exercise journal. Writing down what you actually do will keep you accountable and show you how hard you're actually working. Additionally, looking back and seeing how much you've done can create an inspiring sense of accomplishment.

, Don't set out to start a rigorous regimen right from the beginning. Instead, start exercising at a reasonable pace and increase as soon as you stop feeling challenged. Try 30 minutes, three times a week and see how you feel.


Avoid burnout. Working yourself too hard at first can lead to muscle strain and fatigue, and associating exercise with pain can make you more reluctant to work out next time.

, Instead of keeping track of your exercise success by how much weight you lose, try keeping a soft tape measure handy and measuring your waist and hip size. You might build muscle and gain weight, but you'll lose inches.


Write down your measurements. As you start to trim up, seeing your progress can increase your confidence.
Measure your neck, arms and ankles as well.

, If you are shooting to lose weight, you must learn to eat healthily. Don't ""fall into"" a diet. You would ""fall out"" eventually. Things like weight watchers can help you learn, but I simply recommend developing a lifestyle you will want to keep, and using your common sense. See tips for more help.

, Drinking water is absolutely the best thing you can do for your body. Always bring water to your workout sessions. Remember not to drink excessive amounts of plain water after strenuous workouts - your body loses salts through sweat, and too much plain water can help to flush out whatever is left. Sports drinks can be helpful for intense workouts, but consider the sugar content if your goal is to lose weight.


Drink enough water to replace what is lost. Amount will vary based on your body weight, climate, effort level, etc. Dehydration would slow your weight-loss goals, increase danger of muscle tears, and could make you feel nauseated. Avoid coffee and soda drinks, for better results.

, As you keep working out and building up your strength, your workouts will probably become easier. Don't allow yourself to get complacent, though - as soon as your current regimen feels easy, change it up and try something different.

, You don't have to work out in a gym to get fit. Try creating your own exercise games based on your favorite television show.

Make a list of things that happen often in episodes of your favorite show(s), and pair each item on the list with an exercise.
Pause the show whenever something on your list happens, and do the corresponding exercise. You can start watching again when you finish your set. Check out examples below.;

If your routine keeps you from getting a good night's sleep, you're in good company: today, lack of proper sleep is recognized as a problem affecting many millions of people in the developed world.When it comes to curing fatigue, there's no substitute for consistently getting a good night's sleep, so if you don't know the cause of your fatigue, start here.


Though everyone's sleep needs are different, most reputable sources agree that the majority of adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep each night.Children usually need several more hours of sleep than adults.;
, The health benefits of a regular exercise routine are many: not only can exercise make you better-looking, better-feeling, and healthier, but also improve your overall energy levels and make it easier to sleep at night. Research has shown that even minor increases in the amount of exercise a person participates in can have a major effect on the level of fatigue she feels.The benefits of exercise are especially great for people with no established exercise routine, so if you're not physically active, try working out regularly to fight your feelings of fatigue.


As with sleep, the amount of exercise that different people need can vary based on their age, sex, size, and fitness level.Most reputable sources will recommend about two to two and a half hours of moderate aerobic exercise in addition to strength-training exercise on two days of the week for adults.However, if you're starting from a base level of no exercise, it may be necessary to gradually work up to this goal.

, The way a person eats can have a serious effect on the amount of energy he has throughout the day. In general, eating a moderate diet rich in healthy carbohydrates and lean proteins will give a person lasting energy throughout the day. On the other hand, eating improperly (for instance, by indulging in rich, fatty foods, overloading on a single giant meal each day, or neglecting important nutrients) can leave you feeling bloated or sapped of energy. Remember, you are what you eat, so eat a healthy, balanced diet to feel healthy, balanced, and free from fatigue.


For more information on starting a healthy high-energy diet, see the corresponding section below.

, In general, people who have healthy weights for their frame and body size have more energy throughout the day than people who do not. In developed countries, obesity is a widespread health disorder that can seriously decrease an otherwise healthy person's level of energy throughout the day.However, the fatiguing effects of being underweight can be equally serious.Though everyone's ""ideal' weight will be different, most adults should aim for a body mass index (BMI) of roughly 18.5-25.Try using an online BMI calculator to find your BMI score.


Note that BMI scores aren't a perfect way to judge whether you have a healthy weight. For instance, if you're an athlete with a lot of muscle or were born with dwarfism, your BMI may be outside of the recommended range but you may not be at risk for any health problems.
If you're overweight, aim to lose weight at a healthy pace by gradually reducing the number of calories you eat each day and increasing your level of exercise. Don't attempt rapid weight loss with a crash diet. Depending on your size, eating less than 1,200 calories a day can be very stressful, energetically inefficient, and even unsafe. On top of this, it will leave you with almost no energy throughout your day, making your fatigue even worse!For more information, see How to Lose Weight.

, A looming deadline at work, an argument at home, a check that unexpectedly bounces — these sources of short-term stress can lead to a variety of long-term problems, including fatigue, if they're allowed to build up. Serious stress can be quite taxing for the body, leading to physical and emotional exhaustion that can deplete your daily energy and leave you feeling completely overwhelmed.In addition, stress is a frequent contributor to many other problems, including headache, anxiety, eating disorders, and more.Unfortunately, stress is something that almost everyone has to deal with. On the other hand, because stress is such a common complaint, there are a wide variety of resources available for those attempting to deal with stress. For instance, many online guides (of varying quality) for managing stress can be found with a simple search engine query like ""dealing with stress."" For the best stress-fighting advice, however, talk to your doctor.
Common stress-reduction techniques include meditation, breathing exercises, designated ""down-time"", physical exercise, and controlled ""venting"".

, Attention or awareness is energy and when you give attention to something, you are giving it energy. So if you focus your attention of tired cells with in your body you give them energy.

Try this especially when you are tired or fatigued. Focus your attention in body where you feel fatigue. It could be face, legs, shoulders, eyes etc. Hold your attention there and you should witness that cells in your body regain energy and vibrate with joy. Subsequently feel the whole body as one, from the inside. You don't have to believe it. Just try it out.

, For these days when you just can't seem to get going, common stimulants like coffee, tea, energy drinks, and sudafed can give you the quick ""jolt"" of energy you need in the short term. However, these quick fixes are bad ideas for increasing your energy in the long term, as they can eventually lead to low-energy periods (or ""crashes"") when their stimulating effect wears off. Worse, if you develop a habit to these substances, their effectiveness will decrease. In extreme cases, you may eventually need to take them just to achieve a ""normal"" level of energy. For these reasons, you'll want to avoid relying to heavily on these energy boosters. Instead, try to adopt the healthy lifestyle changes described above.


Never turn to illegal drugs to give you the energy you need to get through your day. Besides the widely-publicized health risks of many of the most popular illegal stimulants (like cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), a stimulant addiction can be a serious drain on your wallet. For instance, country singer Waylon Jennings purportedly spent over $1,000 per day on cocaine during the height of his addiction."

Put on your gym clothes.,
Create a new habit loop with rewards.,
Do a financial reality check.,
Try your clothes on.,
Buy some nice gym gear to bribe yourself with.,
Be realistic about how often you can make it to the gym.,
Take a leaf from those who train for the Olympics.,
Buddy up.,
Switch up your workout.,
Stop blaming the gym and its ""sales tactics"".,
Have recourse to visualization.,
Listen to music.,
Work on the rest of your overall health beyond the gym.",How to Motivate Yourself to Go to the Gym," The prospect of going to the gym and pushing yourself can be intimidating, so break it down into smaller steps. Make a commitment to put on your gym clothes and get to the gym, and if you don't feel like exercising, don't. Tell yourself that you can just go home as soon as you get there. But odds are, once you're there, it won't be too hard to convince yourself to do 15 minutes of exercise. Just 15 minutes. Once you're done with those 15 minutes, commit yourself to doing just another 10. Keep pushing yourself incrementally.

, People who choose simple cues and set up rewards are more likely to exercise regularly.A good cue for going to the gym could be putting your keys under your gym clothes, so that you can't leave your house without handling them (and hopefully bringing them with you). A good reward would be to treat yourself to a latte or something similar, after you go to the gym. Eventually your brain will anticipate the reward and crave the process (going to the gym) that leads up to it. That being said, the reward shouldn't be so unhealthy that it cancels out your gym-going efforts!

, Consider the cost to you of not going to the gym. Each month not attended means that money is wasted without anything in return. And any equipment, private training sessions or clothing that you've already purchased is more cost without benefits gained by you. Tally up the total amount for a little shock effect––some of the costs you might have incurred already:


Shoes, equipment and clothing. If you didn't own the right workout apparel or shoes, you most likely purchased gear in order to make your visit to the gym more effective. Cross trainers or running shoes can run up to $200 a pair. Also, purchasing expensive boxing gloves or joint braces can add up quickly.
Personal training sessions. In some cases when you sign up for a gym membership, you may have fallen for adding in a few sessions with a personal trainer, especially if you were feeling motivated at the time. Have you made use of it? No? What are you waiting for then?!
Childcare or babysitting services. While some gyms offer free childcare, you may have already either paid for childcare services at your gym or shelled out dough for daycare. If so, this is a terrible opportunity to let go to waste, those hours free from the kids!

, If the money you've already spent doesn't motivate you, perhaps trying to squeeze into your pair of jeans and still not managing it will. Get out all of those gorgeous clothes you wish you could fit into, plus the ones you're wearing but stretching unforgivably, and use this as a motivator to get yourself back into the gym. Take some photos of you trying to wear the tight clothes and stick them where you'll see them as visual reminders of what needs to happen.


Identify what size you really want to be. If you used to wear a much smaller size in high school but have swelled up since, don’t throw in the towel and just concede to your new size. The gym workout can help restore a figure you'd be proud of and can also bring back youthful energy. Of course, be realistic about the size you want to be––choose a size that is healthy and suitable for your gender, age and body type.

, If you haven't already done so, head out to a store that stocks workout clothing in funky styles. Purchase a few key pieces in bright colors or cool styles that you'll feel good wearing. Since the gym is the only place you can wear these goodies, you have a new reason to go.

, If you started out with the idea of turning up at 5am every weekday but found out that this was really difficult to maintain while juggling kids, work schedules and your night owl ways, then it's time to refresh the expectations rather than completely give it all up. Another thing to consider is where your gym is––people are more likely to exercise when the gym is located near their home or place of work. If this isn't the case for you, investigate having your membership transferred to a closer gym if it's part of a franchise.


Look at your life's schedule. Where does gym have a place in it? Do you really need to be there for all those TV shows? Couldn't someone else pick up Freddie on Fridays? Or perhaps your java programming and drinking club is now not doing for you what it once did and you could spend that hour at the gym instead? There is always a little time somewhere to spare; mark down the times you will attend the gym in your calendar or smartphone or digital diary or scheduler and don't ignore these set times without a very good reason involving an emergency or sickness. Keeping to set hours develops a habit that you won't let go of.
Make use of weird hours. If your gym is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, use those odd hours when traffic is at a standstill and you can get there in half normal time to fit in your workout. Added bonuses include ease of finding a parking space, peace and quiet and less distractions.
Don't sweat the misses. Everyone misses things now and then but if you've started using missing gym visits as a reason to never go back again, that's just a cop out. Accept that you missed a few sessions, then get right back on that gym horse.
If you've been sick, let yourself off. Nobody should be exercising when they're unwell, let alone spreading germs around.

, Most sportspeople maintain clear, realizable objectives that are reached in the short term rather than setting endless long term goals without interim stages. Aim to set yourself a minimum goal and then raise the bar when you've successfully met that goal for a period of time. Decrease your gym time so as to increase it. Perhaps five days a week was too ambitious––how about cutting it back to once a week and seeing how you manage that for now? At least you'll be turning up and once the weekly turn-up is well established, you can think about edging it up some.
, Ask your friend to come along and help keep you motivated. Going to the gym with a friend is often a fun outing and it's twice the motivation to get there and to keep going. Perhaps schedule in a post-workout coffee and chat to increase the enjoyment of the visit.


Can't find an interested friend? Consider teaming up with someone from work. If you have a similar work schedule, you could resolve to head to the gym immediately following work or during your lunch hour, if convenient. Or, make a friend at the gym and agree to turn up at the same time together.
Ask your spouse, partner or lover along. You could even create some friendly competition by seeing who can drop the weight or build muscle faster.
Invite the entire family. Make a pact to meet at the gym every evening (or five nights a week) for an hour workout. Take this notion one step further by creating a tracking chart that you can hang in the kitchen that tracks exercise or weight loss for further motivation. Don't get excited about family membership just yet though––see how things progress before forking out yet more money.

, Perhaps you're going to the gym regularly but it has become ho-hum, a dull routine. By trying something new at the gym and getting off the usual equipment, you might be able to resurrect your motivation to keep going. A body that is used to a set level of exercise or routine needs new challenges and so does your mind. Keep your body guessing and you’ll continue to improve your level of fitness and end up having more fun.


Try a class. You’ve paid for more than equipment, so browse the different classes and give one a whirl. Most likely your gym offers a bevy of fun classes including cross training cardio and weights, kickboxing, Zumba and more.
Mix cardio and weights. If you’re a treadmill rat and simply like to get on, push a button and check out for 45 minutes, consider mixing up your routine by only jogging for 15 minutes and then checking out the free weights.
Sign up for extra boot camp sessions. Some trainers host breakout boot camp sessions that not only give you that extra fitness edge, attending one of these courses allows you to try something new and fun (like running through an obstacle course or punching a bag).

, Sometimes it's easy to let resentment stop you from meeting a commitment to yourself––it's silly but it does happen at times. It doesn't matter if you think it's the fault of the gym for overselling the virtues––maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but deep down somewhere you wanted to get fit and this seemed like a good way to do it. By placing the blame back on the gym, you're ignoring the responsibility to take care of your own body. The gym's a business and really doesn't care whether or not you turn up; on other hand, your business is you, and you should care about turning up when it is about self-improvement.

, Use mental imagery to motivate yourself. In your mind's eye, see yourself at the gym working out and enjoying it. See yourself achieving certain challenges that you'd like to overcome at the gym. Finally, close your eyes and see the figure you'd like to sculpt with all of your gym efforts, complete with yourself in an outfit you're longing to wear.

, Make gym visits an occasion for wearing your MP3 player or iPod and listening to your favorite tunes, including new ones you'd like to hear more of. Music is a fantastic motivator and it's even more enjoyable when you can move to the beat at the same time. Many athletes train to their favorite music as it has a positive effect on the limbic system of the brain, causing your emotions to respond favorably to the exercise. And if you're not too keen on music, try the sounds of nature or simple instrumentals.

, It's demotivating to bust your gut at the gym without seeing results. And it may be that your diet is letting you down or you're failing to get enough sleep every night. Good health and fitness are the result of paying attention to all needs physical and mental, so it's important that you're not neglecting other aspects


Eat healthily. If the gym provides nutritional services, make use of them. Cut down on the junk food and any excesses that you know are depriving you of healthy nutrients.
Sleep adequately. No amount of gym work will make up for sleep deprivation and the ravages it wreaks on your body over time.
Minimize alcohol intake and cut out the cigarettes. Neither recreational drug adds to your overall health.

First ask yourself: ""Why do I want to add more activity to my life?"",
Get to some basic principles about activity.,
Take these basic principles and develop a personal strategy plan.,
For each idea listed, write a smart objective.,
Now group your objectives by setting (eg inside or outside activities, winter or summer activities, work setting or home setting) and schedule them on your calendar by both date and time. 

,
Keep a journal to track your progress.,
Share your success with a friend.",How to Add More Activity to Your Life,"  Activity burns calories, but that might not be your primary purpose. To get motivated and get moving, consider why you want to add more activity to your life.  Maybe you want greater flexibility or good balance or sharper eye-hand coordination. Activity makes your digestive system more regular.  Perhaps adding extra activity will help you tone and strengthen your muscles, giving you a greater sense of personal power and effectiveness.  Increased activity helps blood flow to the brain. You just might be a little sharper in your mind, after a quick run down the hall or a short stroll around the block. Adding activity to your life may also decrease stress.  Physical activity helps quiet an overactive mind.  It also helps the mind make creative connections.  So adding activity to your life may help you solve problems or design better mouse traps.  And you might also gain a social life.  When you're ""on the move"" other people are attracted to you.  They'll want to join you in a walk, a dance, a team sport, or a gardening project. ;
, 


If you can reach a desired object without moving, you won't be active. So move what you want AWAY from you, make it harder to get, so you have to put some effort in.  That means getting rid of the TV remote control, parking at the edge of the parking lot, and picking a bank that is faster to walk to than drive to.
Moving should feel good.  If it hurts, you won't do it.  If you even think you might feel uncomfortable in some way, you are likely to not do the activity.  For example, many people abandon exercise because they dislike sweating or fear the social embarrassment of body odour.
Some activities are more fun to do or provide some special interest.  Consider what your passions are and plan activities around them.  Walking on a treadmill is easier if you can watch the news or your favourite cooking show.  Bird watching may help you hike up to an eagle's nest or have you paddling estuaries in a kayak, looking for shorebirds.
Lower the ""threat factor"". This might be a fear of the cost of activity, in time or money or energy.  Some people skip the gym workout because they think they must wear fancy clothing or pay for a pricey membership. Others skip the dog walk because they have over-committed to work projects.  If you are out of shape, your first few days and weeks may totally exhaust you.  But the real rewards come just a bit later, when you find that your extra activity has trimmed your waistline, lightened your step, and actually  boosted your energy.
An active person is more likely to keep active, so don't just think about it or talk about it.  The hardest step is your first one.
Pairing activity with something pleasant, or someone pleasant, makes it more likely to occur.  Put something wonderful at the end of each burst of activity. Consider getting a pet.  Dogs, cats, and rabbits are house pets that will want you to be active with them.
Become mindful of your body's natural rhythms and cycles.  The time of day you will prefer to exercise depends to some extent on other biological needs like sleep, eating, and sex drive.
Notice when you are already active and make note of the details (day of week, time of day, location, setting, and what happened just before or just after your activity).  Try to add even more to those activity events when possible.  Also make notes about when you ""veg out"" as a couch potato.
Notice if your activity level changes when you are around certain people.  For example, parents may enjoy riding bicycles with their kids, or you may give up dance classes to watch TV with your new couch potato spouse.
Where you work and when you work has an effect on your activity level.  Night shift workers have more digestive upsets and often put on extra pounds.  Desk jobs are notorious for caging employees in physical inactivity.  Employers who foster stretch breaks and allow employees to travel stairwells to run errands may find they have a fitter work force.
Look for activity  opportunities embedded in your daily life.  Put cast iron cookware on the lower cabinet shelves.  Pull those weeds instead of using poison.  Hand wash the car.  Add an extra step to activities you already naturally do.  Kneed your bread dough and hand mix your meat patties. 

,  Review step 2 and then write down two or three ideas for each principle that fit with your current lifestyle. You are not making yourself over into somebody else or trying out for the Olympics.  Small changes are more easy to achieve and sustain.  Small changes allow you to have ""error-free learning"", avoid the punishing aspects of trying too much too soon, and give you a quick sense of success and measurable accomplishment.

,  These objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-determined.  For example, ""I will skip my kitchen convenience gadgets and drive-through food trips.   This means juicing my oranges by hand, using a manual can opener, using a spoon for mixing, grinding my spices, and chopping my vegetables.  I will set a table and wash my dishes by hand.  At least 5 of 7 days I will make a meal from scratch. and I will continue this habit for at least 3 weeks, to reinforce the pattern"". 

,,  Assign time and cost estimates to each objective and then record the actual outcome.  Review your estimates and measure your success.  The more visible it is, the better.  Don't be afraid to put yourself on a star chart or give yourself ribbons or tokens of achievement.  Celebrate your added activity!

,  If you're brave, go public and report your achievements on Facebook or Twitter. The encouragement of others will help you keep on moving into that more active life.

Eat a healthy mix of carbohydrates.,
Eat lean protein for long-term satisfaction.,
Don't forget breakfast!,
Space your meals throughout the day.,
Don't over-load on food.,
Hydrate!,
Try a dietary supplement.",How to Overcome Fatigue2," In recent years, carbs have gotten a bad rap — in fact, they're one of the cornerstones of a healthy diet that gives you energy throughout the day. Being choosy about which types of carbs you eat and choosing reasonable, moderate portion sizes is important for getting the biggest nutritional (and energetic) benefit from your carbs possible. In general, you'll want to eat mostly complex carbohydrates, like those found in whole grains, as the body breaks these down slowly, providing long-lasting energy. However, eating some simple carbs, like those in fruit and honey, can give you instant post-meal energy.


Healthy complex carbohydrates include whole grain products (whole grain bread, cereal, etc.), oatmeal, quinoa, buckwheat, brown or wild rice,
Healthy simple carbohydrates include most fruits, honey, non whole-grain products (white bread, etc.) and white rice.

, Often, the distracting feeling of being unsatisfied or ""not full"" a few hours after a meal can go hand-in-hand with feeling fatigued. To help stay full throughout the day, try adding protein to your diet. Compared to other types of food, good protein sources leave you feeling fuller for longer, which, in addition to fighting fatigue, can also help with maintaining a healthy weight. However, since some sources of protein can be rich in unhealthy fats and calories, it's important to distinguish between lean, healthy proteins, which you should eat frequently, and unhealthier varieties, which are best enjoyed infrequently.


Lean sources of protein include chicken breasts, egg whites, most varieties of fish, beans, soy products, and some leaner cuts of beef and pork., We've all heard the old cliché before — breakfast is the most important meal of the day. In fact, when it comes to fighting fatigue, there's lots of truth to this advice. In addition to contributing to healthy growth and making it easier to maintain a normal weight level, breakfast is vital for giving us the energy we need to succeed throughout the day.People who skip breakfast have less energy in the morning (and, if they normally eat complex carbohydrates for their first meal, throughout the day). In addition, people who skip breakfast are more likely to overeat later in the day, which can lead to a bloated, lethargic feeling.Ideally, breakfast should include some simple carbohydrates for instant energy, some complex carbohydrates for day-long fuel, and a little protein for satisfying fullness. Here's a great sample breakfast idea to get you started:One cup Skim milk (10 g protein)
Two ounces Canadian bacon (12 g protein)
Whole-wheat bagel w/ light spread (52 g complex carbs)
Banana (27 g simple carbs)





, When it comes to reducing your fatigue through diet, it's not all about what you eat. It's also about when you eat. Some studies have shown that splitting your daily food intake over five (or more) smaller meals per day makes it easier to maintain feelings of fullness and high levels of energy throughout the day (though some of the other supposed benefits of this style of diet have recently become the subject of debate).Conversely, eating just a few large meals per day can leave people feeling fatigued when it's been a long time since their last meal.


Note, however, that if you plan to split your daily food intake into a greater number of meals, it's important not to increase your overall calorie intake (unless you're trying to gain weight). Your weight is ultimately determined by the absolute number of calories you eat per day, not the number of meals you eat.

, While healthy, nutritious food can be the fuel that gives you the energy that you need to get through the day, too much food can be a bad thing. Over-eating (even if your food is very nutritious) can lead to feelings of uncomfortable fullness, bloating, and fatigue. In addition, consistently over-eating can cause weight gain, which can lead to long-term feeling of fatigue and sluggishness. No matter what's in your diet, it's important to keep your daily intake under control to maintain optimal health and energy.


You'll especially want to avoid frequently indulging in foods that are rich in fat and/or sugar. These foods can be satisfying to eat, but they're usually sources of ""empty calories"" — in other words, they're calorie-rich but have no other nutritious benefit. Additionally, consuming these types of foods too heavily can lead to serious health problems, like diabetes and heart disease.

, Dehydration has long been cited as a cause of a variety of health problems, including fatigue.Though the seriousness of mild dehydration and the exact amount of water a person needs throughout the day are the subjects of continuing debate, moderate to serious dehydration is known for sure to sap a person's energy and cause fatigue. If you've been active throughout the day or have been exercising and are beginning to feel fatigued, try drinking a glass of water for a refreshing boost.


Pure water is best for curing dehydration (though certain sports drinks containing electrolytes can also be great for prolonged, intense exercise). Don't consume drinks containing alcohol or caffeine — these chemicals can contribute to dehydration (though not as much as is sometimes reported),decreasing the drink's benefit.

, Today, a huge assortment of dietary supplements are available both online and through traditional retailers that allege to help fight fatigue. Though some supporters of these supplements testify to these supplements' benefits, most have not been proven to be effective in a clinical setting. In addition, these sorts of supplements aren't subject to the same sorts of oversight and regulation that ordinary foods and drugs are, which means that, for many dietary supplements, there is little in terms of quality control. If you'd like to take a dietary supplement for your fatigue, talk to your doctor first — he may be able to recommend an alternative or help you judge the possible risks and rewards of your chosen supplement. Just a few supplements that can (allegedly) lower fatigue are:Black currant
Fish oil
Magnesium
Melatonin
Rhodiola
Evening primrose oil
Folic acid

Know the signs of sleep apnea.,
Know the signs of diabetes.,
Know the signs of anemia.,
Know the signs of depression.,
Know the types of medications that can cause fatigue.,
Consult a doctor immediately for more serious causes of fatigue.",How to Overcome Fatigue3," Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder which can usually be cured but can cause serious health problems if left untreated. In a person suffering from sleep apnea, the throat doesn't maintain its proper shape during sleep, leading to periods of sleep where breathing becomes difficult or even stops entirely. This keeps the body from getting as much oxygen as it needs, leading to interrupted sleep, stress, and extreme drowsiness during the day. If you think you have sleep apnea, talk to your doctor right away to start a treatment plan.


Some of the most common symptoms of sleep apnea are very loud snoring, difficulty breathing during sleep, morning headaches, insomnia, dry throat, and drowsiness during the day.One of the most common causes of sleep apnea is being overweight or obese, though even thin people can suffer from the disorder.If you are overweight and suffer from sleep apnea, your doctor will probably recommend beginning a weight-loss regimen.

, Diabetes, a disease which in recent years has become a serious health problem for millions of people in the developed world, can cause fatigue (especially after meals).In fact, some people first discover they are diabetic when they go to the doctor for unexplained fatigue. Diabetes effects a person's ability to regulate her blood sugar levels — fatigue results when a person's blood sugar levels become too low or too high. If you exhibit any of the symptoms of diabetes below, contact your doctor right away — left untreated, diabetes can develop into a very serious condition.


Some of the most common symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination, frequent thirst, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, tingling in the hands or feet, and sweet-tasting urine., Anemia is a disorder of the red blood cells which can cause fatigue and other serious symptoms. In cases of anemia, the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to transport oxygen throughout the body effectively (or the red blood cells is does have don't function properly), keeping the body from getting the energy it needs. If you exhibit some or all of the symptoms below, talk to your doctor immediately. Though anemia can usually be treated, drastic treatments may be needed if it is not dealt with in a timely fashion.


Some of the most common symptoms of anemia are fatigue, dizziness, headaches, coldness in the hands and feet, pale skin, and chest pain. In addition, anemia is often accompanied by iron deficiency, which can cause swelling of the tongue, brittle nails, sores in the mouth, and frequent infections.

, Not all of the serious medical causes of fatigue are physical disorders. In fact, some mental and emotional disorders, including depression, can cause fatigue. It is also thought that depression can be caused by fatigue, which can lead to a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle in people suffering from depression.If you suffer from constant fatigue and have frequent negative thoughts or any of the other symptoms listed below, visit your doctor and be sure to mention your depression symptoms. Depression is a serious medical condition (not a personal weakness) and it can be treated.


The symptoms of depression include irritability, feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, eating disorders, fatigue, loss of interest in pleasurable activities, persistent sadness, and non-specific pains.
If you're exhibiting symptoms of depression and are having serious thoughts of self-harm or suicide, don't wait for your doctor's appointment — call a crisis hotline (like 1-800-273-TALK (8255)) immediately. These lines are open 24/7 and offer counseling, guidance, and reassurance in times of intense personal pain., Every medication, from the most benign cold pills to the most serious chemotherapy drugs, can have unintended side effects. Fatigue is a common side effect of many medications — so many, in fact, that it's impossible to list them all here individually. If you've recently been prescribed a new medicine and you've begun experiencing fatigue, talk to your doctor. She may be able to adjust your dosage or find you a new medication with less severe side effects.


Some common medicines which can cause fatigue are anti-anxiety medications, high blood pressure medications, painkillers, antidepressants, and cholesterol medications containing the substance statin., The vast majority of fatigue cases have causes that can be solved with simple lifestyle changes or basic medical treatments. However, in rare cases, fatigue can be a symptom of serious or life-threatening conditions which can require immediate medical attention. In cases where your fatigue has no apparent cause and is accompanied by other symptoms (especially fever or unexplained weight loss), you should contact your doctor immediately. If severe fatigue occurs suddenly and is accompanied by other serious symptoms (like confusion, blurred vision, or swelling and an inability to urinate), as this may be a time-sensitive condition like stroke or heart failure.Some (rare) disorders which can have fatigue as a symptom are:Heart failure
AIDS
Tuberculosis
Cancer
Lupus
Kidney/Liver disease

It'll be the simplest solution to getting what you want. Humans are pretty good at doing what they want -- so lining these two things up (the motivation and the action) will become easy as pie.;
, You're probably telling yourself something like ""I should exercise right now. If I don't work out, I'm never going to get fit."" This statement has many hidden obstacles. For one thing, feeling like you should do something makes it seem like work, or an obligation. That's no fun! You're also thinking about what will happen if you don't exercise -- in other words, you're threatening yourself with punishment (the image of being unfit). Subconsciously, you're flooding your mind with negativity. Instead of thinking about how you'll look if you don't work out, think about how great you'd look if you did!


It's very important to think in the positive. Instead of, ""God, I feel terrible for not working out,"" think ""I'd feel better if I worked out -- so tomorrow I will."" If you think in ""nots"" and ""nevers"" and ""didn'ts,"" you're just bogging yourself down, making it even harder to get motivated!

, This can be at any point -- it doesn't have to be your end goal! If you want to work out twice a week, have a goal of two times a week -- simple. Then you can reward yourself after! If you want to run 10 miles (16 km) a week, have that be your goal. Smaller goals (rather than losing 50 pounds, say) bring the light at the end of the tunnel a bit nearer, making it more achievable.


Sign up for a charity walk or run that will encourage you to train. Once you have a set date to work towards, you'll have a goal in mind while you're working out. The feeling of accomplishment after you're done will encourage you to sign up for another or to just continue being fit.

, What's the point in having goals if nothing is going to come from it? You gotta reward yourself! And again -- the rewards don't have to be dangled in front of you until the very end (that's just cruel); give yourself teeny rewards from time to time for sticking with it.


Make a reward for every session, every week, every pound, or every task you do/exercise/lose/complete -- whichever speaks to you. This is all about training your brain. When you see the good stuff behind all the work, it'll give you the strength to keep going and to stick with it.
The other side of the coin is to make the alternatives worse. Tell yourself if you don't work out, you have to organize the attic, or call that cousin you haven't spoken to since that awkward family reunion. Now that's one threatening motivation.

, You're not lazy -- this stuff is just hard. A person that runs 5 miles (8.0 km) a day doesn't get that the energy they exert is a lot less than the energy someone uses that hasn't worked out in years. So don't label yourself -- you're just starting out, that's all.


When you stumble and fall, you have to understand that that's normal. It happens to everyone. It's unimportant that you have a setback -- it's only important that you get back up. These tiny failures will happen (you'll miss a day, you'll get sick, whatever), so when they do, relax. You'll get back at it. Keep your chin up.

, Hypnosis is a state of intense concentration, when your mind is extremely receptive. The ""Best Me Technique"" is a form of hyperempiria, or suggestion-enhanced experience, which encourages you to pre-experience the accomplishment of a goal. See the video below for more insights as to how self-hypnosis can help you get motivated to exercise.


This will only really be effective if you believe it'll be effective. If you're a skeptic, don't waste your time. Stick to more concrete endeavors.
