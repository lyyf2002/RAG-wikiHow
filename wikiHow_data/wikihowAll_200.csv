",How to Get Rid of Cattails2,"


Look for an herbicide approved for aquatic use that includes one of the following active ingredients: glyphosate, imazamox, imazapyra or diquat. These chemicals are effective on cattails.

, These measurements are needed for you to determine how much herbicide you should use to kill your cattails.


Get the measurements for your pond. If a contractor put in the pond, you should be able to get the measurements from the contractor's office. Your local survey control service office may also have measurements available or aerial photos you can use to determine your pond's measurements. If not, get a survey of the pond or measure it yourself. Methods you can employ yourself without special equipment include chaining and pacing. Chaining involves putting a stake at either end of a measuring tape or length of wood, chain, or rope of known length. Place the stakes in the ground, remove them, and stick them back in the ground, this time, with the first stake in the same place where the second stake left a depression. Continue moving the measuring tape and stakes around the perimeter of the pond. Count the number of times you need to move the stake, and multiply this number by the length of the measuring tape to get the perimeter's measurement. Pacing functions in the same way, but the known length is your normal stride.
Calculate area. Determine the shape of your pond, whether it's roughly square, circular or triangular, and use the appropriate formula to solve for area.
Calculate volume. The volume of a pond is the area multiplied by the average depth of the pond. Take depth measurements by slowly dropping a weighted line into the water at various locations in the pond. Use the depth measurements you've obtained to calculate an average depth for the pond. The more measurements you take, the more accurate your average depth will be.

, It is best to use herbicides in the spring when growth first starts. The cattail plants are smaller at this time, which makes application easier.


Read the directions on the herbicide container. Different formulas will have different water use restrictions. You need to familiarize yourself with these restrictions so you know when you can use the pond again for recreation or livestock use. The directions will also indicate how much herbicide to use based on the area and volume of your pond.
Divide the pond into sections if you have a large amount of cattails to remove. Once the herbicide takes effect, the decomposition of the dead cattails can deplete the dissolved oxygen levels in the pond, killing fish. Killing fewer cattails at once will reduce the amount of decomposing vegetation in the pond.
Use a pond or yard sprayer to distribute the chemical onto the cattails. Be careful to limit overspray as much as possible.
Wait 10 to 14 days before spraying the next section if you chose to spray your pond in sections. This will help keep the dissolved oxygen levels in the pond more stable.

,


Wait 10 to 12 days before cutting the cattails to allow the chemical enough time to work. You want to provide adequate time for the herbicide to fully kill the root system.
Use a weed whacker or sharp blade to cut down the cattails.

Create a safe, effective solution using baking soda, cooking oil, and shampoo.,
Spray the plant thoroughly with the solution if there are no symptoms of phytotoxicity.,
Treat the plants once a week until the weather conditions no longer support the growth of downy mildew.",How to Get Rid of Downy Mildew in Your Plants1," As the main active ingredient, baking soda is a good alternative to chemicals when trying to get rid of downy mildew.


Mix together 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo, 2 tablespoons of any type of cooking oil and 2 tablespoons of baking soda in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a container.
Put a cap on the container and shake it until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Pour a small amount of the solution into a spray bottle.
Spray a few hidden leaves on plants infected with downy mildew.
Wait 24 to 36 hours and then check the leaves for brown or yellow spots, brown tips or pale scorched leaves. These are all symptoms of phytotoxicity, which can occur in some plants when they are treated with this remedy.;
, Shake the rest of the solution up, pour it into the spray bottle and spray the plants until the solution drips from the leaves.


Be sure to coat the tops and bottoms of the leaves.
This baking power solution will also kill pests like aphids, lacebugs, mealybugs, scale, spider mites, thrips and whiteflies.

, Downy mildew flourishes when temperatures are between 58 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit and the relative humidity is 85% or higher.So once the humidity and temperatures outside drop, you can stop applying this remedy to your plants.

Call your local County Extension Office to find out which chemicals are permitted for use in your area.,
Use copper fungicides.,
Use neem oil.,
Use these chemicals cautiously and only when absolutely necessary.",How to Get Rid of Downy Mildew in Your Plants2," Though there are several possible chemicals that can be used to get rid of and prevent downy mildew, they are tightly regulated and some of them are restricted or not permitted for use in the United States., Copper fungicide is one of the more traditionally used chemicals to remove downy mildew.


However, these fungicides are controversial and are regulated for use. Though copper is an essential plant nutrient in small amounts, fungicidal levels of copper are toxic to beneficial organisms like earthworms and social microbes like blue-green algae. Excessive use of this chemical can cause a toxic level of build up in the soil.

, This botanical pesticide is derived from the Azadirachta indica tree species and is labeled for use on downy mildew.


Though it is organic, neem oil kills beneficial insects like lady beetles and bees.

, Due to the toxicity of these chemicals, only use them on downy mildew as a last resort. Apply them just before the plant blooms, one week later, and then again 10 days to two weeks later.


Always wear protective eyeglasses and protective clothing when applying these chemicals as they can cause permanent eye damage as well as severe skin irritation.
These chemicals also kill beneficial organisms called Mycorrhiza, which are essential for healthy plant growth.Some of these chemicals can also be hazardous to people and wildlife."
"
Always prune off any infected leaves before spraying the plants with a remedy.,
Use a rake to remove any plant debris on the ground around the plants.,
Water your plants under their leaves.",How to Get Rid of Downy Mildew in Your Plants3," The damaged, infected leaves will never recover and removing them will make it easier for the baking soda solution or the chemicals to kill the mildew organisms.

, If this debris remains on the ground, it will become a hiding place for downy mildew and can re-infect the plants when the weather becomes humid and moist.Put all of the debris in the garbage to ensure the area around your plants is kept clean and free of any potential downy mildew.

, Doing this will prevent the growth of downy mildew as no water will be on the plant's leaves. Wet leaves or foliage makes it easier for downy mildew to thrive, especially when weather conditions are humid and moist.


Use a soaker hose or water the plants individually by hand with a watering can until temperatures warm.

Store trash securely where it cannot be accessed by crows.,
Cover and contain all compost.,
Protect your garden.,
Use bird feeders that exclude large birds.,
Install crow-proof nest boxes.,
Trim dead branches from trees.,
Install bird spikes on roof lines or fences.,
Use transparent bird gel on branches and other roosting areas.,
Reduce outdoor lighting.,
Address the arriving crows early in the winter.,
Disrupt the crows right before dusk.,
Use fake animals to deter crows.,
Shine a laser beam at the crows.,
Scare crows away with reflective objects around your property.Crows can be frightened by moving shiny objects.,
Use loud noises to frighten crows away.",How to Get Rid of Crows," Crows can easily rip into a plastic trash bag to start rummaging through your trash. Make sure your container is not overfilled as crows can get into the trash if a small part of the bag is showing. Look to get a container that has a locked lid. Once a crow finds a source of food, it will be back daily to forage, so it is important to always keep trash completely secure.Cover and lock all trashcans.
Secure the handles to stakes stuck in the ground to prevent bins from being knocked over.;
, Crows are omnivores and will eat any food scraps they happen upon. It is important to make sure all food scraps are securely contained. Composting is a great sustainable way to get rid of leftover food, however open compost is very inviting to a crow. To compost food without attracting crows, make sure you cover your compost or keep it contained in a bin. You can compost yard waste without attracting crows., Although crows can be beneficial to gardens because they eat insects and grubs, sometimes they will help themselves to your crops as well. Place a flexible bird net over your crops purchased from your local garden or hardware store. A four inch net will keep the crows out but still give smaller birds access to the insects in your garden. Before your fruit starts to ripen, drape the net on the crops or suspend it above the crops with a frame built around the garden. Make sure the net is secure to ensure it will keep the crows out. You can also put this netting over fruit trees and bushes., Invest in a bird feeder that automatically closes when birds of larger weights try to feed. You might also try using a feeder with a wire mesh that excludes crows but lets smaller birds in. Clean up any spillage each day to prevent crows from foraging around the feeder.

, Crows will sometimes eat the hatchlings of other, smaller birds. If a crow finds a nest box that it can get a hatchling out of, it will return every year to do the same.Make sure all of your nest boxes are over 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep from the hole to the bottom of the box.
Remove the perch or ledge under the hole of a nest box so that the crow doesn’t have a place to stand and wait for a hatchling to poke its head out.

, Crows gather in groups and will look for open spaces to roost. Removing dead branches prevents large numbers of crows from converging on the leafless branch.

, Bird spikes come in strips or bunches and can be easily installed as a permanent way to deter birds from landing. Bird spikes remove areas where crows can land by preventing them from being able to find footing.

, You can purchase bird gels from a local hardware store or online. Bird gel is a non-toxic sticky substance that does not disrupt the natural look of windows or trees like bird spikes. The sticky gel makes the surface uncomfortable to crows and will prevent the from establishing your yard as a nesting site., Crows tend to congregate in well lit areas at night. Reducing your outdoor lighting will help make your space less attractive to crows., Crows are migratory birds and typically choose roosting grounds in early winter. Disrupt their habits by addressing the birds as soon as they arrive so they don't take up residence with you all winter., Scaring crows away in the evening helps prevent them from spending the night in your yard. A crow will look for a safe place to spend the evening, and by scaring them right before it gets dark, they are likely to look elsewhere., String fake crows from a Halloween store upside down with their wings out. Crows will avoid the fake dead crows. You can try using fake horned owls or snakes, but these will only deter the crows for a short while. Crows will even learn the patterns of animatronic animals and recognize that they aren’t real eventually. , Laser lights can disturb crows from their roosts temporarily; however, the crows may return a short time later. It is thought that after continuous harassment, the crows will eventually avoid the area all together.

, You can find bird tape that is designed as a visual deterrent to crows. Hang shiny streamers on poles throughout your yard, or make a fence around your property by twisting the tape together and stringing it between poles along the perimeter. Move the location of your streamers periodically to keep the crows from overcoming them as a threat. Other reflective ideas to try:


Reflective tape
Old CDs hung vertically on a string.
Aluminum pie pans. Adding anything shiny to your yard will help to deter the crows.

, Crows do not like loud sounds such as explosions, loud banging, and alarms; these options, however effective, may be impractical for people in urban settings. Each time you see the crows, make the noise to train them to stay away. Playing a recorded audio of crow predators or crow distress calls can also help keep them away. You can find audio of crow sound deterrents available online at bird control companies. Try these noisemakers to keep the crows away:Firecrackers
Recordings of crow distress calls
Recordings of crow predators such as owls and hawks
Air horns

Leave your roses in water until you're ready to use them.,
Pluck the petals.,
Air dry roses.,
Use a dehydrator.,
Store your dried roses properly.",How to Harvest Roses," If you don't want to plant roses, find them outdoors. Roses tend to grow in low to middle elevations. Roses are usually found in clusters in open, sunny areas. Roses are easy to find as they tend to form dense thickets in the right areas. Explore wooded areas around you to locate roses to harvest., Make sure the plants you find are roses before harvesting, as some wild flowers are not safe to eat. Roses are red or pink and have five petals each. Red roses tend to have a pear-like shape. Roses usually have one flower per branch and tend to have thorns or prickly textures on the stem.If you are not sure if a plant is a rose, do not harvest or consume it.

, You can also plant roses to harvest. Purchase rose seeds online or at a local greenhouse. They should be planted in an area where the soil's pH level is between 6.5 and 7 and where they can have access to direct sunlight six to eight hours a day.You can buy a pH testing kit at a greenhouse to check your soil outdoors. If growing roses indoors, you should be able to buy soil at a greenhouse that is the proper pH for your roses.
If growing roses inside, place them near a window or on your balcony to make sure they get enough sunlight.

, Soak the area around the roots completely at least once a week if you're not getting any rain or are growing your roses indoors. Place two to four inches of shredded leaves or grass clippings near the base of your roses to help with drainage., Roses will take around a year to grow. During this year, help them mature so you can harvest them when they bloom. Provide granular fertilizer with a 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 ratio from April to July as roses begin to grow out of the earth. Sprinkle 3/4 of a cup to a cup of the fertilizer around the rose bed., Roses harvest best just after they bloom. Wait until the flowers have fully unfolded to harvest your roses., In most climates, roses bloom in late spring or early summer. Keep an eye on your roses around this time. Aim to harvest shortly after they bloom during these months., The ideal time to harvest roses is the morning on a sunny day. Opt for a relatively dry morning after dew has evaporated. This will result in strong smelling roses that are easier to harvest., The best roses are the ones that are in the later bud stage. Outer flowers should be opened. Select roses that have been most exposed to the sun. These roses will be the strongest., When harvesting, you cut a rose's stem twice. Use a quality hand pruner or garden scissors to make the first cut low on the stem. Make one quick cut, leaving a little more stem than you want. You'll be making a second cut later, so leave the stem an inch longer than you want., Bring a small container with water with you when you go to harvest roses. As soon as you cut your rose, immediately immerse the stem in water. This prevents wilting., After bringing your roses inside, make a second cut to the stem. Leaving the stem immersed in water, cut another inch off the bottom of the stem. This helps your rose soak up water., Roses should remain in water until you're ready to use them. You may simply want to leave roses in a vase on display or you may want to harvest their petals for use. Keep their stems immersed in water and, every two to three days, cut another inch off the stem., To dehydrate rose petals, you will first need to pluck them from the roses. Simply use your fingers to remove the petals from your roses. Set them aside when you're done in a safe place, like a small jar or Tupperware container, until you're ready to dehydrate them., Spread your roses onto a flat surface, like a baking sheet. Make sure the rose petals are not touching or overlapping. Set them out in the sun until all the moisture is gone. Times will vary depending on the heat of your region.Watch the weather forecast and choose a day that will be sunny and warm. Rain or other precipitation can ruin rose petals.
If it starts to rain, bring your rose petals inside.

, If you have a dehydrator, spread the roses out on the dehydrator tray. Make sure they're not touching or overlapping. Dehydrate the roses on lowest heat setting. Times vary depending on the dehydrator, so refer to your dehydrator's specific instructions., Rose petals should be stored in a glass jar. Store your jar in a dry place in your home. Make sure to minimize exposure to direct sunlight."

Try using Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (BTk).,
Make the area attractive to birds.,
Use burlap to catch caterpillars living in a tree.,
Drown the caterpillars.,
Collect the caterpillars and move them elsewhere.",How to Get Rid of Caterpillars1," BTk is a bacteria that naturally occurs on dead or decaying material in the soil. This bacteria is good for controlling caterpillars because it interacts badly with the digestive system of caterpillars. Furthermore, it is considered to be safe because it doesn’t harm pets or people, and the dead caterpillars will not harm other animals (such as birds) that might eat the caterpillar.It is important that you apply BTk to leaves of affected plants or trees at the right time because it must be eaten by the caterpillar. You should follow the instructions that come with the BTk, but generally, it should be applied twice. The first time will be about ten days after caterpillar eggs have hatched, and the second time about two weeks later, while the caterpillars are still small.
BTk is available commercially, so you can probably get it at your local home improvement or gardening store. It is usually sold in powder form, which is then mixed with water and sprayed onto infested plants.;
, Birds are perhaps the best at controlling caterpillars naturally. Thus, it is a good idea to make your garden appealing to them. Try placing a birdbath, some bird feeders, and even a bird house or two into the garden to elicit interest.If you have cats that go into the yard, make sure that they wear a collar with a bell on it. This alerts birds when a cat is in the area.
If you have space, chickens also offer a great way to get rid of caterpillars. Chickens will eat the caterpillars, so you won’t have to worry about dealing with them yourself.However, you will need to prepare your yard properly to keep chickens healthy and safe, so this shouldn’t be seen as a quick and easy fix.

, If you are having a problem with caterpillars in a tree, you can wrap the trunk with burlap. Caterpillars like to hide during the heat of the day, and the burlap offers an ideal place to get out of the sun. Once they’ve crawled in, you can smash many caterpillars quickly.This may work especially well for gypsy moth caterpillars, which tend to live in trees.

, If you aren’t afraid of touching the caterpillars, then this is one way to get rid of caterpillars without spraying chemicals or other substances on your leaves.Fill a bucket about half way with water. The size of the bucket depends on how many caterpillars you are dealing with. If it is just a few, a coffee can might do. If you have a lot of caterpillars, you might need a 5-gallon pail.
Add dish soap. If you are using a relatively small-sized bucket, a quarter of a cup should do. Add more if you are using a large bucket. This is not an exact science, so don’t worry about getting the measurements exactly right.
Pick the caterpillars up and throw them in the water, where they will die. Wear gloves if you want to.

, Caterpillars eventually turn into moths and butterflies, which play an important role in pollination.Thus, you might want to consider moving the caterpillars elsewhere (e.g. a nearby wooded area) where they can live without harming your plants.


You can do this by collecting the caterpillars in a bucket or a jar. Take them to the area you want them, and then gently dump them onto a leaf or tree branch.

Separate the bamboo you wish to kill.,
Mow down the culms.,
Dig out the rhizomes.,
Keep mowing and digging until you don't see more shoots.,
Use a root barrier.,
Consider using herbicides.Applying an herbicide to the leaves of bamboo shoots may help to prevent new growth from occurring.,
Buy a clumping bamboo species.,
Plant bamboo in a container.",How to Get Rid of Bamboo," Bamboo culms, or stalks, are connected underground by rhizomes that grow quickly and close to the surface of the ground. By cutting through the rhizomes, you can separate and contain bamboo. The easiest method for cutting through rhizomes is to slice them using the tip of a heavy shovel.


If you want to get rid of an entire grove of bamboo, you'll want to work from the outer edges inward. Separate the outer ring of bamboo first so that the bamboo gets contained in one area. Depending on how large a grove you're working with, this may take weeks, months or even years.
This technique is also effective if you want to preserve a section of bamboo. Cut through the rhizomes that connect sections of bamboo so that they will no longer spread and continue growing together. Continue with the process of killing one section while allowing the other to live. You'll need to periodically cut back the remaining section to keep it from ""running"" underground and spreading to other areas.;
, Now that the rhizomes are cut, shear back the culms as close to the ground as possible. For thin stalks, you may be able to use a lawnmower or a lopper. For larger ones, you might have to break out a chainsaw. If you keep the area maintained over time, the bamboo won't have the chance to get quite so large again.


You can cut the culms at any time of year, but doing it in the spring when you see new growth is a good time to get rid of bamboo. The bamboo is using its energy stores, and you'll be able to get rid of more of it more quickly than if you attempt to get rid of it while it's dormant.

, Use a shovel to dig out the rhizomes and discard them. It's best to dig out the rhizomes the same day you cut down the culms; bamboo grows so quickly that waiting even a day or two will mean having new culms to cut down before you can get to work on the rhizomes.


If the grove is too big to mow and dig all in one day, remember to work from the outer edges inward, gradually containing the grove as you work to get rid of it.

, You'll certainly miss some rhizomes the first few times around, so you'll need to use the same method several more times before the bamboo is completely gone. If you're working in the spring, the growth cycle will happen quickly, and you'll be able to get rid of a substantial amount of bamboo in a few days' time. During other times of year you may need to check the area for new growth every few weeks.

, If your neighbor's bamboo continually creeps into your yard, you can keep it contained by installing a root barrier in the affected area. Rolls of plastic root barrier are available in home and garden stores. Metal and concrete barriers are also effective.You can dig a trench that will act as a barrier if you'd prefer not to use a non-porous material in your yard.
Installing a pond or stream will also effectively block bamboo roots.

, However, this doesn't always work as well as removing culms and rhizomes by hand. It might be tricky to find a chemical that works for the particular species of bamboo you're dealing with. Even if you do find one that works, you could end up killing other plants or wrecking your neighbor's treasured bamboo grove in the process.


If you want to try an herbicide, use a glyphosate herbicide or a selective-grass herbicide directly on new bamboo growth each time it appears. A selective-grass herbicide is not as effective as the glyphosate type in controlling bamboo, but it may be used in flower beds or around ornamental shrubs.

, Not all bamboo species ""run"" all over the yard; some actually stay contained when you plant them. Ask an expert at your local nursery to help you choose a species that won't take over your property.

, This is a simple way to enjoy bamboo while making sure it doesn't get out of control. Most bamboo species do well in large containers that may be placed on your porch or in your yard.

Try pyrethrins.,
Make an insecticidal soap spray.,
Purchase a commercial garden pesticide.",How to Get Rid of Caterpillars2," Pyrethrins are a natural pesticide that is made from plants, specifically chrysanthemums. They are toxic to many pests, including caterpillars. Generally, it is safe for humans and pets, but it could be toxic if ingested in huge amounts. These are typically sold in garden and home improvement stores. The product is typically sprayed directly on infested plants, and is degraded within a few days by sunlight.If you go shopping for pyrethrin pesticides, you will likely come across products that contain “pyrethroids,” these are simply synthetically produced versions of pyrethrum.
You can protect beneficial insects from being harmed by this product by applying it to the affected plants early in the morning, and then cover the plant with an old sheet for 24 hours., This type of spray should be applied directly to the caterpillars. It works because the soap destroys the skin of the caterpillar. In order to make this spray, simply mix two tablespoons of soap into one quart of water into a spray bottle. Shake the mixture well, and then spray it directly on any caterpillars you find.Make sure the soap is biodegradable and plant based in order to avoid harming plants, animals, and bugs that don’t harm your plants.

, This should be considered a last resort given the harmful effects pesticides can have on beneficial insects and the environment, but if you must use a pesticide, make sure that it is designed to work against caterpillars. You can find all of this information on the label.Remember that if you have pets or small children, using a pesticide may harm them if they come in contact with the pesticide.
It is not a good idea to use pesticides in gardens where there are plants that will be eaten.

Add some plants that attract beneficial insects to your garden.,
Use an insect barrier.,
Identify caterpillars.",How to Get Rid of Caterpillars3," Planting flowers such as aster and yarrow, or cilantro, fennel, or dill may attract beneficial insects (insects that eat other insects), which eat caterpillars. Be sure to have these plants growing throughout the season to keep the beneficial insects coming.Planting these types of plants provides a source of alternative food for the beneficial insects, and will keep them coming back even after they’ve taken care of any caterpillars.

, An insect barrier is a type of fabric that you can use to cover your plants. This barrier will prevent moths and butterflies from laying eggs on your plants, which then hatch to become caterpillars.This may be ideal for plants that grow fall vegetables. In this case, pollination does not play a huge role so covering the plants will not reduce the amount of vegetables grown by the plant.

, Caterpillars come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are large, some are small, some are hairy, and some look like worms. If you haven’t seen any caterpillars, but notice that the leaves of your plants are covered in holes, then you likely have caterpillars in your garden.Almost all caterpillars can be taken care of using one of the above-mentioned methods. However, tent caterpillars, which usually live in trees. These caterpillars usually live in webs. These types of caterpillars can be controlled in the same way, but you can also try to remove the branches of the tree where the nest is, and then burn the web nest.
Although caterpillars are generally harmless to humans and cannot bite, there are several species of caterpillars that can give a painful sting. There are many different types of stinging caterpillars that all look very different; therefore, you should generally assume that if a caterpillar has a furry appearance or barbs that it will sting you if you touch it. The sting may not be fatal, but it will be very painful, so it’s best to avoid touching a caterpillar if you aren’t sure what kind it is."

Cut off any curled and distorted leaves and flowers on the rose bush with sharp hand pruners and discard them.Aphids may be hiding within them and it is not worth saving them as they will not recover.,
Use a garden hose with a spray nozzle to spray the aphids off the roses in the morning.,
Repeat this treatment several times a week if the aphids return.",How to Get Rid of Aphids on Roses Organically1,";
, Water the roses in the morning so they will be dry by nightfall. If the leaves are wet when temperatures cool at night, the roses could develop a fungal disease.


You want to use a strong spray and direct the water at the top of the leaves, the bottom of the leaves, and along the stems. Most aphids do not have wings and will be unable to get back on the rose shrubs once the water rinses them off.
The strong spray of water will also crush the aphids.

, Water the roses consistently in the morning to ward off the aphids.

Purchase insecticidal soap at a garden center or a nursery.,
Dilute the concentrated soap with water.,
Prune off any curled leaves and damaged blooms before spraying the roses.,
Spray the rose in the morning when it is cooler outside.,
Coat all of the roses’ leaves and stems until the soap solution begins to drip.",How to Get Rid of Aphids on Roses Organically3," When sprayed, insecticidal soap smothers the aphids that are present on the rose bush. There is no residual or negative environmental effect and beneficial insects are rarely harmed.


You can purchase insecticidal soap in ready to use spray bottles and in concentrated form., If you purchase the concentrated form, you will need to dilute it so you can put it into a spray bottle.


Mix about 5 tablespoons of soap into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water.Shake or stir the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed.
Pour it into a spray bottle.

, The insecticidal soap will not penetrate well enough to kill any aphids hiding within them so it is best to trim off any damaged leaves or blooms and throw them away.

, Do not spray the rose when temperatures rise above 85 °F (29 °C).The higher temperatures could cause the soap to damage the roses’ leaves.

, Leave the insecticidal soap on the rose bush for an hour or so and then rinse it off with clean water.


Don’t leave the mixture on the roses for longer than an hour, as it can cause phytotoxicity and severely damage the foliage.
If the aphids return after one week, repeat the treatment.

Choose an appropriate weed killer.,
Get rid of Wild Rose bushes in late summer, if possible.,
Follow the specific instructions provided with your chosen weed killer.,
Use a stump killer if you need to remove Wild Rose in winter.,
Wait several weeks before digging up the dead rose bush.,
Avoid using household chemicals to kill the rose bush.",How to Get Rid of a Wild Rose Bush1," Chemical weed killers containing glyphosate are an easy way to kill unwanted Wild Rose, but you do need to be very careful not to let it impact the plants that you don’t want to remove.


Some chemical weed killers will linger in the soil so chose your weed killer carefully if you want to replant in the area soon after.
Also make sure you choose a weed killer effective for use on woody plants.;
, Late summer is the best time to apply weed killer to Wild Rose bushes. It’s always best to remove the bushes before the hips set (in late summer or fall).


Choose a still day so the wind doesn’t spread your chemicals. Also try to pick a dry day with no rain forecast so rain doesn’t wash the weed killer away.
It’s recommended that you avoid digging up plants in the winter as the ground can be harder to work with.

, It’s best to read the instructions for whatever brand of weed killer you buy in order to find out the recommended method. However, in most cases you can use the following approach when using a weed killer:


Protect other plants and the ground as required, perhaps using plastic sheeting. Wear protective clothing and gloves and consider using eyewear. Exclude children and animals from the area
Spray the bush with the chemicals, making sure you saturate the base of the bush and the stem. Wait a few weeks for it to take effect. Re-apply if necessary.

, Some chemical weed killers are marketed as stump killers. These work best over the colder months when the sap isn’t rising (usually November – March).


To use a stump killer, prune off the branches and then saw the main stem of the bush down to a few inches from the ground. Apply the stump killer to the fresh cut wood.
This will only work on living wood so if the bush is already dead or the stem you are applying it to is brown and dried out, it won’t have the effect of killing the rest of the bush.
You may need to drill holes into the stem to get the chemicals to penetrate if it doesn’t seem to work the first time.

, Chemical weed killers should kill a plant right down to the roots so it cannot regrow even if the roots are left in the soil. However, you should avoid removing the bush for several weeks to ensure the chemicals have spread right through the plant’s root structure.


You will probably want to remove the dead plant after the weed killer has done its job. This is to prevent the dead stump from becoming an eyesore or trip hazard.
As the dead stump won’t break down very quickly in the soil, you’ll want to remove the bulk of it in before you can replant the area. A mattock will help you to remove the root crown and stump from the ground a few weeks after treating with the weed killer.

, Some people will advise you to use household chemicals such as salt, vinegar or bleach to kill roses. However, this is not recommended as these chemicals are likely to contaminate the soil, making it difficult to cultivate the area later. Instead you should use branded chemicals intended for garden use such as Roundup.

Start by watering the plant well the day before.,
Prune your wild rose back to just a few inches above the ground.,
Carefully remove the entire root ball from the soil.,
Burn or dispose of the rose bush, rather than composting it.,
Watch out for re-growth.,
Consider more extreme removal methods if the rose bush continues to reappear.",How to Get Rid of a Wild Rose Bush2," This will hopefully help the root mass to stay fairly intact when you extract it. If any parts of root are left in the ground they may revive and grow a new plant, which you obviously want to avoid!

, It’s a good idea to protect your arms when you do this – use heavy-duty gardening gloves and thick sleeves.

, When you come to dig, expect the root ball to mostly extend to about 6 inches (15.2 cm) out from the main stem of the rose. Aim to dig in this area using a spade.


Make every effort to avoid leaving any root parts behind as these may re-sprout. It may make sense to remove some of the surrounding soil just to be sure.

, It’s best to burn the rose bush once extracted, or throw it out with the household trash. Avoid composting it.


Any soil should also be removed from the premises so it does not contaminate a new area with sprouting rose roots.
If you are leaving the bush on a bonfire pile for later disposal or burning, make sure it isn't in contact with the ground, as it may re-root this way if left for long enough.

, After you are finished extracting the rose bushes, keep an eye on the area for a few months just to check nothing springs up in the area. This may indicate you have left roots behind in the ground that need to be removed.

, If you have a severe problem with new roses appearing from root runners and root sections left in the ground, consider using a chemical weed killer.


If you prefer to avoid this, you could try excluding the light from the area. Weed control fabric can be purchased which allows water to penetrate but not light.
Cover the area with the fabric and weigh it down with large stones. You’ll need to leave it for several months before the rose bushes die off.

Call a professional if the hive is large or difficult to access.,
Call a professional if you're allergic.,
Contact a local bee keeper if the hive appears to contain honey bees.",How to Get Rid of a Beehive1,"


Honey bees will typically have from 10,000-50,000 or more bees in a hive.
You may only see a small portion but the hives can be deeply hidden in walls, trees, chimneys, roofs, etc.
Some bees are more aggressive than others and will swarm or sting if the hive is threatened or if someone gets too close. Yellow jackets, though not a bee, will do this.
Removing a large hive can be very dangerous and requires great skill, training and experience.;
, If you are allergic to bee venom then this may not be a safe task for you. If allergic, a bee sting may cause swelling of the throat or lips which may cause difficulty in breathing. Some bee stings have even induce vomiting and diarrhea. If you are highly allergic a bee sting could be fatal. So please proceed with caution., Honey bees are on the decline and they may be willing to relocate the bees for free or a nominal fee.


Look online or in the Yellow Pages (Bee keeping may not be well advertised in all areas, you may need to search). Search for beekeepers or apiaries for your local area.
Ask someone at a locally owned market or general merchandise store for bee wranglers or bee keeper contact information.
Call your local farmers market or nursery as they deal with bee keepers.
If a bee handler doesn't remove bees, they probably know of someone who does.

Limit your beehive removal and extermination to small hives that can be easily managed with widely available spray insecticides.,
Prepare your materials.,
Dress appropriately.,
Find the hive.,
Pick the right time.,
Plan properly.,
Use an insecticide.,
Physically remove the hive.,
Dispose of the hive.,
Close off the area.",How to Get Rid of a Beehive2," Avoid large hives and honey producing hives.

, You'll need:

Light-colored and smooth-textured clothing
Gloves (leather preferred)
Head gear (Bee keeper veil preferred)
Insecticide spray
Plastic garbage bag
Soap and Water
Materials to close off area (depends on where the beehive was located)
Bee-smoker (optional, helps calm bees which will make them less likely to sting.)

, Clothing is a very important part in the process of removing beehives. Light colored clothing with smooth texture is best for removing bees. If dark colored or rough texture is warm bees may become aggravated.


Gloves offer great protection for your hands, thick gloves offer better protection for you. Leather is the preferred gloves for the removal of a beehive among professionals. If no gloves or thin gloves are warn you may get stung or feel the sting through the thin layered gloves.
The head gear that professionals use is a beekeeper's veil. This offers great protection while not hindering your vision. Don't wear anything too thin and or nothing, this will leave your head/face open to bee stings.
Try not to wear heavy scented odors, such as : perfume, cologne, and scented deodorant. If worn the bees may get your scent confused with flowers.

, Locating a beehive may be trickier than it sounds. Many beehives are located in hard to reach places such as chimneys, inside walls, in the bark of a tree, and in the ground. The sooner you locate the beehive the better. The longer a beehive remains untouched the bigger it gets and harder to remove., The best time to remove a beehive is late in the winter or in the early spring. During this time the beehive population is smallest. Bees are asleep in the early morning and in the evening, this is when it is safest to remove.


Bees are less active at night, and will likely all be at the hive then. However, it's harder to see and effectively kill bees at night. You may miss bees or smaller hives nearby

, Consider the fallout of removing the hive, and make sure you're ready for it.

Prepare to have repairs following the removal of a large honey bee hive from a home. Walls or structure may need to be cut away to gain access
Plan to bee proof to avoid further infestation in areas where the hive and honey can't be removed (behind stucco and brick).
Consider evacuating those with allergies, children, pets and elderly from the immediate area where a hive is active.

, One of the best ways to remove a beehive is by using a good/strong insecticide. In order to kill the bees inside you may need to repeat the spraying of the insecticide a couple of times. Approach this part of the task only when you're geared up in your protective layers.

The best place to spray the insecticide is in the hole of the beehive. Spraying in the beehive will give the most effective results. If unable to spray directly in the hole of the beehive, spray on it. This will give the same results but will take more spraying applications.
Never attempt to move a large hive and only disturb hives when small enough to eliminate with household chemicals.

, Once the spraying is done, and you don't see any bees flying in an out of the hive, it is time to physically remove the beehive. Removing the beehive will prevent other bees from moving in., Using a plastic garbage bag is the best way to dispose of the beehive. Once you place the beehive in the plastic garbage bag, securely tie the bag. Place in the trash container and put out for trash pickup.

Cleaning is an important process to do once the beehive is removed. Beehives are full of dangerous bacteria that should be cleaned thoroughly. Scrub the area with soap and water for the best results.
Make sure all of the hive and honey is removed whenever possible. Honey and dead bees may attract other bees, wax moths or ants. Scout bees will also find old hives and a new colony will move in if not removed.

, Closing of the area will prevent future bees from moving in. Plug all the entrances where bees could gain an entry point. Seal off all openings in the walls, and insert screens if necessary. If there is a hole in a wall a fresh new coat of paint will seal up the hole."

Prune infected leaves immediately.Ensure the overall health of your plant by removing diseased leaves entirely.,
Treat infected areas.,
Throw away infected leaves.",How to Deal with Black Spot Leaf Disease1," To prevent the spread of disease through contact with the plant or soil, throw them away immediately with your regular trash before doing any more work in the area. Further prevent the disease from spreading by disinfecting your tool immediately after pruning each leaf. Have a solution of 1-part bleach to 4-parts water within easy reach..;
, Prune the infected leaves, including those that have turned yellow or are about to, since these are most likely too far gone to recover. If the infection is widespread, it’s better to prune off entire limbs rather than just removing leaves. Treat what remains, including the leaves’ bottoms as well as their tops.Although there is no guaranteed cure for black spot disease,try the following remedies, which can slow and prevent the disease from spreading, and use whichever shows the best results:


Mix together a solution of 1 tbsp. baking soda, 2.5 tbsp. vegetable oil, 1 tsp. liquid soap, and 1 gallon water. Be sure to use liquid soap, not detergent. Since this may potentially burn your leaves, spray a small test area with the solution before spraying the entire plant. If burning is absent or minimal, spray the leaves once every two weeks.Combine 1-part dairy milk to 2-parts water. Spray the leaves once each week. (Sorry, vegans; non-dairy milk substitutes won’t work).Spray the leaves with neem oil once every two weeks.Use fungicides as a last resort if the disease returns for multiple growing seasons.Follow their directions regarding applications. Apply them early, before outbreaks or at the first sign of spots, since they are preventative in nature. Choose organic products if possible for both the plant’s health as well as pollinating insects., Remove them from the area as soon as you prune them. Put them with your regular garbage, preferably in a tied bag. If you dump them straight into a trashcan, secure the lid firmly to prevent the wind or animals from blowing or tracking them free.


Do not add infected leaves to compost, since the disease may survive and infect other plants when that compost is used as mulch.

Identify your shrub as an azalea.,
Rule out other diseases.,
Remove infected leaves.,
Destroy the infected pieces away from the plant.,
Lay new mulch beneath the azaleas.",How to Cure Azaleas of Leaf Gall,";
, While only the Exobasidium vaccinii fungus causes the distinctive fleshy distortion and discoloration, followed by hardening into brown galls, azaleas can become sick with other conditions that affect the leaves.

, Pick them off by hand, or use scissors. Optimally, you should get all the infected parts before they turn white; white indicates spores, which means that the fungus is redistributing itself (possibly infecting healthy plants) for next season.

, Because each part you removed has the fungus on it, leaving it near the plant will just allow it to spread again. If you have space to do it safely, burn the infected bits.

, This will bury any existing spores, which can reinfect the plant.

"
"
Rake continually.,
Prune the lower canopy.,
Water your plant or tree properly.,
Keep the air circulating.",How to Deal with Black Spot Leaf Disease2," Keep the base of the plant or tree clear of infected leaves that may have fallen on their own. Clear away all fallen leaves, whether they’re infected or not, since beds of dead leaves trap and retain moisture, thus creating a ripe breeding ground for the disease. Be sure to rake straight up to winter’s first snow, or even after if needed; the disease may survive the cold weather and reinfect the plant or tree when spring comes., It’s best to prune from the bottom up. Lower leaves are more likely to be infected with black spot disease, so you’ll want to start in the lower canopy. Prune back lower branches that never completely dry and leave higher ones that receive sunlight.Pruning the lower canopy is also safer – you won’t need to get to those high-up branches.

, Water the soil directly. Keep the leaves dry.Avoid overwatering. Allow soil to dry before watering again.Refrain from watering during rainy weather.

, Weed the soil to improve airflow.Apply a level amount of mulch around the base of the plant or tree, leaving a ring of free space between the mulch and the trunk. Prevent weeds from growing while improving the area’s ability to dry more thoroughly."
"
Purchase resistant varieties of plants.,
Space new plants well apart from each other.,
Avoid planting in overly moist areas.",How to Deal with Black Spot Leaf Disease3," Research the type of tree or plant that you wish to include in your landscape. Find out if any particular variety has been proven to be resistant to the disease.If the cost of resistant varieties is significantly higher than non-resistant ones, ask yourself which you value more: saving money now or time and labor later.

, Whenever you plant new saplings or young plants, picture the size they’ll reach once fully grown. Plant them accordingly, allowing each plenty of distance from the rest in the future.Preempt the easy spread of disease by keeping one plant from touching another once they’ve matured. Allow sunlight to reach and dry the lower leaves throughout their lifetime by eliminating the excessive shade that overcrowded canopies would otherwise provide.


Cover the soil around newly planted areas with mulch. This will absorb water and keep the disease from splashing up into the leaves when it rains.

, Since moisture facilitates black spot disease, plant in areas that dry easily after rain. Choose spots that receive direct sunlight for at least a portion of the day.Keep clear of areas that are prone to standing water.


Also adjust any lawn sprinklers so they don’t soak your leaves unnecessarily."

Know what to protect.,
Protect individual fruits and vegetables.,
Enclose garden beds.,
Block all entry points.",How to Deter Possums from Your Garden1," Possums seem to be fond of new growth on deciduous vines, fruit on fruit trees, and some of the new growth on pruned evergreens. Possums damage the plants when they eat the new growth, so this needs to be prevented.Possums may remove all of the buds, thereby weakening the plant, creating bare patches, and making it easier for plant diseases to take hold.Keep this in mind when planting new plants in your yard or when planting a garden. If you plant things a possum doesn't like, such as prickly and smelly plants like a tea tree or geraniums for example, they are less likely to be destroyed.;
, For example, there are cloth bags that are made to cover individual fruits in a tree. Each one can be covered separately.This will stop the possums from getting to the fruit and does not interfere with the growth of the fruit.You can also use old plastic plant pots with a slit down the side to protect individual fruits or vegetables. Place the fruit inside the pot, so that it is mostly covered but can still grow.

, Instead of keeping possums out of your yard, you can just try to keep them out of specific garden beds. The best way to do this is to create a full enclosure out of chicken wire.


This may make tending your garden a little more difficult but it will assure that your plants survive.

, Possums may make their way into your eaves or other access points on your house or shed. Possums trying to get into your garden shed or house eaves can be deterred by covering openings with permanent covers, such as pieces of wood, or by using anti-bird netting over any holes or entrance points. Just make sure that the possums are not inside the shed or eaves when you cover them, as you could trap them inside.
If you're not sure how the possums are getting in, patrol the area at dusk and watch for possums leaving their den.

If you aren't trying to control an existing plant, the best place to start is in choosing a species that is compatible with your gardening style.,
Some will argue that the best way to control bamboo is to eat the shoots...,
If the option is available, make use of natural barriers.,
Again, if the option is available bamboo can be easily controlled by planting where a lawn surrounds it on all sides by 6 meters (20 ft.) or more.,
If natural barriers or a large lawn are not options for you, you must consider active methods of control.,
To improve on step 5 above, dig a 12-inch deep trench around the bamboo.,
The above methods are highly successful, but not perfect.",How to Control the Spread of Bamboo," Bamboo is a large grass. And like its smaller cousins, there are some varieties that spread easily and others that form neat clumps. If you already have a spreading variety of bamboo, or if you prefer the style and appearance of the spreading kind, go on to step 2!;
, Most bamboo shoots are edible raw, and all of them are edible cooked. This is actually very effective, but requires diligent harvesting every year. The rhizomes left in place after shoot harvest will put up more shoots the following year.

, While bamboo will grow next to a stream, it will not cross one. Bamboo will not grow into an area that is either bone dry or completely water saturated for more than three months out of the year.

, Mow the lawn as usual during the shooting season, and the soft shoots will be killed before they get started.

, One of the easiest of these is to make conditions very good where the bamboo is, and very bad where you don't want it to be. For example, give your bamboo water, organic material like compost, and a few inches of mulch where you want it to be. Withhold water and nutrients in the areas where you don't want it. This is only reliable in combination with the following step.

, Bamboo spreads by sending rhizomes out from the plant near the surface. These rhizomes will shoot out into your trench where you can easily spot them. Check for these rhizomes once or twice a year, and cut off any that you find. Although another rhizome may replace it the following year, a rhizome that is cut off will not continue growing in that direction.

, Occasionally a rhizome will sneak out under your trench for example, requiring you to dig it up to prevent spread. If you really want a long term low maintenance solution, you may want to install a bamboo rhizome barrier. Though this is the most difficult option, it is the most effective way to control aggressive bamboo. See the related WikiHow article, ""How to Install a Bamboo Rhizome Barrier"".

Make it hard for possums to climb structures or plants.,
Trim trees that are being eaten.If a possum is eating the new growth off a tree, you need to figure out how to block its access to the tree.,
Put netting on fruit bushes and trees.,
Place a greased PVC pipe on top of your fence.",How to Deter Possums from Your Garden2," If the possum is using a structure to get to the plant, make the structure difficult to climb. Wrap galvanized iron sheets around posts and over beams of structures, such as pergolas. This will stop the possum from being able to grip the surface with its claws.


This also requires ensuring that there are no trees or shrubs next to the structure that allow the possum to ease itself down from.
You can also use a plastic garbage can with the bottom cut off and a slit up the side. Put it around the trunk of a tree so that the possum is unable to climb up the tree.You can wrap sheet metal around the trunk of the tree to make it difficult to climb.You can also place thick netting around the trunk. The netting will catch the possum's feet and discourage them from climbing.

, Branches should be far enough away from fences and structures so that a possum can't jump to them.This, in combination with blocking access to climbing the trunk of the tree, will give you the best chance of saving your tree from being decimated.


The good news is that while possums can jump, they can't jump very far.An agile, young possum can jump approximately 2.5 meters from a fixed, stable base but less than 2 meters from a swaying tree branch.This means that trimming your trees so they are more than 2 meters from your garden fence or other structure should be sufficient.

, In particular, you should place netting over these plants while they are sending out new growth shoots or are bearing fruit. The netting will not keep possums out completely but they should make it difficult enough for the possums that much of the fruit will be saved.


Also remove any fallen fruit below fruit trees or bushes. Fallen fruit will attract possums to the area, so keep it to a minimum if you can.

, This method only works if your garden is closed in with fencing, as it stops possums from climbing over the fence. It will take about one day of your time to install this protection.


Attach a large PVC pipe running horizontally across the top of all of the fencing. This will be hard for the possum to grip onto.
Then apply non-toxic grease to the PVC pipe. When a possum now tries to get into your garden, you should find that it cannot get a secure grip or footing because of a the grease on the drum. This causes the animal to fall off without injury.
Make sure that there are no holes or other points for the possum to cross the fence.

Look into commercial possum sprays.,
Make and apply a quassia chip spray.,
Use household items to deter possums.,
Surround your garden with predator urine.,
Put up noisy deterrents.,
Put up scarecrows.",How to Deter Possums from Your Garden3," Nurseries, supermarkets, and some hardware stores stock a range of possum-deterrent sprays that you can use. Remember to follow the instructions on the packaging so that your plants are not affected and so that possums the are not injured.

, Quassia is a small branching tree that contains substances that deter the possum from wanting to be around it.Make a spray of 100g quassia chips to 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water. Heat for one hour, then strain. Add one tablespoon detergent. Dilute 1 part quassia solution to 4 parts water and spray on foliage.Most homemade sprays and applications need to be reapplied following rain. They should be reapplied frequently anyway, for full effectiveness.

, These will require constant reapplication to be effective in the long-term. Some things that you can try include:Brew up some lapsang souchong tea. Spray this over the affected plants. Possums don't like it!
Spread blood and bone around the vulnerable plants.
Use mothball flakes on beams, and around the base of plants. Place in pantyhose and hang from foliage.
Apply Indonesian fish sauce. Combine one tablespoon of sauce in one litre of water and then sprayed on foliage.
Make a garlic spray. Place 2 tablespoons of freshly crushed garlic into one litre of hot water. Leave overnight, strain, then spray on foliage.
Spray laundry detergent full strength onto foliage.
Tabasco sauce. Use this full strength. It can painted or sprayed onto foliage. Note that this can badly damage some plants, so do your research before applying this sauce.
Strong-smelling herbs such as sage, rosemary, or oregano may deter possums, especially when mixed with spicy chili pepper. Blend to a paste and spread around affected plants.

, Urine from male foxes, weasels, and likely other predators has repelled possums in experiments.That said, it may not be completely reliable, and it could attract other animals.Look for predator urine at a hardware store or plant nursery, and follow the label instructions to distribute it in a perimeter around your garden.Carpet Python faeces are an effective possum deterrent, if available. Pythons are possum predators.
Some homeowners ring their garden with human hair to deter pests, but this is unproven.Consider trying it the next time you have a haircut, scattering the trimmed hairs thinly over the surface.

, Wind chimes, noisy bells, or plastic bottles cut in half can catch the wind and make enough noise to keep some pests away. This isn't foolproof, but hopefully your fruit trees will be ready to harvest before the possums learn to ignore the noise.


You can also buy commercial ultrasonic pest deterrents, outside the range of human hearing.
Dogs, especially outdoor dogs, will chase away possums, and their barking will scare them off.

, You can try a traditional scarecrow, or put up fake birds such as a tennis ball with feathers glued onto it. Again, the effectiveness of this deterrent varies from animal to animal, and may lessen over time.


Hanging mirrors near the scarecrow may amplify the effect.

Plant food for possums.,
Trap possums humanely.,
Understand that possums are protected in Australia but not in New Zealand.",How to Deter Possums from Your Garden4," You may be able to steer a possum's attention away from one plant to another. Put plants that possums like to eat, such as eucalyptus, at the edge of your garden. This may keep them occupied enough to keep them away from tender shoots and new growth in your garden., In New Zealand, possums are considered an invasive species. You should trap them and call animal control for removal.That said, possums are protected in Australia. The South Australian government only recommends (humane) trapping when a possum is living in your building.Even then, it may cause the possum less stress to lure it out, then block its access


For example, you could build a nesting box, place some fruit in it, and then place it near where the possum is dwelling. This should lure the possum into the nesting box.
If you do use a live trap, a small amount of honey works well as bait. Use the trap to transfer it out of the building, but not outside of the area. Possums almost always die when relocated., Possums may limit the kinds of plants you can grow in your garden but possums need human help to survive. If you live in Australia, you can help offset the destruction of their natural environment by creating a good location for them to live, including nesting boxes and attractive vegetation.


Possums are considered invasive in New Zealand. Call animal control or the Department of Conservation for assistance in removing them.

Identify the disease.,
Use cultural control.,
Use chemical controls.,
Practise prevention.",How to Deal with Mildew Leaf Disease," Mildew appears as grey powdery patches on top of the surface of the leaf.;
, You can brush mildew off with your hands but this won't rid your plant of the disease. If you spot a leaf blighted with mildew, prune back the shoot to a healthy leaf, or even to the ground if it needs it. Make sure you check the entire plant thoroughly, pruning as you go.

, If removing all the diseased leaves will leave your plant completely bare, consider using a pesticide/fungicide spray. This won't cure the disease but it will stop it spreading. Always follow the instructions on the spray container carefully.


Hold the bottle about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) away from the plant and spray enough to coat the leaf but not enough to cause any drips.






Treat the plant either early, or late in the day, so you don't spray pollen-spreading insects like bees.
Wait 14 days and then repeat.







, To stop your plants from getting mildew, keep them well watered and fed, particularly at the beginning of the growing season.

Refrain from disturbing the soil.,
Sprinkle weed prone sidewalks with salt.,
Maintain a thick and healthy lawn.",How to Control Weeds1," Heavy digging and cultivation can cause weed seeds to come to the surface and begin growing. Only disturb the soil when you have to, so that you don’t inadvertently raise weed seeds.Weed seeds can lay dormant under the soil for years.Hoeing or tilling in weed prone areas may inadvertently bring up dormant weed seeds in the process.;
, If you are having an issue with weeds growing in between cracks in a walkway or sidewalk, try using salt to prevent future weed growth. Be warned that salt will also kill other vegetation in the area, so make sure to use it only in spots that are weed prone.


Amine salt is a good solution for killing weeds and can be combined with water in a spray bottle for easier application.Borax is another, more caustic solution to killing weeds in small cracks. Make sure to use gloves when handling it., Weeds like to grow in open areas that are abundant in nutrients and minerals. You can prevent them by maintaining a thick and healthy lawn that has grass and other lawn plants to compete with weeds that may want to grow in the area.


Keeping your lawn fertilized will promote healthy growth for all plants on your lawn or garden bed.Reseeding lawns in the fall will promote healthy grass growth next season because many weeds die late in the fall, and the grass seeds will have less to compete with."
"
Use mulch to smother the weeds.,
Pull visible weeds in your garden.,
Hoe or till your lawn.",How to Control Weeds2," Smothering weed seeds with mulch will hinder their germination and could prevent them from growing all together.Keep your garden or lawn area well mulched in order to prevent weed growth.


Spread the mulch 2 to 4 inches deep to retain moisture and to stop weed growth.
Organic mulches like hardwood mulch, shredded bark, pine needles and straw degrade over a couple of months and can provide additional nutrition to your soil., Pulling weeds from the ground with your hands is the simplest way to rid your garden or lawn of unwanted weeds. Identify weeds as they grow and pull them. You can also opt to sever the roots of the weeds with a knife by stabbing the dirt under the weed where the roots are.Weeds are easier to pull when the soil is moist.
A single dandelion can create 15,000 seeds in a single year, which may lead to additional weeds in your garden. Pull or sever the weeds when they’re young before they can create more seeds., If there is already weed growth in your garden, tilling or hoeing the weeds will uproot smaller annual weeds while severing the flowers off perennial weeds. Once you are done tilling or hoeing, discard the weeds and use mulch to prevent seeds from sprouting new ones.If you do not have weed growth, refrain from tilling or hoeing your garden or lawn, as this can activate dormant weed seeds under the soil.

Identify the weeds that you have.,
Read and follow the directions on the label of the herbicide.,
Wear protective gear before applying the chemicals.,
Spray the herbicide to weeds and weed prone areas.",How to Control Weeds3," Herbicides can be used to chemically control or kill weeds in your garden or lawn, but are typically species specific to the weeds that you have.Before purchasing a herbicide, refer to online encyclopedias to identify the type of weeds that you have.


Applying a chemical solution to your garden should be the last resort as it can pollute groundwater and can be bad for the environment.Weeds can be broken up into three classifications known as broad-leaves, grasses, and sedges and their life cycle can be annual, biennial, or perennial., Before applying herbicide to any weeds in your garden, it’s important that you read the directions and the label on the box it came with.Some herbicides may pose a threat to other plants, so make sure to read the warnings before applying anything in your garden or lawn.
You should also determine if the herbicide is made for weed prevention, or for killing weeds once they are grown.

, Wearing things like an apron, rubber gloves, protective eye-wear, and a face-mask will protect you from any herbicides that may inadvertently get on you.


Tyvek and nitrile gloves are the best material to use when handling herbicide and can be bought in hardware stores or online., Do not douse an area with herbicide, even if it has a lot of weeds, as this could be dangerous. Use the recommended level of herbicide according to the label.


You can visit a local cooperative extension if you have additional questions about applying herbicide to your garden or lawn, or having trouble choosing the correct chemical for the types of weeds that you have."

Control whiteflies on outdoor plants by introducing the whitefly's natural predators.,
Purchase whitefly parasites.,
Avoid insecticides.,
Get rid of ants.",How to Control Whiteflies1," One of the most effective ways to get rid of whitefly infestations is to introduce animals to your garden that will feed on the whiteflies, but not your plants. Lacewings, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, some species of ladybugs, and some spiders all eat whiteflies.Garden supply stores often sell these bugs, and should say whether the insect they are selling will eat whiteflies.;
, Encarsia formosa or other Encarsia species are tiny parasitic wasps, which can be introduced to your garden to invade the whiteflies' bodies and disrupt their ability to reproduce. They are commercially available, but most can only thrive indoors, in greenhouse environments, and in tropics., Many strains of whitefly are resistant to insecticides, while their predators and parasites are not. Thus, using insecticides can sometimes increase the amount of whiteflies in your garden.

, Ants are not predators of the whitefly, despite their frequent appearance near infested plants. Some species of ants will actually feed on the ""honeydew"" secretions of the whitefly nymphs, and could defend or discourage actual predators of whiteflies.

"
"
Purchase whitefly traps (optional).,
Cut your own traps instead.,
Paint your traps bright yellow.,
Coat both sides of the trap with a sticky substance.,
Place them above plants.,
Clean the traps periodically.,
Remove the traps when the whiteflies are mostly gone.",How to Control Whiteflies2," Whitefly traps are available commercially. They are usually bright yellow strips of sticky cardboard, staked or hung above plants. As you might have guessed from this description, they are easy to make yourself as described below.


Note that these traps will only catch adult whiteflies, and young wingless nymphs will still remain on the plants and damage leaves. Combine this with other treatments for best results.

, If you'd rather make your own traps, start by cutting plywood or masonite board into strips roughly 12 inches (30 centimeters) long and 6 in. (15 cm) wide.This size should be suitable for most plants, but you may use smaller ones if you only have a small flowerpot or two to protect.

, Use any type of paint to make your traps bright yellow, on both sides. Adult whiteflies are attracted to this color.

, Petroleum jelly mixed with an equal amount of mineral oil or detergent creates a long-lasting sticky adhesive.Alternatively, use a heavy-grade motor oil or a commercial product such as Tanglefoot.Whichever substance you choose, be sure to coat both sides of the trap generously with a paintbrush, so any whitefly landing on the trap will be stuck.

, Hang them above your plants, or stake them in the ground near your plants. The stakes should be at the same level as the leaves you see the whiteflies feeding on. One trap for every two large vegetable plants or flowerpots is a good guideline.

, Hopefully, there'll be plenty of dead whiteflies on the trap, along with dead leaves or other debris that gets stuck to them. Wash with soap and water or scrape the traps regularly to remove these, and reapply the sticky substance so you can catch more pests.

, After the whitefly population is mostly dead, and you only see a few on the traps, take down the traps. Because the traps also have the potential to kill whitefly predators, they are not recommended for a low level infestation, unless the predators fail to keep the whiteflies in control."
"
Remove badly infested leaves by hand.,
Spray or vacuum whiteflies off the leaves.,
Add a reflective mulch.,
Isolate new or infected plants.,
Use insecticide as a last resort.",How to Control Whiteflies3," Check daily during a severe whitefly infestation, and pluck off badly infested leaves. These have many white eggs and/or wingless nymphs (""crawlers"") on the underside of the leaf. If severely infested, the leaf may be coated with a sticky or waxy substance produced by the feeding nymphs, or it may turn yellow and spotted.This method works best for small gardens where you can check each plant regularly.

, You can dislodge young whiteflies from the underside of leaves by spraying them with a hose. To catch the winged adults as well, use a hand-held vacuum cleaner to catch whiteflies when they are most sluggish, in the early morning or during cool weather. Put the vacuum cleaner bag inside an airtight plastic bag after capturing, and freeze it for 24 hours to kill the whiteflies before emptying in the trash.This method is most helpful when the whiteflies are first noticed. If they have had a chance to lay eggs, these may remain on the leaf and start a new generation of many hundreds or thousands of whiteflies after hatching.
If the infestation is minor, this method can help reduce the population of whiteflies to the point where natural predators will be able to keep the population in check.

, Add a layer of aluminum foil or reflective plastic mulch covering the ground. This can make it more difficult for adult whiteflies to locate host plants, reducing the amount of eggs successfully laid.This step will require special water considerations. Plants surrounded by plastic mulch will need to have a drip irrigation system.
Do not use mulch in hot weather, as it may overheat the plants.

, If a plant is severely infested, transfer it to a separate room or an outdoor area distant from other plants. Isolate all newly acquired plants for several days before introducing them to a location with other plants, and inspect the undersides of the leaves for whiteflies., As explained in the section on natural enemies, insecticide rarely works on whitefly populations, and may even kill the animals that feed on them. However, if the whitefly population in your garden is out of control, you may have nothing to lose. Neem oil, insecticidal soap, and malathion are common options, and you may wish to choose two of them to alternate between, in case your whiteflies are resistant to one. Apply an insecticide once every five to seven days to the undersides of infested leaves.Always check to make sure the insecticide you plan to use will not harm the plant you are applying it to.

Discourage skunks in your garden by eliminating their access to the food source.,
Choose species of plants that repel skunks.,
Put some stinging nettle, or Urtica dioica, around the outside of your garden to discourage skunks.,
Spread mothballs around your plants or the entire garden to repel skunks.,
Treat your garden for insects.,
Remove spoiled fruit and vegetables as soon as possible.,
Set traps to get rid of skunks.,
Repel skunks with a fox urine scent.",How to Discourage Skunks in Your Garden," The best approach is to fence your garden. Put cages around the plants and cover the berries with netting.;
,


Plant squash around the perimeter of your garden. Skunks enjoy squash but most won't walk on the squash leaves to get to the vegetable because the plant leaves contain tiny hairs that irritate the skin and feet of skunks.

, The leaves have pointy sharp hairs that break off and produce a liquid when disturbed. The combination of the 2 creates painful burning and stinging.


Consider planting Fritillaria imperialis, or Crown Imperial, to get rid of skunks. The Crown Imperial is a flower-producing plant. The flowers have an unpleasant odor to skunks, rodents and many people.

, Most skunks have a keen sense of smell. The mothballs may not only keep skunks out of your garden, but they may keep them out of your yard altogether.

, The reason why a skunk may be in your garden is the bugs, worms and other insect population common in gardens. Keep the bugs under control to discourage skunks.

, Rotten food in general harbors insects.

, You can use traps that catch the animals so you can relocate them to better locations that are far away from your garden and home.


Be sure your traps are tubular in shape and narrow. This serves 2 purposes: it keeps the skunks calm in the dark and prevents them from raising their tails to spray.
Bait the traps with bacon, cat food, berries, peanut butter or other items that skunks like to eat.
Place the traps in the garden or in the travel paths to the garden.

, Foxes are a skunk's natural enemy. This should discourage skunks from visiting.

Check your home for dangers.",How to Survive a Tsunami (for Kids)," During a tsunami, low-lying areas near the ocean are extremely vulnerable to the waves. You should know how at risk your family is before a disaster occurs, so you know how to prepare. Your parents will probably know if your home is a tsunami hazard area, but you should also know how high your street is above sea level and how far your neighborhood is from the coast and other areas where waves may occur. Those numbers usually help officials decide if you need to evacuate during a tsunami.If you're not sure whether you live in an area that is at risk for a tsunami, visit your local emergency management department's website. There is usually a map or search engine that allows you to put in your address to determine if you're in a tsunami evacuation zone.
Even if your home is safe, other areas that you visit regularly may be in danger during a tsunami. Find out how far above sea level and how far from the coast your school is. Your parents should know that information about the places they work too.
While any area near an ocean coast can experience a tsunami, they usually occur most often in the Pacific Ocean because of the fault lines beneath the ocean there.On average, only two tsunamis occur each year, and they only affect the area around the source. Large tsunamis that cause ocean-wide destruction occur much less frequently.;
, Hopefully, you’ll never have to worry about a tsunami or other natural disasters, but being prepared is the best way to keep yourself safe. Talk to your family about creating an emergency kit, so if you are trapped during a tsunami, you have everything you need, such as food, water, and medical supplies, to survive for several days. Place the items in an easy to carry container -- a duffle bag, camping backpack, or unused trash can work well.Your kit should have 3-gallons of water per person, per day. For evacuating, it should be 3 days worth. In case you’re trapped in your home, it should be 2 weeks worth.Pack the kit with non-perishable food that’s easy to prepare, such as canned beans. Have a 3 day supply for evacuation and 2 weeks’ worth for your home.
Make sure your kit has at least one flashlight and a battery-operated radio to keep up with news reports. Add fresh batteries to the kit as well.
In case of injuries, it’s important to have a first aid kit in your emergency supplies for minor injuries. However, if anyone in your family has special medical needs, such as medications, eye glasses, or syringes, there should be a supply of those as well. Make sure there are enough to get through at least a week.
If you have a baby sibling, check that the kit includes diapers, baby, food, and formula.
If you have a pet in your family, you’ll need items such as a collar, leash, pet food, and bowls.
Your kit should have a multipurpose tool with features such as a can opener.
Communication devices come in handy in an emergency kit. Add a cell phone with charger and/or two-way radios.
You may not have access to clean, running water during and after a tsunami, but include personal hygiene products, such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and deodorant. Make sure to add several rolls of toilet paper as well.
Emergency blankets, sleeping bags, rain gear, and changes of clothing for everyone in the family are also important.
Include maps of your area in the kit, so if you get confused about where your family should evacuate to, you have a guide.
You may be stuck in your home, at a shelter, or some other evacuation location for a while during a tsunami. Pack some games, books, and other activities for you and your siblings in the kit to help keep you busy during the disaster.

, If you live in a low-lying area, you likely can’t stay at your home when a tsunami hits. That’s why your family must plan an evacuation route, so you know how to leave your home safely and reach higher ground. Your family should choose a destination that’s 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level and approximately 2 miles (3 kilometers) inland. Make sure that everyone in the family knows how to get there, including the specific route to take.To be sure that everyone is ready, practice the evacuation route several times a year. Practicing means you won’t have to think as much during an actual tsunami because you’ll know exactly what to do.
If your family is taking a trip to a location that is prone to tsunamis, have your parents check with the hotel or resort to determine what the evacuation policy is for guests during a disaster.

, It’s possible that you may be at school when a tsunami hits, so you should pay careful attention when teachers and other school official go over the evacuation policy. That way, you’ll know where to go and how to leave the school safely.During a tsunami, evacuation roads are going to be crowded and it may be difficult to get in touch with your parents. Make sure they know whether they should pick you up at your school, at an emergency shelter, or another location.

, During a tsunami, phone lines may be down or overloaded, so it’s important for your family to develop a way to get in touch with one another in case you’re separated. Everyone in your family should know how to text because that may be the only way to contact one another. It’s also a good idea to have an emergency contact for the family. That should be someone who lives out of town -- it may be easier to get through to someone who isn’t in the immediate area during a disaster. Memorize the number or have it stored in your phone. Take the time to make contact cards for everyone in the family that includes your emergency contact’s information and any other phone numbers that might be important during a tsunami. You and your family members should carry the cards with them at all times.
Don’t forget to include the numbers for the police, fire department, hospitals, and other emergency services on your contact card.

, While you’ll probably notified of a possible tsunami on the TV, radio, or internet, it still helps to know the signs yourself. When a tsunami occurs, you’ll notice severe ground shaking due to the underwater earthquakes that cause the waves. Ocean water may move away from the coast, so shells, sand, and sea life are suddenly exposed. You may also hear a loud roaring sound that’s similar to a plane engine as a tsunami approaches.If you observe any of these signs, you should evacuate as soon as possible even if no official orders have been given.
Your area may also have a siren or other type of audible warning that occurs when a tsunami warning is issued. Make sure you familiarize yourself with the warnings, so you know if there’s danger.

, When there is a good chance that your area will be affected by a tsunami, your local authorities will likely issue a warning to alert residents. They’ll also tell you if you have to evacuate based on where your home or school is located. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully and as quickly as possible. Because you’ve practiced your evacuation route with your family, you should know exactly where to go and how to get there.Official tsunami warnings and evacuation orders are usually shared via TV or radio news. You can also find information on the internet.
If you’re away from home at the beach or other low-lying areas when a tsunami warning is issued, move inland immediately. If possible, run uphill so you reach higher ground where the waves can’t reach you.
Don’t ever stay to watch a tsunami. If you’re close enough to see a wave, you’re probably close to run away from it.
If you can’t escape to higher ground quickly enough, the best option is to climb to the roof of a tall, sturdy building or a tree. Trees can be uprooted during a tsunami, though, so be sure to choose one that is large and strong., When you’re evacuating, you must make sure that you’ve accounted for all of the family members who live with you, including your parents, siblings, and grandparents. However, make sure that you find all of your pets as well. If a situation is dangerous for you, it’s dangerous for your animals -- and they usually don’t have the means to protect themselves.To avoid losing your pets during an evacuation or tsunami situation, keep animals on leashes or in carriers. Even if your home is in an area that’s not vulnerable to the tsunami, make sure to watch them so they don’t wander off.

, If you live in a coastal area, you may actually feel the earthquakes that cause the waves. It’s extremely easy to get injured in an earthquake, so if you feel the ground shaking for more than 20 seconds, drop to the ground and take cover under a desk or table, making sure to hold on tightly.As soon as the shaking stops, round up your family and evacuate as quickly as possible. The earthquake is usually a sign that a tsunami is only a few minutes away.

, A tsunami can cause destruction to buildings, power lines, and other items. Make sure to avoid buildings from which heavy objects might fall or large trees that may be uprooted or lose branches. Don’t go near downed power lines either because they may be live and you could electrocute yourself.Bridges can become unstable during the earthquakes that accompany tsunamis, so take care if you need to cross any when you’re evacuating., Before you can help anyone else after a tsunami, it’s important to check that you’re not hurt. Examine yourself to see if you have any injuries that require first aid. If it’s a minor injury, such as a small cut or scrape, you can probably handle it yourself. However, if you have a more serious injury, such as a broken bone, talk to your parents so you can get medical assistance as soon as possible.If you have an injury that is extremely painful, avoid moving around too much. You may wind up making it worse.

, If you have younger brothers and sisters, make sure that they are safe and uninjured after the tsunami. Older relatives, such as grandparents, may also need assistance because they may not be able to move around too well on their own. If anyone needs serious medical attention, bring it to your parents’ attention.Make sure that you know where the first aid kit is in your emergency kit, so you can help with minor injuries, such as putting antibacterial ointment and a bandage on a cut.

, It’s common for people to become trapped after tsunami because the earthquake and strong waves can cause items to fall and block people in. If someone in your family or a neighbor is trapped, don’t try to rescue them on your own. Instead, call emergency professionals who have the right equipment to safely extract people.People have been known to get injured or killed when they try to rescue someone on their own. While you have may the best intentions in mind, you may wind up putting yourself in serious danger if you try to help a friend or family member.

, In the days following a tsunami, phone lines are probably going to be jammed with emergency workers trying to communicate with needed resources. To keep the lines open for them, avoid making calls unless there is an emergency, such as someone needing to be rescued or to receive medical assistance.If you want to get in touch with family members or friends to make sure that they’re safe after a tsunami, text instead of calling. The added benefit to texting is that it will often work even when cell phone service is out.

, If you had to evacuate during a tsunami, you’ll probably want to return home as soon as it’s over. However, you and your family should only go home if local authorities have announced that it is safe to do so. Tsunamis often involve a series of waves that can take place over hours, so even if one passes, there may be another one on the way.In some cases, the subsequent waves may be larger and more dangerous than the first, so it’s important to ensure that tsunami is over before you head home.

, Even if the tsunami has passed and officials have decided that you can return home, you should be careful when you go back. Stay out of your home or any building that still has water in it. The water may cause floors to split and walls to collapse, so the building may be a danger for you and your family.If you’re not sure whether a building still has water in it or not, try to look through a window to see. Avoid going inside if you’re not sure.

, You may assume that your home is safe if there is no water inside, but there are other dangerous problems that may occur after a tsunami. Even if the water has receded, the floors may be damaged, so be careful where you step. Your parents also should check the house for gas leaks, as well as other fire hazards, such as frayed wires, a submerged fuse box or circuit breaker, and wet electrical appliances.It’s best to let your parents inspect your home before you go inside. They’ll be able to tell if everything is safe, so you and your siblings don’t injure yourselves.
You can usually tell if there’s a gas leak if you smell gas in your home or you hear a hissing or blowing sound. If you suspect there’s a leak, tell your parents and immediately leave the house.

, Unlike tornadoes or hurricanes, where underground shelters are sufficient, tsunamis can submerge towns and cities under more than 20–30 feet (6.1–9.1 m) of seawater (sometimes even deeper).

In short, it'll be the quickest way to reach high ground. You want to be, ideally, 2 miles (3.2 km) away from shore and at least 100 feet (30.5 m) above sea level.


If you are a tourist, ask your hotel or various approachable locals about policy, if you're concerned. Familiarize yourself with the terrain so if the worst were to happen, you could fend for yourself. Even though you'll probably be following everyone else, know that they're heading for high ground, too, and you should do the same.
And those evacuation routes won't really do you much good if you don't practice them. So round up the kids and the family dog and...GO. How long does it take to reach your safety spot? Are there any potential issues that could crop up? Do you know how to reach your back-up route in the event one is impassable or jammed?;
, You want one available for wherever you may be when the time comes. Worst case scenario is you get caught somewhere for a few days before evacuations start happening, so you want 72 hours worth of goods. Put in things like a roll of toilet paper, first aid equipment, energy bars, and water. Here's a list to get you started:


Water (A large amount to last for about a week)
A prepaid sim card in a phone (Be sure the phone has a long lasting battery)
Canned or packaged foods (A large amount to last for about a week)
Flashlight (hand cranked flashlights are a good idea)
Radio (tuned to NOAA station that gives the ""all clear"" signal)
Sanitary items such as toilet paper, moist towelettes, garbage bags, zip ties, hand sanitizer.
First aid equipment (band-aids, gauze pads, etc)
Whistle
Map
Tools (wrench to turn off utilities, manual can opener)
Duct tape
Spare clothes
Anything for individuals with specific needs (infants, elderly, etc.)

, If you're at work, the kids are at school, and your spouse is at home, all the group planning in the world won't do you any good. Have a plan on where to meet if a tsunami were to strike when you're in different areas. Invest in a set of walkie talkies and outline the plan, making sure all parties understand that that's where they need to meet, regardless of circumstance.


If you have kids that are in school, familiarize yourself with their policy. They may take the kids to their own spot. Ask your student's teacher or a faculty member about their tsunami policy.

, If your community gets hit, people like you may need to rise to the occasion. If you have taken a first aid course, you can administer CPR, attend to basic injuries, and help save lives. Including your own or that of someone you love.


Definitely read up on wikiHow's first aid and emergency articles, but consider taking a legit course from a nearby school, hospital or community center. You'll be helping better the world from day 1.

, If you know what do when in 4 feet (1.2 m) of water and a Toyota Corolla is coming at you, you can stay calm and, most importantly, survive. And then there's the skills that help you survive when the community is in shambles. Were you a girl or a boy scout, by any chance?


Once you know how to predict a tsunami and how to handle the situation when it comes, your main duty is to pass your learning onto others. If your community doesn't have a program, start one. It's imperative that everyone knows how to operate under these conditions.

, ""Tsunami insurance"" just isn't really a thing, but flood insurance definitely is. If your house is even a half mile to a mile away from the coast, inquire about it. The last thing you want to worry about is reconstructing your life when you have so much else on your plate. Having insurance at least eliminates some financial stress.


Invest in a hurricane shelter if possible. The more mental anguish you can avoid, the better -- and having a hurricane shelter can be a serious load off. Your emergency route would lead you there and you could stash your emergency kits in it as well. Home away from home, if need be.

, Though not 100% of the time, usually a coastal earthquake is what sets off a tsunami. So if at any point the ground beneath you is even quivering, go on high alert. A tsunami could come in a matter of minutes or matter of hours. Or it could not come at all.


Tsunamis also have a tendency to travel. An earthquake can happen in Alaska and a tsunami can strike in Hawaii. This is all quite scary, so just take note that they don't happen incredibly often -- most waves lose energy out at sea, far away from civilization.

, Usually during a tsunami, the water will recede very far back. The water will be inactive, and the only waves will be very small and barely make it up to the beach. Nearby boats and ships will be likely to bob up and down. A small wave might come up and fill the water where it is supposed to be, but then it will recede back in a second. These are excellent signs that a tsunami is coming.


Do a quick YouTube search right now for videos -- it's quite startling. If you think you won't be sure whether or not the tide has receded, think again. So much land that almost never breathes air will make its fateful appearance and it'll be impossible to ignore.

, Get everyone to evacuate the beach and any area near the shore. Yell, scream, and make an idiot out of yourself if you need to in order to grab their attention. Many people will be entranced by the odd behavior of the ocean and not realize something is wrong.


If you don't want to jump to conclusions, look to the animals. How are they acting? We may be technically smarter than them, but they know when nature has gone awry. If they're acting funny, something is definitely up.

, And they can be separated by short or very long periods of time. So if the first wave is not very aggressive or not very big, don't think you can go back to the beach and that your tsunami did not live up to the hype. Many times people think that the tsunami is over and are injured or killed by the second or third wave.


Tsunamis spread, so a small wave in one area could be a behemoth of a wave in another. If you hear word that another area has been hit, presume yours will be too, though the gravity of the wave could be very different.

, Depending on the tsunami, sometimes one mile isn't enough. The wave can sweep as much as 2,000 feet (609.6 m). It doesn't happen often, but you want to be as safe as possible and assume the worst. So get far away from the water and get to high ground.


Ideally, you want high ground that's natural, like a mountain or hill. The 32nd floor of a high-rise that gets swept away and turned to rubble by the current is not a good place to be.

, The last thing you expected on your week-long, relaxing visit to Thailand was a tsunami, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. You could be casually resting on the beach, eyes closed, earbuds in, and all of a sudden the tide starts acting as if it has a mind of its own. When that happens, head for the hills.


Even if it's on foot, just run. Follow the locals. Tourists are often the ones absent-mindedly looking to the sea and then not running till it's too late; you see the locals scatter way before the visitors.

, Take your boat and get to the middle of nowhere. You'll waste far too much time getting to shore and docking. Apart from that, in the middle of nowhere, the waves have room to spread out and thus their ferocity gets exponentially diminished. That and you don't run the risk of the side of a building or a semi-truck hitting you in the face; you'll be much safer at sea. Half the danger of a tsunami lies in the debris, just like in a tornado.

, That's why you have a kit everywhere you could possibly be. So whether you're high-tailing on foot, on a bicycle, or in your car, grab it and go. Once you're there, use your radio to tune in to your weather alert station and use the walkie-talkie to channel your family. Is everyone on their way?


Oh, and grab your pet, too. Don't make the little guy fend for himself! Is there food you can spare for him in the kit if need be?

, You might drown. A bunch of deadly debris might be floating by, such as cars, trees, or rocks. Try to grab onto the debris or something solid in the ground, like a pole. If you can't grab the debris, try to avoid it. Move out of its way swiftly or duck beneath. If you grab something or float on something until the water subsides or you are able to get away from the wave, you are likely to survive.


In short, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. And a tsunami is one move Mother Nature has up her sleeve that you definitely can't beat. So if you do get swept up in her power, roll with it. Grab the nearest SUV that's going for a new-age joy ride and hang on. The worst will be over in the first few seconds.

Evaluate elements outside the home that are potential hazards.,
Make any necessary repairs to your home.,
Add support to cripple walls.,
Build better walls to make your home more earthquake resistant.Add steel frames or plywood panels to offset structural problems from quake damage.,
Anchor sill plates properly to the foundation.,
Install windows with round corners.,
Restrain large equipment, furniture pieces, and appliances.",How to Protect Your Home During an Earthquake1," Trees that are old or leaning, electrical wires, and power lines can be detrimental to the infrastructure of your home during earthquakes. The way to counter potential damage is to reinforce structures.For power lines and potential electric wires that might fall and cause damage, reinforce foundations and ceilings with concrete and plywood sheathing respectively to brace your house for falling objects.
Consider removing or cutting down trees that could fall onto the home. Reinforcing your home with concrete for its foundation and plywood sheathing for your ceiling will help protect it, but so will ridding the surrounding area of things that could potentially fall and cause the damage you’re bracing it for.;
, Look at walls, your chimney, foundation, and roof tiles to inspect them for any potential weaknesses. If you find that they have some, make those repairs before disaster strikes to prepare yourself for potential earthquake damage.Use additional plywood sheathing underneath chimneys to reinforce ceilings and prevent bricks and/or mortar from falling through the ceiling.
Fix roof tiles that are loose and anchor heavy roofing material properly on a roof frame to ensure the roof is strongly braced.
Add braces to chimneys to prevent it from falling over. Make sure that they are steel collar braces.

, Earthquakes can potentially shift cripple walls, so bracing them is necessary to support the floor and exterior walls of the home.Add 2x4 boards between vertical studs at the top and bottom of a cripple wall to brace it securely against the foundation.

, Secure the frame to the foundation by installing anchor bolts through the frame and into the foundation., Sill plates are the horizontal part of the wall that vertical architecture like walls is built on. It acts as a layer between the wall and the house’s foundation. If they aren’t bolted down, an earthquake can make the sill plates shift.Bolts need to be long enough to penetrate through the plate and several inches of foundation every six feet along the exterior walls.
Hire a professional contractor to do this work for you, as it is extensive and must be done correctly.

, Traditional, rectangular window frames are more susceptible to having their corners cracked and chipped as a result of pressure from the earthquake shifting the frames. Windows can be preserved if you round out the corners instead of using the default angled corners most windows come with., Secure wall hangings, bookshelves, computers, and entertainment centers with flexible fasteners. Have your refrigerator and your hot water heated bolted down to prevent gas lines from breaking if the quake causes them to fall over."

Inspect the home for any apparent structural damage.,
Clean up spills from drugs, medicines, and other potentially dangerous materials immediately.,
Check your utilities and turn off any damaged utilities.Gas is harder to turn off.",How to Protect Your Home During an Earthquake2," If there are any structures that look unsafe, evacuate the home. If there is just a lot of debris and shifted furniture, make sure you are wearing shoes as you look around and assess the damage the earthquake has done.Watch out for any downed wires. Do not touch wires or objects that risk potential harm.

, However, be careful of cleaning up chemical spillage because mixing the wrong chemicals might have adverse effects. If you are unsure about whether or not it’s safe to clean up, open windows or a door to provide ventilation., Take two bricks and crank the lever 90 degrees to the left. That turns it off. For electricity, just flip the main switch on the breaker box off. That turns all the electricity in your house off.


Once you are sure there are no fires in your house turn the water off.
Plug all water sources. Water pipes may become damaged and water might come out your drains and flood your house.
Call the fire department or electric company to have your utilities turned back on once a thorough inspection has been conducted.

Create an emergency plan.,
Put together an emergency supply kit.,
Know how to shut off your home’s utilities in case of an emergency.,
Review your homeowner’s insurance policy periodically.",How to Protect Your Home During an Earthquake3," An emergency plan covers what to do in the case of an earthquake and lets you be aware of which areas of your home are dangerous and which areas you should stay away from. Make sure that every member of your household knows the emergency plan in the case of an evacuation route., Keep it somewhere safe and easily accessible. Ideally, an emergency kit should include enough essentials that could last at least 72 hours. Within the supply kit, some of the basics include one gallon of water per person per day, non-perishable food items, a NOAA Weather radio, a battery-powered radio, a first aid kit, flashlight, extra batteries, etc., Knowing where to go to cut off the water main, gas, and electric is important, especially if a leak occurs due to damage from an earthquake. Every household member needs to know how to turn off the utilities to protect the home and the people in it., You want to be sure that in the case of an earthquake disaster striking, you have the exact coverage you need to rebuild and/or add repairs to your home if damage incurs.If you live an area that is prone to earthquakes, consider purchasing earthquake insurance.

Watch for reports of ""earthquake lights."",
Observe unusual changes in animal behavior.,
Notice possible foreshocks (smaller earthquakes that lead up to the ""main"" earthquake).",How to Know Naturally when an Earthquake Will Strike1," Days, or mere seconds, before an earthquake, people have observed strange lights from the ground or hovering in the air.Though they are not fully understood, earthquake lights may be emitted from rocks that are under extreme stress.Earthquake lights have not been reported before all earthquakes, nor has the timing been consistent, but if you hear about strange lights or talk of UFOs in your area, you may want to go over your earthquake preparedness plan and make sure your emergency survival kit is stocked.Earthquake lights have been observed as short, blue flames coming up from the ground, as orbs of light that float in the air, or as huge forks of light that look like lightening shooting up from the ground.;
, There are reports of animals, from toadsto bees to birds and bears, abandoning their homes or breeding grounds just before an earthquake. It is not understood why animals may sense an oncoming event, possibly because of changes in the electric field or feeling smaller tremors that humans can't sense, but noticing strange behavior in your pet may give you a heads up that something is about to happen.Chickens may stop laying eggs before an earthquake. If you notice your hens stop laying eggs for no reason, make sure you and your family know what to do in case of an earthquake.
Catfish respond violently to changes in electric fields, which may occur before an earthquake. If you are fishing and see a ton of catfish suddenly thrashing around, it is possible an earthquake is on the way. Look around for a safe place away from trees or bridges that might fall on you.Dogs, cats, and other animals can feel an earthquake seconds before it can be detected by humans. If your pet begins acting nervous and erratic, becomes frightened of seemingly nothing and runs to hide, or if your normally calm dog begins to bite and bark, you may want to look around for a place to take cover.Dogs will also howl a lot and loud if there is an earthquake., Though foreshocks may not always occur before an earthquake, and it is impossible to tell which earthquake is the main quake until after the fact, earthquakes tend to happen in clusters.If you experience one or more small earthquakes, there may be another, bigger earthquake on the way.Because it is impossible to predict how long an earthquake will last or its magnitude, when you feel the ground begin to roll, take the appropriate actions to protect yourself from falling debris, depending on where you are (indoors, outdoors, in your car).

"
Gather kindling and tinder for your fire.,
Place your tinder in the designated spot for the fire.,
Shave magnesium from your fire starter onto the pile of tinder.",How to Use an Emergency Fire Starter1," Examples of items you can collect are twigs, dead branches, dry bark or grass, pine needles, pocket lint, and paper.;
, When you use the emergency fire starter, the sparks you create must be able to ignite your pile of tinder.

, The magnesium shavings are the elements that will be used to light your pile of tinder and kindling on fire.


Hold the block of magnesium tilted at an angle above your tinder pile, then use a knife or metal blade to scrape along the length of the magnesium block to create small shavings.
Allow the shavings to fall directly onto the pile of tinder, and continue scraping off shavings until you have created a pile that equals the approximate size of a United States quarter.

"
"
Investigate the seismic cycle of any faults in your area.,
Sign up for a wireless emergency alert system.,
Check an earthquake tracking website.",How to Know Naturally when an Earthquake Will Strike2," Though there is no way to pinpoint the exact arrival of an earthquake, scientists can examine sediment samples to get an idea of when major earthquakes occurred in the past. By measuring the amount of time between events, they can come up with a rough idea of when a major quake might hit.Cycles can stretch for hundreds of years--it may be 600 years (or more or less) between major earthquakes along a fault--but there's no way to truly know if or when the next big quake will occur.If the nearest fault line still has 250+ years in its cycle before another big earthquake, allow that to give you some solace. But do remember that there are no hard and fast rules for predicting earthquakes, so you should have an emergency kit prepared just in case., Right now Japan is the only country with a functioning early alarm system for earthquakes (other countries, including the US, are working on developing their own systems). Even with systems in place, they can only provide tens of seconds of advance warning before an earthquake.There are, however, services that will send you text messages alerting you of natural disaster occurrences or warnings in your area, including earthquakes.These alert messages can provide you with instructions in an emergency, including evacuation routes and available emergency shelters.Your city may have a warning system in place, such a sirens followed by a warning or instructions. Make sure you know if your town or city has such a warning system., Not sure if that rumbling you felt was a big truck outside, or construction, or even just a weird dream? You can verify earthquakes online with tracking websites, which will show you where and when any earthquakes were recorded and the magnitude of each quake."
"
Assemble a survival kit for your home and car.,
Secure large, heavy, or tall furniture by bolting it to the wall.,
Practice ""drop, cover, and hold on."",
Make sure your family has a communication plan.",How to Know Naturally when an Earthquake Will Strike3," If there is an earthquake, you may lose power and cell service, access to clean water, food, and medication. Putting together a survival kit will ensure your family has their basic needs covered should anything happen.For your home, try to have enough supplies for up to 2 weeks. This means 1 gallon of water per person for each day, non-perishable foods (and a can opener if they are in cans), medications for each day, bottles and diapers for babies, and hygiene products.Vehicle survival kits should include maps, jumper cables, enough water for at least 3 days (1 gallon per person), non-perishable foods, blankets, flashlights.Don't forget your pets! Make sure you have water, food, bowls, medication, a leash and collar or carrier for your furry friends.Check out a more extensive list of items on the Red Cross website or .

, One of the biggest dangers of an earthquake is unstable buildings and the things inside the buildings that can fall and crush you.Anchoring heavy furniture to the wall will make your home much safer if there is an earthquake.


Bookshelves, wardrobes, armoires, hutches, and china cabinets are all examples of furniture that should be bolted to the wall.Mirrors and flat screen TVs should also be secured to the wall so that they can't fall off and shatter. Don't hang them over couches or beds., Contrary to popular belief, a door frame is not the safest place to be in an earthquake. You want to drop to your knees so the quake doesn't knock you over. Cover the back of your head and neck with your arms. Or, if you can safely crawl under a solid table or desk, do so and then hold on to one of the legs so you move along with it.You may only have a few seconds to act, and practicing will allow you to react faster.If there is no cover, try to get to an inside corner of the room and get low to the ground.If you are outdoors, try to get to an open area away from buildings, live wires, and other things that might fall on you, and drop, cover, and hold on.If you are in a city, it may be safer to go inside and find cover.If you are in a vehicle, get out from under any bridges or overpasses. Stay in the car and come to a stop as soon as possible, avoiding buildings, trees, or wires that might fall on your car., Agree upon where you will meet if there is an emergency. Learn important phone numbers (like your parents work and cell phone numbers).Choose a person who lives in another town or state as a contact. It is sometimes easier to reach someone who is not in the disaster area. If you are separated from your family, this person can relay your location and that you are safe."
"
Ignite the fire using the flint portion of your emergency fire starter.,
Maintain the fire.",How to Use an Emergency Fire Starter2," Depending on the manufacturer of your emergency fire starter, the flint may be on one side of the magnesium block or reside on its own separate block.


Hold the flint block at a tilted angle over the pile of magnesium shavings, then slide your knife or blade forcefully along the length of the flint to create sparks.
Continue to strike your blade against the flint until the sparks you have created have landed directly onto the pile of magnesium shavings and tinder, and have ignited the fire.

, After the sparks have caused the magnesium to ignite, you must ensure that the fire continues to burn steadily.


Blow gently on the shavings of magnesium after they have ignited to spread the flames to the rest of your tinder and kindling.
Place additional kindling on top of your flames to fuel the fire and ensure that it continues to burn.

Make an earthquake emergency plan for all members of your family.,
Make sure every family member has the name and phone number or e-mail address of an out-of-area contact memorized.,
Make a list of all the emergency supply items you need for one week of sitting it out should utilities go down and roads become unusable.,
Rehearse the actions to take when a quake hits.,
Know some of the basics of staying safe during an earthquake.,
Practice using battery-operated equipment.,
Make your home as earthquake-safe as possible.,
Learn how to turn off your home's gas and water valves quickly in an emergency.,
Hire a professional to verify whether your home is secured to its foundation.,
Assemble an earthquake preparedness kit.,
As well as home supplies, make a ""go bag"" in case you and your family has no choice but to leave.",How to Prepare Your Family for an Earthquake," This includes:


Picking a safe place to take refuge at home, school and work. Keep in mind that during an earthquake you'll have only seconds to get into a safe place, such as underneath sturdy furniture or against an interior wall, away from windows and unsecured furniture that could fall on you.
Knowing what to do if you're not all together, including having communication methods and central meeting points. Identify a single meeting place for all family members to reunite, when possible, after an earthquake.
Mapping escape routes to and from your home. This means making escape route plans for leaving work/school/other regularly visited places to your home and plans for leaving your home. Be aware of alternative routes and be aware that if the electricity and internet connections are down, you need paper maps and road guides. Keep the escape plans in your ""go bag"" or in a safe place at work/school, etc.
Deciding who can help you if you need to leave the city or town for a while. Which family members or friends interstate or across the region might put you and your family up for a while if things are bad enough that you have to leave? Ask them in advance if they are prepared to be your refuge in such a situation and reassure them that you will cover costs, etc.;
, You can all use this contact to check in and make it known that you're safe, even if local lines of communication aren't working.


Let all family members know that telephone lines tend to be overwhelmed after a natural disaster, as everyone tries to contact their loved ones. Prefer texting over calling, as it uses a lot less power and is more likely to get through to people. Let family members know that there may be a substantial amount of time when communications are impossible and that it is important to follow the plans and neither panic nor assume the worst. If your family knows the plan well, there is less need for worry.

, Once the list is made, shop for the supplies and set them aside in storage areas of your home. You will also need a ""go bag"" in case your house becomes uninhabitable as a result of the quake. A suggested list is provided below.

, Every family member old enough to follow instructions should know what to do when a quake happens. The more you rehearse the actions, the more natural the self-protection reaction will be when the quake occurs and everyone will be less likely to panic.


Practice the ""drop, cover, hold"" drill in each selected safe place.
Hunker down beneath the sturdy furniture or against the interior wall, cover your neck and head, and hold on.
Make it a habit to hold quake drills once a month if you live in a quake-prone area. Make it fun, such as combining quake-drill night with takeout food or a movie together afterward. By making it a family affair and associating the rehearsal with positive things, being quake-safe becomes a fact of your everyday life, not something to be afraid of. Prepared people stay alive.

, Make sure that every family member is aware of the following:


If you're outside, get away from power lines, buildings, street lights and anything else that might fall on you. Be aware that glass windows shatter and can rain shards down onto the street, so buildings with large glass expanses are not safe to be under during a quake.
If you're inside, do not try to run outside. If you do, you risk being hit by falling debris from awnings, glass shards, bricks, scaffolding, cement decorations forced off buildings, etc.

, Show family members how to use radios, cooking equipment, flashlights, etc. that are powered by electricity or other contained energy sources. Have a few practice runs; you could even have an entire night of camping in your home to see how it goes.


Never cook indoors with fuel stoves or barbecues. Carbon monoxide is one of the by-products of burning fuels; it is odorless and colorless and it kills quickly. Always keep cooking gear outdoors and make sure every family member is aware of this need. Tell children that if they cannot operate the cooking gear safely should you not be there to help them during any emergency, that they should eat only cold food from cans, dried packages and (within 12 hours) things from the refrigerator.

, Make the following modifications, recommended by the American Red Cross and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):


Bolt or brace water heaters, gas appliances, bookcases, china cabinets and other tall furniture to wall studs, so they're less likely to fall over.
Hang pictures and other objects away from the bed, where they're less likely to fall on you during a night-time earthquake.
Anchor or brace overhead fixtures such as lights and ceiling fans.
Store heavy, breakable items on low shelves or in cabinets that lock shut, so there's less chance of them falling on you.

, If your kids are old enough, teach them how to do this as well. Every person old enough in the family should be able to do this.


Make sure that all family members are aware that they are not to turn utilities back on until given the all-clear by the utility or emergency authorities that it is safe to do so.

, If it's not secured, your home is at additional risk during an earthquake.

, It should include basics such as:


A gallon of water, per person, per day. The United States Geological Survey recommends storing enough water for 2 weeks
A water filter or purification tablets for purifying water
A camp stove for cooking without electrical or gas power
One week's worth of shelf-stable food for all family members, including pets. Remember to address any special dietary needs, such as diabetes or food allergies. The best food sorts are canned, dried (pasta, cookies, beans, etc.) and dehydrated foods (always add water to dehydrated food or you risk bloating internally and suffering injury)
Mechanical can opener
Portable crank radio, or radio with extra batteries
Crank flashlight, or flashlight with extra batteries
Any medications or personal hygiene supplies necessary for every member of your family. Keep each person's hygiene supplies/medication sealed in a large zip-close bag with their name on it, and check medication expiration dates at least every 6 months
Toilet paper. Other useful sanitary items include wet wipes, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and waterproof plastic bags; sawdust/kitty litter etc. can be used for keeping toileting sanitary (use a bin with liners and bury if possible)
A fire extinguisher, and any necessary tools to shut off the gas and water lines to your home
An emergency blanket and extra layers of clothing, including a waterproof poncho or pants and jacket
Food, water and medication for your pets
Shovel for digging (toilet waste, trenches for disposal of garbage, food gathering, etc.)
Whistle for location
Sewing kit for emergency stitches
Pet crate, leashes, pet medication, etc.

, The items in this bag will be similar to above except that you cannot carry anywhere near as much and will need to take portable versions of many things. If you're able to take your car, you will be able to carry more supplies than if only going by foot.

Learn how to use the main features.,
Use the large blade.,
Unfold the small blade.,
Use the corkscrew.,
Open cans with the can opener.,
Identify the bottle opener.,
Find the reamer.,
Use the key ring.,
Pull the tweezers and toothpick from the end of the knife handle.",How to Use a Swiss Army Knife1," There is a wide variety of possible functions, but many of these are limited to expensive special-use knives. If you're using a simple, standard Swiss Army knife, then you'll probably only be working with 4-10 basic tools. Most Swiss Army knives include some combination of the following:


Large blade and small blade
Corkscrew
Can opener with 3 mm flat-head screwdriver
Bottle opener with 6 mm screwdriver, plus wire stripper and bender
Reamer and hole punchKey ring
Tweezers
Toothpick;
, This is the basic component of the Swiss Army knife. This blade is usually about as long and thick as the knife handle. Use it for almost anything that requires a knife. Be sure to exercise knife safety: always cut the knife away from your body, and be very careful not to let the blade snap shut with your fingers in the way.


Cut your food, or gut a fish, or slice paper. Carve your initials into a tree or whittle a piece of wood into another shape. Cut anything that needs to be cut.

, Your knife may or may not include a small blade. It usually holds the same shape as the large blade, only slightly smaller. Use it in situations that call for a more delicate touch.

, Some Swiss Army knives include a metal corkscrew for opening wine bottles.Fold the corkscrew out so that it extends straight out from the knife – as though the knife body is the handle. Use the knife-handle to twist the corkscrew into the cork, and pull firmly on the handle to remove the cork from the bottle.Be sure to remove the mini screwdriver first, if your knife includes this feature. Not all Swiss Army knives come with a mini screwdriver.

, This is not your modern twist-cut can opener: it is an old-school manual can opener. Put the lip of the can into the cap of the can opener, then press the sharp bit into the lid of the can until it punctures through. The tip of the can opener also functions as a 3 mm flat-head screwdriver!You can also use the tip of the can opener on Phillips-head screws, if you angle it to use the point instead of the flat breadth.

, Use this to open bottles of your drink of choice. The flat tip of the bottle opener also functions as a 6 mm flat-head screwdriver. Use it when you need something larger than the 3 mm can opener screwdriver.


Look for the wire stripper and bender. It is a small notch on the bottom of the bottle opener tool., This tool is also known as an awl. Use it for punching holes in materials like leather or canvas, and for drilling (or reaming) holes into sturdier materials like wood.The tool is intentionally tapered so that you can enlarge a hole by digging deeper and scraping the sides with the sharp edge.

, Find this hanging from the outside of your knife. You can use this to clip the knife to your key-chain, your belt loop, or another handy location. You can also attach other useful tools or survival necessities to the Swiss Army knife to keep them in the same place.

, The end of the tweezers usually looks like a small knob of grey plastic, while the end of the toothpick is a small knob of tan plastic. Make sure to wash the tweezers and toothpick after each use!

"
"
Keep the tools dry.,
Oil the blade regularly.,
Sharpen the blades.",How to Use a Swiss Army Knife2," Swiss Army Knives are made of stainless steel, which is much more water-resistant than regular steel.However, if you get them wet, it's still best to dry them relatively quickly. If you get your knife wet: dry off every tool and the base as fast as you can. Dry it by hand, and then let it sit out to dry more thoroughly. Let it sit open for 10-30 minutes., Place a dollop of lubricating multitool oil on the blade joint when the blade is starting to stiffen. Your manual will tell you how to oil and repair it., The sharpening technique will differ slightly for straight blades and serrated blades. Use the ""straight cut"" method for the standard Swiss Army knife.Straight cut: Sharpen your blade using a whetstone at an angle of 15-20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30-40°. If you are sharpening on a grinding wheel, make sure to cool the metal with plenty of water. This might help avoid high temperatures and damage to the blade.
Serrated cut: Hone the blade with a sharpening stone. Pull it across the flat side of the serrated cut at an angle of 15-20°.

"
"
Identify which features you have.,
Use a small Victorinox pocket knife.,
Navigate a full-fledged Swiss Army knife.,
Unfold a lock blade knife.",How to Use a Swiss Army Knife3," There are many models of Swiss Army knife, each with a unique set of included features. Each knife is designed for a certain type of user, from the casual urban bottle-opener to the serious survivalist. Knives fall into a few main categories: pocket knives, Swiss Army knives, and lock blade knives.


Some models include: classic, tinker, super tinker, angler, camper, huntsman, handyman, mechanic boy, rescue tool, and Swiss champ. They come in categories like everyday, sports and leisure, DIY, LED lights, outdoor, executive, gardening, multitool lights, and scouting.
Read the manual. If you've just bought your Swiss Army knife, be sure to read about the tools that come with your particular knife model. Read about the repairs, maintenance, and correct functions of the tool.

, These knives are usually smaller than the standard model, and they contain fewer features. A pocket knife may contain all or some of the following tools:


Find the large blade, the nail file (with nail cleaner,) the scissors, and the key ring. Pull tweezers and a plastic toothpick from the end of the knife handle.
Find the nail file, the end of which is a flat-head screwdriver. Look for a bottle opener with attached nail file. Unfold the Phillips screwdriver, and look for the wire stripper.
Some pocket knives even feature a bright LED, a ballpoint pen, and a USB drive., This is the knife type with the most potential features. Some Swiss Army knifes come with as few as four tools, while others are packed with up to 38 unique functions. The standard model may contain all or some of the following tools:


Find the large blade and the small blade, the corkscrew, the key-ring, and the can opener. Pull tweezers and a toothpick from the end of the knife handle. Some knives include more delicate tools like a scissors, a magnifying glass, a sewing eye, a stainless steel pin, and a pressurized ballpoint pen.
Check for a bottle opener with screwdriver and wire stripper. Look for the nail file with metal file and nail cleaner. Find the pliers, which usually include wire cutters and a wire crimping tool. Look for a paper reamer and hole punch.
Look for the small flat-head screwdriver at the tip of the can opener. Check if your knife has a 2.5 mm screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver, and/or a mini-screwdriver.
Some models even feature a wood saw, a metal saw, a multi-purpose hook, or a fish scaler with ruler and hook disgorger. Find the chisel and scraper. Look for a wrench with a 5 mm or 4 mm hex drive.

, This tool is larger than the standard Swiss Army knife, and the handle is curved for better grip. Use the lock blade for more serious cutting: it locks into place such that you must disengage the safety to close it. A standard pocket knife will still fold back into the handle when you apply force to the dull side of the blade. A lock blade knife may include the following features:


Open the large lock blade and feel how it sticks in place when fully unfolded. Look for a curved lock blade for one-hand opening, which features a 2/3 wavy cut. Find the wood saw, the metal saw (with metal file), and the scissors. Pull the tweezers and toothpick from the end of the handle.
Find a 1-2 inch Phillips screwdriver, a long, small Phillips screwdriver, or a mini-screwdriver. Identify the corkscrew, the can opener (the end of which is a flat-head screwdriver), and the bottle opener (which also acts as a screwdriver and wire stripper.) Find the pliers, with wire cutters and wire crimping tool included.
Look for the emergency features. Lock blade knives often include a window breaker, a seatbelt cutter, a nylon cord, and a saw for shatterproof glass.

, If the label is lifting off, use a transparent tape to secure it.

, Purchase only the amount necessary to complete your current job. You may find it better to discard leftover product rather than storing it. Just make sure you follow the proper process for disposing of hazardous materials.

,


Look for problems inside each storage area on a regular basis. Be sure there are no apparent fumes.
Inspect all hazardous material containers. Make sure you can clearly see each label. The containers should be free of rust, bulges, dents or leaks.
Use a separate broom and dustpan for chemical cleanup. Be sure to lock these tools away when you are not using them.

Find a trash bag.,

Use your hands, a knife, or scissors to create a hole in the center middle seam for your head.
,

Poke your head through to see if you did it right.,

Withdraw your head, and make two arm holes on either side of the bottom seam.
,

You can wear this poncho either with your head completely through the hole, or with it just around your face to protect your head.
",How to Make a Trash Bag Poncho," Preferably, a large thick one. It should be enough to cover your torso

Clean the bottle.,
Check if the water, that you want is not turbid.,
Fill the bottle with water, until it is 75% full.,
Put the bottle in the sunlight.,
Wait.",How to Sterilize Water With Sunlight," Remove anything in the bottle like dirt and on the bottle like a label. This method works with PET bottles (the clear/uncolored plastic bottles often used for mineral water or soft drinks and soda) and certain kinds of glass bottles.The use of PET bottles for this process has been researched and found to be safe when used correctly.Because not all types of glass allow for the transmission of UV rays, PET is often recommended over glass, especially since plastic bottles are also less breakable and cheaper.;
, If it is turbid, you have to filter it.

,


Put the cap on the bottle.
Shake the bottle 25 times. By shaking the bottle you add more oxygen to the water. This will also improve the water's flavour.
Fill the bottle until it is full.
Put the cap on the bottle.

, A good place is a reflective surface. The sun beams contain UV-A rays that can pass through the bottle and kill most germs in the water. The oxygen helps to amplify this process.

, The amount of time you have to wait depends on the weather.


If there are only little clouds in the sky, it takes 6 hours.
If there are about 50% or more clouds, you have to expose the bottles for 2 days to the sunlight.
If it is raining all time, this method doesn't work. Collect rainwater instead.

Know the difference between gas and particle contamination.,
Cut the bottom off of a transparent 2-liter soda bottle.,
Cut a U-shaped opening for your head.,
Create a protective seal around your face with rubber foam.,
Remove the elastic bands from your hospital mask.,
Staple the elastic bands to your mask.,
Push the hospital mask into the bottom to the bottle.,
Wear your new gas mask.,
Attach a homemade air filtration system to your mask to protect from some gases.,
Cut off the top of a 1-liter bottle.,
Fill the bottom of the bottle with 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm) of activated charcoal.,
Cut the bottom off another 1-liter bottle.,
Fill the top of the bottle with 3-4 inches of pillow stuffing.,
Poke 6-7 holes in the charcoal end of your filter when you’re ready to use it.,
Use a rubber hose to connect the bottom of your air mask to your filter.,
Replace your activated charcoal with each use.,
Cover your nose and mouth with a t-shirt if you have no other protection.,
Call poison control immediately.,
Move immediately to fresh air.,
Turn unconscious victims on their side with their face down.",How to Make a Gas Mask," Tear gas is actually a dust that is sprayed into the air, whereas biological weapons are generally gases. While it is incredibly difficult and expensive to completely protect yourself against gases, you can easily create a barrier against particles at home.


Toxic ash from volcanoes, tear gas, and dust are all particle contaminates.;
, Using a razor blade, cut the bottom inch off of a large bottle and discard the bottom.

, Use a marker to draw a “U” across the front of the bottle, cap side down. This needs to fit snuggly across your face, stopping roughly at your temple and below your chin. Make sure you leave 5-6 inches between the bottom of your cup and your chin. Cut along your outline with your razor blade.


Start smaller than you think you need – you can always cut more away later.
The bottle should fit snuggly across your face, as this prevent gas from getting into your eyes., Glue 1 inch of rubber form insulation around the edges of your gas mask to create a seal. This will keep contaminated air away from your eyes and nose. Take your time with this step, trying on your mask multiple times to make sure it sits snugly across your face.


You can purchase rubber foam online or at large hardware stores.
If you can’t get your hands on rubber foam, use several layers of tape around the edges, or strips of fabric from an old t-shirt.

, Cut them near the bottom, as you will need them later to attach the mask to your face.

, Attach the elastic bands near eye level so you can securely keep the mask on your face without your hands.

, This is your filtration device. Place the hospital mask, preferably an N95 particulate mask (available online or at a nearby health supply store), at the bottom of your gas mask.


Seal the edge of the mask to the bottle with glue to prevent air from bypassing the mask.

, Attach it to your face, making sure there are no holes in the insulation that would allow contaminated air to your face. Make sure the bottle cap is off, and breath in the clean air.

, While this system is not as powerful as a military-grade air mask, it can successfully filter out some toxins as well as all particle-based contaminates like tear gas.

, Use a razor blade to slice off the top of the bottle, leaving an open cylinder. You can use any type of plastic bottle, but a 2-liter bottle will usually be big and unwieldy.

, Activated charcoal absorbs fumes and gasses from the air, providing an effective barrier against gases. While not perfect, charcoal can filter out chlorine and carbon-based chemicals.

, This should be the same size bottle as before. Slice 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) from the bottom, leaving as much of the top as you can.


Leave the cap on.

, This will remove any physical contaminants, like dust, ash, or tear gas, from your air. You can also use strips of old t-shirts, socks, or cotton balls.


Slide the bottles together and tape them shut. If you used the same sized bottles you can slide one into the other, creating a seal. Tape the bottles together so they stay shut. This is your air filter!

, Using a razor blade, cut holes in the bottom of the filter to allow air in.


Activated charcoal will absorb moisture from the air if left uncovered, making it useless, so only cut the holes when you need the filter.

, The easiest way to connect your filter to your gas mask is with an old vacuum hose. Clean it with soap and water and then attach it with duct tape around the ends of your filter and gas mask.


Because the charcoal could absorb the moisture from the air, becoming useless, only remove the cap from your filter when you need it., Activated charcoal absorbs chemicals and moisture, so it is useless after it has filled up. After every use or prolonged exposure to air you need to replace it with new charcoal.

, A t-shirt can actually protect you from large particles, like dust or tear gas, though not perfectly. Try to create as perfect a seal as possible using both hands to keep the shirt over your nose and mouth.Bandanas, towels, and blankets will provide similar protection in an emergency.
A simple piece of fabric can save your life against ash and dust from a volcanic explosion.

, WIKI LINK If you or someone you know feels light-headed, nauseous, or experiences seizures or loss of consciousness after inhaling a chemical, make a note of the chemical and call poison control immediately.


In America, poison control can be reached at the number 999.

, If the victim is able to move, get them to fresh clean air as soon as possible. Stay away from the source of the chemicals.

, This is called the “recovery position.” Roll unconscious people on their sides, using their upper leg to brace them. Make sure their mouth faces down so that they can easily expel anything that comes up. Wait for emergency services and follow their directions.

Burn crayons as candles.,
Make a candle from petroleum jelly.,
Create an oil lamp.,
Make your own wick.,
Identify other flammable materials.,
Make a torch.,
Improvise a battery.,
Build your own simple generator.,
Ignite steel wool.",How to Create Cheap Light During a Power Cut1," Most crayons make fairly good candles, if you leave the paper wrapping on as a wick. A typical crayon burns for about half an hour.


It may help to break the tip off the candle before lighting it.;
, Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) burns easily and for a long time. The most efficient way to use it is to rub it onto cotton balls or other flammable materials, placing them on aluminum foil or another fireproof material. For a long-term light source, light a candle or homemade wick stuck in a small container of petroleum jelly.

, Pour vegetable oil into a container. Drop a cotton string into the oil to use as a wick. Light the tip of the string and add a new string each time the old one burns out.


If you do not have any cooking oil, look for goods packed in oil, such as canned fish. Pour out the oil into a fireproof container.

, If you do not have a cotton string, search for any long, thin, flammable material you can use instead. Here are two options using household materials:


Rub a cotton ball between your palms to make a long strand.
Peel half of an orange and remove the fruit. You should be left with the white central ""stem"" attached to the bottom half of the peel. Pour oil into the ""bowl"" of the peel and light the stem to make a candle.

, Soak a cotton string or homemade wick with animal fat or alcohol to make a candle, or stick the string in a stick of butter. If none of these are available, you can even burn fat- or oil-rich foods such as Brazil nuts.


For a candle that can burn for weeks, stick a string in a can of shortening (Crisco).
In indoor areas with poor ventilation, stick to candle-sized fires only. Large fires in enclosed spaces can cause death by carbon monoxide poisoning.

, Wrap a rag around the tip of a sturdy stick or metal rod and cover it with gauze or wire mesh. Dip the tip in vegetable oil and light it for a long-lasting light source.

, You can make your own low-powered battery with two types of metal and any acid. Read this article for more detailed instructions. This is usually enough to power an LED light, connected to both ends of the battery.


You can even make a battery out of a potato or lemon. Link several of these organic batteries in a series to increase the power.

, If you have a magnet and a length of wire, you can create your own hand-cranked generator. While not the easiest solution, it does give you something to do while your electronics are off!

, Place clean steel wool in a heatproof bowl. Rub the terminals of a charged battery against the wool to ignite it. Blow gently on the wool if necessary to help it along. This won't burn for long, so it's mainly useful to light other items if you're out of matches.


The wool and bowl reach very high temperatures.Take care not to burn your fingers, and do not touch the bowl for at least ten minutes.

Work in a fireproof, ventilated area.,
Lay down tinder.,
Add longer-burning material.,
Build up the fire.,
Light the tinder.",How to Create Cheap Light During a Power Cut2," If you don't have a fireplace or wood stove, build your fire in a metal campfire bowl, or clear an outdoor area of all flammable materials. Always build a fire in a well-ventilated area, to avoid the risk of lethal carbon monoxide buildup.

, Begin with an easy-catching, quick-burning material such as balls of paper, cotton wool, or dried leaves.

, Use longer-burning materials for the next layer of tinder, such as strips of cardboard or bark. These will catch easily but provide more heat than your first layer.

, Add increasingly large sticks or other flammable items, spacing them out to get oxygen to the fire. Finish with a log or two if available.

, If you do not have a source of flame, learn about other ways to start your fire. You may need to light the tinder several times in order to get the larger materials to light.

Get a hand-cranked flashlight.,
Buy a camping lantern.,
Light outdoor areas with solar lights.,
Consider purchasing a generator.",How to Create Cheap Light During a Power Cut3," Any flashlight will come in handy, but a hand-cranked one will never run out of power. Many of them also include a radio for emergency situations.

, If you plan to light the lantern indoors, check the safety information to make sure you have adequate ventilation. Propane and white gas lanterns are particularly dangerous indoors, due to high levels of carbon monoxide. Lanterns powered by kerosene, vegetable oil, and especially alcohol are generally safer, but still require ventilation., Illuminate outdoor walkways with solar-powered lights from a garden store.

, If power cuts happen frequently in your location, be prepared with a generator powered by diesel or petrol. Although not the cheapest option, this can save you effort, and allow you to power appliances as well as lights.

",How to Grow Mint in an Apartment," You can use a pot or a box.;
, The soil should be good quality soil suited for indoor plant growing.

, You could use mint seeds or mint buds from a mint plant. Mint is very easily grown., Leave a half inch of the pot free of soil.

,, Place a saucer or dish under the container, to capture excess water and prevent it from staining any surfaces in your apartment.

, Increase the dosage of water as the plant grows. Water twice if necessary.

, Mint grows well with a lot of sunlight.

Fertilize lightly during active growing season which is April through September.,
Prune damaged fronds to make the plant appear healthier and to promote plant growth.,
Know how to combat pests.,
Divide and re-pot a fern in the spring.,
Start new ferns from seed.",How to Grow Fern Indoors," Most ferns thrive in an environment that is consistently 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius).;
, A plastic pot retains moisture better than a clay pot will.

, Ferns are found among the greens on a forest floor. The soil there is usually laden with decaying leaves and organic matter. When potting your indoor fern, plant it in soil that has a high organic matter content like a good peat moss mix.

,


Ferns prefer indirect light. Daylight coming through a window is adequate. Place the plant in a north or east facing window. The fern may not grow so well in a south or west window, as the light is more intense and can be too harsh for the fronds. Too much light dries the plant out.
Ferns can grow in low-light conditions, but they can not grow in no-light conditions. Ferns that are not getting enough light will have retarded growth and poor color. If your fern is not getting enough light from a nearby window, set up an incandescent light above the plant to shine on it 4 to 6 hours each day.

,


Touch the surface of the soil in the pot. Water a fern when the top of the soil is dry to the touch.
Water a fern until the water starts to run out the holes in the bottom of the pot. You can sit the pot in a sink or bathtub so the excess water can go down the drain.
Do not use softened or treated water to water your fern. This mineral rich water leaves deposits in the soil, eventually causing the roots to rot.
Alter your watering schedule based on the rooms temperature. If the room is warmer than 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), you will need to water more often. If the room is cooler, wait to water until the soil feels dry when you touch it.
Know the indicators of inappropriate watering. If the plant has too much water, the fronds turn yellow. Wilted fronds indicate too little water.

, The humidity around a fern is just as important to the plant as the amount of water at the roots. Ferns like humidity, so the closer you can duplicate the humidity around a steamy, wet forest floor, the happier your fern will be. Fronds turn brown at the ends when humidity is too low.


Create ample space around the plant for air to circulate and allow even distribution of humidity to the foliage.
Put your fern in the bathroom. This tends to be the most humid room in a house.
Set up a humidifier in the same room as the fern.
Place a tray of water near or under the fern. If you place the tray under the pot, make sure the pot does not touch the water. Ensure this by placing decorative rocks in the water to prop the pot on. The water in the tray evaporates, increasing the humidity in the air around the plant.
Spray the fronds of the fern periodically. Use a spray bottle filled with room temperature water to mist the fronds. This not only adds humidity around the plant but also helps keep the leaves of the plant clean and deters pests.

, Fish emulsion makes a good fertilizer. Apply half the amount of fertilizer called for to make a sparse fertilizer solution. Fertilizing too richly can scorch the fronds.

, This can be as extensive as taking out entire fronds near the plant's core or as simple as snipping dead or damages leaves from the ends of the fronds.

, Potential pests are spider mites, scales and mealybugs. Hand pick them from the plant if they appear. You can also spray a direct stream of water on them from a spray bottle.

, This places the fern in a position to spread during the ferns natural active growing season.


Remove the plant from the pot and divide into the desired size at the roots.
Wait 4 to 6 months or until there is noticeable growth to fertilize newly potted ferns.

, This is an optional part of growing ferns. This task is the most labor intensive part for a fern grower and is best reserved for the patient indoor gardener.


Propagate ferns in summer when the conditions are ideal for plant growth.
Collect spores from the plant. During the spring and summer, spots will develop on the bottom of the leaves. These are called spores. When the spores darken, remove the leaf and place it in a paper bag. As the leaf dries, the spores will fall off into the bottom of the bag.
Plant the seeds that fell to the bottom of the bag in peat moss starter soil in small containers. Water them generously.
Place the containers inside a clear plastic bag, and seal the plastic. Keep the temperature between 65 to 70 degrees F (18 to 21 degrees Celsius).
When the small ferns are 1 inch (2.54 cm) tall, transplant them into bigger pots.
At 2 (5 cm) inches tall, transplant the baby ferns into individual pots.

Clean drinking water. The most import part of your survival, store 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water for each person per day. Keep it in Jerry cans or water jugs and write ""Drinking Water"" on the side of these containers with a permanent marker. Add four drops of Clorox per gallon to keep the water good for years.






Food. Military-style MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat) are an excellent choice.






Complete first-aid kit along with any medications needed.






A survival knife is the most important and useful tool in the kit. Be sure to keep it sharp.






Self defense weapon. Mace spray is a good economic choice, although a Taser or pistol works just as well. Keep in mind that if you choose mace, it does expire and will need to be replaced occasionally.

Watch for the signs of poor soil conditions.",How to Grow Houseplants," A nursery or a dedicated garden store will give you quality plants, and you can pick up knowledge from the experts. You can buy plants at a home improvement stores or grocery stores, but usually they don't directly source their plant products. In other words, they can't vouch for the quality of their plants. Often, they don't offer refunds for plants, so it's a risk.When evaluating a nursery, look for a relatively clean environment. Also, if all the plants are priced low, that could mean they care more about cost than about providing good plants.
You can also buy plants online or via mail order.;
, If you're new to growing plants, start with something that's easy to grow. If you need a desert cactus for a starter plant, that's fine. Just make sure you have an easy plant that you know you can take care of. Some easy-to-care-for houseplants include coleus, sweet flag (Acorus calamus), Aspidistras (cast-iron plants), bromeliad plants, peace lilies, amaryllis, African geraniums, bamboo, Philodendron, spider plants, succulents, cactus, and button ferns.

Just because you see a particular species everywhere doesn't mean it's an easy plant to grow. They may be everywhere because they are easy to reproduce in a greenhouse, but that doesn't mean they are an easy houseplant.
Many plants don't belong in the house. Plants like tulips and hydrangeas need to be planted outside after they bloom, while other plants die after they bloom, such as paperwhite narcissus or Persian violets. Mini roses and Easter lilies just don't thrive well indoors.

, You can choose from two main categories that apply to all houseplants. These categories are divided according to visual differences.


Flowering Plants: The main attraction of these plants is the flowers. In nature almost all plants fruit and flower. However, due to the lack of light and root space in most homes, many plants don't reach maturity and won't flower as a houseplant.

Foliage Plants: These plants are grown for their attractive leaves. They can sometimes produce blooms, but they are not really attractive or worth the effort.

, A good plant should have an attractive shape and fresh-looking leaves without spots or blemishes. Check that the stems have leaves growing from top to bottom with no major gaps. Also, with flowering plants, look for ones with a lot of tight buds and few full blooms; the blooms should be bright and rich in color.New growth is a good sign, though some plants grow slowly, meaning new growth may not be noticeable.
Buy a plant that is the size you want, instead of trying to grow a larger version from a young plant.

, Give the plant a slight tug to make sure the stems are connected to the roots, and the plant is secure in it's pot. If the soil is pulling from the pot edge or it is soggy or dried out, choose another plant. Crowded roots are not a major issue., Sometimes, suppliers will use deceptive tricks to make a plant more attractive. For instance, they may glue a bloom on to a cactus that isn't from that plant. They may even spray plants to make them a prettier color. Not only are these tricks deceptive, but also they can harm the plants. Look the plant over carefully before buying it.

However, plants that are grafted, braided, or in novelty containers are fine.

, Plant dealers will help wrap the plant to help prevent damage. If the plant dealer won't wrap it, figure out a way to protect it from the elements, such as wind, cold, heat, and car fumes. You want to avoid shocking the plant. If the plant is huge and you can't transport it, have it delivered.

Create a barrier between the plant and the environment. When purchasing multiple plants have a partitioned container like a wine box ready. Buckets and storage containers will also work.
Cover the plant with plastic bags or old newspaper, and use skewers inserted in the dirt to prop up the bag. If the bag touches the leaves and flowers, it can damage them.
Cover the container or seal the bag before leaving the area, so you carry a bit of the indoor air with you. Also, don't leave the plant in a hot or cold car/trunk, which could damage the plant.

, Choose a spot that isn't full sun (unless the plant is a succulent, cactus, or a plant with flowers). Also, don't pick a spot that gets extreme temperatures. A sunny room is a good choice, but set the plant out from the window 4 to 5 feet so that it gets indirect light. Leave the plant in this spot to help it adjust. Resist the temptation to move the plant around or to transplant it into a new pot. Let the soil dry out almost completely before giving it its first watering.After being moved around among several different environments, the plant is in a state of semi-shock and needs time to adjust to yet another environment.
Isolate new plants from other plants in the house to prevent the spread of diseases and pests.
Avoid placing a warmth-loving species in the greenhouse or warm room right away, even if it loves the situation. Many florists and garden centers keep plants in lower temperatures, and if you make the plant too warm at first, it can lead to shock.

, Keep observing the plant and give it help if needed. Many plants will either wilt or drop flowers and leaves, which is normal when moving a plant. However, if the plant withers excessively or turns brown, you may have something more going on.Don't keep plying it with water or excess nutrients, which might actually make the plant worse.
Some plants, such as the Benjamin ficus, drop all their leaves then later sprout new growth vigorously after getting used to the environment. Some plants will lose all but their younger leaves and the leftovers grow more resilient in the new environment.
Sometimes, you may have bought a plant that is just ready to go dormant or even die.

, Watch the plant to see how it adjusts. Once it is showing new growth and isn't wilted anymore, you can move it to its permanent location. You can also transplant the plant to a new pot as needed.

If your plant location fits this description already, you don't have to move it.

, The plant has probably been fertilized at some point. The plant already has enough nutrients, and adding more could do more harm than good.After about a year, the plant may need fertilizer. Check on what that species needs specifically, as some do not need fertilizer at all.

, With too little light, a plant will produce poorly sized leaves and leggy stems. Variegated and colorful leaves of many plants will disappear and turn green. Flowering plants do not flower in poor light. At the other side of the spectrum, too much light can result in a tightly bunched plant with scorch marks and shriveled leaves. Knowing what plants need what light can help you provide the right amount for your plant.High light is light right next to a sunny windowsill. Cacti, succulents, and many houseplants will thrive here, but others will need to have the light filtered.
Medium light is light that is about 3 to 5 feet away from a sunny window. It produces a distinct shadow. Most houseplants thrive at this level of light without a problem.
Low light is the farthest from a sunny window, and it produces a fuzzy shadow. Some houseplants can tolerate this light and stop growing yet remain healthy.

, You can buy special grow bulbs or plant lights in big box stores or garden stores. These bulbs produce a light that is similar to natural sunlight. Turn off the lights on a schedule so plants can rest at night.You can also use ordinary household ""daylight"" bulbs, which are the same as grow bulbs only less expensive. These produce a bluish-white light.
LEDs generate less heat and less energy than incandescent, fluorescent, or halogen bulbs. With these bulbs, the plants don't get overheated as easily, and you save on energy bills.

, No plant likes to be exposed to a sudden change in temperature, which can happen when a cold front or thunderstorm passes through. The same goes for being near doorways and windows connected to outer walls. Changes of 5 to 10 degrees are harmless, but larger fluctuations can shock the plant.Most houseplants can thrive in temperatures of 60 degrees to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
If your plants are exposed to temperature shocks, they may collapse and lose all their leaves and/or blooms. Too much cold can lead to rot and leaf curl, while too much heat can lead to shriveled flowers and yellowed leaves.

, You may have areas in your house that are ""heat pools,"" which can reach extremely warm temperatures. For instance, extra sunny areas and heat sources like computers, TVs, heaters, and air conditioners. Most plants will not tolerate this kind of heat at all, but cacti and succulents can thrive., Giving your plant too little water will result in a scorched plant with crispy leaves. Too much water can lead to mold, fungus, and stinky rot. Understanding what each plant needs will help you give it the right amount of water.


Low Moisture: Many desert plants belong to this group. They don't like high-moisture environments, since they cause mold, fungi, and rot to grow on the plant. With these, provide low humidity and water only when the soil is almost dried out.

Moderate Moisture: Many plants enjoy moderate moisture and humidity. Wait for the soil to dry out a bit (like a half or quarter of the soil) and water thoroughly. Keep an eye out and provide humidity as needed.

High Moisture: Some houseplants are real water babies and love high humidity and soil moisture. These plants do better in a terrarium, vitrine, or indoor water display. A few even can live with their roots submerged in water.

, If your plant is subjected to high humidity and low temperature and light, it is likely to rot and grow fungus. That means you need to lower your watering levels if the temperature drops.

English ivies, English primroses, begonias, and some ferns don't like crowded, damp conditions. Don't place these plants in crowded plant groups or they will get rot and mildew.

, Feel the soil with your finger. For high moisture plants, if the surface is completely dry, water immediately. For moderate moisture, stick your finger in the soil to half an inch or so. If it's dry, water it.Pour water into the soil until the water runs through the drainage holes. This process waters it thoroughly. Plants love this technique, and it helps the roots at the bottom get water. Also, it gets rid of leftover salts in the soil.

, For practice, use room temperature water that has sat out overnight. However, you can also use lukewarm faucet water if you need to water a plant immediately.If you're not certain of the chemicals in your water or if your plant is sensitive to chemicals, you can use filtered water or spring water. Watch how your plant reacts. Some plants hate fluoride, lime, or salts that are present in water sources.

, Even the exact same species in the exact same situation in different pots will need water at different times. Treat each plant as a individual. Also, plants higher up on shelves or in hanging pots need more water usually than their counterparts that are lower down.

When dealing with plants that require high humidity, it's best to leave the plant alone and watch for signs of needed humidity. The leaves will scorch on the edges or tips and shrivel up.

, Many species like humidity but don't want water on their leaves, such as plants with fuzzy leaves. Instead of misting, place the plant in a humidity tray containing pebbles and water, buy a humidifier, place the plants in a group display, or plant in a greenhouse-like terrarium for watering.

However, bromeliads and many orchids love being misted. In fact, bromeliads like water in their cups and at the top of the plant, and Tillandsias or air plants have water-absorbing scales on their leaves.
Some plants get ugly cola/coffee spots if misted. Leathery leaves get corky spots. Several species develop glassy, limp leaves. Hard water also causes hard white chalky markings on misted foliage.
Splashing cold water on leaves can kill the leaves via rot. Wet leaves in full sun can burn leaves like a sunbeam through a magnifying glass can burn paper.

, Some plants like African Violets and Cyclamens will rot if water touches their crowns or bulbs, which kills the plant. Set the pot in a bowl of lukewarm water and lift it up when the water stops bubbling and the soil glistens on the surface., When it comes to pots, you have a wide range of options. You can use a nonporous or porous container, depending on your preference. You can also hide an uglier planter in a prettier container.

Nonporous containers have the advantage of holding moisture in the soil so plants don't dry out quickly, which is good when you are a forgetful caregiver. These include plastic, ceramic, and glazed clay.
Porous containers absorb water through soil, which can dry the roots; this type of pot might be helpful if you overwater. These pots also absorb fertilizer salts, and the inside edges of these can be loaded with salts that can burn roots.

, Good quality potting mix has particles of various sizes instead of only fine particles resembling black sand. Also better quality potting mix has a fluffy, damp, crumbly feel. Stay away from soils with added fertilizers which can burn plant roots and kill plants. Most plants are sensitive to salts in soil.Bad quality potting mix has a tendency to become very compact, making it difficult for roots to penetrate the soil. Also, watch out for weed seeds and bugs.
You can also mix your own soil from ingredients found at a garden center, such as peat moss, humus, perlite, pure garden sand (not builder's sand), and others. Recipes for soils are available on the web and in garden books.
Many plants also have specific soil needs, and you can find soils specific for these groups. For instance, many tropical plants prefer acidic African violet mix and rhododendron foods. Other examples are cacti and succulent mix, orchid mix, and citrus food.

, First, choose a pot that's 1/2 an inch larger than the old pot. To transplant the pot, remove the plant from its original pot by turning the plant on its side and lifting the plant out. If necessary, use a spade or knife to separate the roots from the inside of the pot. You might have to cut or break the container to free the plant. Lift the plants by the leaves or woody stems not by the soft stems or crown, which prevents damage to tender soft stems and roots.

Cover the bottom of the new pot with pebbles to have adequate drainage. Also if it has one central drainage hole, cover the bottom with a piece of fine screen.
Fill the bottom of the pot with your soil so that the plant crown (where the roots meet the stems) is almost to the top of the pot. Fill the surrounding areas with soil.
Shake the pot to settle the soil, which gets rid of large air pockets that could kill roots. Give your plant water, and let it rest for a few weeks. Do not fertilize for a few weeks

, Some plants (such as Chinese Evergreens) like to be planted deeply, while others do not want to be planted too deeply, such as African violets. Learn your plants' preferences.

Also different plants like different pot heights and widths. Palms like narrow deeper pots to support their deep taproots. Azaleas and African violets like shallow pots. Flowering plants and some other species like being cramped in the same pot they've lived in for years.

, Too much fertilizer can result in weak growth that needs to be removed, as well as white crusts on the soil and burn marks on the leaves. Plants with too little fertilizer just stop growing and start declining, slowing down, and losing leaves. Using the wrong fertilizer (like a high-nitrogen fertilizer) on a flowering plant will lead to no flowers or bad performance.The three main macronutrients are:


Nitrogen (N) is for leaf growth.

Phosphorus (P) is for the development of roots, flowers, seeds, and fruit.

Potassium (K) promotes strong stem growth, movement of water, and flowering and fruiting.


Look for these macronutrients presented in the format of dashes and numbers (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8), always in the NPK order. Generally, foliage plants need more nitrogen in their soils while flowering plants need more potassium and phosphorus. Also, a good garden store will have a large selection of fertilizers for each specific group.

, Follow the instructions on the package. It's best to choose either a liquid fertilizer or a mix-in fertilizer rather than fertilizer sticks and pellets. The sticks and pellets don't always melt correctly into the soil and leave ""salt spots"" that can burn roots. Whenever you use fertilizer, use less than the recommended amount to avoid harming your plant.

Don't fertilize plants during the dormant season or when they are not growing. Many plants appreciate a good rest during the cool season. They receive less light thus have less energy to be used in making food. Fertilizer during this dormant (sleep) season will result in weak, leggy growth that is more susceptible to diseases and pests. Also, this growth will not produce strong flowers or fruit.

, Learning the native climate and soil conditions may help uncover little secrets that will help you grow better plants. You can do a bit of research about each plant to find out more., Routine checking up on your plants will help you spot problems when they are still minor. If you don't check up on your plants, you may find they are too far gone to save., If you find pest or disease, start the appropriate pest- or disease-killing procedures immediately. If your problem is poor conditions, correct them quickly to avoid further damage.

Many completely different ailments produce similar symptoms. Look for combined symptoms. Leaf drop and yellowing symptoms due to dried-out soil will accompany dry soil and scorch marks.

, If you see a rotten, dead, or deformed leaf, pluck it off. Remove spent and dead flowers, as both dead leaves and flowers are sources for disease.Many soft stem plants like Pilea benefit from a procedure called pinching in which you pinch off the top of a stem to encourage side shoots. This procedure results in fuller growth. Use these clippings for cuttings.
Indoor trees and shrubs also need pruning to help encourage healthy growth, an attractive shape, and blooming. Some plants only bloom on new wood.

, If the plant tolerates water on leaves, give them a nice lukewarm shower, or set the plant out in a summer rainstorm. Leaves that don't like water on the leaves are best dusted with a makeup brush., Many tropical houseplants in their native tropical habitat don't go dormant at all and keep growing. Others, however, have distinct sleeping seasons that need to be provided for proper growth. You'll need to provide less water and warmth for a period of weeks or months. During the winter, almost any plant can get by with less water or warmth, which results in vigorous spring growth or even flowers and fruit.Signs of dormancy vary among plant species. Evergreen species just stop growing. Deciduous plants drop all their leaves. Most bulbs like caladiums simply appear to go dead above ground while the bulb lives on. In fact the calla lily unusually falls asleep during the growing season in northern climates due to the opposite seasons of its South African home. Cacti and leafless succulents don't display dormancy but appreciate cold dryness in winter.
Do not fertilize a plant during winter or dormant season unless it's required for the species. The plant's roots will not be using the nutrients, and it will damage roots or force the plant into active growth, which results in weak foliage and flower performance., Compacted soil results in water and nutrients draining too fast into the draining dish. The soil should bubble and make soaking sounds when you water it. In soil that is too heavy, plants will have symptoms of weak brittle stems and normal leaves.

Sometimes the plant will snap off the root ball with a slight tug, or stronger species will be less vigorous.
Plants with taproots and some indoor trees will topple over in soil that's too light.

Consider building a raft.",How to Survive on a Deserted Island With Nothing," If your plane or boat has failed at sea, the first thing you will want to do is look for survivors. There may be others who are injured and in need of help. Try to gather up as many survivors as you can and help the injured to shore.Having others with you can help make the situation more bearable, psychologically.
Surviving with others means that you won't have to do all the work yourself.
Other survivors may have skills or knowledge that can be of great benefit while surviving on the island.;
, Before you head to shore, it can be a good idea to gather up any supplies or materials near you. There may be useful items floating on the waters surface that will help you survive and await rescue. Try to look for anything you can use before heading to shore.Sheets of plastic can be used to build water stills.
Cloth, fabric, or clothing can be dried and used later on.
Grabbing up any bottled water or other containers can help keep you hydrated on the island.
It's still possible to survive on the island, even if you have nothing with you.
Grab whatever you can. Even things you would normally consider to be junk might have a use.

, Once you've collected others who need help and have gathered up any useful things you can, it's time to swim towards land. After you arrive at the island, you can get started assessing your situation and setting yourself up for survival.You can tread water by moving your arms out to the sides and pulling them back in, meeting in front of your chest. At the same time, bring one leg up towards your body and kick the other down. Switch which leg you bring up and kick down to help keep you floating.
Watch out for any strong currents that you can see. Try to avoid swimming into these, as they can sweep you back out to sea.
Be careful when approaching the island. Look for any large rocks or rough coast lines before swimming to shore.
You can float in water by laying on your back and keeping your lungs full. Use your hands and arms to steer the direction of your float.
Survival floats involve facing down, with your face in the water. Relax your body and hold your breath as you easily float on the water. When you need a breath, just raise your head up and get some air.

, If you've made it to the island with other survivors, it can be a good idea to figure out what everyone is skilled at. If other survivors have specific skill sets, they should handle relevant tasks on the island. Even if no one has a set of special skills, survival tasks can still be delegated to make things easier on everyone.For example, if someone is a doctor, they should get to work treating injuries.
Even without special skill sets, you can still assign basic tasks. For instance, someone might be in charge of getting a fire started while another person looks for water.
If you are alone and able, start looking for water before doing anything else.

, The very first thing you will want to do is find a drinkable source of water. Water is critical when maintaining health and surviving. Dehydration can kill a person very quickly, sometimes in as little as three days. For this reason, it's important that you quickly locate water that is safe to drink. Keep some of these ideas in mind while locating drinking water on the island:Streams or rivers will usually have fresh water in them. Keep in mind that although there is no salt in this water, it may still contain parasites or diseases.
It's always a good idea to boil water you plan on drinking.
Do not drink salt water. Salt water will only cause further dehydration and health issues.
If there is no water available, you may need to build a water still.
You can drink rain or dew that has collected in leaves.
If you find plants, there is a good chance that water is nearby. Try looking ahead for a pool of water or digging down into the ground to find the source of water.
Some thicker vines can be cut open to reveal water. Most water carrying vines will look thick and wooden. Cut a vine open and examine the water. If it looks milky or discolored, don't drink it.
Many foods contain water. If you find something like a coconut or fruit, you can enjoy the meal and get some hydration.

, Shelters are critical when it comes to keeping you safe and out of the elements. Shelters can also give you a place to rest and recover while you consider your next moves. There are many different types of shelters you can build. However, the natural material found on the island will dictate what kind of shelter you can create. As an example, you may try to create a simple lean-to shelter, using these steps:Find a long and solid stick or branch. This log should be longer than you are tall.
Lean this log up against a tree. The log will be your roof line, so find an angle that works for your height.
Lay smaller branches or sticks over the main branch. These sticks should go down the length of the main log and will be placed at 45 degree angles.
Cover these smaller sticks with branches and leaves to create the walls of your shelter.
You might also want to put leaves or other plant matter on the inside floor of the shelter to create a bed.

, After you've found water and built a shelter, it's time to keep warm. Building a fire can be done without any outside tools. All you will need is some natural material and a fire-starting technique. There are many techniques that you can use to actually start the fire. As an example, take a look at these steps to get an idea of how you can start a fire without tools:Find small pieces of wood, tinder, or twigs and arrange them in a small tepee.
Having good tinder is important. Try using dry grass, pine resin, birch tree bark or any other dry material that will easily take a flame.
Locate a length of soft wood. Ideally this will have a small groove in it already. However, you could also make a grove by cutting the wood with a sharp stone.
Find a hardwood stick and gather your tinder together.
Put the tinder in the groove. Rub the hardwood stick up and down the groove quickly to create friction.
Eventually the tinder will ignite. Place this tinder in your small kindling tepee to start the fire.
Add larger pieces of wood to build the fire higher.

, If you hope to be rescued, it's a good idea to leave rescuers with a signal. The signal you create will help search parties find your location and get you home more quickly than you would otherwise. You might try making some of these rescue signals to make you more visible:Burning damp or wet wood can produce a lot of smoke.
Piling large rocks on the beach can be effective. Try to spell out S.O.S. or HELP with them.
You can also spell messages by drawing in the sand or using large sticks to spell the message out.
If you move locations, use stones to draw an arrow on the ground, indicating which direction you went.

, Although you might not have any supplies handy, you can still do some very basic first aid if needed. It's important that you take care of any injuries as best you can to avoid them worsening or threatening your chances of survival. Take a look at some of these basic first aid techniques you can use while surviving on your deserted island.For cuts, hold the wound together by pinching the sides of it together. You can use a bit of cloth as a bandage. Lie down and elevate the wound above heart level.
Treat shock by laying down, keeping quiet and staying warm.
Handle hypothermia by first getting out of the wind, rain, or snow. Remove any wet clothes, and change into dry clothes if you have them. Get warm by drinking heated water and staying near a fire.

, Although you may have taken care of the basics of survival, you'll need to make sure you are focused, collected and in the right mindset. If you're not in the right frame of mind, survival can become a lot more difficult and dangerous. Try to focus your thoughts and attitudes towards useful survival mindsets to help make your time on the island easier.Be realistic about your situation. If there are serious problems, accept and address them.
Try to stay positive. Even if you're faced with a tough situation, staying positive can help keep you motivated and alert to new solutions.
Remind yourself that your life is at risk. You can't afford to be careless or unaware when surviving.
Panic can cause you to act in nonsensical and dangerous ways. Always try to avoid giving into fear or a sense of panic.

, Once you've taken care of the immediate survival needs, you can focus on other important aspects. Locating, obtaining, and preparing food is one of these critical survival needs. Although you can survive for a while without food, eating will help keep your energy levels up and increase your chances of survival overall. When looking for food, keep these tips in mind:There will likely be fish that you can eat in the shallow water around the island.
Making a simple spear out of a sharp stick can allow you to go spear-fishing.
There may be edible fruit around the island. Try looking for bananas or coconuts to eat.
You can usually eat seaweed if you find it growing nearby. Make sure you find it growing in the island shallows or tidal pools. Seaweed that has drifted to the island may be dangerous to eat.
You should cook any food that you find to reduce the chances of eating a parasite or contracting a disease.
If you aren't sure if something is poisonous, start by rubbing the food on your hand. If you don't get a rash or reaction, try rubbing it on your lips. If you don't notice anything, try holding it in your mouth for a few minutes before removing it. If you don't feel ill, you can try to eat it.
Check out this guide to learn more about testing potentially poisonous plants.

, If you've successfully hunted an animal, you'll want to properly prepare it before eating it. Although animals are a good source of nutrition, they can also carry diseases and can become inedible if improperly prepared. Take a look at some of these basic steps when preparing an animal to eat:Remove the skin or hide from the animal. Make sure the entire hide has been removed before proceeding.
Take out the entrails. Carefully remove the organs from both the chest and stomach of the animal. Take special care with the digestive tract and bladder, as these can pose health risks if spilled.
You can save and eat the heart and liver.
You can roast or boil the meat, once it has been cleaned and prepared.

, Once you've collected some meat, you'll need to either eat it quickly or preserve it. Meat will spoil fast if left untreated, so it's helpful to have a preservation method ready to go. Look over some of these basic ideas to learn how you could preserve any meat that you've found:Smoking the meat can help it last for a few weeks. You'll need to cover a small fire in a blanket or sheet to trap the smoke. Above the fire, hang the meat on sticks and leave them there in the smoke for around 2 days.
You can dry meat by cutting it into thin slices and leaving it on a drying rack in the sun. You'll need to make sure animals and insects stay away from the meat while it is drying. It should be fully dry and crisp before you eat it.
If you are on an island with snow or cold temperatures, freezing the meat can be an option. Even though it will be frozen, you will still need to cook it before eating.

, There may be dangerous predators sharing the island with you. Because of this possibility, you will need to think about defending yourself. Avoiding a conflict is the best course of action. However, you may also want to create some basic self defense items as well.Making a basic spear out of a sharpened stick can be a easy way to defend yourself.
Stay out of deep waters to avoid encounters with sharks.
Avoid going into any caves as they may be an animal den.
Stay away from any snakes or insects that you might encounter, as many could be venomous or poisonous.

, Often times, the safest course of action you can take is to stay put and wait for rescue. After you've set up your basic survival camp and shelters, maintain your rescue signals and focus on taking care of yourself. Staying in one place can reduce the danger of travel on an unknown island and increase the likelihood of rescuers narrowing your location down.Try to stay in whichever place you decided to build your survival camp.
Moving around the island can increase your chances of getting lost or injured.
If you keep moving your camp, you will likely be more difficult to find.

, While you will likely be very busy trying to survive on the island, it's also important to get some rest and relax. Taking a break can help you feel refreshed and ready for whatever comes next. Finding things to do in your free time can also help keep your outlook positive and make survival a bit more comfortable than it would be otherwise.If you're feeling lonely, try singing, dancing, or daydreaming.
Being too tired can cause you to get careless. You need to stay as alert and focused as you can.
It's okay to be afraid. However, don't let your fear stop you from doing what you must to survive.
Think about your upcoming plans. Ask yourself what you can improve about your situation and how you might do it.

, If the island is too harsh to survive on, you may need to create a raft and attempt to leave. You may also consider leaving the island if you think your rescuers believe you have died. However, sailing on a raft can be extremely dangerous and should be used only as a last resort. Try using these steps to build a simple raft, allowing you to self-rescue if need be.Find some larger logs to act as the base of the raft.
Find many smaller logs to act as the braces and platform of the raft.
If possible, try cutting small notches into the base logs for your support branches to fit inside of.
Tie the smaller branches on top of the larger logs with vines.
Make sure you loop the vines over and under each log before tying them off.
Once the raft is complete, test in shallow waters before venturing further out.
Bring extra logs and vines to make repairs if needed.

, The ideal water source would be a moving river with sandy banks.

, Clean the bark off from a hard wood stick, dip the stick in water and beat the side of a sandy bank. This will embed sand into the sides of the stick. Keep doing so until ample abrasiveness is accomplished. Use this stick to sharpen your axe or knife.

, Larger structures also waste physical resources and energy in building and upkeep. Also note that smaller shelters tend to trap more heat and heat up much easier than large shelters. Make sure to face it away from the prevailing wind. Also consider the fact that the shelter will need to drain any rain that comes.

, Also note that after two days of not eating you will begin to lose energy. During those two days it is important to find a safe food source as in that time your body will still hold ample amounts of energy. Tips for this will be explicated below.

, You can use the blunt end of your axe to snap softwood away from a tree. Larger softwoods tend to have a great many dry branches ideal for the making of fire. Also note that pine needles make ideal tinder. You will need this dry wood to produce safe food and water.

, Be careful not to get pitch on your hands as the sticky sap can create large blisters if worked into your skin. The reason spruce is important is because boiling the needles into a tea makes the perfect morning drink. Imagine a cup of nasty-tasting orange juice with seven times as much Vitamin C. Note that this concoction will also save you from scurvy.

, By successfully using snares and pitfalls one will only catch something on the rarer side of things. As that is the case it is important to set many snares, in varied locations. It is also important to remove all these snares before you move on.

, If you cut down an ash you can pound the blunt end of the axe on a white, brown or black ash. This will loosen long strips that can be pulled off and used as shingles. If they break vertically while you pull them off the log simply use pitch to fill the cracks.


The ash is a sacred tree to many Native Americans. Native basket makers will often times offer tobacco before a tree is chopped down, it would be wise to make this offering, or one that can be deemed appropriate given your resources. This is out of respect for where the knowledge comes from and out of respect for the thing that helps you survive in adverse conditions.

, Instead look to the smaller game trails that often yield quail, rabbit and smaller turkeys. These creatures can be captured using the stringy roots of spruce or the inner bark of basswood in the form of a snare.


The basswood snare is a powerful tool but is a native technology that requires the destruction of a tree. An offering of tobacco or some other comparable resource may be advisable. Never compromise survival to make such an offering.

, There are very few places where man hasn't been. Signs of his presence include bottles, cans and often times wrappers useful for tinder. Also during the autumn rocky terrain is often hidden under a layer of leaves. Men have died because they did not check their footing with a good walking stick, as this tool can serve a number of purposes.

, The earth gets cold at night. Lay a mattress of pine, cedar, juniper boughs, palm leaves, or just small wood or pine needles. More layers = more warmth.

, Be prepared however to go anywhere from 10–50 miles (16–80 km), or much further, depending on the location.

, Often times one reverts to wishful thinking in a time of crisis. Again be prepared to travel indefinite distances or you will not survive. In situations where you suspect that someone will be searching for you, it is generally advisable to stay put, provided you have sufficient food and water resources.

, Once you give up there is nothing keeping you from dying. Humans can and do survive on virtually any terrain on Earth. If a technique is not successful, learn from the mistake and keep trying.

Be sure to have portable (Drinkable) water.,
Be sure to have all of the medications and medical supplies that you might need.If you have the elderly living with you,make sure you have their needs.,
If you have a generator, be sure you have what it needs.",How to Survive a Two Week Survival Situation," Water is the most important supply you need to have.At least one gallon of water per person & per day. That is just for drinking, that doesn't include water for cooking and washing.;
,


It is wise to have at least two weeks of medication on hand. A good amount is at least a month’s worth.
You can get a good first aid kit with most of your basic needs at most pharmacies. Get a larger size one. Also pick up extra items for it like anti-biotic ointment, and antiseptic wipes. Infection will be an issue. If you deal with a minor scratch properly,it will save your life. Most of these first aid kits come with instructions for basic first aid so you need to read that.If it doesn’t, buy a book on Basic First aid. Don’t count on home remedies.
Be sure to have dried and canned foods.
During a storm everyone runs out and buys all the milk, bread and eggs off the shelves. Milk and eggs will go bad in just a day or two without refrigeration. During bad storms,the power is going to go out. Though your fridge and freezer are built to keep things cold, they will thaw a lot sooner than you think.
Dried foods such as pasta,cereal,breakfast bars,and powdered milk are the kinds of things you want to have handy. Remember it isn’t about whether or not you like it, it is all about survival.
Canned foods, such as soups, tuna, vegetables and canned meats. Again, Franks and Beans may not be your favorite food, but it is a great source of nutrients that your body needs to survive.

,


Great! How much fuel do you have? Do you have all the spare parts and knowledge to repair it when it doesn’t start for you? Maybe, but there are too many things that could render it useless. Prepare for the “Dark Ages”.
Have a way to prepare food because no power,no way of making food like we usually do.
Though it may be difficult,you have to you can eat the canned goods right from the can.
The dried goods are a different story. Most of them need to have hot water to be prepared properly.
Be ready to camp.Whether you like camping or not, you should have some basic camping gear handy. A camp stove is a great investment. They are relatively inexpensive and can be stored long term and used when needed. Remember to have the fuel available. Your BBQ will work well for this as well. Just don’t try to use it indoors! Make sure you have enough fuel for whichever method you choose. A “Mess Kit” is a great thing to have handy. If this event turns out to be more than 2 weeks, it is portable and designed to be used on open camp fires. (Your household pots and pans often have plastic or weak metals that would break down or melt over an open fire)
Be sure to have an Information source and a means to listen to it.
Have a hand crank radio ready to go. In most cases there are enough radio stations that are prepared and able to keep broadcasting in the event of an emergence. They will help you stay informed as to what is going on around you and whether or not you have to plan to go to plan “B”. They will supply you with locations of refuge, supplies, and conditions around you. This is a MUST HAVE. If you have a battery powered radio, you need at least 3 sets of FRESH batteries for it. Fresh means, new every year. Batteries do loos their charge while sitting on the shelf and may not last very long when you do start using them.
Have a way to pass time.
Your tech device is not going to run for very long, and there will more than likely be internet service.Texting and cell phone use will be limited if available at all. Have plenty of old fashioned games on hand to help keep you and your loved ones entertained. Just sitting around waiting will literally drive you crazy. You will start making bad decisions because you are “Tired of waiting”.
Have a Light source, preferably a safe one.
This is where things can get dangerous. One of the most popular light sources are candles. These are probably the most dangerous because of the fire hazard involved. Only use them if you absolutely have to. Use them in candle holders that are enclosed, and keep them away from combustibles. (Curtains, paper, table cloths, furniture.) Flashlights are your best option. They also have “Crank” flashlights usually right next to the crank radios. IF you are going to get battery operated flash lights, then be sure to have plenty of extra batteries on hand for them too. Use them sparingly. Plan your days around daylight. Go to bed when it gets dark and get up when it is light. Another option I use is oil lamps or kerosene lamps. Again they are a fire hazard so you have to be EXTREMELY careful with these. Have plenty of extra fuel on hand for these as well.
Be prepared to move.
Depending on the event, you need to be ready to move. Weather they give an evacuation notice, or this event turns into a long term catastrophic event. You need to be ready to take what you can carry and go.

Get a container.,
Get a magnifying glass and some survival matches.,

Include a couple of small blades, or carry a pocket knife.,
Include some water purification tablets.,
Include basic medical supplies.,
I've included a few mini glowsticks in my kit.,
Pad out your kit with cotton.",How to Put Together a Pocket Survival Kit," Most people use an Altoids mints tin to put their kit in. If you can't get Altoids, Marks and Spencers do a brand called Curiously Strong Mints, which have a similar sized tin. If you want something bigger, places like B&Q make plastic containers (intended for keeping stuff like screws in) that are suitable. Any container that you get should clip shut, so that it doesn't spring open.;
, Being able to light a fire can be critical in some situations. A magnifying glass will focus the sun's rays to a point, allowing you to ignite materials. Survival matches have large heads, allowing you to strike them even in windy or rainy conditions. However, they have two disadvantages: first, you can only carry a limited supply of them, and second, they cannot be extinguished by blowing them out, so you need some other method to put them out.

, String is fantastically useful: you can use it to tie stuff together, helping to make a shelter; it's less bulky than rope; you can make a fishing line out of it; there are many uses, limited only by your imagination.

, They're easy to aquire, and you can use them for different purposes, such as bending it out into a fishing hook (or paper clipping stuff together). just use your imagination.

, You never know when you need to cut something.

, You need to drink water, and if you can't boil it, you need to find some other way of purifying it. These tablets are essential.

, Paracetamol, ibuprofen, anti-histamines, plasters. Anything else you can cram in. If you get injured, you'll be glad you included them. Learn how to use items from the environment to replace some of these items and free up space (e.g. willow bark can be used as a painkiller).

, They glow for about ten hours, and can be used as a light source, for signalling, and for night fishing - the light attracts the fish. Some people prefer to carry a beta light - they're reliable for years, but they can be dangerous if they are broken, due to them containing tritium.

, It stops stuff from rattling, and can be used as a firelighter.

Know the most important basics of survival.",How to Survive Being Lost in the Forest," Do not continue to walk through the forest, as this may make you even more confused and lost than before. Staying where you are may increase your chances of being rescued because you are closer to the place you went missing which is where rescuers will search first.

, Try to calm down and take deep breaths. If you can think clearly you will have a better chance of survival. Also if it is close to nighttime you will need all the planning you can do to survive that first night. Making a plan helps to focus you on surviving and to make you feel better and confident about your situation.

, This will help keep you warm, provide a dry place to sleep, and make you feel more secure. The shelter doesn't have to be anything fancy, just enough to keep most of the rain off and to keep you warm and secure. If you don't have enough time to make a shelter try to huddle up under a tree for the night.

, This is the most important step as it will allow you to cook food, boil water, warm up, and most importantly, keep the wild animals away. If you don't have match or flint, there are other techniques that can be used to start a fire. Two of the most popular ways are the hand drill method and the fire bow method. Both methods have materials that can be gathered from your surroundings.

, This step is also critical to your survival. After your first night, you should recon the area looking for animal tracks, edible plants, (don't eat anything if you don't know what it is!) and a stream or brook

, Once you have done all the things in steps 1-5 you should be set for as long as it takes to get rescued. Try to signal anyone and anything to get you out of there.

, This means having things like matches (preferably waterproof), a compass, a map, something warm, food and water. Anything can happen when you go into the woods, so it is best to try to be as prepared as possible beforehand.


You should also make sure you bring a pocket knife with you. This way, you can use it to help you make a shelter, open cans, and cut thread to make a fishing string.
Bring a mirror (a small compact mirror is fine). If you're lost in the woods it will be really hard for your rescuers to locate you. You can use a mirror to signal to a helicopter or small plane your whereabouts.
Bring a condom. As silly as this sounds, a condom can hold up to a gallon of water, which can be a saving grace for you since you'll be needing water to survive and this can act as an emergency container.
A first aid kit can be literally life-saving. If you're planning on taking a trip in the wilderness make sure that you have one of these.
Bring a trash bag. They fold up small and can be used to waterproof yourself or your shelter.;
, While it's true that some people have been rescued from the wilderness because they had their cell phone (and were able to call out, or rescuers were able to triangulate their signal) there are many ways a cell phone can become useless (battery dies, you're out of range, etc).


Make sure that you're prepared to function without a cell phone and that you've told someone what your plans are so when you don't show up at the appointed time and place there is someone who can get help for you.

, Footwear is incredibly important for being in the woods. Don't go out in sandals, even if it's only for a short hike (again, anything can happen and you have to be prepared). Make sure that if you're going out into the woods that you wear sturdy shoes (preferably hiking boots) and socks.


If you're lost, no matter what, keep your socks. Losing your socks, and protection for your feet, can spell disaster for you (worse disaster than just being lost in the forest).

, There are three things that you will absolutely need if you're going to survive: appropriate shelter, fresh water, and a latrine. These are more important than food, even, because you can survive without food for longer than you can survive without shelter or fresh water.


For shelter you'll need something that is out of the wind (a silent, deadly enemy in the fight for survival) and ground cover (the cold, dampness of the ground will make you far colder when you're trying to sleep at night and protect yourself). Try to make it low to the ground, so that it's out of the wind as much as possible.
You'll also need a nearby fresh water source. Nearby basically means that it's within half an hour's walk. try to find a large body of water. When you're concerned with survival, there's often not much you can do about water purity, but hope for the best and try to find somewhere that the water's moving quickly (unless you brought a water purifier with you).
When you're making your latrine, it will need to be downhill from your water source, preferably downwind from your shelter, and should be at least 100 meters from your shelter. This is important so that you don't contaminate your water and food supplies. Try to make it at least 2 feet deep and leave the dirt from the hole beside it. After each use, dump a handful of the dirt in over your business.

"
"
First you want to cut your wicks to a proper length.,
Then you are going to want to take your wood shavings or sawdust and fill your paper cup up halfway.

,
At this point you want to melt your wax.,
Once you have melted wax you pour it into your paper cups over the woodchips.,
Leave the cups for about ten to twenty minutes to harden and you have a firestarter!

,
To use the firestarter, just place in your fire like you would do with tinder and light it.

",How to Make DIY Firestarters," About 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Your going to put them in the cup in the shape of a U. This way the ends of the wick stick out of the cup. You can put in one piece of twine, or a second if you want.;
,, The easiest way is to take pieces of wax and put them in a can (like a soup can) and put that on a hot plate. If you don't have a hot plate you can always get a large candle (not a long tapered candle!) and light it. As it burns a pool of melted wax will form under the candle wick. This can be used as well.

, If there is still room in your cup, you can add more woodchips and wax till it is filled to the top if you would like.

Water. Now, the American Red cross recommends having one gallon of water per person per day for about 3 days or up to one week. But if you happen to have a nursing/pregnant mother, children, or elderly living with you they might need more water.

A change of clothes for each family member. So that would include 1 pair of pants, 1 shirt, 1 pair of socks and undergarments. Shoes can be included. You might want to include a sweatshirt or jacket for each family member as well.

Non-perishable foods such as crackers,cereal,canned food,chips,almonds etc. You might also want to include some comfort food such as candy or chips. In a time of emergencies, foods such as candy (chocolate or chips) can really help calm nerves.

First aid kits You can either go out and buy one or you can make one yourself. Also either in a separate place in the kit or in your first aid kit, if anyone in your family is taking medication you need to make sure you have at least a week worth of that medication.

Maps are also needed so you can know directions.

",How to Build Your Own Emergency Disaster Kit," It could mean retaining all your fingers and toes, or continuing to live in luxury.

, This becomes quite important for two reasons, the first being that a one time use kit will only get used when death is on the line, the second is one time use kits generally fall into the “just survive - with or without my limbs attached” definition of survive. A reusable kit can become part of a lifestyle, turning many “disasters” into inconveniences or even adventures.

, It is tempting and it will take some discipline, but resist the urge to say “I might need this”. A kit that is too large or too heavy is many times just as useless as no kit at all.

, This is one of the highest priorities. The sun will bake you, the rain will freeze you (hypothermia can set in quickly during the fall, spring, and winter if you are wet), and unless you are lucky enough to be stuck in a benign environment (like Tahiti), lack of shelter will be more than an inconvenience. Shelter can be a tent or tarp, a trash bag or tube tent (if you just want to survive), or a Winnebago. A great thing is a rip stop nylon poncho that folds flat and can be used as a tent. These are very versatile, they are lightweight, very tough, they do double or triple duty (a must if your kit is to be light enough to carry), and some of these can be used together to make a larger tent if you are with others. Make sure you have a small rope and stakes along.

, There are recommendations galore for how much water to put into your kit. Have 130-160 oz per day minimum, depending on your size. If you are very small take the former, larger, the latter. This is the lowest amount you should take. Any less than this and you will start to seriously gamble with your life. The government says one gallon per person per day - but this includes water for washing, cooking, etc. Options for water include sterilized boxes, sterilized Mylar bags, water bottles, and reusable containers. The sterilized water (bag or box) are awfully convenient if you don’t let their relative unavailability keep you from using them when you need to. They have a 5-year shelf life and you can just forget about them. Water bottles have to be replaced yearly and take up a lot of extra space - but are otherwise good. You can also get reusable containers (generally collapsible plastic) which work well if you sterilize the water (and keep it sterilized) or wash them and replace the water often. Water purification tablets are an option, but due to their taste (they can make you sick) you may not want them. Some Sporting outfitters have water purification systems.

, There are plenty of options but the best require no preparation and no utensils or dishes to eat. Food bars of all types fall into this category, as do granola, GORP, etc. They all work well but should be replaced yearly or according to their expiration dates. The Coast Guard uses a food bar with a five-year shelf life. Get ones with lots of variety, such as nuts, whole grains, etc. Living on food bars for three days isn’t too bad except that you’d swim the English Channel for a burger by the end. The next best type of food is the Mylar type - Mylar bags of tuna, MREs (ready eat meals), etc. They do require utensils, but the tuna can be eaten out of the bag, as can the MREs albeit with a bit more difficulty. The excessive amounts of packaging and superfluous items in MREs might prevent you from using them as a serious food source if space and weight are an issue. Note: eat as healthily as possible. Do not fall for the “take plenty of candy and junk food for comfort and energy” gig. Sugar causes a crash in energy proportional to its high. It also stresses out the body, and in a stressful situation it is the last thing that should be eaten. Whole grains, nuts, etc. will give gradual, even energy and provide the necessary fats, proteins, and nutrients needed – needs which increase during times of stress.

, Wool and fleece are the best blanket choices. Both retain heat even when wet, wool is flame retardant, fleece is very lightweight. If you are in an area where fire is likely an issue, stick with the wool unless it is just too heavy. Stay away from cotton, as it wicks heat from your body when it is moist. Get orange blankets if you can, this is a lot of surface area for signaling (even if a child is wrapped up in it). It is a good idea to include a foil type of emergency blanket. They fold up very small and can act as a ground cloth, they can retain body heat, act as a vapor barrier and wind breaker, etc. Don’t buy all the hype about its amazing heat reflection properties, though - it only reflects radiant heat - and it is, after all, just foil. Persons in very cold climates might investigate buying a down sleeping bag for all of your camping and storing it in your 72-hour kit. It packs incredibly small and light and is amazingly warm.

, Toilet paper, cotton bandanna (for face mask, washcloth, etc), baby wipes, soap, potty bags, and an N95 dust/virus mask are essentials. Additional important items include a toothbrush/paste, latex gloves, and feminine napkins.

, Do not get a standard first aid kit with 3,200 band aids and a few aspirin. Get a roll of gauze, some gauze pads, medical tape, some painkillers, alcohol wipes, some burn/wound cream, some blood coagulant (such as cayenne, which is also antibiotic), and some petroleum jelly or some other lubricant/moisturizer. You’ll have to make your own band aids from gauze and tape, but you’ll be able to cover most other minor injuries.

, Again, do not over pack. You need light (light sticks or a crank flashlight), warmth (heat packs), and a whistle. Additional ‘might need’ items are: fire starting kit, multi-use pliers, firearms, small rope, hand crank radio, duct tape, and a folding saw. You might want to take a small pocketknife (with a saw, scissor, tweezers, sharp knife, hook) Generally everything else isn’t needed. If you live in rural Idaho, you might pack a bit of fishing string and a hook, but don’t overdo it. A well thought out selection of tools already in a kit is www.Gorgimi.com, follow the links to their ""Tools"".

, A Rubbermaid is easy to access but don’t try to carry it anywhere and the lid can come off easily. Dry bags, duffels, day packs, etc are all viable options depending on your budget and location. If you want to be able to carry it, and want it to be waterproof (a good idea - keep in mind that most natural disasters in the US are related to water), a dry bag that can be carried as a backpack is the best option. Many are tough and waterproof, and a few can be carried in several different ways. Zip top freezer bags (these are heavier than ""storage"" bags) can keep like items grouped together within your pack and keep them dry, too. If it's a vital item, like matches, pack the item in two bags, with the zippered ends pointing in different directions. Small recycled containers, like pill bottles and Altoids boxes can be used to house kits for sewing, fishing, personal hygiene, and an ID pack.

, Take it camping, use it often. Buy the items as camping gear and store them in your 72-hour kit. You’ll get your money out of it and know how it all works when you really need it. Likely, your kit will become that place where you always go when the lights go out, when you can’t get that bag of chips open in the car with your teeth, when you are stuck on the side of the road, when you can’t find a flashlight anywhere else, and of course when that 3 feet (0.9 m) of snow pins you down on a desolate stretch of Iowa highway.

, These provide light, info, especially about what caused the emergency, and batteries will not be available in an emergency situation. Also get glow sticks. Safer than candles, especially if that emergency is a tornado, quake that ripped up gas lines, you detect gas. Some of these devices are designed to charge cell phones, thus only a downed cell phone tower will be why your cell phone doesn't work, unless you broke the cell phone yourself.

",How to Hoard Food for an Emergency1," Ideally, the foods should be shelf-stable, require no refrigeration, and even more ideally should be easy to use for bartering purposes in the event of emergency. Some good choices include canned meats and fish, nuts, grains, dried fruit, dark baking chocolate, and cooking oils such as coconut oil.

Know how to respond to a hurricane.",How to Make a Hurricane Disaster Kit," First, you'll need a waterproof utility bag or backpack to hold your disaster supplies. This should be big enough to hold all your essentials, but convenient enough that you can grab it and go in a moment.;
, You'll need at least one gallon (3.8 liters) per person per day for drinking and sanitation. Stock up on three gallons (11.4 liters) per person so you're set for three days.

, This food could sit in your disaster kit for months. Pack long-lasting, calorie-dense foods such as protein bars and canned meals. Make sure all foods are completely sealed, to avoid attracting pests.


If you decide to pack canned foods, do not forget to pack a manual can opener.
Also pack paper plates, cups, and eating utensils.

, Pack one warm-weather and one cold-weather outfit. Having a dry change of clothes could save you from hypothermia during extreme weather conditions.

, Many people are not able to reach a doctor for several days after a natural disaster. At minimum, include disinfectant and medical bandages to clean and dress injuries. Adding additional tools is even better.


If anyone in your household needs medication, pack extra in here. If he only has a limited prescription, he should keep it on his person or somewhere he can retrieve it quickly.

, Include multiple flashlights and/or lamps, several dozen batteries, and a few glow sticks in case the batteries get wet. A couple lighters will also come in handy to light fires. Double bag each of these items in waterproof zip-locked bags, since they're vulnerable to water.


LED lamps last longer than most other types of battery-powered light.

, Include backup batteries as well, plus a battery-powered charger. Once again, double bag these items.

, Make copies of flood and homeowner's insurance, if you have them. Also copy your identification cards, birth certificates, and other documents you might need to prove your identity to a bank or government institution. Bag them and keep them deep in the container to ensure they stay dry.


Include an address book as well with local phone numbers.

, It should be easy to retrieve the kit at a moment's notice. Let everyone in the house know where it is.

, During hurricane season, your house should have at least one or two weeks' worth of bottled water. Each member of your household needs one gallon (3.8 liters) per day. This means your kit should have 7–14 gallons (26–53 liters) per person.


Don't forget to include extra if you have pets.

, Keep your pantry well-stocked, and include extra supplies just for disasters. Choose nutritious, non-perishable items such as canned fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, unsalted nuts, and peanut butter.


Minimize salty foods, which will make you thirstier.

, If you already have one in your travel kit, you may not need another. Still, an extra supply of disinfectants and bandages is never a bad idea.

, With power lines down and a storm raging, communications could be limited. A solar-powered or battery-powered radio can be a good way to pick up emergency information.


Depending on where your travel kit is located, you may want another cheap mobile phone, flashlights, and lighters.

, A few blankets in a waterproof bag could be vital after a hurricane. Baby wipes are a small comfort you may appreciate if you cannot take a bath or shower. Bug repellent and sunscreen are also useful.

, Once the worst of the storm passes, you'll want to start repairs and cleanup. The following will help you out:


Cleaning supplies such as mops, liquid bleach, bucket, push broom, utility knife, hammer, and pry bar for tearing out wet sheet rock.
Heavy-duty work gloves, leaf rake, garden rake, and bow saw to clear debris from yard.
Equipment for temporary roof repair: plastic tarps, hammer, and roofing nails.

, The best course of action is to listen to emergency broadcasts in your area. However, knowing some general information in advance can help you decide where to place your preparedness kit:


The hurricane may blow objects through your windows. Move garden furniture and similar objects before the hurricane arrives.
The safest place in your house is usually a basement room, or a room in the center of the house. If you can get under a staircase, it may protect you from falling beams.
Lean mattresses and large cushions against doors and windows for protection.

Water thoroughly
,
Place pot in cold storage.,
Wait for shoots to appear.,
# Place the pot in a warmer location.,
# Move pot to a sunny window.,
#* Rotate the pot daily.,
Wait for your daffodils to bloom.",How to Grow Daffodils Indoors,", The cold treatment will mimic the conditions the bulbs would experience if you had planted them outdoors. Temperatures from 35 to 48 degrees F (1.7 to 8.9 degrees C) are ideal. The bulbs will not grow properly if it is either too cold or too hot #* Cover the soil in the pot with a loose layer of leaves or sawdust to help regulate the temperature.

Pick a location that is dark and cool. Good options include sheds, garages or refrigerators. In climates where it does not freeze outside, you can dig a hole and bury the plant outside.
Keep soil moist, but don't overwater.

, Most daffodils will require around 12 weeks of cold treatment. You will know your pot is ready to bring to a warmer climate if you see shoots about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in height and you see white roots coming out of the drainage holes on the bottom of the pot, The temperature should be around 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), and there should be low light. Leave the pot here for 2 to 3 days, The new location should be 60 to 65 degrees F (15.6 to 18.3 degrees C). Warmer temperatures may cause the plants not to bloom, Daffodil shoots will lean towards the light source. Turning the pot frequently will keep your plants from leaning in 1 direction., It typically will take 3 to 5 weeks after the cold treatment before flowers appear, but it will vary based on the variety. Once the plants bloom, the flowers will last for approximately 1 month

Move the daffodils out of direct sunlight once they've bloomed to prolong the life of the flowers.

Choose the right bag.,
Pack enough food and water.,
Pack reflective tape.,
Pack a compact raincoat or poncho.,
Pack a space blanket.,
Pack a whistle.,
Pack a pair of athletic shoes.,
Pack socks.,
Pack a small first aid kit.,
Pack a small flashlight.,
Pack a map of your city.,
Pack a list of emergency contact numbers.,
Pack a face mask.,
Pack a portable charging unit for your phone.,
Pack some cash -- but not too much.,
Pack a small pack of tissues and moist wipes.,
Add a all purpose pocket tool or Swiss Army knife.,
Pack a small radio.,
Tape an extra house key into the bottom of the bag underneath the cardboard bottom.",How to Create an Urban Emergency Evacuation Kit for Work1," Use a large, canvas, water resistant backpack with several compartments and padded shoulder straps. A waist strap will help distribute weight and make the bag easier to carry long distances. Since you won't use this daily, you can buy an inexpensive one from a discount store, military surplus store, dollar store, or even from a local thrift store. Think function over fashion.


Add a luggage tag with your name and contact information to your bag. If possible, add some form of identification inside your bag such as an old employee ID. You may have left behind your handbag.;
, Water is heavy to carry but you will need to have plenty available. You'll also need high calorie snacks. Keep at least one sealed bottle of water in your bag and pack more if you can stand the weight. Make sure it's in a durable container so you can refill it and close it easily.


Pack granola bars, S.O.S. bars, or protein bars that are high in calories and carbohydrates and store well long term. Food is not only necessary for energy, it can be great for morale. Dried fruit is also an excellent option.

Peanut butter (assuming you're not allergic to peanuts) comes in handy tubes, is an excellent source of protein, and does not require refrigeration or cooking.

, Blackouts have shut down many cities, forcing people to walk miles. Cell service can be spotty or nonexistent. Subways can be down and vehicles backed up because of non-working traffic lights. Think ahead! Make a plan! Visit a fabric or athletic store or look online for reflective tape. Buy 1–3 yards (0.9–2.7 m) as you will add it to your backpack and other items if necessary. It's usually sold in rolls and is 1"" wide or wider.


Add the reflective tape to the exterior of your backpack. Use fabric glue to attach it if you don't sew.
Attach the reflective tape to the back of the bag and the front straps.
Be generous with the tape. It may make you visible to drivers or emergency workers.

, Choose a coat or poncho made of brightly-colored material, such as yellow, so you'll stand out more. This can protect you from the elements on a long walk, provide shelter, and, when covered in the reflective tape, make you stand out to drivers and other people. You should add reflective tape to your raincoat since wearing it may cover the tape on your backpack.


Pack the folded poncho in your backpack. If it doesn't fold into itself (as many do), you can compress it into a small bag to keep it out of your way.
You can also wrap thick rubber hair bands to compress it. Those will also come in handy to keep long hair out of the way during the emergency. (Hair in the eyes can obstruct vision in addition to being frustrating.)

, You can buy Mylar sheets (so-called space blankets) at hardware or camping supply stores. They are large, lightweight, waterproof and exceptionally thin. They come tightly packed, about the size of an ace bandage, and should be left in their original packaging until you need to use them because they're pretty tricky to refold once you reopen them. Because Mylar reflects heat, it can be used to retain body heat in extreme cold or to reflect away heat in extremely hot conditions.

, A whistle will make more noise with less effort than yelling if you become trapped. The higher pitch will also carry better than your voice.

, In case of an emergency, you may have to run or walk long distances in unpredictable conditions. You don't want to do that in heels or stiff leather work shoes. Your safety may depend on moving quickly and traveling efficiently on foot. Athletic shoes are an absolute must in every person's grab-and-go work kit. Don't use a new pair, as these can cause blisters; pack a pair that is broken in but not worn out, if possible. Even a worn pair is better than wingtips or heels.


Many athletic shoes have reflective trims but you can add more. You should still have some tape left over from the poncho and backpack.

, Pack cotton crew athletic socks that are appropriate for your athletic shoes in terms of thickness. Avoid low cut socks, as they don't protect your heels when walking long distances. Stuff the socks into the shoes so as to conserve space and keep your footgear together.


Women who wear skirts and dresses may benefit from packing knee high athletic socks to provide additional coverage for the legs.

, For the kit, use a quart or gallon size zipping storage bag. Label your bag. You can even add a piece of the reflective tape to make it easier to find if you drop it or are looking for it in a dark pack. Include the following items:


Adhesive bandages: A few of each size will do. Pack mostly the 1"" since they work well for blisters. Bandages that are foam instead of fabric offer more protection for blisters and can still be used for other first aid.
Antibiotic first aid ointment.
Benadryl or other antihistamine: emergencies are not a good time to have an allergic reaction.
Epi-pen if you have been given one by your doctor for severe allergies. They're usually willing to write prescriptions for several so you can keep several available.
Prescription medication to last a day or two in a well-labeled container. If your medication changes, you need to update your kit. Be very specific when labeling describe the pill bottle, the dose, and what it treats. Don't forget an asthma inhaler if you are an asthmatic. You may be walking and air quality could be questionable.
Pain killers, such as aspirin. Look in the travel/trial size section of stores for small bottles.
An ace bandage, which is great for rolled ankles or can be used to immobilize a limb.
Latex or vinyl gloves (if you are allergic to latex) are a must. You could be around injured people or need to treat someone with your first aid kit.
Anti-bacterial hand gel for cleaning up.
Washcloth or hand towel: can be used for clean up, wiping a sweaty brow or signaling.
Find a travel/trial size of saline solution (or contact lens wetting solution) and include it in your kit. Flushing eyes may be necessary for contact lens wearers or for anyone in dusty or polluted air. It can also be used to irrigate a wound.
Assorted gauze or other first aid items. You can use additional quart or gallon size plastic storage bags to keep items dry and organized.

, Find at least a small or medium flashlight or headlight and make sure it has fresh batteries. Maglite type flashlights are extremely durable but heavier aluminum flashlights. The larger ones can be used as a defensive weapon should you need it. Decide if you can tolerate the weight and have room. You can go full size (D cell) if you have room and can stand the weight. You won't get a warning on a massive power outage or evacuation.


Look for a small to medium light that takes AA or C batteries. It depends on how much space you have, your needs and how much weight you can tolerate. Lightweight plastic flashlights are great. You don't need to spend a lot but make sure it works.
There are many newer, pocket-sized LED flashlights on the market that are less expensive (check discount), more durable (no bulbs to burn out or break), and produce more light per set of batteries.

, It should include streets and public transportation (subway stop) information. You may be forced to detour, disembark a train early, or take an alternate route -- finding yourself in unfamiliar territory. Always keep a map to find the best way to your destination. Getting lost can add insult to injury. Traffic patterns are often changed and you may find yourself walking through unknown areas. Keep a map with you of the city and note different routes to take out.

, Cell phone service may be down or your phone charge may not last. Consider keeping the numbers of friends or family near work, in between work and home, and someone who could pick you up and offer shelter. Keep the numbers stashed in your kit. Phone traffic may be heavy and connections hard to come by, so don't rely on calling information first. Your memory of numbers may also be strained in a stressful situation, so keep things written down.

, You can get one from your local hardware or paint store and add it to your kit. They only cost a few dollars. If you need one, you really need one. Smoke and debris can be choking during a fire or earthquake. A particle mask can be very helpful.

, There are solar and wind-up chargers available. Others often use a few small batteries and convert the power to give your phone a small charge. Check travel sites, mobile phone supply stores, or airport kiosks.

, Stash cash for public phones, food vending, or any thing else that could come up. Don't keep too much, just a few dollars and quarters. You can often hide it under the sturdy cardboard bottom. You can use this for transportation or to buy food or drink. Don't forget to include several quarters should you need to use a public phone and be able to find one.

, It may provide dual use in case the restroom facilities lack proper supplies. Think of the different things you may encounter on the way home. Every city and its facilities are different.

, Multipurpose tools are available at most sporting goods or camping stores. The one shown here has pliers, which can be very handy. There are too many ways to use one of these to begin to list them all.

, Many local radio stations switch to emergency programming during an emergency. Look for a small, battery operated FM transistor radio for your bag. These can be found in discount stores or electronic stores for minimal investment. All local radio stations will begin emergency broadcasting if there is an emergency in your area. Make sure it has fresh batteries and is turned off before adding it to your bag.

, If you leave a house key, don't add anything to identify it as such. Even better, hang a combination lockbox from your home door (if allowed;) with a spare key in it. These are $30 at a hardware store and also come in handy anytime you or a family member accidentally lock yourself out or if you need to call a neighbor to enter your home when you are away, and you won't need to risk losing a spare stored elsewhere.


An additional advantage is that if you don't carry a spare key in your emergency kit, you can put your address on a luggage/ID tag attached to it. A spare car key could also be helpful depending on your situation (or in a magnetic wheel-well box - these really work!).

Plant the bird's nest fern in good quality potting soil.,
Water very generously during warmer months and in warm indoor environments.,
Mist the fronds occasionally to improve humidity.,
Ensure that the plant has access to bright light but of an indirect source.,
Fertilize regularly.,
Cut away any dead growth as it appears.",How to Grow Bird's Nest Fern As an Indoor Plant," Be sure to use soil that permits excellent drainage as this fern does not like waterlogged feet.


Also ensure that the pot is able to drain water with ease. Filling the saucer with marbles, glass pebbles or real pebbles can help make drainage better, as well as allowing for evaporation to create humidity.;
,


Add water directly to the soil.
Test the soil to see how moist it is. Poke your finger into the soil; if it is moist, the plant doesn't yet need watering. If it is dry, it needs watering.

, Use a regular spray bottle and mist the leaves directly.

, If it is situated next to a window, make sure that the light is filtered through a lightweight curtain.

, A light feeding plant, keep the dosages of fertilizer low. If the fern is over-fertilized, the fronds can slow down in growth and may become deformed.


Avoid fertilizers with urea or high ammonia nitrogen content.

, This will keep the fern in excellent shape, and ensures that the plant has space to grow healthily.

Select your chili pepper variety.,
Opt for a plastic pot over a clay container.,
Choose a pot with a drainage hole.,
Sterilize the pot before use.,
Purchase potting mix.",How to Grow Chili Peppers Indoors1," Dwarf ornamental peppers work best for indoor growing, since many of the large varieties may not have adequate room for their roots to develop in indoor containers.;
, Clays like terra cotta can actually draw moisture out of the soil, especially in the warm, bright conditions required for growing chili peppers. These peppers need a lot of moisture to grow and may dehydrate in a clay pot.

, While chili peppers thrive on vast amounts of water, a drainage hole prevents too much excess water from gathering and drowning or rotting the roots.

, Many containers, especially if previously used, contain hidden bacteria and insect eggs that can sabotage new plant life. Wash your container out with hot water and soap to eliminate most threats.

, Garden soil often contains bacteria that can damage your pepper seeds, preventing germination or hindering growth. A multi-purpose compost mix purchased from a local gardening store should do the trick, but the higher quality soil you use, the better your odds are of successfully growing your plants.


Improve the quality of your soil further by mixing in some vermiculite.

"
Resist the urge to tap into your bag for water, snacks, or band-aids.,
Pack your bag and store it in a locker, under your desk, in a filing cabinet nearby, or somewhere else it can be grabbed in a hurry.,
Renew your kit regularly.",How to Create an Urban Emergency Evacuation Kit for Work2," Keep the kit intact and only open it to check medication expiration dates, check or replace batteries or replace dated food.

, If in doubt, grab it. Everything you need will fit easily in a backpack. If you live in colder climates you can add additional supplies or change your pack for the seasons.



Take it for fire drills and other alarms. Keep it handy when news has reached you of an emergency in your city.
You may not realize you are in an evacuation situation until you've been separated from your kit.
In large cities, earthquake or tornado prone areas, and large office buildings, it is wise to be a little paranoid.

, Set a reminder on your phone or computer to check your bag every few months. You might want to check twice a year (perhaps when you replace your smoke detector batteries or set clocks forward or back for daylight savings time), use family birthdays as reminders, or set the reminders on your desktop calendar. At least check once a year on a reminder date.


Check the perishables (batteries, food, and first aid items) for expiration, leaking, or borrowing. Verify that maps and phone numbers are all up-to-date. Check for brittle gloves, missing items, operation electronics, and anything else that could go wrong that you wouldn't want to face in an emergency.
Send an email to your home computer with a list of items you'll need to restock it, or print your list. You may not remember once you leave the office.

"
"
Evaluate where you work and how far you live from work.,
Make a family emergency plan.,
Create a buddy system with a coworker.",How to Create an Urban Emergency Evacuation Kit for Work3," Don't think of it in regular transportation terms. Ask yourself what you would do if you had to get home without the use of a car or public transportation during an emergency. What would you have to wear to get home from work on foot, and how long would it take?

, Discuss with your family what you may do in an emergency if they can't reach you by cell phone. Discuss your options and what scenarios would be practical. Knowing what your actions may be will enable them to assist even if you can't communicate during the emergency.


If your family hears of an emergency, they may be able to pick up your kids, meet you at a meeting place, or be ready to spring into action when they get your call, text, or third-party message. Have a family action plan.

, Coordinate with your co-workers and exchange ideas for creating individual jump-and-run bags ideal for your situation, urban area, and workplace.


If you work with someone who also lives near you, discuss in advance and plan on using the buddy system to get home together.
Have them pack a bag so you each have supplies.
Talk to management about turning kit-making into an office social or emergency planning exercise. Get permission for everyone to bring their items, pack them as a team, and make a store trip for forgotten supplies.

Place a handful of chili pepper seeds in between sheets of damp paper towels.,
Seal the seeds and paper towels in a container.,
Keep the seeds in a warm airing cupboard.,
Check the seeds after two to five days.",How to Grow Chili Peppers Indoors2," The seeds should be in a flat, single layer so that the moisture is evenly distributed.

, A plastic container with a tight lid or a large sealable plastic bag works best.

, Both warmth and moisture are necessary for germination.

, If they have swelled up, they are ready to plant. Some seeds may even have tiny sprouts shooting through.

"
"
Fill your pot with potting mix.,
Plant your seeds in the pot.,
Sprinkle loose compost over the seeds.,
Spritz the seeds with water.,
Monitor your container for seedling growth.",How to Grow Chili Peppers Indoors3," Keep approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of empty space between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.

, The seeds should be spaced 2 inches (5 centimeters) apart from one another.

, You should only have about 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeters) of compost covering the seeds, just enough provide minimal protection.

, Spray the seeds with water as often as necessary in order to keep the soil moist. Water is essential to chili peppers, especially in the early stages of planting.

, Depending on the variety of chili pepper you chose, the first sprout may appear above the soil anywhere between one and six weeks.

"
"
Keep your chili peppers near a sunny window.,
Invest in a fluorescent grow light.,
Provide daily air circulation, but keep your peppers away from drafty areas.,
Thoroughly soak your peppers after sprouts appear above the soil.,
Encourage growth by giving your plants a vegetable fertilizer on a monthly basis.,
Harvest your peppers one at a time.",How to Grow Chili Peppers Indoors4," A window that faces west or south may provide the best light and the most warmth. Chili peppers thrive on full sun, so place your plants as close to the window as possible to maximize sun exposure.

, If you are unable to provide your chili peppers with enough natural light indoors, place them beneath a grow light, instead. The lights should be positioned approximately six inches above the plants, and your peppers need the light to remain on for 14 to 16 hours each day in order to receive enough warmth and light.

, Open a window or turn a fan on low for a few hours each day. Ideally, the air should remain room temperature to moderately warm. Continual hot or cold drafts could hinder growth, however, so keep your peppers away from air conditioning and heating vents.

, When the surface of the soil is just barely dry to the touch, give your chili peppers more water. Water the plant until excess water begins to drain out of the container's bottom hole.

, Use a balanced 15-15-15 fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.


The three numbers on a bag of fertilizer refer to the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that fertilizer contains. A 15-15-15 fertilizer has equal parts of all three elements, meaning that the foliage, root system, flowers, and fruit of your pepper plant all receive an equal dose of food. Nitrogen improves the foliage, potassium improves the flowering and overall strength of a plant, and phosphorus improves the roots and fruit.

, Note the standard size and color—red, orange, yellow, or green—for the variety of chili pepper you chose to plant. Once your peppers reach these specifications, use shears or scissors to snip the stem directly above the pepper. Chili pepper plants can take 90 days after germination to yield peppers that are ready for harvest.

Put both folded items into your zip lock bag.,
Add the following items to the bag:


A Swiss Army knife.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Pocket Survival Kit (Temperate Climate)," The garbage bags can come in handy for waterproofing, water collecting, insulation in layers or if one was stuffed with boughs or needles, extremely large storage potential, small amount of space needed for empty storage, and weight.;
, Tin foil can be useful for signaling, cooking, waterproofing, water collecting (can be made into a primitive cup), moderate storage potential, heat reflection, small amount of space needed for empty storage, and is very light weight.

, By this time your kit should look like the one to the right.

, A Leatherman tool is not recommended because its hard, brittle steel has the potential to break in the cold. Hard steel is industry standard now is because it does not dull as easily. In the image, compare the Leatherman at the bottom to the older jackknife above it. The jackknife has undergone 50 years of use because of the soft steel used in its construction, with the downside being that it needs sharpening often. When weighing soft steel vs. hard, weight should be given to the fact that one has a very tangible need to keep one's survival implement in one piece. That is the main advantage of soft steel vs. hard. You should add a Leatherman as an option - it's nice to have as long as it's in one piece. But consider it an also item.
Flint/magnesium starter - easy to use, can light in very wet conditions.
Thick roll of electrical tape - can function as rope, adhesive, straps; bring for durability, weight.
Two smaller zip lock bags - good for water collecting, storage potential; can be made into a primitive cup.
Several small bottles to hold the following liquids and supplies:

Honey: antiseptic, high energy intake, low to no spoilage.
Fir Sap: adhesive, flammability, high vitamin C for immunity during low energy phases, antiseptic properties, good for a sore throat.
Salt: preservation, spice, intestinal cleanser in larger amounts, helps your water supply go further as it encourages fluid retention.
Mini Fishing Kit: Includes sinkers, swivels, fishing line, hooks and artificial bait.
Black Walnut: A poison poured into a stream during a survival situation to kill and provide safe fish meat to eat if they are not biting.
Cotton Balls: Used For lighting fires and first aid.
Band-Aids Basic first aid.

Watch its lifespan.",How to Grow a Sensitive Plant (Mimosa pudica)," Plant Mimosa pudica seeds indoors in spring, at any time before the last frost.If you have growing lights and good temperature control, you may plant them indoors at any time of year., Take off the brown outer covering. Then you will have a greenish seed.

Gently expose a small bit of the white flesh inside. Tweezers have worked well for this part, though it may be hard.

, Mimosa pudica can grow in most well-drained soil, even if low in nutrients.For best results, however, try a mix of loam and dry, aerating materials, such as two parts loam, two parts peat moss, and one part sand or perlite.If you don't want to make your own mix, most all-purpose commercial potting mixes have similar ratios, and should work well enough.

, The seeds are more likely to germinate if you weaken the tough outer seed coat first. Soak the seeds in bowl of hot water for 30 minutes — or up to 24 hours if you want to play it safe.(You may let the water cool as the seeds soak.)

, Place each seed just barely below the surface of the soil, about 3mm (⅛ in.) down.It's likely that most of your seeds won't germinate, so these extra seeds will minimize wasted effort.


You can start the seeds in a seed tray or in 7 cm (3 in.) pots., Water until the soil is slightly moist, but not soggy. Water again whenever the soil is about to dry out.If you're worried about getting the right amount of water, place the flowerpot in a shallow dish of water. Let sit ten minutes or until the top of the soil feels damp, then discard the excess water., If sensitive plants do not get enough sun, they may close their leaves. Put them in a location where they receive full sun for most of the day, or partial shade if you live in a very hot region.In ideal conditions with temperatures around 70ºF (21ºC), the seeds may germinate in under a week. In less ideal conditions, or if you didn't soak the seeds, this may take two to four weeks.Some of your seeds may survive colder nighttime temperatures, but they may end up slow-growing or fragile. Never expose the seeds to frost.
If the room is too cool or too dry, cover the pot with plastic wrap to trap heat and moisture. Remove this as soon as the first seedling appears., If more than one seedling sprouts in the same pot, move the smallest ones to another pot once they are a few centimeters (1–2 inches) high. Once your plant reaches maturity, transplant it to a larger pot whenever the roots come out the drainage hole or press against the sides of the container.

, The soil should remain moist at all times, but never soggy.If the sensitive plant is in a dry room, mist it with room temperature occasionally, or place it on a humidity tray., Sensitive plants are an invasive weed in many areas. Unless you are in one of their native habitats in tropical America, you may want to grow sensitive plants indoors. Gardeners worldwide report the plant taking over their lawns.In Australia, you are legally required to minimize the spread of mimosa pudica seeds off your property., Dilute a balanced fertilizer to half the strength recommended on the label. Apply to the soil once a week during the growing season, and once a month during winter.Avoid direct contact with the roots.

, Since it is a tropical plant, Mimosa pudica will grow best if nighttime temperatures are 70ºF (21ºC) or higher.If temperatures fall below 65ºF (18ºC), move the plant to a warmer room or keep the plant warm in other ways.Adult plants can survive temperatures as low as 40ºF (4.5 °C), but are at risk of damage or death. Keep an eye out for yellow leaves and stems, which are signs of possible cold damage., It's normal for the stem to fall over and creep along the ground once the plant matures.Provide a trellis or sturdy plant to support it, or allow enough horizontal space for it to grow. Some sensitive plants grow more than 1 meter (3 ft) high or 2 meters (6.6 ft) horizontally, but in temperate zones they will more likely reach half this size., Mimosa pudica can survive for at least two years in tropical climates, but are usually annual plants in temperate zones.Even if your plant survives after its first bloom (usually in summer), you may have better results letting it die and collecting its seeds for next spring.


To collect seeds, let the pods dry on the plant, then break them open and collect the seeds."

Prepare a soil mix.,
Plant anthurium in a pot 1/3 full of this soil mix.,
Keep in a warm or hot location, with indirect sun.,
Keep the air humid.,
Keep the soil moist, but not soaked.,
Provide a stake if the anthurium is drooping.,
Fertilize your anthurium plant cautiously.,
Transfer to a larger pot whenever necessary.,
Start with seeds for an added challenge.,
Harvest ripe anthurium fruit.,
Remove the pulp.,
Prepare a potting mix for the seeds.,
Plant the seeds and potting mix in a flowerpot or tray, with a clear covering.,
Lightly moisten the potting mix.,
Keep in a warm environment, away from direct sunlight.",How to Grow Anthurium Plants," Anthurium prefers a coarse, well-draining soil. Try a mixture of equal parts perlite, peat moss, and pine bark.Alternatively, combine three parts potting mix with one part coarse material such as orchid bark or lava rock.If the anthurium plant is at least a year old, it may prefer an even coarser material, achieved by adding a handful of crumbled aquarium charcoal, coarse river sand, or small pieces of broken brick.


Anthurium plants can only grow outdoors in USDA Hardiness Zones 11 and 12, corresponding to minimum annual temperatures of 40ºF (4.4ºC) or higher.In any other climate, use a flowerpot and keep them indoors. The ideal temperature range for anthurium is 60-85ºF (15-30ºC).;
, The anthurium plant should be kept in a pot only slightly larger than itself, or its roots may rot and die.Fill a pot 1/3 of the way full with the prepared potting mix and place the anthurium on top. Fill in with additional potting mix around the sides. Typically, the roots of the plant will continue to grow above the potting material, so begin with this low level of fill to delay the need to transplant your anthurium to a larger pot.If you are using a potting mix with less coarse material or worse drainage, consider one or two layers of pebbles at the base of the container to speed up water drainage.

, Anthurium plants thrive in daytime temperatures between 80 and 90ºF (27–32ºC). If this is not possible, the plant will typically survive indoors at temperatures above 60ºF (15.5ºC), but warmer is better.Avoid direct sun, which may burn the plant, but keep it in a bright location to encourage blooming. A south- or east-facing windowsill is a good option (north- or east-facing if you are in the Southern Hemisphere).Place the plant 5–8 feet (1.5–2.4 m) (1.5-2.5m) from a window for some gentle sunlight.
If night temperatures dip below 40ºF (4.4ºC), the leaves may yellow and growth will likely slow. The plant rarely survives long if temperatures fall below freezing (32ºF / 0ºC).Do not keep plants directly in front of heaters and heating vents, which may burn them.

, Mimic the humid, tropical environment of anthurium plants by keeping the room at 80% humidity or higher.Placing the pot in an aquarium or a shallow tray of pebbles in water will help achieve a high level of humidity. Mist the plant weekly, or daily if you live in a dry climate, making sure to spray portions of the stem that have grown over the lip of the pot., Water in small amounts as necessary to prevent the soil from drying out. Even in hot weather, the soil does not need watering more than once every two or three days, as the plant does not soak up large amounts of water from its roots.


If the leaves turn yellow (but not brown and withered), this may be a sign of overwatering. Let the soil dry out before watering again if this occurs., Most anthurium plants in nature, but probably the minority sold as houseplants, are ""epiphytic,"" meaning they grow on other plants instead of in soil. If your plant is vine-like and failing to support itself, use a stake or other wooden object for the plant to climb up. You do not need to move epiphytic anthurium out of the soil; it will not cause them harm., Newly planted anthurium should not need fertilizer for at least a few months. If you decide to apply fertilizer to encourage vivid colors and growth, use a slow release 3:1:2 fertilizer and dilute it to 1/4 the recommended strength before applying according to the instructions.You can fertilize your anthurium every other time you water it, or as needed.

, Anthurium plants often build up a mound of roots above the surface of the soil. About once a year, or if the soil begins to dry out rapidly between watering, pack a layer of peat or sphagnum moss over the lower 1/2 or 2/3 of the exposed stem. Keep this layer moist and wait for roots to grow out of the buried portion of the stem. Once they have extended throughout this layer, cut the stem with a clean, sharp knife at the base of the soil mixture, and transfer the buried stem into a new pot, with the buried stem below the level of the soil.Remember, pot anthurium in a container only 1/3 full of soil, so the stem is below the rim of the pot.

, Commercially grown anthurium are typically propagated using cuttings and grafts. It is possible to grow anthurium from seeds, but the resulting plant may have unpredictable characteristics if it was produced by a hybrid mother plant, and may be more difficult to grow. Outside of tropical areas, it may be difficult to even locate fresh anthurium seeds.


If you are growing an anthurium cutting or an adult plant, skip to the start of another section.

, Anthurium seeds must be fresh and moist when planted.If you do not have an anthurium plant yourself, ask another gardener or garden store whether you can collect some of their plants' fruits, which are rarely used. If you live in a tropical New World region, you may be able to harvest wild anthurium plants. There are hundreds if not thousands of anthurium species, so you may wish to refer to a local plant identification booklet.



Warning: The fruit, along with all other parts of the anthurium plant, are toxic and should not be eaten.

, The pulp of the fruit, surrounding the seed, may prevent the seed from growing or cause mold. Rub off as much pulp as you can with your fingers, then drop the seed into a cup of water. Leave it in there for a day or two while the pulp material detaches and floats to the top.Warning: Some species of anthurium may irritate the skin. Using gloves is recommended.

, Prepare a potting mix with equal parts sphagnum peat moss, pearlite and pine bark. The soil needs of anthurium seeds are similar to the needs of adult plants.

, Anthurium plants are native to the tropics, and require warm, humid environments. There are a couple different ways you can recreate this environment:


Place the potting mix in 4 inch (10 centimeter) flowerpots. Place a seed on the surface of the soil, one per flowerpot, and place a glass canning jar upside down over each pot.Or layer the bottom of a shallow, earthenware tray with your prepared potting mix. Scatter the seeds evenly over this, and cover with a flat sheet of glass or plastic over the tray, leaving a gap of air between the sheet and the soil., Wet the potting mix slightly, then cover with the clear barrier as described above to keep the environment moist. Wetting the mossy mixture may also help prevent the seed from sinking beneath the surface, which reduces the likelihood of germination.


If tap water in your area is hard, use bottled water instead.

, Keep the potting mix at a temperature of about 80ºF (27ºC), in an area of indirect sun or partial shade. Keep the soil moist while you wait for the seeds to germinate, as they are very vulnerable to drying out at this stage. Within about 20–30 days, the seeds should sprout and grow their first root and leaves, after which they can be moved to a larger container and cared for, as described above.Move the young plant carefully, as the roots may be fragile. Ideally, use a scoop to pick up the mossy material surrounding the plant, and drop this gently onto the new pot after preparing it as described below.

Assess your aloe vera plant.,
Cut off some aloe vera leaves.,
Clean off the cut aloe vera.",How to Extract Aloe Vera1," Before you start to harvest any aloe vera gel, you'll want to be sure you're working with a mature plant. A mature and healthy aloe plant is recognizable by its large, green leaves: they should be about 8 inches (20 cm) long. Aloe grows from the center outward, making the outermost leaves the oldest, largest, and richest of the leaves to use., Depending on how much aloe vera you need, you will probably not need or want to use an entire aloe vera plant for this. Cut off one of the outermost leaves of an aloe vera plant using a sharp knife at the base of the plant. The leaves do not grow back, but by only cutting a portion of the plant, you will leave the whole of it to continue to grow and produce more aloe vera for you in the future.


Be sure that your knife is sharp to cause minimal damage to the plant.

, Once you have cut the leaf, a yellow substance will begin to ooze from the cut. In order to keep the plant from making a mess, you'll want to point the leaf vertically, cut end down, into a bowl to allow the substance to continue coming out. Use a pitcher of water and your fingers to clean the leaf from top to bottom, directing the water into the bowl as well.The yellow ooze produced in this step is a sap called aloe latex.It is not the aloe vera gel, which will be clear and thick in appearance, and you do not want it to contaminate your gel because it has laxative properties that may mess up your digestive track.

Provide your houseplant with water as often as needed to maintain moist soil, but make sure it is not overly wet.

",How to Grow Avocados as Houseplants," Squeeze the fruit gently to check for a small amount of give. The avocado should be soft, but not mushy.;
,, Remove the seed from the fruit.

,, Slice a thin piece of the top and bottom of the seed using a sharp knife. Opening the seed slightly will aid in its germination.

,, Place the dish in a dark area, such as a closet, for 2 to 3 weeks.

, Observe the seed periodically for root growth. When the roots are 3 inches (7.62 cm) in length, the seed is ready to plant.

,, Face the pointed end of the seed upward and balance it with the toothpicks on the sides of the glass, making sure 1/4 of the bottom of the seed is resting in water.

,, Check the water level and refill when the level goes below 1/4 of the bottom half of the seed.

, In about 2 to 4 weeks, the seed should crack and a root should appear, followed by a stem. When the root is about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) long, it will be ready for potting.

, Line a small planting pot with drainage holes with a small amount of gravel. Fill the rest of the pot with potting soil.

, Leave the top sprouts of the root system exposed, as well as 1/3 of the upper part of the seed. Pat the dirt firmly around the seed and water.

Cut off the top third of the leaves.,
Remove the spines.,
Remove the top and bottom layers.,
Remove and store the gel.",How to Extract Aloe Vera2," Because of the thinness of the top, pointed part of the aloe vera leaf, you will waste more time trying to get gel from this portion than is cost effective. Instead, cut this portion off and discard it.You will need to repeat the previous rinsing step for the top portion as it now will also produce yellow ooze.
Depending on the size of your aloe vera leaves, you might find it easier to extract the gel by cutting the thick portion of the leaf into additional pieces, either along the leaves' length, width, or both ways.

, Before you can get at the gel core of the leaf, you'll need to remove the hard, spine edges on either side of each leaf. Carefully cut them away, remembering to move the knife away from yourself and your hands so as to avoid potentially cutting yourself in the process.Be sure that the aloe vera leaves are also dry before you begin this portion of the cutting as a slippery leaf could lead to potential accidents.
Make your cut as close to the spines as possible so that you don't lose a lot of gel in the process.

, With your leaf laying flat on a cutting board, carefully slice away the skin of the aloe vera leaf. This will be the thin, outer green layer you see. Run your knife between it and the the thick, clear gel at the center, and repeat this process for the remaining top layer by flipping it to the bottom.If you would prefer not to use a knife for this step due to the potential for cutting yourself, you can choose to use a fruit peeler instead., At this point, you should have slabs of clear aloe vera gel. If you see any bits of leaf left on them, trim them off, and feel free to cube the gel for easier storage by cutting them with your knife. Be sure to rinse the aloe vera gel itself 2-3 times when you're finished to be sure that it's free of any aloe latex residue.Use a spoon to scrape up any excess gel left over along the skin.
Store all of the gel extract you get in a new glass or bowl separate from the water you used to wash the leaves with.

, For better looks, choose smooth rocks, or rocks with interesting patterns on them. You can paint them for a more colourful garden.

, Choose hardier plants for a cooler windowsill. If you spend a lot of time away from home, choose plants that need very little watering. If you like natural colour, choose plants that flower a lot.


If you have a window box, plant them. Make a hole in the compost the same size as the pot of the plant that you're transplanting. Water the plant and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Put your hand over the soil in the pot, turn the pot upside down and gently squeeze the pot until the whole set slides out. Set the roots and soil into the hole in the window box, firm the compost down around it and add more if necessary.

Buy hyacinth bulbs from your local floral or garden shop.,
Cool your hyacinth bulbs before planting them.,
Purchase pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs to speed up the process.,
Find a suitable container to grow your hyacinth bulb.,
Add water to the container.,
Place your bulb in the container.,
Choose a cool, dark place for your bulb.,
Move the bulb to a warm, bright spot when it blossoms.,
Place your hyacinth in a brighter spot to help it fully bloom.",How to Grow a Hyacinth Bulb in Water," Hyacinth bulbs are typically sold in bundles of 3, and there are often deals when you buy multiple bundles at once. Bundles of hyacinth bulbs that are not pre-chilled usually cost $5-$7. Bundles of hyacinth bulbs that are pre chilled usually cost $12-$15.;
, All hyacinths need a cooling period of 12-14 weeks to develop an adequate root system, otherwise they will not properly grow. If you cannot find pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs, this step is absolutely vital.


Store your bulbs in a dark area with temperatures between 35-45º Fahrenheit. Great examples of these locations include fridges, outdoor sheds, garages, or even potted damp sand.
Be careful when storing your bulbs in the fridge. Certain fruits produce ethylene gas that will cause your hyacinth bulbs to rot and/or become sterile. If you decide to cool your bulbs in the fridge, don’t place any fruit in the fridge during the cooling process.Don’t expose bulbs to freezing temperatures, otherwise they will become damaged.
Wear gloves when handling hyacinth bulbs, as they can cause a skin irritation., Most floral and garden shops sell pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs, so be sure to ask for them when you're shopping. Buying pre-chilled bulbs will speed up your hyacinth growing process by 8-12 weeks.Pre-chilled hyacinth bulbs can sometimes be a bit more expensive than the non-chilled bulbs, but the time they'll save you will be well with the extra cost.

, Bulb vases, also called forcing jars, are the perfect shape for forcing bulbs; they are designed with a narrow neck that holds the bulb above water, and a wide base that allows the roots to dangle and grow in the water. The wide base of bulb vases will allow your hyacinth to fully bloom without knocking over the vase., Fill your container with enough water so that it is up to, but not touching, the bottom of the hyacinth bulb. Leave 1/4″ between the water and the base of the bulb, as bulbs sitting in water are prone to rot. Using forcing jars are ideal because they are cinched at the waist and allow the bulbs to sit nicely above the water.You can also add a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of aquarium charcoal in the water to keep it clean and clear.

, Set your bulb on top of the cinched neck of your vase, with the root end facing down. Make sure that your bulb is sitting just above the water, but that no water is actually touching it. Its roots will slowly grow into water in the base of the vase, and the hyacinth will slowly begin to bloom.If you would like to grow your bulb and use it again next year, plant it in a potting mix instead of water. Bulbs forced this way in water will not bloom again next year, but those planted in soil may.

, Place the hyacinth bulb and vase in a cool and dark area (40-55º F), such as your garage or refrigerator. Keep cool for roughly 4 weeks, or until the hyacinth's root system has developed in the water of the jar and growth from the top of the bulb has begun.


As previously mentioned, do not store your hyacinths in a refrigerator with fruits. The gas from fruits will damage your hyacinth's growth.Change the container's water twice per week. Keeping fresh water in your vase will help your hyacinth to bloom fully and beautifully., Your hyacinth needs to be transferred to a warmer, somewhat brighter place (50-60º F) once it is ready. You'll know the hyacinth is ready to be moved once the foliage has grown to be about 2 inches tall and the root system has extended to the bottom of the vase. Keep the bulbs in this location for about a week, or until its shoots have turned green., Move the hyacinth plant to a warmer location (roughly 65º F) so that it will fully bloom. Hyacinths reach toward sunlight, so turn your vase daily to prevent the plant from leaning in one direction. After 2 weeks or so, your hyacinths will be fully fragrant and bloomed, and should last for another 2 weeks before they begin to wilt.Although you want to move the hyacinth to a brighter location, avoid direct sunlight.
To make your bloom last longer, place your hyacinth plant in the refrigerator at night.
Enjoy the fragrance of the plant. Once the hyacinth flowers have bloomed, their scent will be beautiful.
Throw out the bulbs once the hyacinth has died. Water forcing uses all of the energy that bulbs have to offer, and the bulbs will be too weak to re-bloom. You'll have to get more bulbs to grow more hyacinths."

Scoop away the mold.,
Let the soil dry.,
Add a natural anti-fungal to your soil.,
Keep the soil clean.",How to Get Rid of Mold on Houseplants1," If you see mold on your soil, it is likely confined to the top layer. You can use a spoon to easily remove the mold. The visible mold in your soil is like a saprophyte, which is harmless to you and your family. However, leaving the mold there will leave your plant susceptible to root rot.If there is an extensive amount of mold—if it has spread to the pot itself—repot the plant. Use high-quality potting soil.;
, Once the mold is scooped out, or your plant has been repotted, allow the soil to dry out before watering it again. If your plant requires moist soil, wait until the surface is dry. If not, you should wait until you have dry soil 2 or 3 inches down. Continue letting your soil dry like this in between watering., The mold spores are likely to be spread through the soil and it will easily come back if you don’t do this. You can sprinkle cinnamon, baking soda, or apple cider vinegar on top of your soil as natural an anti-fungal. This acts as a natural deterrent to mold growth and won’t harm your plant., Keep debris like rotting leaves and plant parts off of your soil. They can cause fungal growth. Trim your plants whenever necessary."

Identify the mold.,
Take your plant outdoors.,
Wet a paper towel.,
Cut off the affected leaves.,
Spray and move the plant.",How to Get Rid of Mold on Houseplants2," Before you act, you should identify if your mold is active or dormant. If your mold is dormant, it will appear as a light color and it will be powdery. If it looks soft and fuzzy, your mold is active., Once you identify that there is mold on your plant, you want to bring it outside. This will help keep the mold from spreading—if it’s active. While outside, you want to find a place that is far away from other trees or garden plants because you’ll be putting them at risk if you clean your houseplant near them.

, Dampen a paper towel and wipe the mold from your leaves. Freshen your paper towel after each wipe. Once there are no parts of the paper towel that haven’t touched the mold, use a new one. Otherwise, you’ll simply be spreading the mold. This process will take away mostly the dormant mold., If your mold is still visible after you’ve wiped it with your damp paper towel, the remaining mold is active. Identify the leaves that are affected by the mold and cut them off at the stem using a knife. Dispose of these leaves., Now that you’ve removed the mold, you need to spray it with a fungicide, bought from your gardening store, to keep the mold from coming back. Spray the plant with the fungicide outside and then move the plant back indoors. Place it somewhere bright. Monitor your plant to be sure the mold doesn’t come back. If it does, simply repeat these steps.Keep your plant in a temperature around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
Keep the soil dryer than you normally would.
Provide your plant beneficial air circulation.

Keep it clean.",How to Get Rid of Mold on Houseplants3," Starting with a sterile soil will help prevent mold. When you bring home a new plant, remove it from the soil it came in—there might be mold in it. Gently remove the plant and repot in new sterile soil., Add more light and a fan to your plant. More light is a great way to have mold control on your houseplants. Ensure that it gets plenty of sunlight. Likewise, your plant will be less likely to grow mold if you give it proper air circulation. Simply use an oscillating fan on a low setting., Over-watering your plant leads to mold problems. Always check to make sure that the top of your soil is dry before you water. Sometimes, this drying takes longer than other times. It is better to check with a touch than to stay on a strict watering schedule with your plants., Keep the dead leaves and other debris away from your soil. These contribute to mold problems in your soil and plants. Trim dead parts of your plant regularly. Also, keep your leaves clean. Wipe them down regularly to get rid of excess dust and dirt.

Harvest your kitchen garden as the vegetables mature.",How to Develop a Kitchen Garden,"


A kitchen garden should be in a sunny spot with a water source nearby and easy to access.
A protected area, such as one near the house or near a fence, will help to keep animals and pests from the garden while attracting pollinating insects such as bees.;
,


This will be influenced by the location.
Kitchen gardens can be small or large and can be in containers, a raised bed or in the ground.
Raised garden beds are an easy way to start your garden, since they are smaller and do not involve tilling. Raised beds can be made from cut wood or purchased as a kit from your local home improvement or garden store. Soil is added to the bed and should be replenished as needed.

,


Kitchen gardens should have rich, fertile soil that is well drained.
Use a shovel or spade to turn over the dirt in the area. If necessary, till the area and break up large clumps of dirt to allow for better drainage. Remove weeds, including their roots, to prevent them from returning.
Amend the soil as necessary by adding compost or topsoil. Use a hand till to mix the dirt. If you're using a raised box or containers, the soil should be replaced or replenished to maximize the nutrients available for the plants.

,


Take your climate and the growing season in your area into consideration when choosing vegetables.
Include plants that you plan to use in your cooking. Kitchen garden ideas include tomatoes, snap peas, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce and herbs.
Buy seeds online or find seeds or seedlings at your local nursery.
Combine flowers and vegetables for healthy partnerships and an aesthetically pleasing look. This is known as a “potager” style garden. This kind of companion planting can be beneficial for your harvest. Certain types of flowers can attract the pests that would otherwise harm the vegetables.
Perennial fruit trees and flowers can be used as border plants and will return each year.

,


Consider the mature height and spread required for the different plants. Remember to leave room to access your plants for harvesting.
Decide which plants may need a trellis and find the right spot for it.
Determine how you will use plants and hardscape edging to define your garden space and design any pathways for your kitchen garden.

,


Water your plants before planting to loosen the root balls.
Pay attention to plant spacing and timing, which will vary by plant. Plant the vegetables or flowers by digging holes with a plant spade that are wider than the root ball and just as deep. Fill dirt back into the hole around the plants and pat the soil down. Add mulch to protect the plants and keep moisture in.
Water the new plants immediately. Continue watering regularly, but do not over water.

,


Harvest times will vary depending on the vegetables, the timing of plantings and your location. If you include a variety of plants, you can enjoy fresh vegetables and flowers from your garden throughout the growing season.

Create a relaxed and informal set up.,
Focus on the addition of scented plants.,
Make the garden cozy.,
Include roses.",How to Start a Cottage Garden," The beds of a cottage garden should always be informal and relaxed. A cottage garden breaks the rules, with plants being placed close together and seemingly at random. In reality, however, it takes time and care to design a garden that appears entirely natural.;
, The garden should be full of heady aromas. Use the likes of rosemary, lavender, and honeysuckle, which provide great scent and colour. They can also be cut and placed indoors to perfume the house as owners of cottage gardens have done for centuries.

, A cottage garden should always feel warm and cozy, perhaps even a little claustrophobic. Use height such as arches, hedges, trellises, and pergolas to turn the garden into your own enclosed haven. Cover timber awnings and other house features with trailing plants, such as honeysuckle.

, No cottage garden is complete without roses, in both shrub and bush form, and even climbing, perhaps creating a dramatic arch for your entrance.

"
Aim for a low-mow or mow-free lawn.,
Create sandy mounds for ground cover plants.,
Take advantage of frost-free areas of your garden space.,
Maintain the garden by removing non-natives.",How to Start a Native Plant Garden in New Zealand," Let the following natives take place of your usual lawn:
Mercury Bay weed (Dichondra repens) - native to New Zealand and numerous other countries



 



Dichondra brevifola







Pratia angulata - white flowering plant







Leptinella species - honey-scented





;
, Sandy mounds can easily be created in your garden using gravel covered with sand. This will replicate the conditions liked by many native ground cover plants and the plants will not require much watering or weeding. One plant suitable to grow on your mounds is Leptinella nana, a tiny cotula, which is quite endangered and would benefit greatly from you fostering it in your garden.

, The narrow strip running alongside your house and fence may seem ""useless"" to you but in many places, it offers a frost-free haven for a couple of frost tender native tree species. Clean the area up, add some ferns at ground level and consider planting two special deciduous natives down the side:

Aristotelia serrata, a local wineberry; and







Fuschia excorticata, the tree fuchsia (see photo accompanying article)







, This will allow the natives to take a stronger toehold and take over garden space previously occupied by non-native species. A little bit of effort up front will pay dividends in reduced maintenance down the track. Moreover, you will be contributing to the local biodiversity by creating homes and encouraging spaces for birds, lizards, butterflies and other species that make the most of native plants.

Locate your garden where it will be likely to thrive.,
Test your soil to see whether it needs fertilizers or amendments.,
Strive to keep your garden simple.,
Keep your flower beds narrow so that you can reach the plants easily.,
Consider using ground covers instead of grass to cut down on landscape maintenance.,
Build patios and decks to simplify your gardening chores.,
Provide edging around beds and trees to help make mowing easier.,
Purchase good quality plants that are either native to your area or easily adaptable to your climate.,
Follow proper planting techniques.,
Inspect your plants for pest damage or disease regularly.,
Mulch regularly.,
Install an irrigation system to make watering even easier.",How to Set up a Low Maintenance Garden," Be sure the location gets enough light, but avoid placing it in an area where too much scorching sun or hot summer winds will force you to constantly water.;
, Improve the soil by recycling materials such as grass clippings and leaves found around your home.

, Simplicity is the key to a low maintenance garden.


Adding some extras such as water features, wildlife feeders, and such, for example, requires more maintenance.
Plant fewer types of plants, but plant them in mass. Having many of the same kind of flower or shrub growing together makes tending them easier. They will have the same requirements and you can provide necessities such as the proper amount of water and fertilizer all at once.

, If you have a wide bed, provide stepping stones or a path which makes easy access possible.

, Lawns require constant mowing, watering and treatments for weed control and fertilizer. Using ground covers helps eliminate those chores.


Ground cover is especially good for steep slopes on your property as it helps prevent erosion. Many ground cover plants do well in shady spots where grass often doesn't grow well, yet requires little or no maintenance compared to grass.
Most ground covers are low maintenance plants that can be grown easily and are simple to maintain. Ground covers that possess flowers also add color and beauty to your yard.

, Keep plants in pots that are easy to maintain and change out.

, You might also think about planting ground cover or using gravel around the base of a tree to keep from having to weed there.

, Check your plants for pest damage and be sure they are healthy. Strong healthy plants will grow more easily and make less work for you.

, Be sure the plants are put into holes at the proper depth. Water frequently until the root system is well established. Having well-established plants makes them easier to maintain.

, Treating these problems early will avoid widespread problems in your garden.

, Mulching cuts down on weeds and helps retain moisture, requiring you to water less frequently. Gravel, bark, and pine needles are some mulches you might consider using.

, You might think of using drip irrigation or soaker hoses.

Prune in late summer or early fall.,
Wear gloves.,
Snip off new shoots at the base of the plant.,
Cut oleander stems to about half height you’d like for the overall plant.,
Shape your oleander.",How to Prune Oleander1," On the whole, oleanders are low-maintenance plants that don’t need regular pruning. However, you should aim to do a major pruning of your oleander at least once a year during late summer or early fall. This pruning will help you shape your plant and stimulate healthy growth.Pruning at this time won’t interfere with the blooming of the plant, because it is after the plant has already bloomed for the season.
Don’t prune past October. Pruning too late can make the recently cut sections of the plant vulnerable during winter.;
, It’s essential to wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Oleander is poisonous, and while for the most part it’s only dangerous when ingested, it can cause skin irritation and inflammation when handled. That is why it’s best to wear gloves when pruning or handling the plant.You may also consider wearing goggles if you have sensitive skin or eyes.
Be aware that the toxin in oleander is primarily in the sap of the plant.

, New shoots, also called suckers or basal shoots, are offshoots of the plant that grow up out of the base of the plant. Use sharp gardening shears to snip them as close to the base as you can. You can also dig up the dirt around the shoot and tear them out of the ground to remove them.These shoots can be harmful to the overall health of the plant because the plant will start to dedicate its energy into maintaining the shoot, rather than investing all its energy in the oleander.

, If your oleander is too tall and its size is a problem, you will want to cut it down to size. Since pruning oleander actually encourages growth and branching, cut stems at half the desired height of the plant. For instance, if you’d like your oleander to be four feet tall, cut stems at two feet. Your oleander will continue to grow, and will reach four feet when the branches grow in.If your plant is more or less the size you’d like, you do not have to do any drastic cuts.

, After cutting the stems to the desired heights, decide if you want to change the overall shape of the plant. When cutting branches, make your cut with sharp gardening shears just above the leaf nodes. The nodes are the sections where three leaves come out from the branch. Cutting just above the nodes encourages flowering.Your plant may have some scraggly or overhanging branches that distract from the natural shape of the plant. Cut these branches to emphasize the natural shape of the plant.
You can also reshape the oleander into more of a tree-shape by cutting off branches near the bottom of the plant, leaving the area around the base clear.

"
"
Check your plant every month or so for dead growths.,
Put on gloves.,
Look at your oleander plant up close and from all sides.,
Snip off damaged branches using sharp gardening shears.,
Cut entire damaged stalks close to the roots.",How to Prune Oleander2," Apart from your annual pruning, you should also prune here and there when you see dead or damaged branches or blooms. Especially if it’s an old plant, or if it’s exposed to pests, it will benefit from pruning to remove unhealthy sections.

, Even if you’re just doing a few minor clips, still wear gloves when you are pruning oleander. Any kind of exposure can cause irritation, so even if you are just clipping a few branches, put on gloves and consider wearing long sleeves in case you brush up against the oleander., Take note of any shoots or stalks that look dead. If it is a young oleander, you may not see any. However, the older and bigger the plant is, the more sections you will see that are past their prime., Use sharp gardening shears to cut off the dead or damaged branches of your oleander. Try to cut them a few inches below where the damaged section begins. If you don’t cut off the entire damaged section, the branch won’t be able to regrow in a healthy way., If the oleander is not only damaged on its branches, but on the whole stalk, cut off the entire stalk. Oleander is an extremely resilient plant, so even cutting off an entire stalk won’t hurt the plant. This stalk will regrow eventually, and will be bushier and healthier than ever!"
"
Fertilize the plant after pruning.,
Water the oleander.,
Dispose of the cuttings.,
Wash your tools and your hands.",How to Prune Oleander3," You should aim to fertilize your oleander around three times a year. One of these times should be after your annual pruning of the plant. Your oleander will need the nutrients that fertilizer provides to regrow and blossom.Spread an even layer of fertilizer around the base of the plant. Fertilizer can be found at Home Depot, Lowe’s or gardening stores.

, You should also water oleander after any pruning. Although oleander is a tough plant that is known for surviving in hot climates, watering the plant evenly can help its regrowth. Make sure not to drench the plant, as this can be more harmful than helpful., Even just the clippings of oleander can be skin irritants if touched, or potentially harmful if ingested. Make sure to gather all the cuttings in a bag of some kind and dispose of them in a place where pets, children, or others won’t be exposed to them.Wear your gloves as you collect the clippings.

, After you have finished pruning, wash your gardening shears or any other equipment you used to trim your oleander.Washing your equipment ensures that the next time you use them you won’t run the risk of skin irritation from the oleander sap.
Even if you wore gloves, make sure to wash your hands as well as any exposed body parts, such as arms or legs.

Figure out the right time of year to harvest.,
Pick your creeping charlie leaves.,
Store the leaves in a jar or similar container.,
Submerge the creeping charlie in water.,
Remove the creeping charlie from the bowl.,
Pat the creeping charlie dry.,
Store the creeping charlie in a mason jar.,
Provide the right soil.,
Water your creeping charlie regularly.,
Provide light.,
Use fertilizer.,
Trim your plant regularly.",How to Harvest Creeping Charlie," Creeping charlie blooms in different times of year based on your region's temperature. Take into account whether you live in a warmer or cooler area before harvesting creeping charlie.In cooler climates, your creeping charlie will bloom in mid-spring or early summer. In warmer climates, such as Florida, your creeping charlie blooms in the spring or fall.
In regions around Canada, creeping charlie usually blooms from September to November.;
, Harvesting creeping charlie is simple. All you need to do is use your fingers to gently pick the leaves off the plants.The leaves are what are typically used in foods and beverages, so it's unnecessary to pick the blooms or stems.Creeping charlie leaves are somewhat fragile, so pick them gently to avoid tearing.
Pick as many leaves that are in full bloom. If you notice more leaves blooming later, pick those then.

, As you pick creeping charlie, place the leaves in a container. As creeping charlie leaves are small, a mason jar or similarly sized container should be adequate. Gently place the leaves in the container to avoid breaking them. Use the mason jar to carry them back into your home to clean., After bringing creeping charlie into your home, you should wash it. Fill a bowl of cold water and submerge the creeping charlie leaves completely. Leave the creeping charlie in the bowl until dirt has sunk to the bottom of the bowl.Times will vary based on how many leaves you're using.

, Use a skim, which is a net-like device, to remove all the herbs from the water. Set them aside on a piece of paper towel. Dump the dirty water down the sink., Use a paper towel to gently pat down the leaves on either side. Keep patting until the leaves are more or less dry.Be gentle with creeping charlie as the leaves are delicate.
You can eat creeping charlie without drying it like you would with other herbs.

, Store your creeping charlie. Take a mason jar and pour an inch of water (2.5 centimeters) on the bottom of the jar. Add your leaves to the jar and seal it slightly. Place your jar in the refrigerator until you're ready to use your creeping charlie., Creeping charlie plants thrive in most soil types. Any soil you purchase at a greenhouse should be adequate for creeping charlie. However, creeping charlie does take best to soil rich in organic substances that promote growth. Mix in things like compost, leaf mold, or manure into the flower bed or pot where you're growing your creeping charlie., Creeping charlie needs some water to thrive, like all plants. The soil should be moist, but not wet. Watering once or twice per week should be enough to keep creeping charlie growing.To determine whether creeping charlie needs watering, place your finger into the dirt. If the soil feels dry past your first knuckle, your creeping charlie needs water.
Overwatering can cause fungal problems, so only water when the soil needs it. If you're growing creeping charlie inside, make sure to use a pot with a drain hole that allows excess water to spill out into a container below.

, Creeping charlie needs access to light to thrive. However, full sun inhibits growth. Plant creeping charlie in a somewhat shaded area. If you're growing creeping charlie inside, keep the creeping charlie near a window where sunlight is blocked slightly by trees or buildings., Use a water-soluble all purpose fertilizer to promote growth. Read the instructions carefully to make sure you're using fertilizer in the proper amounts. Most fertilizers require a teaspoon of fertilizer be diluted in a gallon of water, but the precise measurements vary by type.The amount of fertilizer you need to use depends on how much creeping charlie you're growing. Read your fertilizer's label.
Apply fertilizer during the growing months, which are from May to October.

, Creeping charlie requires regular trimming to promote growth. Trim the stems back until they branch out just slightly before the plant's leaves. This is especially important if creeping charlie plants are growing into one another."

Draw a plan of your garden before you begin.,
Keep a mixture of formal and informal features in your English garden.,
Brick or stone walls can also be a part of the traditional English garden.,
Provide furniture throughout your English garden.,
Include vegetables and herbs in your English garden.,
Consider adding a topiary as a focal point in your garden.,
Decide on how much lawn you want for your garden.",How to Set up an English Garden," Study photos of English gardens to collect ideas for your own garden design. Include layouts of your planting beds and types of flowers and shrubs. Be sure to locate on your diagram where you will place garden features.


Traditionally English gardens are rectangular or square in shape. Modern versions also allow for curving lines.
The English garden usually has a focal point of some sort such as a large statue, fountain, or bird bath.
Include formal wide straight pathways in your drawing. Paths can be made using pea gravel or brick as well as stone.;
, The structures, walkways, statuary, and hedges are kept formal while the flowers are lush and informal-looking.


Traditional perennial flowers such as lavender, phlox, veronica, foxglove, roses, delphinium and lupine are among plants you might consider.
Try placing taller plants to the rear of the flower bed and keep shorter plants to the front. At times, however, placing a taller plant at the front will add to an informal look.
Formal hedges such as boxwood are often used in the English garden. Hedges form outdoor rooms that are a part of the English garden tradition. It will be necessary to keep the hedges trimmed and looking well-groomed.
Lavender can be used if you want a less formal looking hedge.
Plant different shrubs together to form a tapestry hedge. Allow the limbs to weave into each other to form the tapestry effect.
Have a well designed color scheme in your English garden. Unlike cottage gardens where many varieties and colors of flowers are desired, the lush English garden is meant to be more controlled and have a more planned appearance.
Keep your English garden well kept. Remove yellow leaves and dead-head flowers past their prime.

, The wall can be used instead of hedges to form a garden room.

, Use trellises, statuary, tables, and seating made of wood, stone or wrought iron. Comfortable benches and chairs give comfortable places to relax and add to the traditional English garden look. Provide special spots to have a tea party or luncheon.

, Place them in in a separate garden room or just let them mingle in with your other plants.

, Shrubs or ivy can trained or trimmed to form geometrical shapes or to look like animals., A small patch of grass can be used to accent your garden if you don't want a lot of lawn to tend. Or you may want to have a large green lawn upon which to play games or have picnics.

Shift away some soil from the area you plan to plant your wheat and sprinkle it across the area a few times to ensure efficient growth.,
All the soil put aside can be placed on top of the seeds and then rolled over to prevent birds getting much seeds.It will also give the impression of how it is sown in fields.

,
When the crop is about 3 centimeter (1.2 in) tall weed obvious weeds and leave ones you are unsure of.,
When the crop has started thickening and you can tell which is wheat, finish off the last weeding and leave the crop with some fertilizer to ensure a good yield for the eventual harvest.

,
You may see white line flakes on the wheat head once it has grain, if the wind hasn't been very strong lately brush your hand over the crop a few times to fertilise.

,
Once the crop is ripe ( grain heads curling over, whole crop golden in colour) it is time to cut.,
Leave the stubbles on the surface for at least a week so they can put unused nutrients in the ground.

",How to Grow Wheat in Your Garden," This will help the plants later in life.;
,, You will probably do this about twice more or until crops are bigger.

Sterilize your planter at least once per year.,
Place your planter in a safe location away from potential damages.,
Place your planter in a position that allows water to drain completely.,
Monitor the growth of every plant inside each planter.,
Use waterproofing solutions on planters made from wood and metal.",How to Maintain a Planter," This procedure will prevent your planter from retaining bacteria, viruses, and fungi, all of which are often transferred to planters from insects or mold spores.


Remove your plant from the planter, then scrub the inside of the planter to remove any loose dirt or debris using warm water and a stiff brush or dish scrubber.
Mix together 1 part bleach and 10 parts water in a tub or sink large enough in which to soak your planter.
Soak the planter in the bleach and water mixture for at least 30 minutes, then use warm water to rinse the bleach completely from the planter.
Allow the planter to dry completely before replacing your plant inside the planter. This will allow any remaining bleach residue to dissipate.;
, Sometimes, your planter can become damaged if it is exposed to rough weather or placed in areas in which pets or children often play.


Position your planter in the corner of a garden, against a wall in your home, or away from hallways or paths in which foot traffic may cause the planter to be knocked over or tampered with.
Move your planter indoors during harsh weather conditions such as freezing temperatures, strong winds, rain, sleet, or hail, all of which can tip your planter over or cause your planter to crack.
If you cannot move a planter inside during freezing temperatures, remove the plate or saucer from underneath the planter if it contains excess water. If the excess water becomes frozen, it may crack your planter or the plate itself.
If your planter is too large to move indoors, insulate the planter from cold weather by placing bubble wrap around the planter, then covering the entire planter with a tarp. This will protect your planter from being exposed directly to freezing water, which can cause the planter to crack.

, If excessive amounts of water cannot drain from a planter, the inside of your planter will rot, in addition to the soil and plant itself.


Raise the planter up and off the ground by mounting it on bricks, blocks, or decorative planter feet, which can be purchased from most gardening retailers.

, When plants grow, they can sometimes cause a planter to crack or break if the roots or weight of the plant become too large for the planter to support.


Inspect the drainage holes underneath your planter when you notice that your plant has been growing. If you can see the roots of your plant within the drainage holes, you must place your plant in a larger planter to prevent the planter from breaking or cracking.

, A commercial waterproofing solution will prevent wood and metal planters from becoming rotten or rusty.


Purchase a waterproofing solution from any retail store that specializes in gardening products, then apply the solution following the manufacturer's instructions.

If you were able to find a framed screen meant for paper making, you can skip this section and start making the paper pulp.;
, Measure the entire frame, including the outside edges. Cut a piece of window screening down to fit those measurements. If you can't find window screening, you can use another type of stiff, mesh screening.


Do not use tulle or mesh fabric. It is too soft.
The mesh must be finely woven. If the holes are too big, the paper will fall through.

, Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you. Place the screen on top of the frame. Secure it with nails, tacks, or stables. Trim off any excess screening.Consider wrapping duct tape around the back edges of the frame. This will prevent the screen's sharp edges from accidentally scratching you.

, This will help soak up any excess water. Make sure it's one you don't mind possibly ruining. Sometimes, paper can leak out dyes.

, Make sure that the screen side (the back part) of the frame is facing down. You want to front of the frame to form a rim around your screen.

, Choose plain, non-glossy paper, such as printer paper, construction paper, newsprint, and paper napkins.Tear the paper into ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) scraps. How much paper you use depends on how many cards you want to make.

, Place the shredded paper into a mixing bowl. Cover the paper with boiled water. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then give it a stir.If you don't have colored paper, but want to make it colored, stir in a few drops of food coloring into the water first., Pour the entire mixture, including the water, into a blender. Pulse the blender until the paper turns into a pulp. Pour out any excess water.


If you don't own a blender, you can use a food processor instead.
Don't over-blend the paper. You want there to be a few chunks., Pour the pulp back into the mixing bowl. Stir a few spoonfuls of your favorite type of seed. Choose seeds that are small and flat, such as: forget-me-not, poppy, or herbs.Other great seed choices to consider include carrots, radishes, and wildflowers., Use your fingers to spread the paper around into a rough rectangular shape. If you wish to make shaped cards, such as hearts, place a cookie cutter on the screen first, then fill it with about 1 tablespoon of the pulp., If you used cookie cutters, make sure that you smooth the pulp until it fills the entire bottom of the cookie cutter.How thick you make the paper is up to you. Keep in mind that the thicker it is, the longer it will take to dry.

, If you used a cookie cutter, wrap a towel around your finger first, then gently press the pulp inside the cookie cutter. Once you have most of the water drained, remove the cookie cutter.


If the towel under the screen becomes too soggy, replace it with a fresh one.
If the baking dish becomes filled with water, dump the water out, and replace the towel.
If you plan on making more shaped cards, now is the time to do so. Leave some space between each ""card.""

, Take the screen out of the baking dish; leave the towel behind. Set it down on a wire cooling rack, a couple of blocks, or a clothes drying rack. Make sure that air can flow freely under the screen., Make sure that air can flow under the rack.

, If the underside is still damp, flip the paper over, and let it finish drying. Your paper is now ready to turn into beautiful cards.

, This will make the base for your card. Choose a color that works well with you paper. You can also use a blank card, with nothing written or printed on it.

, The seeded paper you just made will eventually go on the front of your card. If you make a rectangular sheet of paper, you can cut it down into smaller shapes using a pair of scissors. If you made shaped paper using a cookie cutter, or if the paper is smaller than your card, leave it as it is.


Save the scraps and plant them in you garden!

, Do not get carried away; you want the paper to be easily removable so that the recipient can pull it off and use it. A few drops of glue are all that you need. You can also outline the seeded paper with a glue stick instead; glue sticks are much easier to remove than regular glue.

, These cards look best if they are left simple, but you can add some designs, if you wish. For example, you could draw designs or write messages onto the seeded paper or cardstock using a pen. You can also stamp a design onto the seeded paper instead using a rubber stamp and ink.

, Cut down a sheet of thin paper, such as printer paper, so that it is a little smaller than you card. Place a strip of double-sided tape along the top, narrow edge. Open your card, and set the sheet down on the right side. Make sure that it is centered, then set the card aside.


If you don't have double-sided tape, you can use a glue stick instead.
This not absolutely necessary, but it will give your card a fancier touch. This would be a good idea if your cardstock is a bright color.

, Be sure to include planting instructions for your card.Listed below are general instructions. Keep in mind that you may need to include additional instructions based on the type of seed you used:Pull the seeded paper off of the card and tear it into smaller pieces.
Plant the scraps under ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) of soil.
Water the soil generously. Allow the excess water to drain.
Keep the paper moist until the seeds sprout. Once the seeds sprout, water them only as needed.

Care for it during the sapling phase.,
Remove buds during first 5 years.,
Let the buds grow after 5 years.,
Contain any diseases.",How to Grow Theobroma Bicolor from Seed1," Do some research about the numerous different types of Theobroma Bicolor to pick the best one for your environment. Take into account temperature fluctuations, soil quality and density, rainfall, wind protection, and altitude. If you purchase a pod, remove a seed from the pod to plant - do not plant the entire pod. Leave as much of the pulp on the seed as you can as that is food for the seed.;
, Farmers of Theobroma Bicolor vary slightly in how they start their trees. Some make slight indentations into the soil and cover the seed in soil, while some bury their seeds up to 10 centimetres (4 inches) into the ground. The seed should be placed in an area that satisfies all of its needs (see Step 4, Part 2). Remember that Theobroma Bicolor is very easily diseased and most farmers lose between 30-100% of their yearly crop due to disease. In other words, having multiple trees isolated from each other is best to minimize risk.

, The first year of the tree's life is the hardest to get through. There is little that you can do as these trees typically suffice off of their environment alone. All you can do is keep other vegetation at least 1 metre (40 inches) away from the tree.

, For the first 5 years, floral buds are removed so that the tree focuses on growth not seed production to maximise output. Remember to maintain a 1 metre (40 inch) buffer zone between the furthest extent of the tree and other vegetation and to add shade if shading-plants die.

, After the first 5 years, do not alter the buds and allow them to grow. Around 6 months after the buds' appearance, the fruit will fall to the ground when ripe. Collecting fallen pods is the most efficient way to harvest the fruit.

, Theobroma Bicolor is extremely susceptible to diseases. A diseased tree must be isolated immediately to limit or, ideally, prevent the spread of the disease further. Resourceful farmers typically isolate the tree and all immediately surrounding trees and a second barrier of two-trees around the original barrier. This barrier is often 2-3 metres (79-118 inches) taller than the tallest tree and is made of a plastic tarp. If, at any time, tree-zero (first infected tree) dies, most farmers burn all of the trees in the primary isolation. After the fire has died in primary isolation, all of the trees in secondary isolation are burned. This is extreme but, due to the susceptibility of Theobroma Bicolor to disease, it is needed.

Consider the climate.",How to Grow Theobroma Bicolor from Seed2," Theobroma Bicolor is native to lowland rainforests in the Orinoco and Amazon rainforests, primarily in Brazil. The plant is now cultivated in in the American tropics, tropical Asia, and Western Africa. If you spot a plant not in these regions, it is likely not Theobroma Bicolor.

, Theobroma Bicolor grows on what's known as the forest understory, or the the layer between the top and bottom layers of a forest. The height ranges from 6 - 12 metres (20 - 40 feet) but is normally at the lower end of the spectrum. Its leaves are long, ovular, and leathery and can be up to 30 centimetres (1 foot) long. The leaves are a vivid red when they first grow. The flowers are either odourless or lightly foul-smelling. They grow in clusters directly from the trunk and are about 1 centimetre (0.4 inches) tall and wide. Theobroma Bicolor flowers are white, rosy, pink, yellow, or bright red.

, The pods (which contain the seeds) can grow up to 35 centimetres (14 inches) with rare cases growing up to 40 centimetres (16 inches) and take less than six months to ripen. A ripe pod has numerous ridges running up and down the pod. Depending on the variety, the pod is can be pale orange, dirty orange, green, or a dark purple-green. On the inside, each pod holds between 20 to 60 seeds (also called beans). Each seed is about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long and is covered in a sticky, sweet, white pulp.

, Theobroma Bicolor lives between 30 and 300 metres (100 to 1 000 feet) above sea-level. The temperature must rarely fall below 20 degrees Centigrade (68 degrees Fahrenheit) or go above 28 degrees Centigrade (82 degrees Fahrenheit). The tree must be protected from wind as the root system is very shallow. Rainfall needs varies greatly depending on the variety, altitude, soil-water retention, but the minimum is 100 centimetres (39 inches) with 150-200 centimetres (59-79 inches) of rain spread throughout the year being optimal. The soil must have good drainage as the surface bark can easily rot and be rich in humus. As Theobroma Bicolor grows in the understory, the plant should be kept in good shade.

Add three seeds into the hole in each rapid rooter.,
Fill the pots the rest of the way with your desired medium.,
Add a support frame for large plants, if needed.,
Add artificial lighting, if needed.,
Refill the water tank as needed.,
Test the nutrient levels weekly.,
Pollinate indoor plants to encourage growth.",How to Start a Hydroponic Garden in Your Apartment," How big the plastic box depends on how many plants you want to grow and how much room you have. You will need at least 4 square inches (10.16 square centimeters) per plant. The box should be at least 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) deep.

You can also use a small aquarium and a Styrofoam sheet instead.;
, You can drill the holes in straight lines or staggered. How many holes you fit depends on the size of the lid, just be sure to leave about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of space between each hole.If you are using an aquarium, cut the Styrofoam a little smaller than the opening first, then drill the holes.You can cut the circles with a dremel, circular saw, or a craft blade.

, Leave 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of space at the top. This way, the bottom of the pots can touch the water without being submerged., The type of nutrient solution you use depends on the type of fruit, vegetable, or herb you will be growing. Follow the instructions on the bottle closely, as each brand will be a little different.Test the pH after 30 minutes, then make any necessary adjustments. Most plants will require a pH of 6 to 7., If you are using an aquarium, drill a small hole in the Styrofoam close to the edge instead. The hole needs to be big enough for the air pump tubing to fit through., Insert the air stone and the tubing through the hole first. Secure the air stone to the inside of the box with clips or a suction cup. Attach the other end of the plastic tubing to an air pump. Plug in the air pump to make sure that it is working. You may need to wait a few minutes before you see bubbles forming.The air stone needs to be submerged.

, Net pots are plastic flower pots meant for hydroponic gardening. They are woven to look like baskets.Leave one hole empty. This will be your ""access hole"" so that you can test the water and make any necessary adjustments.

, You can grow all sorts of plants in a hydroponic garden, including herbs, vegetables, and flowers. If you have a large apartment with lots of space, you may be able to grow larger vegetables, such as squash or cucumbers! Listed below are some great choices:Herbs: basil, chives, cilantro/coriander, garlic, mint, oregano, and spring onions
Vegetables: beans, broccoli, celery, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peas, peppers, and radishes
Decorative plants: African violets, coleus, ferns, lilies, marigolds, orchids, petunias, pathos, and spider plants.

, Rapid rooter plugs are small discs of compacted soil. You use them when starting seedlings. Soak them in water for 30 seconds., Make sure that you are placing it so that the hole is facing upwards. Don't worry if the rapid rooters are too small for the pots; you will be filling them with more medium later on., Make sure that you are placing the same type of seed into each hole. You are placing three seeds because not all seeds sprout. Planting more than one at a time ensures that at least one will sprout.Pay attention to the growing season! Certain types of plants need to be planted during certain times of the year.

, Be careful not to cover the hole where you put the seed in, however! Clay pellets are a great choice, but you can also use any of the following: gravel, perlite, sand, and vermiculite. You can even use a combination of two or more mediums.Coconut fiber is another good choice, but you have to be careful so that it doesn't get soggy., If you are growing larger plants, such as cherry tomatoes, squash, or cucumbers, consider getting a plant frame, trellis, or teepee to put over the garden. This will allow your plant to grow upward rather than horizontal, and take up less space., Unless you have access to a balcony or a bright, sunny window, you will need grow lights for your plants. Choose LED lighting designed to save energy; this will help reduce your electricity bill and reduce energy usage.Some plants like it dark. Read up on your plants' needs, if necessary.

, As time goes on, the water level in the box will drop. It should always be touching the bottom of the pots, about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) away from the lid., The plants will use up lots of nutrients, so you will want to test the water weekly. If something changes, you will need to adjust it, either by adding more nutrient solution, or water to dilute it.Use the one hole you left empty to fill your tank as needed., Plants need to pollinate in order to produce fruits, vegetables, and flowers. If you are keeping your garden out on the balcony, the birds, bees, and butterflies will do that for you. If you are keeping them inside, however, you'll need to do it yourself. You can do this be gently shaking or tapping the blossoms with your finger.You can also touch each flower bud with a Q-tip to help distribute pollen."

,
Change your water regimen after the verbena plants are well rooted.,
Deadhead verbena plants after the first full bloom.,
Prune two to three times per season.,
Consider using cuttings to multiply your verbena stock, if you want to grow them again.,
Trim back the plant slightly in the fall if you live in a warmer locale and want to treat them as perennials.",How to Grow Verbena," They are available in zones two through eight. Since verbena seeds take a long time to germinate, you can save yourself time and space by starting with seedlings.


Buying the verbena plants allows you to ask the clerks how tall they grow and compare different colors. You can find verbena plants in white, red, purple, pink or multi-colored varieties.;
, Sew two seeds to every peat or fiber pot. Keep the soil damp but not overwatered.


Use warm water to keep the soil warmer during germination.
Seeds will take approximately one month to sprout.

, Then, start hardening them by placing them outside during the day in full sunlight.

, Verbena plants are prone to developing powdery mildew if they don’t get enough sun., Make sure that you are well past your last frost and the days are long.

, After you place them in the ground, fertilize the ground with flower fertilizer. Fertilize monthly for the rest of the growing season.

,, Water once per week at the base of the plant, making sure they get about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water or rain. Allow the soil to dry out before the next watering.


Overwatering and watering from overhead are common mistakes with verbena care.

, Prune one-fourth of the plants top growth, include old flower blooms. Take care not to prune on the main stem.

, The next bloom will appear in 15 to 20 days. This practice will produce more blooms and wider plants.

, Cut a stem just below the node, or thickened place on a stem. Plant them in soil and keep them moist and shaded until they take root.


Keep them in a container with as much sun as possible until you are ready to plant them in your beds.

, They will die with exposure to frost. Don’t overtrim them or they may not remain hardy.

Choose perennials that can stand up to physical abuse.,
Select perennials that provide thick coverage.,
Determine whether you want a compact or spreading perennial.,
Choose the color of your edging plants carefully.,
Edge your walkways with shrubs to add vertical interest.,
Consider your water and temperature constraints when selecting edging plants.",How to Select Perennials for Edging," Plants that are used to edge walkways will likely have to deal with a lot of foot traffic. Hardy, resilient perennials will therefore be a good choice. Examples of perennials that can withstand abuse from foot traffic include lilyturf (genus Liriope) and brass buttons.;
, Because plants used for edging will be in a high-visibility location, and because you want them to adequately conceal the path's edge, it is a good idea to select thick-growing plants. Great examples include English ivy, thyme, Bishop's weed, and bunchberry.

, Perennials for edging can be broadly grouped into 2 sizes: compact and spreading. Compact plants are great for providing a short demarcation between a walkway and a lawn; examples of these types of plants include lavender, aster, and black mondo grass. Spreading plants will cover much more area and are great for blending your walkway into a heavily planted garden. Good spreading plants include creeping thyme, creeping rosemary, and drift roses.

, If you want your edging to blend in with the rest of your garden, choose a plant with a complimentary color (keeping in mind that perennials will not be in bloom for very long each year). However, if you want a dramatic, contrasting color for your edging, you could select plants such as black mondo grass or heuchera plum pudding.

, If you want to add visual interest vertically, you can edge your walkways with tall shrubs rather than low-growing ground covers. Hardy, low-maintenance shrubs include hydrangea, potentilla, and spirea.

, Another major consideration when selecting perennials for edging is climate. Many ground cover plants (like English ivy) will tolerate a very wide range of conditions, which is why they are so popular as ground covers to begin with. Still, you will want to buy plants suited for your local climate. If you live in an area with low rainfall, consider drought-tolerant perennials like rock rose, bluebeard shrub, and pachysandra.

Collect the materials you need.,
Build the compost heap.,
Calculate the total carbon and nitrogen content.,
Maintain the high temperature.,
Use the compost in your garden.",How to Hot Compost,"


Recycle your kitchen and garden organic waste by first accumulating it in a cool, preferably shaded, part of the garden.
Chop the waste into small pieces. This helps the microbes and worms break it down quickly. You can use a garden shredder, you can run over it with a lawn mower or you can use a sharp spade.
Keep the brown and green waste separate until you are ready to build the compost heap.
Note: Green waste is material rich in nitrogen and brown waste is rich in carbon (see chart for details).
Examples of Brown Waste (high Carbon):

Wood Chips..................400 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Shredded Cardboard......350 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Sawdust.......................325 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Shredded Newspaper.....175 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Pine Needles..................80 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Straw.............................75 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen.
Leaves...........................60 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Fruit Waste....................35 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen


Examples of Green Waste (high Nitrogen):

Weeds...........................30 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Green Wood...................25 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Food waste.....................20 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Grass clippings...............20 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Seaweed........................19 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Cow manure....................16 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Chicken manure..............12 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen
Fish waste........................7 Carbon: 1 Nitrogen

;
, Work out the mix of brown and green materials you need to achieve a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30 to 1.


Use the above chart to calculate the proportions you need to use.
Use a heaped shovel load of waste as your standard unit of measure.
Example: Set aside 20 shovel loads of chicken manure, 5 shovels of weeds, 20 shovels of leaves and 10 shovels of fish waste.

,


For chicken manure this is 20 shovels x 12 (from the chart) 240 units of carbon, and 20 shovels x 1 (from the chart) 20 units of nitrogen.
For the weeds this is 1200 units of carbon and 20 units of nitrogen.
For the leaves this is 150 units of carbon and 5 units of nitrogen.
For the fish waste this is 70 units of carbon and 10 units of nitrogen.
The totals for all the ingredients are 1660 units of carbon and 55 units of nitrogen, a C:N ratio of 30.18 to 1.
Build the heap in layers alternating between green and brown waste. You will need at least a cubic meter (cu.yard) to get the required temperature in the middle of the heap.

,


Turn the heap over with a garden fork every 2-3 days. This aerates the heap so the heat generating microbes - which are aerobic and need oxygen - can continue their work.
Move fresh material from the outside to the inside of the heap at the same time so that, in about 2 weeks, all the material will have gone through this high temperature stage of the process.
Leave the heap to mature for about a week. A whole new army of microbes and worms will move in to complete the maturing process.
Under ideal conditions, the whole process can be completed in 3 weeks.

, Incorporate the compost into your soil by first spreading it generously over the surface and then digging it into the soil with a garden fork


Apply straw mulch to the surface of the soil once your plants are established. This keeps the soil moist and encourages worm and beneficial microbe activity right up to the surface.
Properly made compost when added to the soil is rich in beneficial microbes. Worms live off the compost and the microbes in it, and distribute organic matter and accompanying microbes throughout the upper layers of the soil. These beneficial microbes break down the organic materials into easily assimilated plant nutrients and break down the minerals in the soil into trace elements which plants need for healthy growth.
Food from plants grown this way is rich in minerals and vitamins, and tastes great.

Analyze what produce your family eats most often.
Consider what produce your family uses occasionally, but cannot be purchased in small enough quantities. You can save money and reduce waste by growing these items in smaller quantities
Use these findings to draft a list of fruits/vegetables you might grow.

,


Check local plant nurseries or online shops for the plants or seeds you might grow. Make a note of their price and care instructions for later use.
Make sure your garden’s location will provide the plant with adequate sunlight.
Ensure that the plants you choose are hardy in your area.
Find rough estimate of the plant’s yearly production to help you decide how many individual plants to purchase.

, Potting soil comes in a variety of blends, so be sure to read the ingredients. Often an all-purpose blend will suffice for container gardens.

,


If you have more space, you can created a raised garden bed. Raised garden beds can be purchased from home improvement stores in various sizes, or built at home. These containers provide you with lots of space for growing.
If you have less space, a potted garden might be for you. When purchasing pots, consider ones that are as large as possible and have holes for drainage.

, Pre-grown plants are often more expensive, but they take away the hassle of starting your plants from seed. Starting your garden from seed can be personally rewarding as well as less expensive.

,


Total up the amount you typically spend on the fruits and vegetables you plan on growing. This can be an estimate, or a calculated average.
Total up your estimated cost, considering the price of seeds/seedlings, soil, tools, and containers.

, Check local home improvement stores, garden supplies, and online. You can find the most economic options by comparing prices among the three.

, If you decide to start your plants from seeds, you'll need seed starting materials. You could purchase a kit from your local garden supply, or gather the materials separately. You will need small containers with holes for drainage, a seed starting mix, and your seeds.


Fill the containers with seed starting mix.
Create a small hole in the seed starting mix, about half an inch deep.
Place the seed in the hole and cover with seed starting mix.
Provide the growing seedling with plenty of light, warmth, and water while it grows.
Be sure to start your seedlings in a timely manner. The information on your seed package should give you further details. Typically you need to start seeds 4-12 weeks in advance.
Once your seedlings have reached maturity, you can move to the next step.

, Make sure you're working in an area you won't mind getting dirty. If you are planting your garden in a raised bed, you'll need to assemble it in its permanent location.
Set up your containers. Have your raised bed assembled, or your pots set out and ready.

,


Fill your raised bed or pots with soil.
Dig a hole. The hole must be deep enough so that when the plant is placed in the hole, the top layer of potting mix is level with the top layer of soil.

,


Hold the plant’s container, and gently pinch the stem of your plant near the base between your forefinger, and thumb.
Gently squeeze or tap the bottom of the container to dislodge the soil, and pull the plant from the container. The potting mix should remain intact.
Gently break apart the potting mix and roots at the base.

,


Place the plant in the hole.
Gently press the soil up against the stem, filling in any gaps between the potting mix and the surrounding soil.
Plant with adequate space to grow. The care instructions will indicate the amount of space to be left between plants. Properly spacing your plants will ensure that they have room to grow and adequate nutrients.
Water the soil thoroughly after planting. This will help the roots settle in.

,, Now that everything is planted, you must ensure that your plants receive adequate water. Each plant has different water needs, so it is important to pay attention to individual plants. Also, pay special attention to the weather to avoid over or under watering your garden.

, There are two types of pests you need to be aware of.


Fortify against insects. When dealing with insects, you can protect your plants using either organic or chemical pesticides. Do some research to find out which option is best for you.
Fortify against small animals. Animals such as deer, rabbits, and groundhogs can cause damage to your garden if it is at ground level. Consider using netting or fencing to keep small critters away.

, Clip away any dead leaves or unhealthy produce. Pull weeds from the surrounding soil.

, As your plants begin producing, collect produce as it ripens. You can then prepare your produce fresh, or consider home canning to keep home grown fruits and vegetables through the winter months.

Fill your garden with nature’s music to give it an unworldly feel. You can do this by purchasing a wind chime; it will look beautiful in your garden and will fill it with a sweet, unique symphony; you will find yourself waiting for the next gust of wind! If wind chimes aren’t your thing, you could also try to attract birds to your garden, who doesn’t love the sweet sound of happily chirping birds?

, Try to attract wildlife to your garden with sweet flowers which may attract butterflies. To attract birds offer a bird bath and bird seeds. The chirping of the birds will bring music to your garden and the butterflies will give it an unworldly feel. Consider other animals, such as dogs and cats. Perhaps you could set up a special place in the garden just for your pet to rest, I’m sure he/she will appreciate it having their own spot in the garden and wouldn’t it be brilliant to see your happy pet snoozing in the garden? Be cautious with mixing cats and birds in the same garden, remember… cats are hunters.

, There are so many plants to choose from, the possibilities are endless. To get that fantasy feel, fill your garden with colorful, unique plants. A good flower to use would be the sunflower, it is very diverse and it towers above most plants. Add some sweet, dainty flowers like snow drops and lilacs to add dimension. Be creative with it, flower arranging can be so fun, so take your time and enjoy it!

, Fill it with sweet, unique fragrances by the use of flowers and of course no artificial fragrances are needed (nature offers us everything we need). Try using Lavender or roses, or maybe some honeysuckle. Get the aromas flowing throughout your garden by using plants that have a strong, sweet scent. You can create a unique scent by mixing a variety of flowers together; your garden will have a brilliant smell like no other.

, Try not to include lights shaped as fairies, butterflies or other creatures, as this can make your garden seem childish. Stick with simple garden lights that will illuminate your garden during the nighttime. If you have a pond or water feature in your garden, putting lights near it or above it will cause the lights to reflect, this will look stunning.

, Your garden can be used as a personal get away; you worked incredibly hard on it so you may-as-well be a part of it. Good luck!

If you're keeping your garden indoors, you'll need a smaller container. For an outdoor garden, you can use something larger.Good items for an indoor container include something like a drawer from an old desk you no longer use, an old pot, or an old wash bin.
Outdoors, you can use larger containers for a bigger garden, such as large garden plots or big bins. A fun idea can be to use a wagon so you can move your fairy garden around.
Account for the types of plants you're planning on growing. Some plants may need extra drainage, so you should find a container that allows for some drainage if that's the case. Other plants can get by with less drainage.;
, While you'll probably end up wandering from your plan as you create your garden, it's always a good idea to have a rough sketch. This way, you'll know how to best monopolize your space when planting your flowers. Make a sketch of your container and draw roughs sketches of where you'll keep things like the fairy house, decorations, and your various plants.Remember, nothing is set in stone yet. Think of this sketch more as a rough guide than a blueprint of exactly how your fairy garden will turn out. Part of the fun of a fairy garden is experimenting and finding fun, spontaneous decorations as you build.

, As you'll be adding plants to a fairy garden, find a location that gets a lot of sun. Strive for an area in your backyard that's free of shade or a space by a window in your home., Invest in a quality potting soil that promotes the growth of a diverse amount of plants. Most local greenhouses and hardware stores will sell all-purpose potting soil. Pour your soil into your chosen container so the full surface is coated with a solid layer of soil.Consider the plants you're adding when adding your soil. If plants need to be buried a specific depth under the soil to grow, make sure your soil is at least that deep.

, Herbs are easy to care for, and thrive both indoors and outdoors. In addition to giving off a magical feel, herbs can be harvested for use later. Pick up some seeds or herbs at a local greenhouse. Either plant your seeds or transfer the herbs themselves to the garden.Thyme in particular makes a great plant for a fairy garden, as it has a very decorative feel.
Other herbs include things like rosemary, sage, basil, and oregano.

, The easiest way to make sure your fairy garden grows without trouble is to select native plants. Stop by a local greenhouse and ask about which plants are native to your area. You can also look this information up online. It's best to use local plants, as they will thrive more easily when planted in your fairy garden.You can either buy seeds or purchase plants that have already bloomed and transfer them by the roots to your garden.

, However, do not choose just any plants. Pick smaller, more delicate native options that give off a mystical feel. For example, if something like forget-me-nots are native to your area, these can make a great addition to your fairy garden due to their small size and decorative appearance., Every fairy garden needs a tree, so select a stronger, sturdier plant to plant at the center of your garden. In comparison to the smaller, more decorative plants lining the plot, this will look like a large tree overlooking your fairy garden.Bush-like plants, like evergreen herbs and shrugs, can make great trees for your garden.
If you have a bigger garden, you can even try adding something like a small bonsai tree to the center of your garden.

, Succulents are great if you want a more hands-off fairy garden, as they do not require as much care. They can go great in a tiny, indoor garden. Pick up succulents, like cacti, at a local greenhouse and plant them in your garden., Moss is soft to the touch and will cover up any patches of dirt left in between flowers. Other choices include creeping phlox. The fern-like foliage will look like little flowers or bushing lining your garden. Stop by a local greenhouse to pick up some moss to plant in your fairy garden to create the illusion rich grass growing in the garden., Plants in a fairy garden grow together in the same small space. Therefore, it's important they have the same basic requirements regarding care, as you won't be able to provide different amounts of water and light for each individual plant. Choose plants with a similar care regimen so it's simple to keep your fairy garden alive and growing., Patches of pebbles can run through your plants, looking like a walkway. You can also add tiny piles of pebbles here and there to create mini rock gardens. You can gather tiny pebbles from outdoors or buy pebbles online or at a greenhouse.To add some flare, think about adding colorful gemstones alongside the pebbles. This can add some color and give off a fairytale vibe.

, Every fairy garden needs a tiny house for your fairies to live. Local craft or art stories may sell tiny house figurines, like little log cabins or tee-pees. You can also look at items you have lying around the house and repurpose them for your fairy garden. For example, if you have a small birdhouse you've never used, place it in your garden.If you want, you can decorate your fairy house before putting it in your garden. Something like an old birdhouse can be painted or stenciled to create fun designs.

, Websites like Etsy, as well as local craft stores or craft fairs, often sell miniature items that can be added to your fairy garden. You can add woodland creatures, like deer and rabbits, to the grassier areas of the garden. You can also put tiny furniture, like miniature lawn chairs, near the house for your fairies to sit on. Miniature items are a must for a fairy house, as it creates the sense tiny people live in your garden., If you live near the ocean, you can gather seashells and wash them. You can also buy seashells at a craft store or online. Place seashells upside down throughout your garden and fill them with splashes of water. These will look like birdbaths for the little birds that visit your fairy garden.If you have miniature bird figurines, try placing them in the bird baths for an added effect.

, Take popsicle sticks and strips or squares of paper. Write things on the paper, like ""Fairy House"" and ""Woods,"" labeling the various parts of your garden. Then, stick your signs in the dirt throughout your fairy garden.Decorate your signs as much as you want. things like glitter and sequins can give off a magical feel for your garden.

Get advice from local gardeners.",How to Grow Sod," Use measuring tape to measure the length and width of the area you want to cover with grass. Next, multiply these two numbers to find out how many square feet of sod you’ll need. For example, if you have a yard that’s 9 feet by 8 feet (2.7 meters by 2.4 meters) you’ll need at least 72 square feet (6.48 square meters) of sod.It’s better to plan for too much sod than too little, especially if you have a strange yard shape. You may need to cut away pieces of sod.;
, If possible, choose a native grass. Native grasses will already be acclimated to your local climate and soil. However, if you don’t like any of the native grasses in your area, choose a grass based on your region. If you live in a region with cold winters and hot, rainy summers, choose a cool season grass. If your region has a hot, humid climate, choose a warm season grass.


Cool season grasses include Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescue.Warm season grasses include Bermuda grass, St. Augustine grass, and centipede grass.Each type of grass has a different growing time during the year, usually in the spring or summer. Plan to plant your sod during this growing time.

, The kind of soil you need to use will depend on what kind of grass you use. Check on the back of the seed bag to see what blend of soil you’ll need for your grass seeds. It will most likely be a blend of topsoil, peat, and fertilizer.


If you’re not sure what kind of soil to use for your grass, visit a local greenhouse. The gardeners will be able to point you in the right direction, especially if you’re using native grass.

, You will need long planting trays with irrigation holes at the bottom, shelving for your greenhouse, duct tape, your soil mix, a spray bottle, and grass seeds. To figure out how many trays and shelves you need, refer to your yard square footage. For example, if you want to cover 72 square feet (6.48 square meters), you will need:


36 1 foot by 2 feet planting trays (.3 meters by .6 meters)
Enough shelf space in your greenhouse to accommodate all of the trays

, Each shelf should have about 12 inches (30 centimeters) of vertical space between them to allow the grass to breathe properly. Line the trays along the shelves to make sure you have enough room for all of your sod.


If you don’t have enough space in your greenhouse to grow enough sod, either grow the sod in batches or purchase it instead.

, Line the trays up end to end along the greenhouse shelves. Cut the ends off of the inside trays and tape them together to create longer trays. Next, fill the long trays with soil, leaving about ½ an inch (1.3 cm) of space at the top.


The length of these trays will depend on how long your greenhouse shelves are. Make each tray as long as possible, but be sure that it fits on your greenhouse shelf.

, To plant your seeds, follow the instructions on the back of the package.Usually, you will be asked to sprinkle a layer of seeds on top of the soil. Next, you will gently cover the seeds with another small layer of topsoil.


Follow the seed instructions exactly. If you don’t, your seeds may not grow at all.
Seed instructions can also include “reseeding.” This involves sprinkling more seeds over the sod after a few weeks of growth.

, Fill a spray bottle with fresh water or place a gentle spray attachment on the end of your hose. Soak the sod planters until the top two inches of soil are moist. Repeat this process daily for the first week.After the first week, water the grass every other day.


The sod should be moist, but not spongy.
Check the moistness of the sod periodically throughout the day. If you live in a hot climate, you may have to water it several times.

, You can either roll up the grass to transport it or cut it into sections and stack them. Use a wheelbarrow to move the sod from place to place.


Make sure your yard is ready for the sod before moving it. Otherwise, it will dry out.

, Your yard needs to be completely prepared for the sod before it’s installed. Otherwise, the sod may dry out while it sits in the sun. If you’re ordering sod, schedule the delivery date accordingly. If you’re growing your own sod, make sure your yard is prepared before the sod is ready to harvest.


Prepare your yard one to seven days before installing the sod.

, First, remove any rocks or debris from the area. Next, use a rototiller to till the yard. Go to a depth of four to six inches (ten to fifteen centimeters.) The rototiller will loosen the soil and bring up any large rocks and debris underground.Remove any unearthed debris after tilling.


Rototillers can be rented from your local home improvement store.
Avoid tilling any underground sprinklers. If you do, you may damage the pipes.

, Use a rake to even out the soil. If there are any deep recessions or holes, fill them in with soil.The more even your lawn is, the better your sod will look.


If there are deep holes in your lawn, consider filling them with handfuls of loam as well as soil.

, Use a wheelbarrow to transport rolls of sod to your yard. Next, place the roll at the edge of the prepared area and slowly roll it out. Make sure the edges of the sod line up with the edges of the yard. If you need to cut a piece of sod, use a sharp utility knife.Trim the sod around sprinkler heads and other surface features on your lawn.
Discard or compost any leftover sod.

, This will press the roots of the sod into the soil and give your yard an even appearance. Lawn rollers can be purchased online or from a garden supply depot. Alternatively, rent one from your local home improvement depot.

, Your new lawn needs at least 1 inch (2-3 centimeters) of water every day for the first week. Before watering, stick a rain gauge in the middle of the lawn. Next, turn on your sprinklers or evenly spray the lawn with a hose. Use the rain gauge to monitor how much you’ve watered the sod.If you don’t want to use a rain gauge, check the moistness of the sod by stepping on it. It should give slightly and appear spongy.
If you get an inch of rain, don’t water your lawn that day.

, After the first week of growth, begin watering your lawn once a week. Give your sod an inch (5cm) of water every week. Use a rain gauge stuck in the grass to measure the water level. Watering the grass deeply and infrequently will encourage root growth and crowd out any pesky weeds.If you get an inch of rain, don’t water lawn that day.

, Start mowing the grass once it gets taller than 3.5 inches (about 9 centimeters.) This usually happens after the third week of growth. Mow off about an inch of growth. However, never cut your lawn shorter than two inches. If you do, the grass won’t be able to grow deep roots.If your grass has deep roots, it will grow thicker, greener, and need less watering.
Only mow a dry lawn.This will create a clean cut along the blades of grass.

, If an area of your lawn has wilted or turned a straw color, it’s not getting enough water. Adjust your watering regime accordingly. Similarly, if cracks are appearing between the sod pallets, the yard needs more water. Increase the number of times you water your lawn each week.


If the average temperature is above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) your lawn may need to be watered more than once a week., If your lawn still looks sick, talk to local gardeners at a home improvement depot or other successful lawn owners. They will be able to give you advice that is specific to your region. Ask about the kind of soil they use, how often they water their lawn, and what kind of grass it is."

It's time to clear away the clutter that is keeping you from seeing the potential. Trash garbage and put compostable items like dead leaves in your composter.;
, Pick up some bags of rich, organic soil that are multi-purpose (good for use in the veggie patch and flower beds, pots, etc.). Flowers are essential in any garden that evokes a magical quality. Green plants add a lush element. Opt for native plants. Native plants and flowers are beautiful and they survive on less water than invasive species, so they're eco-friendly and economic too!

, Reflective materials are commonly seen in images of enchanting gardens. Certain kinds of rocks have crystals on the surface. Scattering these types among river rocks will achieve a glittering effect while keeping a natural look.

, Most garden centres offer lovely decorative crafts that can be nestled into flower beds. Ceramic figures of birds, mushrooms and snails look adorable peeking out from flowers and shrubs. Tree stumps and wooden bird feeders add a great natural element as well. Stepping stones will lead your guests from one end of the garden to the other.

,, Water reminds us of streams and rivers, the kinds you may find in a forest, which will only add to the ambiance you want. Also, water invites birds to the garden and has a calming and healing quality.

Draw out a plan of your raised garden.,
Choose a location for your raised garden bed.,
Decide on the height of your raised bed.,
Decide on the size of your garden and lay out the perimeter.,
Assemble your garden bed frame.,
Level the frame.,
Get the base of your raised bed cleaned up before adding the topsoil.,
Design an irrigating system for your raised vegetable or flower garden.",How to Prepare a Raised Bed Garden," Label where you want each vegetable and flower to grow. Remember to add room for you to maneuver around your garden for harvesting and picking if your garden is for vegetables.;
, Ideally, you should select a place that sits in the sun at least 6 hours in a day.

, If you cannot till your current land, then the plants or flowers you grow will have to depend on the soil in your garden bed. Therefore, expect to build a raised bed that is approximately 3 feet (0.91 m) high. If your land is conducive to planting, then you only need to build a raised bed that is 8 inches (20.32 cm) high.

, If you choose to use corner posts, lay out a hose or string to define the boundaries of your garden. Position your corner posts and dig a trench approximately 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm) deep from post to post along the marked edges. Alternatively, for a more simple design, omit the corner posts and lay out your two side walls and front/end boards so that they form a rectangle.

, Secure each side wall by screwing it together with the neighboring front or end board. The front and end boards can be placed either inside or outside of the side walls but be sure to be consistent on both ends.








, Dig and add soil where necessary to level the frame. Make sure that the frame is securely in place since it will be keeping your soil and growing plants or flowers from eroding.

, If you have Bermuda grass, you will have to remove it with a shovel; otherwise, just get rid of the big weeds, rocks and other debris. Pour the topsoil into the frame. You can also mix in some compost for added nutrition, should you feel it necessary. Just make sure that your soil, whether it's amended or not, feeds your plants and retains some moisture while providing drainage and ventilation. Additionally, you should mix the compost into the topsoil before pouring it into the frame. Once the soil is added, spread it out and rake it down.

, Consider drip irrigation that waters the area. A sprinkle system with perforated hoses is also adequate. Whatever you decide, make sure that your system will not overwater your garden or waste water.

Go up.,

Create a focal point, or one focal point per room, if you have multiple rooms.",How to Garden in a Small Space,"

Measure it physically. How much space do you really have?
What is the climate and exposure in your space? Does it get a great deal of sun or shade?
Look at the surroundings. Is there something you wish to cover up or conceal, such as a wall, fence, or utility box? Is there something you wish to preserve or incorporate, such as a nearby tree, a view, or other surrounding landscape?
Check out the soil. If your small space has soil, is it clay or sand? Does it support other plants, even weeds?;
, Do you have someplace to hook up a hose to water the plants? If so, consider a self-coiling hose with a nozzle that will turn off the water. Get a hose sized for your space. Otherwise, get a large watering can.,

Is it purely decorative, or would you like to grow a few herbs or food plants?
Decide where you will be when you look at this garden. Will you be out in it or will you mostly view it from indoors? One or two chairs and a small table can make a small garden an attractive retreat in which to sit and read.

, If you are serious about making a garden here, try to find someplace else to store the mop. Many communities discourage the use of outdoor spaces as storage, anyway.

If you must store items in this area, such as if this is the only place for your bicycle, at least minimize the size and number of items stored. Discard or remove any items that are not necessary and give yourself space to organize and access the rest.

, Place larger, brighter specimens closer to where you will be viewing them. Use more muted colors and smaller features (leaves and flowers) further away. This helps to give the illusion of a larger space., If a fence or railing is the prominent feature in your garden area, it is very clear how small the space is. Instead, use plants as your boundary.

Use any plants peeking over the fence. If you can see a bit of a neighbor's shrub or tree over your fence, plant some lower plants in a grouping in front of it. Done right, it can look like all three plants are in your yard.

, You can't always divide the space if it is very small, but if you have a bit of space to work with (say, a small back yard rather than an apartment balcony) don't have all of it showing at once. Have a pathway to another space or area. A small space could be just right for a hidden treasure or for a place to hide out.

Vary the path or patio material from one room to the next.

, If a path is all you have room for, leave space for that. If you can, though, add a bench or chair., Generally, the horizontal space is what's limited. Build a vertical garden, try a taller container planting, or train a climber up a wall or fence. You could also use window boxes or other wall- or fence-mounted containers, or a table or open shelving for more containers., This could be a colorful chair or bench, a water feature, or an especially showy plant or planting."

Weed regularly.",How to Make a Bog Garden," It doesn't have to be large but it should be at least one metre in depth. Also, digging out lawn space is preferable as it's under-utilised space and the turf is handy for lining the bog. Keep the turf that you dig up.;
, Once you've dug the hole, use black plastic pond liner to line it. Poke a few holes in the liner here and there.

, Shovel over a layer of gravel and pebbles. Make this layer about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) high. Cover this with a layer of peat.

, If you used a different part of the garden, place those pieces back into the bog.

, Using decomposed plant matter, peat, fibrous plant material, and soil, fill the bog garden in.

, Plants that might be ideal for your bog garden include:

Hostas






Bog primula (they need shade)






Irises






Marsh marigold (Caltha palustris)






Forget-me-nots






Polygonum






Crocosmias






Monardas (wild bergamot)






Some ferns.







, The moisture content will be retained much longer.

, Do this regularly.

, Like any garden, weeds will grow and they need to be removed on a regular basis. Sedges can become a problem, as can buttercups, which will grow like weeds. Japanese iris will also grow like a weed.

Add plants.",How to Make a Water Garden," They can be small to large and encompass not only plants but fish and fountains as well. Research the different types of plants you want to consider.;
,


Locate an area that has full sunlight or at least 5 hours of direct sunlight. Your plants will grow better with a lot of sun and the sun will help keep the water clean.






Find a spot that is wide open and does not have trees. Trees will provide unwanted shade and you will have to continuously clean leaves and tree debris out of the garden.






Build or place your water garden on level ground. You can add hills and varying heights when you put the water garden together.






Use an area that has convenient access to electrical connections and fresh water.







,


Choose a small water garden if you are not sure where to locate it. When it is small enough, it can be moved from site to site until you find the right place. Small water gardens are also good if you do not have a lot of space.






Use a large water garden if you want to have a lot of plants, fish or a fountain.







,


Pick a container for your small water garden, such as a wooden barrel or tub. Line the barrel with plastic or the rotting wood may damage your plants.






If you want a large water garden, choose the appropriate lining. Your water garden liner can be concrete, brick, clay, plastic, butyl rubber or fiberglass – it depends on the type of weather you get and which you prefer. Liners can be either rigid or flexible.







, Fountains and waterfalls generally require a pump and filter.

,


For a flexible liner and different types of plants, create your hole to be shallow at one end and then have it gradually deepen. The depth depends on whether you want fish, if you have freezing winters and what kinds of plants you wish to plant.
For a rigid liner, dig the hole large enough to insert the container.

,,,


If you are using a flexible liner, start at the center and lay it outwards.
If you are using a rigid liner, place the container in the hole and back fill dirt around it to keep it in place.

, Smooth out the flexible liner as you pour the water in.

,, Choose between floating, submerged or edge plants. Each type of plant will give you a different look for your garden.

Find out what the strata organization's rules for your building are.,
Estimate beforehand what plants you are going to grow, the size and material of the containers they would need to grow in, and very important, how many such containers your balcony can safely hold.,
Research on what plants you will be able to grow well as opposed to what you would like to grow.,
Consider the affordability.,
Ensure that you have sufficient time.,
Expect additional cleaning duties.,
Be realistic.",How to Manage a Balcony Garden," Think of your would-be plants as your children, and for their sake at least, strike up a friendship with the self-important manager of your apartment (aka building manager). Befriend and have pleasant relations with your neighbours. If you do not have good relations with all your neighbours, including the all-important building manager, even small infringements, real or made-up, in the course of your garden-building can create flashpoints that can end up with you having a fight on your hands. There can be a hundred reasons why people can object to your garden and even if they are all wrong and you are all right, still it's not worth the aggravation. After all, you are keeping your garden for relaxation and enjoyment, not stress.


Be thorough in your enquiries and find out what is allowed, what is not allowed, and make sure you get the strata's permission in writing for everything you plan to keep or do in your balcony to save yourself heartburn down the line.;
, Also very important, check the drainage qualities of your balcony. Does it slope gently as it must, according to apartment-building rules, towards the drain-holes or is it prone to water-logging in places? If not, and if the lay of your balcony floor happens to be faulty, try to get the strata to repair and rectify it.


Don't start a balcony garden on a floor going down the wrong way because it would entail daily clearing of small pools of water, a nuisance on a daily basis.

, Thank your lucky stars for the internet and the hundreds of gardeners, botanists and other experts who give generously of their knowledge and time. You will find a lot of the information you need at your fingertips. Be practical and mind the height and weather conditions at your balcony and consider carefully which of your favourite plants are likely to do well and which are likely to struggle.


For instance, if you feel yourself in love with the jackfruit of your native land, don't mail order a seed and plant it in a pot under the eaves. You might even find an expert on the net who assures you that jackfruit can indeed be made to fruit and flower in a window-box. But unless that window box measures at least 2 square metres, is located on the ground and is open to the sky, don't try. It would be cruel to the plant. So, choose the plants according to their purpose, their ability to thrive under the conditions that you can provide for them and/or their usefulness.
For example: Tall plants that can provide screening and privacy, easy-to-grow and pest-resistant hybrids that can thrill a novice gardener, prolific leafers that can quickly green up a space,  pretty flowering shrubs that bring pleasure to the eyes, night-flowering plants that waft their fragrance out on the evening breezes, hardy natives that, though not showy, can host wildlife because of their edible leaves or nectar-producing capabilities; or aromatic herbs that double as bee magnets. There is a whole world of beauty from which to choose those that will thrive in the particular environment that you can provide for them.

, Do not be taken in by effusive assurances that you can have a balcony garden that costs next to nothing. Maybe this is  true for a garden on the ground where the basic soil, at least, exists and there is ample space for a compost pit. Things are usually very different with a balcony garden. Here, everything has to be bought, from the pot and planter, the potting mix, manure/fertilizer to trellises, stakes and supports, which a garden on the ground may have resources to provide, like trees, posts, pillars and large vertical and lateral areas like fences and walls. When at the garden store, you will find that things that are freely available and easily improvisable on a farm, for instance, comes at considerable expense when you want to buy them off a shelf.


If you have land, you have the space to do things yourself, like propagate many plants from one or grow your own seedlings. These can be done even on a balcony, but not too easily, if it's not a large one.
If you want a good quality balcony garden, you have to invest in premier potting mix, fertilizers, amenders, etc. It is, of course, possible to make your own compost from kitchen waste using a table-top composter and some may succeed in making a go of it, but generally speaking, in apartment-type homes, space proves to be a constraint both within the kitchen, out on the balcony and inside the pots themselves.

, Plants need individual attention, even the poor, so-called abuse-tolerant ones, unless they are made of plastic.


Pots have to be weeded individually.
A keen eye has to be kept for pests on each and every plant as different plants may be susceptible to different pests. If the pests, depending on their kind, are not picked off by hand or otherwise disposed of as soon as they arrive, and are allowed, instead, to stick around and multiply, chemical warfare will have to be resorted to- not at all a happy solution anywhere, but especially not on a balcony, which is usually bang next to a living or sleeping area.
Diseases like mould and mildew can take over when pots are kept in close proximity due to space constraint and air circulation between plants gets curtailed.
Again, individual plants will have to be moved around according to their specific requirements of sun or shade or protection from wind and rain. The more attention is paid to each plant, the more successful it's life will be. 

, With a balcony garden, expense also comes from what may be called an unnatural use of space. For instance, your lovely balcony tiles will likely be stained by the muddy water leaking out of your pots because leak they must if your plants are not to be left standing in water to suffer root-rot. You can alleviate this problem by mounting your pots on stands, but again, this costs money and is not a full cure. An added problem is the necessity of having to frequently clean under and between the pots -a backbreaking chore.

, All this goes to show how important are factors like time, money, strength and energy in the maintenance of a healthy balcony garden. A balcony garden is a lovely thing to have, but it's not a breeze and people at various stages of life and health should think hard and realistically about the implications and consequences of embarking on such a project.

Buy the right herbs or vegetables to plant in your container garden.,
Choose a planter with drainage holes at the bottom.,
Make sure that the planter is the right shape and size for your plant.,
Cover the drainage hole with a porous material.,
Choose a good soil suitable for the type of plant you are growing.,
Fill the pot with soil 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim.,
Add your plants, and fill the spaces with more soil.,
Water the soil until water starts to leak out of the bottom of the pot.,
Take care of your herbs or vegetables.",How to Grow a Container Garden1," While just about any type of herb will do well in a container, not all vegetables will. You can buy mature plants from a nursery or you can start them from seeds. Here are the types of herbs and vegetables that do well in container gardens:Herbs, such as basil, mint, and thyme. You can even plant a bunch in a large planter for a mini garden.
All salad greens, such as collards, lettuce, mustard, and Swiss chard. Harvest only the outer layers.
Tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers all do well in summer pots, but will need supports or cages.
Cucumbers, zucchini, and other types of squash will also work. Cucumbers can also climb a trellis to save space.;
, This is important, otherwise the soil will become waterlogged and lead to root rot, which can kill your plant. Your planter can be made out of anything: wood, plastic, clay, etc. Keep in mind, however, that wood planters don't last for more than a few seasons. Also, if you live in a hot, dry climate, stay away from terracotta; they dry out too quickly and soak up too much moisture.


If you absolutely must have a terracotta planter, get one that is sealed on the inside.

, Short, wide pots are good for shallow-rooted, plants such as lettuce, while large, tall pots are good for vegetables, such as a zucchini or pumpkin. Half-size wine barrels also make great containers.A 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) pot is best for herbs and small plants, like strawberries and lettuce.
A 14-inch (35.56 centimeters) pot is great for herbs and salad greens, like spinach, non-heading lettuce, and arugula plants.
An 18-inch (45.72 centimeters) pot is good for small vegetables, such as broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, and small peppers. It can also hold salad greens and herbs in small bunches.
A 24-inch (60.96 centimeters) pot is best for large vegetables, such as cucumber, squash, and tomatoes. It can also hold small bunches of small vegetables and herbs.

, This will prevent the soil from falling out while allowing the water to pass through. You can use a scrap of burlap, window screening, or even a coffee filter.


You will also want to place a dish under the planter to catch any excess water and keep your floor or patio clean.

, Different plants will have different needs; some plants need a well-draining soil while others need a water-retaining soil. In general, however, you should look for soil that is light, fluffy, and holds moisture well.Consider looking for ingredients, such as: aged bark, lime, perlite, sphagnum peat moss, and vermiculite. They will make the soil more expensive, but they will ensure the healthiest crops.Added wetting agents will help the soil stay evenly damp.
Fertilizers are great additions, but you will need to add more fertilizer later on; it doesn't last forever!
If you have thirsty plants, such as vegetables, consider getting a specially-formulated soil that retains water., Make sure to have some extra soil on hand, as the soil will compress a little once you water it. Do not pack or press down on the soil, however. Instead, gently tap the pot against the ground, or rock it side-to-side, to collapse any air pockets., Carefully take your plant out of the container it came in, and make a hole in the soil large enough to hold the plant's root ball. Place the plant into the hole, and gently pat the soil around it.


If you are starting your garden from seeds, then sow the seeds according to the directions on the seed packet.
At this point, you can also add cage or supports, if needed.

, The soil will compress 15 to 20%, so you will have to add more soil on top and water again.Keep doing this until the soil level is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim of the pot.


Add some liquid plant food to the water for a nutritional boost., Water them when the top inch (2.54 centimeters) of soil is dry. If you find that the soil is drying out too fast, add some mulching on top, such as fine bark or straw. If you live in a humid climate, use white pebbles instead; hey will dry out faster and prevent root rot.Fertilize only when necessary, and be sure to use the right type of fertilizer for your herb or vegetable. Each plant will have different requirements.
Make sure that your plants are getting around 5 hours of direct sunlight each day. Some plants, such as cabbage, can live in shaded areas. Others, such as cucumbers, thrive in full sun.

Buy plants from a nursery that will do well in containers and the amount of sunlight you get.,
Choose a large planter with a drain hole at the bottom.,
Line the bottom of the planter with a porous material, such as a coffee filter, burlap, or window screen.,
Add the plants, and arrange them to your liking.,
Fill the gaps between the flowers with potting soil.,
Water the soil until water starts to drain out of the bottom of the planter.,
Take care of your plants.",How to Grow a Container Garden2," Depending on where you place the container, your plants may get full sun, partial sun, or full shad. Different types of plants will do better in different types of conditions, so you should choose accordingly. Plants that do well in containers include:African daisies and begonias
Ferns, ivy, and grasses
Impatiens
Marigolds and zinnias
Pansies and petunias

, The planter should be large enough to hold several flowers. Keep in mind, however, that the larger the planter is, the more difficult it will be to move around.


Avoid terracotta planters if you live in a hot, dry climate. It will soak up too much water and dry out too fast. If you must have a terracotta planter, make sure it is sealed on the inside.

, This will prevent the soil from falling out while allowing the water to drain through.You will also need a dish to place under your planter to catch excess water and protect your floor or patio.


If the drain hole is smaller than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), then you do not need to line it., Carefully take the plants out of the pots that they came in, and arrange them in the planter until you are satisfied with the design. You can arrange them however you like, but here are some ideas to get you started:


Mix different colors of the same plant variety. Pansies and impatiens come in a variety of colors, which can make your garden look more interesting.Combine different textures. This is a great idea for plants that will be growing in the shade. Pay attention to the different leaf shapes and colors, and mix them up.If you have a large planter: place a tall, upright plant in the middle, and add one or two broad, mid-height plants. Fill the gaps and outer edges with one or two trailing plants., Choose a potting soil that is lightweight and rich in nutrients. You can also get soil that has fertilizer mixed into it, but you will need to add more fertilizer as the year goes on., The soil will compress a little. When that happens, you will need to add more soil and water again. If you live in a hot, dry climate, consider adding some mulching on top of the soil to help seal the moisture in. If you live in a humid climate, consider adding some white pebbles on top of the soil instead. They will dry faster and prevent rot and mold.

, Water your flowers every 2 to 3 days. If the summers are hot and dry, you'll need to water them every day. For bigger, healthier blooms, feed your flowers with an all-purpose plant food every few weeds. Lastly, remember to pick off any dead or wilted flowers and leaves. This will encourage blooming."
"
Choose a sturdy, watertight container that is at least 15 to 20 gallons (56.78 to 75.71 liters).Pick something that is around 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) deep.,
Choose your plants.,
Transfer your plants into new containers, if necessary.,
Arrange the plants in the planter, and use bricks to adjust the plants to the correct height.,
Add the water, and make sure that it is safe for the plants.,
Take care of your plants.",How to Grow a Container Garden3," This includes both the planting depth of the plant as well as the container it is planted in.


A container that is dark-colored inside is the best. It will make your water garden appear deeper, as well as discourage algae.<ref.http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/container-water-120737</ref>

, Plan on having some rooted, floating plants, as well as marginal plants and submerged/oxygenating plants. This will give your water garden some variety. How many plants you have will depend on how much space you have in your container. Do not overcrowd your container; no more than one-half of the water's surface should be covered by floating plants.Rooted, floating plants include water lilies and lotuses.
Marginal plants, include water iris and dwarf papyrus.
Submerged (oxygenating) plants include anacharis and hornwort.
Floating plants include duckweed, fairy moss, and water hyacinth.

, Fill a cheap, plastic pot two-thirds of the way with heavy, clay loam/garden soil. Place the plant in the center of the soil, and top it off with a ½ -to ¾- inch (1.27 to 1.91 centimeters) layer of pea-sized pebbles or gravel. These pebbles will help anchor the plant and prevent the soil from leaking out.Do not use plain gardening soil; it is too light.
If you bought your plants already potted at a nursery, then you can skip this step because they already come potted.
Be careful; some plants are ""floaters"" and do not need to be planted!

, Keep the plants in their pots; this will allow you to rearrange your water garden at any time. How deep you plant everything will depend on the individual plant's needs; read the care label to find how deep you should plant it. Some plants need to be 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) under water while others need to be 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) under water.Use bricks to elevate shallow-water plants to the correct level.
Save the floating plants until after you add the water.
Don't overcrowd your planter. Remember, no more than half of the water's surface should be filled with plants.

, If you are using tap water, let it sit for 48 hours so that the chlorine can evaporate. You can also buy special de-chlorinating at the nursery.<ref.http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/container-water-120737</ref> Also, pay attention to the water temperature. Some plants like warmer waters while others prefer cooler. If the water is too cold, the plants will go dormant.


Most plants will do fine at 50°F (10°C), but some need at least 70°F (22°C).If you are using floating plants, now is the time to plop them in.

, Make sure that they get at least 6 hours of sunlight each day. You will also want to add extra water to the container every few days as the water evaporates.<ref.http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/container-water-120737</ref> Lastly, don't forget to give your plants some aquatic plant food and fertilizing tablets. If you live in a cool climate, you will need to overwinter your plants. You can do this by:Take the individual pots out of the water container.
Remove any dead or rotting leaves.
Place each pot in a plastic bag.
Store in a cool, dark place. Make sure that the temperatures stay at 50°F (10°C).
Replant everything in spring.

Pick the spot where you want the bog to be located.,
Determine the size of the bog you want to construct.,
Order a pond pump tank with water shut off valve (no pump) from the same place you're buying the liner.,
Dig your hole the size you want it.,
Dig an additional hole at the end closest to a water source.,
Install the pond liner.,
Install the water level box.,
Place the box in the hole so that the top is 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the ground.

,
Attach the liner to the water level box, using the ring supplied from the original package.,
Run a 1/2"" water line from water source and hook up to the water level box.,
Place river rock or pea gravel on the bottom of into the lined hole to form a place for the water to pond so that your bog is not a mud hole.

,
Place ground cloth over the stone, to keep the dirt from plugging the stone.

,
Fill the hole with the topsoil from the soil you dug out.

,
Turn the water on and set the float so that the water turns off when it is about 8"" below ground level.

",How to Construct a Bog," Most bogs will need a minimum of 6 hours of full sunlight per day. Access to a water supply is another important consideration, as your bog will need replenishment from time to time.;
, Order a pond liner for your size pond. A goldfish pond landscaper can help you. The liner must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) longer and 6 feet (1.8 m) wider than the hole to compensate for hole depth.

, A goldfish pond contractor can do the whole job but this not necessary if your willing to do the work. A water shut off valve is the type of float valve you see in many toilet tanks. They allow water to flow when the water level is low, but shuts off the water when it has reached the desired level. You can use this to control the water level in your bog.

, It should be a minimum of 1 1⁄2 foot (0.5 m) deep.

, This hole should be 2'x2'x3' deep. This will be used for the self watering system. Save the dirt for back filling later.

, Make sure the liner over extends past the edges of the hole on all sides.

, This is where your water shut off valve will be housed.

,, Cut away any excess liner that might be hanging over the side of the bog area.

, This is just like a hose hookup.

Determine where planter will be positioned and mark holes for the mounting bracket, making sure to keep bracket level.,
Attach the mounting bracket securely to the wall with the appropriate screws.,
Carefully rest planter on bracket making sure it is both secure and level.

,
Lay planter flat on horizontal surface and quarter fill each cell with potting mix.,
Plug plants into cells with desired design, pressing firmly around the base of each plant to anchor to mix.,
Fill excess air pockets and each cell with potting mix even if cell does not contain a plant.

,
Water thoroughly and tilt planter on a 45 degree angle for 3-4 days or until the plants take root.,
Carefully rest planter on bracket making sure it is both secure and level.

,Drill two screws on the side of each planter to connect with the wall for extra security.,Check the installation is secure and make sure that the planter is level.,Watch your vertical garden grow.",How to Create a Vertical Garden Using Living Wall Planters," Note: Use a level to be sure that the bracket is perfectly horizontal before you attach it. If it is slightly uneven, planter will look crooked and the plants will not get evenly watered.;
, Note: Ensure you use the correct fixing screws for your wall surface. The back panel should have pre-drilled holes to make it easier. Different wall materials require different types of fixing devices. If you are uncertain about what type of screw or fitting to use, contact your local hardware store.

,, Ensure you press potting mix firmly into each cell. Note: If planting seeds or succulent cuttings, fill each cell ¾ full of potting mix.

, Note: Plant them tightly in each cell so soil will not fall out. Make sure plants are spaced appropriately to their mature size.

,, Note: It is best to leave planter horizontal for few weeks so your plants have time to take root. The longer the better. This will allow the plant roots to lock tightly with soil and help prevent soil spillage when you hang your upright.

Visit IKEA to purchase the frame.,
Use the wire basket as support for the 25 liter (6.6 US gal) plastic container that will house the growbed.,
If you want to personalize the system to fit in with your home décor, now is a good time to do it.,
Use a small 600 lph (litres per hour) electric submersible pump in one corner of the fish tank which takes the water up to the growbed.,
Obtain male and female threaded adapters.,
Place the male adapter through the top of the growbed.,
Observe the 25mm-13mm reducer on the far left of the photo shown below.,
Place the 60mm bell siphon in the middle.,
Finally, the 100mm media guard, shown on the far right, is simply to keep the growbed media out of the bell siphon.,
Bell siphons can be tricky to get working.,
Add the ball-valve by-pass.,
Once you have all the framework, the containers, and the plumbing set up, add water into the fish tank and start the pump up.,
Fill the top container (the growbed) with some sort of growing media.,
Once this has been done, you are ready to add the fish and to start putting plants into your system.,
Read up on aquaponics for more details.",How to Make an Indoor Aquaponics System," You'll need the Antonius frame from IKEA for the main frame. It will be combined with one or two wire baskets and two of the plastic containers. Use the 50 liter (13.2 US gal) container for the fish tank at the bottom, and the 25 liter (6.6 US gal) container for the growbed at the top. Assemble all the parts based on the accompanying packaging instructions.


If you can't find the frame at IKEA, ask around to see if friends have a spare one, or make a request on a site like Freecycle.;
, It is not strictly necessary to have the 50 liter (13.2 US gal) plastic container fish tank at the bottom if you just put the container on the floor. You may want to trim the plastic lip on the top container to ensure a better fit; in this tutorial, the handles have been cut off the ends of the container as well. However, this is not strictly necessary. To cut the plastic, use a small saw or some standard wire pliers.
, The photo shows an example of a fish tank that has been decorated with a strip of PVC plastic sheet:

, The water flows through the growbed and exits in the opposite corner to which it entered. As the water then flows back to the fish tank, it pushes any solid waste over towards the pump, ready to pulled up into the growbed.


Use a bypass ball-valve on this system. This item diverts some of the water from the pump straight back into the fish tank. This lets you control the amount of water going into the growbed, and the diverted water also creates some water movement in the fish tank, as well as providing additional aeration. In this tutorial, 13mm PVC pipes were used throughout. Initially, it's recommended that you too start with the growbed and the siphon used here.

, Drill a hole in the right place in the growbed––you need to make sure that the female adapter will fit between the wire mesh squares. Make the hole about 6 or 7 centimeters (2.3-2.7 inches) from the edge of the container in each direction; the hole should form a snug fit with the threaded male adapter.

, Then fit a rubber O-ring onto the threads. Next, screw the female adapter onto the male adapter until you have a nice snug (and waterproof) fit. You can add some silicon to the bottom if you want to, but it's not strictly necessary. Finally, use a reducer on top of the male adapter. The one shown here is a 25mm to 13mm reducer.


This whole piece is called the standpipe and this is how the water will exit the growbed. You want the overall height to be about 1 inch (2.5cm) under the top of your growbed media; thus, you will need to cut the pipe down so that it is the right height for you. At this point, let the silicon dry if you have used it.


, This is where the water will exit the growbed.

, This is a 60 mm piece of pipe with an airtight cap on the top. The pictured bell siphon shows some pieces cut out of the bottom as well as some holes drilled in the side––you want these holes to be no higher than about 1 inch (2.5cm) from the bottom of the pipe. The water will drain down to this level and will then stop.

, This has holes drilled or cut out of it to allow the water to come in––and to keep the roots and the media out! The cap is optional, but helps to keep things out of the bell siphon.

, The mechanics of a siphon is relatively complicated, but you are really only concerned with the practical application of siphons to allow you to quickly empty a growbed into either a sump tank or fish tank using a simple mechanical method with no moving or electrical parts., This whole setup allows you to control how much water flows into the growbed and so it's an important addition. The ball-valve bypass also allows you to divert some water back to the fish tank, providing additional aeration and water movement into the tank. This improves the health of the fish.In the picture below you can see the small 600 lph (litres per hour) pump with a small piece of 13mm pipe coming from it. This then has a T-Bar attached and then the 13mm pipe continues up to the 90-degree elbow at the top, which empties the water into the growbed. Coming off the second part of the T-Bar is a simple ball-valve that controls the flow of water that is diverted back into the fish tank.


, Test to see if everything works properly, and to see if the system is watertight!

, This could be hydroton, lava rock, perlite, river stones or other similar matter. Use something that allows the water to flow through the growbed and is non-toxic.

, Initially, add only a couple of small fish, just to start producing the ammonia needed to kickstart the system.

, Setting up your system is just the beginning––you'll need to keep learning more about the use and benefits of the system to make the most of it. As such, it's recommended that you check out additional information on how to actually run your system and to gain a thorough overview in how aquaponics works properly. You can search for more resources online, purchase books about aquaponics or visit your local library to request further information.

If you plant them too early or too late, they could freeze and die before you can harvest your vegetables. Usually about Mid-April to Mid-May will be a good time to plant your vegetables.

While they're technically fruits, a good starter plant to grow is tomatoes. You can plant these in a pot or in your garden.;
, Make sure there is enough space to grow your plants. Use a tiller and till the whole space you will be gardening. Then pull out any weeds and move any large rocks. Things like pumpkins and squash take up lots of space. Make sure they don't strangle other plants. Find out how big your plants get and space them accordingly. Make sure the ground is warm enough and has good drainage to bear your plants. If your plant needs slightly acidic soil, get an acid meter and make sure the soil has enough acidity. Some plants that need acidity are tomatoes and blueberries. You can buy fertilizer that can add acidity to the soil., You can either get seeds or get plant starts (where the seeds are already planted). Go to your local nursery and see what they have. Get fertilizer as well. Make sure to get the right fertilizer for your plants. This will make your plants grow better and faster!,

For plant starts, use a hand shovel and dig a small hole big enough to put your plant in. Water your plant before you put it in so you can moisten the root ball and less the shock on the plant when you plant it. Sprinkle in a little bit of fertilizer and put your plant in. Then surround the plant with dirt and make a small circle around it for water.
For seeds, stick your finger into the dirt where you want to plant the seed until the dirt reaches the second joint on your finger. Then sprinkle a little fertilizer in, place the seed inside, and bury it.

, But don't over-water. This could drown your plant or its roots. Water until the soil is moist., Try to buy a net that you can wrap around your garden, as wildlife (or even your own animals) can destroy your crops. Even if they take just a little bite out of your plant, it could pass a disease and kill it. So protect your crops!, If you planted seeds it will take a few weeks to germinate then sprout. Make sure its getting plenty of water and sun in this germinating process. Remember to water in the mornings. If a hot day happens, you may have to water two or three times that day. Then when the vegetables are ready, pick, wash, and eat them!

Sprinkle the garden with fertilizer every 3-4 weeks.

, Add a few feet onto your garden in its second year. You can even create another garden in your backyard!, Sadly, most garden crops don't come back each year like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries do. But don't worry. You can either go to the store and buy more plants, or you could get seeds out of your crops and prepare them to plant!, Go to your local store and buy some strawberry plants. You will see it has some leaves, some roots, a crown (where the whole plant grows from), and maybe some fruit., Find a pot. Dig a hole big enough to hold all of your roots. Then fill it in after you have put your strawberry plant in. Be careful not to bury the crown as it can rot. For the seeds, stick your finger into the dirt until your whole fingernail is covered. Place your small strawberry seed in and cover it lightly with dirt., Make sure to water well but not too much or the roots and plant will drown., You will see flowers starting to come out. After the flower comes a little green strawberry. You will see this starting to swell. As it swells, the stem its on will be weighted and will start to droop. Try to tie it upright so the fruit doesn't touch the ground. This will make it rot. You will see your fruit turn white. This means its done swelling and it is full size. Finally it will start ripening in the sun and turn red. Once it hits a nice blood red it is ripe., What are those little vines sticking out of the strawberry plant? Those are called runners. You can put them in a pot. Once they take root you can cut the vine and bam! You have a new strawberry plant. Keep it out of direct sunlight for a few weeks as its leaves will wither. After a few months you will start to see it flower and fruit!, Go to a store and buy some pumpkin seeds. Pumpkins don't really come already planted. At least I've never seen them already planted but if you can find some, good for you!, You want to plant them in Mid-Spring. If you found some pumpkin plants, dig a hole big enough to hold your pumpkin's roots, throw in some fertilizer, then put your plant in and fill the hole with dirt., If you planted seeds, you will have to wait a few weeks for them to sprout. They may not all sprout. After they sprout they will grow very large leaves, about as big as you head. Then you will see little vines starting to grow with little flower buds on the end. The flowers will then sprout and will get pollinated. After the flower is pollenated, you will see it wither off and die. Finally a little green pumpkin starting to swell where the flower was., Once your pumpkin is heavy enough it will start to droop and touch the ground. Take a garbage bag and lay it out flat. Place the pumpkin on top of the bag so it wont rot when it touches the ground. When it rains, cover the pumpkin with plastic. If you don't it will get diseases. When the pumpkin reaches full size, it will start to ripen and turn orange. Once it is a nice orange and shiny, it is ripe!, You can get seeds or get plant starts. Make sure the plant starts you get don't have any brown patches as this can indicate disease., In your garden find an area to plant your corn. Make a hole big enough to hold the corns roots, sprinkle in a little fertilizer, then place your corn inside. Fill in the hole. For seeds, make a little hole with your finger, place the corn seed inside, then cover it with dirt., The corn will start out like little blades of grass. If you see this starting to turn yellow, that means you are over-watering. The corn will keep growing. It needs to be ""Knee high by fourth of July"". You will see little corns starting to grow off of the plant. Once little silk tassels come out, give each corn plant a little shake to spread the pollen that's on the top of the plant. All it takes is one little tiny piece of pollen on one tassel to produce corn. After its done, you can pick them and store them for later eating. Maybe dinner that night."

Choose plants that won't shed plant matter into the pool.,
Choose plants that are heat resistant.,
Consider using ways to contain plants.,
Try using fragrant plants.,
Grow lawn to the edge of the pool.",How to Choose Plants to Grow Around Swimming Pools," It's hard enough cleaning a pool regularly without increasing the chances of filter clogging and messy pool water thanks to plants. When selecting plants, choose ones that:


Are evergreen; and
Will not drop leaves, flowers, needles, seeds or bark into the pool; and
Will not release thorns, prickles or other painful things that might be trodden on around the pool area.;
, The body of water in your pool will serve as large heat reflective surface that can scorch plants in close vicinity. This means that the plants you choose must be able to withstand hotter temperatures and sun glare.

, One ideal solution for pool plants is to use containers which can be shifted around at will. Choose containers that can cope with the watery and chlorinated environment; some container materials will deteriorate faster than others under the combined force of heat, sun, water and chlorine.
Alternatively, make use of such features as trellis, pillars or railings that are next to or surrounding the pool to grow plants on. Climbers and creepers are good for such supports and can be regularly trimmed to keep them under control.

, It can be very pleasant to swim and smell sweet fragrance from plants near the pool area. Bear in mind the possibility of attracting bees and other insects not wanted near the pool are though.


Flowers that release their fragrance at night during the summer months can make an excellent choice for those who enjoy evening swims after the sun's heat has started to wane.
Lavender makes a perfect choice for a poolside fragrant plant––smells great, tolerates heat and has a variety of colors and sizes.

, A nice pathway of lawn around the whole pool can be a great way to add some greenery without having any issues with dropping foliage or seeds. It will need regularly mowing maintenance though, and regular fertilizing.

Identify where water collects.,
Check where the water is coming from.,
Check the soil.,
Measure the grade of your lawn.",How to Fix Poor Soil Drainage1," Watch your yard during rainfall. Note exactly where water tends to pool and sit. Also take into consideration how light or heavy the rainfall is, which may affect how large the affected area is. Plant stakes or flags in the center of the area and/or its borders while it's still wet if you think you will lose sight of it once it dries.For example, say you have a spot roughly ten square meters that has standing water after a day of average rainfall.
Then say that, after a heavy rainfall lasting three days or more, the area expands to twenty square meters.
In this instance, the problem area is probably still the original ten square meters, since the surrounding area usually doesn’t experience standing water.;
, First, see if additional water is being concentrated on this spot by a nearby structure, like the roof of your house or shed. Next, check if the water is runoff from an impervious surface, like a driveway or patio, that’s close at hand. Finally, check the lawn’s surface to see if the affected area is noticeably lower than the surrounding area.Water goes wherever gravity takes it, so always work your way up from the affected area to find out how water is getting there.

, Excessive water draining and pooling into a depression in the ground is certainly a problem, but keep in mind that it may not be the only one. Expect the soil itself to possibly prevent water from being absorbed. This may be caused by:Compaction from weight placed on it, such as parking vehicles on the same patch of earth repeatedly.
Thick root structures from vegetation that block the water’s absorption through the topsoil.
Soil that is composed mostly of clay, rather than sand and/or organic matter.

, Take a 3-foot (0.9 m) wooden stake and plant it a third of the way into the ground alongside your house. Do the same with a second stake 100 feet (30.5 m) away from the house, with the affected area in between. Then:Tie a string around the first stake where it meets the ground. Then tie the other end to the second stake, using a level to determine how high up to make your knot, in order to keep the string perfectly horizontal.
Go along the length of the string and measure its height off the ground to see how much it drops as you move away from the house.
Ideally, your lawn should drop off a couple of inches (5 cm) every ten feet (3 m) from your house. If the ground rises again as you move away from the house, this may be part of your drainage problem.

Discover the cause of compaction.,
Reroute traffic.,
Reduce cultivation.",How to Fix Compacted Soil1," Several obvious reasons cause soil compression, such as heavy machinery and foot traffic. Less obvious reasons include over-tilling the soil, leaving the soil bare to the rain, or working with wet soil. Knowing the reason for compaction helps you take precautions to limit it now and avoid it again in the future., Shift livestock, machinery, vehicle, and foot traffic away from the compacted area. Provide alternative routes and block off the area with barriers such as signs and fences. Do this long enough to give the area a rest and consider protecting the area permanently by keeping paths, roads, or stock runs to restrict traffic to one area.Try to designate already degraded soil for paths and household construction to limit the spread of compaction.

, If you use the compacted area for farming or gardening, move your plants somewhere else for at least one growing cycle. Instead, try substituting a cover crop at the end of the season, such as winter wheat or ryegrass. The roots break up the soil, and then next season you can mow and turn it in the soil with a spade or tiller to further aerate.A light, non-machine compaction can often be cured by letting the soil freeze and thaw through one growing cycle.
Tillage radishes can help with severe compaction with their large roots, which work deep into the soil and leave space after they decay.

Review what you're adding to the compost.,
Keep the pile moist and turn it regularly.It's less like a comfortable, dry home when it's damp and getting agitated frequently!,
Visit frequently.,
Review the design of the compost.,
Bury food waste deeply.If rodents seem to be feasting, make it hard for them to get to the tastier morsels (the kitchen scraps) by burying them into the middle of the compost, with the other vegetation layers over the top.,
Encourage local birds of prey to visit the compost heap by locating it near tree branches.,
Provide plenty of physical barriers against rodents.,
Harvest completed compost every three to six months.Doing so can remove potential nesting temptations from the rodents.

",How to Get Rats and Mice out of Compost," Some foods may attract rodents more than others, such as bread and baked items. Avoid putting these in, in particular cooked and processed foods.In addition, do not add meat or fish waste to the compost.Also, keep dairy products, bones, oils, fatty foods, and pet manures out of the heap.(Meat, fish, and dairy shouldn't be composted for any reason in a normal, backyard compost, because these can harbour human pathogens that can harm you.)


Rats that keep coming back are likely to be after vegetable scraps. You might need to stop placing these into the heap until you've solved the problem by redesigning the compost or getting rid of the rats through other means. (This means only adding yard waste, not household food scraps.);
,


The ideal moisture of a compost heap is about the same as a wrung out dish sponge.
Seek a good balance between green and brown materials in the compost to maintain a decent level of moisture.Add water if the heap becomes too dry.
Materials high in carbon (e.g., dry leaves or dead plants) placed at the bottom of the compost pile and lining the walls of the bin can improve airflow, control odour, and help with drainage.Just be sure to keep this ""brown"" material moist.

, Rats and mice are shy when it comes to human disturbance, so daily visits from you can be a good deterrent in itself., If the compost isn't turning vegetable waste into something less attractive to rodents within 24 to 48 hours, the design of the compost needs to be changed.You might need more nitrogen, more bulk to ensure that the compost is heating up enough, smaller compost scraps and more moisture.A hot compost method is more likely to deter rodents than a cold compost method.Apparently rats and mice dislike bokashi,so you might like to consider changing to this method if you've tried to fix your compost heap to no avail.

,


Alternatively, if you don't want to bury the scraps every time, keep a scoop next to the bin and add a layer of leaves, soil, or finished compost over the food scraps each time they're added.These cover up the food odour and microorganisms in soil help to speed up the composting.

, Leave the lower limbs of such trees intact., Keep a lid on the compost heap. Always ensure your compost bin or heap has a lid to keep the local wildlife out of it. To prevent access from burrowing under, stand the bin on 1/4 inch wire mesh.This mesh can also be used to cover up any gnawed holes.


The benefit of the mesh wire over other sorts of stands is that it allows worms free access and having worms in your compost is very desirable, as well as also providing drainage.,"
"
Regrade your lawn.,
Install gutters and drains.,
Create a drainage creek.",How to Fix Poor Soil Drainage2," Water follows gravity, so if it’s collecting in a depression, raise the ground in that area. First, rake up the affected topsoil with a landscape rake so it mixes well with the soil to be added. Then collect soil from a higher site and use your rake to redistribute it over the low-lying area, tilling it well to mix it with the original soil. Fill the depression almost all the way, with about 2 inches (5 cm) to spare. Fill the last two inches by laying sod so its roots prevent the soil from washing away.Remember to keep the slope of your lawn running downward from your house, not toward it.
Your lawn’s slope should ideally lower by a couple inches (5 cm) every ten feet (3 m) from your house.

, If the roof of your house or shed is adding water to a certain spot in your hard, redirect the water by installing water gutters and drains. Definitely do this if water is pooling directly alongside your house, since it may get into the foundation and create mold and cracks. Make sure you place your drains where the ground slopes away from your house so you don’t create a new problem while solving the old one.Installing a rain barrel to collect water from your gutters is a great way to minimize the amount that your lawn has to absorb. It’s also a great no-waste practice, as the rainwater can be used to water plants.

, Map out a creek bed that will carry water downhill from the affected area. Remove 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) of soil along this course. Compact the ground so the bed is flat and the sides are angled up and outward, away from the bed, so surrounding water flows in. Cover the bed and sides with landscape fabric to keep weeds and grass from growing. Then add a ½ inch (1.25 cm) layer of pea gravel over the bed.Be mindful of neighbors when plotting your creek’s course. Diverting standing water might solve your drainage issues, but flooding their yard may create a whole new problem.

"
"
Aerate your lawn.,
Alter the soil’s composition.,
Use vegetation to absorb water.,
Create a rain garden.",How to Fix Poor Soil Drainage3," If the root structure of your grass or other vegetation is so thick that it’s preventing the soil from absorbing the water, use a lawn aerator to break through the barrier. Punch holes through the ground with the aerator’s spikes or tines so the water can reach deeper sooner. Choose from a variety of models (from aerators you can wear under your shoes while walking to others that you push like a lawn mower) based on the size of your affected area.All models are generally divided into two classifications: spike and core aerators. Core aerators are widely considered the most effective.
Aerating your lawn will also attract more worm activity. Worms will create even more pathways for water to travel into and through the soil.

, If a soil test reveals that your lawn is primarily clay, add new elements that will promote water absorption. Use a till or landscaping rake to loosen and remove at least 6 inches (15 cm) of topsoil from the affected area. After removing that, rake the bed of your hole again to loosen the underlying soil so it mixes well with the 6-inch (15-cm) layer of organic materials that you’re about to add. Then rake in a mix of compost, dead leaves, wood chips, tree bark, and horticultural sand.The new organic material will be lighter and more permeable than clay.
It will also promote plant life, which in turn will absorb more water through its roots.
Worms will also be drawn to the richer soil, and the holes they create will increase drainage.
Gypsum and limestone are also effective at breaking up clay for more permeability.

, Plant landscaping trees, shrubs, or plants that are particularly thirsty in or near the affected area. Note how much sun or shade it receives where your drainage problems occur. Choose local vegetation that will thrive in your specific yard. If your soil is mostly clay, be sure to choose plants well adapted to that soil.Ideal plants for clay: (trees) birch, blue spruce, crabapple, douglas fir, eastern hemlock, eucalyptus, Japanese maple, juneberry, Norway spruce, western red cedar; (shrubs) barberry, butterfly bush, hydrangea, rose, viburnum; (plants) bigleaf periwinkle, common juniper, creeping juniper, creeping raspberry, elephant’s ears, geranium., If your soil isn’t clay, but you still experience poor drainage, go a step further and turn the affected area into a rain garden. Dig a hole in the center of that area. Make it deep and wide enough for all of the surrounding runoff or standing water to collect in. Create a planting mix that is 60% sand, 20% compost, and 20% topsoil to fill the hole. Select plants that are native to your area and thrive in water to plant in your new garden.Keep your rain garden at least 10 feet (3 m) from the house and at least 50 feet (15.2 m) from a septic system. In the U.S., call 811 to make sure underground utilities aren't in the way.Ideally, all the water in your rain garden should be absorbed within a day of rainfall. This is partly why creating a rain garden in clay soil isn’t a solution, since water has a tougher time draining through clay.
A rain garden is a great endpoint for gutter drains and dry creek beds to get rid of runoff from roofs, driveways, and patios.

Punch holes with a garden fork.,
Dig up compaction.,
Get a rototiller with an aeration attachment.,
Remove soil cores.,
Replace the soil.",How to Fix Compacted Soil2," For small, grassy areas, a small metal garden fork or sandals with spikes in the bottoms are enough to poke holes in the soil. Aeration holes let in air, water, and roots. Start on one side of the lawn and push the fork into the ground in one direction every few inches or eight to ten centimeters.You may need to repeat the process in a different direction to achieve aeration.

, Loosen the compaction by digging up two or three inches of dirt with a shovel. Take a spade and divide the soil into small rows about a foot wide. Dig small trenches behind these rows, then use the rows of soil to replace the dirt removed from the trenches.For poor soil, you may need to dig deeper, about two spade-lengths, to help aerate the top layer and mix it with better soil.

, Buy or rent a rototiller from a lawn and garden or home improvement store and consider getting an aeration attachment for it. Run the tiller over the soil, then run it over again two or three times, using it to cut deeper.Tillers aren’t as effective on large areas as coring machines since they only break up the top layer of soil.
Tilling too regularly actually contributes to soil compaction, because it creates a hard pan of soil below the tilled area.

, Plug aerators are heavy machines that are useful for large areas of foot traffic such as lawns or fields. Rent the machine from a home and garden store, then set the machine against moist soil. As it rolls across the soil it will pull out a core of dirt, then move it two or three inches away. Repeat throughout the area. Let the removed soil plugs dry before breaking and scattering them.Badly compacted areas require multiple passes of the aerating machine.
Mark off any areas where pipes and roots run close to the surface. The aeration plugs should only be a couple of inches deep, but it can still damage these structures.
There are also hand held aerators which you push into the soil manually and then move, which may be better for smaller lawns or gardens.

, This is an intensive solution and is mostly used for small areas to reintroduce grass. Dig up the compacted soil by hand or by machine. You can gather the soil into a planting mound nearby or bury it in good soil. Bring in new topsoil and spread it over the area.


Check with your lawn and garden or home improvement store for a soil that has the qualities to nurture plant growth.The larger the plant, the more replacement soil it will need to flourish. Trees and shrubs require 15 inches to three feet of replacement soil.

"
"
Let soil dry before use.,
Avoid overworking the soil.,
Work in organic material.,
Limit traffic pressure.",How to Fix Compacted Soil3," A particular time of danger is when gardeners go out to plant in the spring. You will be eager to go out and work, but immediately after rain, the soil is too wet. Working with soil when it is too wet causes it to lose structure and collapse in on itself. Instead, wait until the soil is dry and crumbly.To test for soil ready to be worked, form a ball of soil in your hand. The soil should break apart when worked and when dropped.

, Aerating is beneficial for soil, but tilling it too often keeps the soil from settling. Good soil forms small clumps after being tilled once. These clumps are the pockets that give the soil the structure that permits air and water to penetrate it. It can be tempting to till the soil again and again, but this collapses the soil. Till the soil only before planting and during occasional aeration.


Even consider trying no-till gardening or farming. Some studies have shown no-till farming reduces compaction and increases soil productivity as compared to tilling., While you aerate the soil, add compost or mulch. Yard waste, wood chips, or even food scraps are a cheap option that can be added to lawns, gardens, and even around trees to refresh the soil. Make compost or buy it at a lawn and garden store. The organics are broken down by organisms such as earthworms that aerate the soil.For badly compacted soil, add a 50% compost blend to regular soil and 25% in sandier soils.Avoid amending soil with inorganic material such as sand if possible. Too little sand worsens the compaction.

, Pressure against the soil is a common way to compress it. Avoid riding lawn mowers and use vehicles with wider tires, adjusted air pressure in tires, and less weight on axles. During construction, limit vehicles to areas where the soil will be covered such as by paths or patios. Also, covering the soil with mulch and ¾-inch thick plywood or synthetic substitutes help reduce the pressure on the soil when traffic cannot be avoided."

, Your neighbors are bound to have a lot of potential compost. Talk to them about composting, and ask if they will save their scrap vegetables and the like for you or if you can collect their yard waste. Many municipalities now offer regular yard waste pickup; if your neighbors use this, you can simply ask them to let you collect the yard waste from their bins.

, Some people have fire pits in their yards, or bring a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with you when you go camping, and add the cold wood ash to the mix. Just make sure you are only burning untreated wood or paper in your fire. Wood ashes are highly alkaline (high pH) so should be added in small quantities.


Sea and lake vegetation is remarkably nutrient rich and makes a great addition to your compost, but it is also unsustainable as the tidelands and shores need those nutrients for their own ecosystems. If you live near the ocean, you can probably collect plenty of seaweed. Check your bylaws to make sure seaweed collection is legal in your area.
Whenever you build compost, try to make sure that you are not removing ingredients from a setting where they would be composted- the forest, the shore, parks, etc. The point is to bring nutrients back into the life cycle that were destined for the landfill. By taking organic matter from a place that would benefit from the compost it makes you would be perpetrating the destruction of ecosystems.

Wet a sample of the soil to see what it’s made of.,
Smell the soil and make sure that it smells sweet.",How to Find Good Topsoil1," The more organic material in your soil, the better chance your plants are going to thrive.Topsoil that is too light in color is lacking this material, and will impede the growth of any plants or food that you are trying to plant. In addition, check the surface of the soil for a light or white residue that may indicate the presence of salts or lime, which are both chemicals that can have toxic effects on a garden or lawn.Extremely black topsoil indicates a lack of minerals in your soil. Look for something that’s dark brown, but not black.If the topsoil you want to buy has already been packaged, ask the owner if he has any sample soil you can look at.
If the soil is blue-green or gray, it means it’s been continuously wet or saturated which is not good for topsoil. Avoid buying soil that looks like this.;
, A quick run of your fingers through the soil will give you a good idea of what it’s made up of. Good topsoil should crumble in your fingers. You should feel the grit in it which indicates minerals that are needed for your plants like phosphorus, magnesium, and calcium. Avoid soil that is too hard, as it indicates low organic matter.Soil that clumps up into balls or large chunks is too rich in clay.
Topsoil that is heavy in clay interferes with plant’s ability to aerate and stops water from effectively reaching the plant’s roots.Look for large stones or weed roots which are also bad for topsoil.

, Ideally your topsoil is going to be a perfect combination of silt, clay, and sand. Place a portion of wet soil in the palm of your hand. Rub the sand around and pour a little more water over it while it's in your hand. As the sand becomes wet, you can physically feel for its properties. Gritty soil indicates high sand, smoothness indicates high silt, and stickiness indicates high clay. The sand should be dark and posses a combination of stickiness, grittiness, and smoothness. Ideally you don’t want any one element dominating your topsoil. It should be an equal combination of all three.You can also see if your soil has any unwanted seeds while doing this.
If the topsoil you’re examining is not ideal, ask the soil seller if he has anything else available.

, Good topsoil will smell sweet. Avoid any soils that have an off-odor or smell like chemicals such as gasoline. This indicates unwanted and unnatural chemicals which can stop plants from growing, and makes for terrible topsoil.Topsoil takes hundreds of years to be created naturally, and decomposition should have already taken place. If the soil in question smells like rotting material, stay clear of it."

Determine different locations that sell soil.,
Ask the seller if they can give you a recipe of the soil makeup.,
Ask the seller if the topsoil has been screened.,
Ask to get the soil’s test data.",How to Find Good Topsoil2," There are a number of different locations that you can buy topsoil, like home and gardening department stores, or sometimes you can buy it in bulk from a landscaping company. However, the very best place to get topsoil is at your local cooperative extension, which is sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture.Most of these extensions exist at local universities and specialize in creating the best topsoil with the highest nutrient count.


When you buy topsoil at a chain department store be careful because they often sell a wide variety of different soil for different purposes.
If you need to buy topsoil in bulk, sometimes the seller will have delivery options available for you.

, Ideal topsoil is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay. Percentages vary depending on what gardener you talk to, but typically you’ll want something close to 40%-65% sand, 20%-60% silt, and 5%-20% clay. This combination of elements in soil is sometimes referred to as loam, and is the ideal combination for most topsoil.The seller can sometimes provide this recipe and save you the trouble of determining it yourself.


Remember to look at reviews to see the seller's reputation.
You can purchase topsoil in bulk at a nearby nursery, landscape supply company, or a home and garden store.
If you are buying the soil pre-bagged, sometimes the recipe is on the side of the bag.

, You want pulverized or screened topsoil so that the majority of rocks, unwanted debris, and weeds are removed. Almost no topsoil is going to have a 100% guaranteed weed free blend, however, there are machines that can get most of the weeds out of your topsoil.Weeds will impair the growth of your garden or lawn, and screening will save you time in the future from having to de-weed your garden.
Screening or pulverization also gives your topsoil a more consistent texture.
If you want to save money, you can screen your own topsoil for unwanted material and debris, however removing unwanted seeds will be more difficult.

, Sometimes people who sell soil, or the manufacturers will have test data available that will inform you of its nutrient makeup and pH level. Having this information at the time of sale will save you time and money from having to test the soil yourself. This is different than the recipe and includes valuable information about the different chemicals in your soil.


Avoid soils with a pH value less than 4.5 or greater than 7.0 because these levels are not ideal for growing most plants.Soluble salts absorb water and prevent it from getting to your plant's roots. Ideal topsoil should have less than 0.5 mmhos/cm for soluble salts test performed using a 1:2 soil:water ratio."
"
Buy a soil test kit at a hardware store to determine its chemical composition.,
Take a sample of soil to an cooperative extension for testing.,
Try planting different kinds of seeds in the soil to see if they grow.",How to Find Good Topsoil3," Make sure to buy a kit that tests for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and pH level. Mix in water, soil, and your reactive agent per the instructions on the kit, and see if the topsoil you plan on buying has adequate levels for what you are trying to grow. Nitrogen promotes plant growth and produces chlorophyll, Phosphorus promotes root, fruit, flower, and seed production, and potassium regulates water intake and the movement of sugars within a plant.Different plants and vegetables require different nutrients. Base your levels of nutrients on your plant types.
It should give you descriptions for appropriate nutrient and mineral levels in the instructions of your test.
Sometimes take-home soil test kits are not totally accurate so make sure to read reviews on the brand you are buying., Cooperative extensions exist all over the country to help aspiring farmers or gardeners promote the growth of their crops and gardens.Taking your soil to these professionals will provide you with the most accurate results on the nutrient and mineral makeup of your topsoil.


Cooperative extensions can also provide you with expert knowledge on how to improve growing your crops.
They may also direct you to topsoil retailers and distributors that may help reduce your costs.

, If you don’t want to mess around with chemical and nutrient compositions, a more traditional approach may work for you. Get a sample of the soil before purchasing it in bulk and try to plant whatever intended seeds you’d like to grow. It will take more time, but will allow you to see what kind of topsoil you would be purchasing and if it fits your needs.


Different plants require different minerals and nutrients so make sure to remember to plant a variety of seeds.
You can use a couple of samples of topsoil simultaneously so that you can choose the best one.

You can use a plastic bin, garbage can, bucket, or even a specialty composting box. Composting bins can be any size, but for indoors, smaller is better--you don’t want it to have a strong smell., The number of holes depends on the size of your composter, but you should have enough for the compost to drain evenly--about one hole every two to three inches (6-9 cm)., You’ll need a tray under your composter to catch any liquid draining from the container--you don’t want that on your floor! The tray should be watertight and large enough to hold about a cup (235 mL) of liquid., You can put your composter anywhere, but it’s best to keep it somewhere out of the way to prevent accidental turnovers. This is especially important if you have kids or pets! A cabinet or closet is a good solution., The thickness of the layer depends on how big your composter is--a good rule of thumb is to use a layer of soil about one quarter as thick as the depth of your container., Shredded paper helps absorb excess liquid and helps speed up the composting process. Add enough newspaper to cover the layer of soil, and cover your composter., Use a sealable container like a coffee can to save your food scraps for composting. You can also compost coffee grounds, coffee filters, tea bags, and napkins.Don’t use meat, fish, or dairy scraps in your composter!
Cut the food into smaller pieces to make the process go faster.

, When your scrap container is nearly full, mix in a few handfuls of shredded newspaper to absorb extra liquid., Spread the food and paper mixture evenly across the top of your compost pile. You can add a thin layer of soil to the top to prevent fruit flies, but this is optional., Every week, use a trowel or scoop to mix the layers of compost.

Make sure it’s very damp, but not wet enough to form puddles., You can just put all of your worms on the top of the mixture--they’ll burrow their own way down. Leave them alone for about a week to allow them to get used to their new home. You don’t need to feed them during this week--they’ll gather nutrients from the soil., Save your food scraps in a sealable container and add them to the composter once a week. Don’t add more often than this--your worms need time to break down the scraps.Don’t use animal products! Worms won’t be able to break them down before they rot.

Plant your plants!",How to Compost Indoors3," You’ll need a few things to get started with the bokashi process:A medium to large tarp.
A five gallon bucket with a siphon.
An airtight container that can hold at least five gallons.
A spray bottle with a funnel.
10 pounds (4 kg) of organic wheat bran.
3.17 gallons (12 liters) of warm water.
One cup (240 mL) molasses.
One cup (240 mL) effective microbes, or EM. You can buy EM online or at some specialty garden stores. If you are buying online, make sure the shop is based in your country to avoid customs issues.

, Pour all three together into the five-gallon bucket and stir it until everything is dissolved. Make sure the water is warm--molasses won’t dissolve in cold water!, Lay the tarp down on a flat surface and spread the bran out evenly over the tarp, enough so that the bran is about an inch or two thick., Use the funnel to transfer the water mixture bit by bit into the spray bottle, then spray it over the bran until the bran is wet all over., Use your hands to mix the bran and the water mixture together--you don’t want to leave any dry spots!, Be careful transferring the bran into the bucket--you don’t want any spills! Make sure you seal the container after you’re done pouring the bran., Keep it in the airtight container for about a month. Resist the urge to open it up--the warm, moist, airless atmosphere is essential!, After a month, open your container and spread the bokashi bran onto your tarp. Let it dry for about two days, then put it back in the airtight container. It’s now ready to be used for compost! You can get started right away, but the bokashi will keep for up to two years if you need to wait longer., The bokashi method lets you compost things that aren’t recommended for traditional compost, like meat, fish bones, eggshells, and coffee grounds. Keep a sealable container (like a coffee can) in your kitchen and put all your food waste in it. Don’t use food that’s begun to rot--this can ruin your bokashi. As soon as you have enough scraps to cover the bottom of a five gallon bucket, you’re ready to compost!, When you have enough scraps, pour them into the bottom of your five-gallon bucket and spread them across the bottom. Your food scrap layer should be between one and three inches thick (4 to 10 cm). Press the layer down as much as possible with a dinner plate or your gloved hands., Make sure the food layer is completely covered by the bran! It should be about as thick as the food layer, but it’s okay if they aren’t perfectly even. Keep repeating layers of food and bran until the bucket is completely full, and don’t forget to press each layer! Use the siphon to drain away excess liquid while you’re pressing., Once the bucket is full, put the lid on and let it sit for about two weeks. Don’t open it during this period except to drain liquids out once or twice. You may notice a smell similar to sauerkraut--that’s okay! Bokashi is basically a form of pickling, so you may also notice that your food waste still looks like the original food and not like traditional compost. This is okay too!


Watch out for a decaying smell--that’s a sign that the bokashi has rotted and you’ll need to start over., Once you’ve waited a few weeks, you’re ready to use your compost! Most compost sits on top of the soil, but bokashi should be underground because it’s so acidic. If you are using your compost for your houseplants, put a few inches (6 - 10 cm) of soil at the bottom of a large planter or plastic tub. Pour your bokashi over it until you have about six inches (15 cm) of space left, then fill that space with more soil.


If you are planting outside, you can simply bury the bokashi under about six inches (15 cm) of soil., You should wait at least two to four weeks before planting anything in your bokashi compost. Bokashi is highly acidic and needs time to neutralize--if you put your plants in it right away, they could die!, You can plant directly in the container, or you can scoop out the bokashi and soil and transfer it to smaller planters. Hardier plants are best for bokashi compost, but any plant can thrive--just be sure to mix it with the right soil for your plant! If you want to plant new seeds, make sure the seeds are in the soil, not in the compost--you can add a layer of bokashi above or below the seed. Water and care for the plant as usual."

Layer the leaves and the nitrogen addition.,
Keep the pile moist.,
Wait approximately 1 to 3 weeks before you turn your compost the first time.,
Use a shovel or a pitchfork to dig into the bottom to middle of the pile of compost and turn it.,
Turn the compost up to 3 times per week, or as little as once every 2 weeks.,
Cover it with a plastic tarp to trap the heat inside the compost pile.,
Combine your compost with your soil after 4 to 9 months.",How to Compost Leaves," These are the best leaves for a compost pile. They usually have higher mineral content than manure.;
, Keep it at 10 to 15 percent of your pile. Oak leaves contain more acid that other leaves, which can be poor compost for vegetable gardens.

, If you only have a few types of trees on your property, visit heavily wooded sections of the town in late fall. Ask people you see raking if you can bag up leaves or take their bags of weeds.


Most leaves in a city are swept up with a street sweeper. You can check the fall street sweeping schedule and go the day before to collect extra leaves from the curb.
Try to avoid picking up the leaves at the very bottom of curb piles, because they can contain oil and other residue from cars. Call landscaping companies to ask if they give away leaves they gather. Pick up the leaves at the company’s location.

,, The addition of grass clippings will save you time adding nitrogen later on.

, Have 1 person pile the leaves while the other person grinds.

, Self-propelled mowers are hard to control through a leaf pile.

, Leaves that are ground up will compost much more quickly than those that are whole.

, You can also use wooden slats, like those on a shipping crate. Either material will allow oxygen to get to your compost. If possible, build a swinging gate into 1 side of your compost bin. This opening will allow you to turn your compost more easily and to remove it when you want to use it.

, Compost, when done properly, takes about 6 months. You can start a compost pile in the fall and distribute it through the garden in the spring, before you plant.

, When you first start the pile, it will be loose and prone to blowing around the yard. Plan to cover the compost pile with a plastic tarp, if you cannot construct a container.

, Don’t place it on concrete or it will create standing water.

, The easiest method is to use bags of grass clippings from your mower.

,, Avoid dairy, dense breads or meats.

, You should put several bags (3 to 5) of leaves on the pile, then add a bag of manure or grass clippings, vegetable scraps or manure.

, During dry weather, sprinkle it with a garden hose. Avoid creating standing pools of water, which can encourage mold. The compost should be damp enough that when you can pick up a handful of compost and squeeze, only a few drops of water drip out.

, The heat that forms inside the moist pile of leaves and clippings is often called “cooking.” , The top layer should be buried and the leaf compost should look fresh and wet on the top.

, Frequent turning will make it cook faster.

, You may need to add a little bit of water occasionally, but not very much, or it can also cause mold. , When the compost turns a uniform dark brown, you will know it is time to use it.

Construct a bin for your compost.,
Fill your bin with a balanced mixture (for best results):










Green stuff (high in nitrogen) to activate the heat process in your compost.,
Layer or mix the different materials in your bin so that they come into contact with one another and so that you avoid any large clumps.,
Turn your pile regularly, once every week or two.,
Decide whether to add slow rotting items such as tough branches, twigs and hedge clippings; wood ash; wood shavings and wood pruning.,
Know what not to compost.,
Harvest your compost.",How to Compost," While you still can compost successfully in a pile on the ground, a bin will keep the process neater and will help to discourage animals if you are composting food scraps. Depending on the construction of the bin, it can also help to regulate moisture and temperature. A good minimum size for a pile is at least 1 cubic yard or 1 cubic meter, though a pile can go larger than this, and smaller-scale composting can be made to work.






;
, Perfect heat-generating materials include: young weeds (before they develop seeds); comfrey leaves; yarrow; chicken, rabbit or pigeon manure; grass cuttings; etc. Other green items that compost well include fruit and vegetables; fruit and vegetable scraps; coffee grounds and tea leaves (including tea bags - remove the staple if you wish); vegetable plant remains; plants.

Brown stuff (high in carbon) to serve as the ""fiber"" for your compost. Brown stuff includes fall (autumn) leaves; dead plants and weeds; sawdust straw; old flowers (including dried floral displays, minus plastic/foam attachments); and hay.
'Other items that can be composted but you may not have thought of before: paper towels; paper bags; cotton clothing (torn up); egg shells; hair (human, dog, cat etc.) Use all these items in moderation.

Air. It is possible to compost without air (anaerobically), but the process employs different bacteria and an anaerobic compost pile will take on a sour smell like vinegar. It may also attract flies or take on a matted, slimy appearance. If you believe your compost pile needs more air, turn it, and try adding more dry or brown stuff to open up the structure. Turning a compost pile can be labor intensive and hard on the back. Some people use a shovel or pitchfork. There are also compost aerating tools that aim to make the process easier that are either of the ""winged"" type or ""corkscrew"" type.

Water. Your pile should be about as damp as a sponge that has been wrung out. Depending on your climate, you can add water directly or rely on the moisture that comes in with ""green"" items. A lid on the compost bin will help to keep moisture in. If a pile gets too much water in it, it might not get enough air.

Temperature. The temperature of the compost pile is very important and is an indication of the microbial activity of the decomposition process. The simplest way to track the temperature inside the heap is by feeling it with your hand. If it is warm or hot, everything is decomposing as it should, but if it is the same temperature as the surrounding air, the microbial activity has slowed down and you need to add more materials that are high in nitrogen to the bin.

Soil or starter compost. This is not strictly necessary, but a light sprinkling of garden soil or recently finished compost between layers can help to introduce the correct bacteria to start the compost cycle a little more quickly. If you are pulling weeds, the soil left on the roots may be sufficient to serve this purpose. Compost starters are available, but probably not necessary.

, Especially avoid compacting large quantities of green materials together, since they can rapidly become anaerobic.









If possible, start with a layer of lightweight brown material, such as leaves, to help keep enough air near the bottom.
Try for a mixture of anywhere from 3 parts brown to 1 part green to half and half, depending on what materials you have on hand.
Sprinkle each layer lightly with water as you build the heap, if it requires additional moisture.

, Clear a patch next to the pile. Then use a pitchfork and move the entire pile to the clear spot. When it is time to turn the pile again, move it back to the original spot, or back into the bin. Mixing the pile in this way helps to keep air flowing inside the pile, which encourages aerobic decomposition. Anaerobic decomposition will smell very stinky (generally sour, like vinegar) and they decompose materials more slowly than aerobic bacteria. Turning the pile helps to encourage the growth of the right kind of bacteria and makes for a nice, sweet-smelling pile that will decompose faster.









Try to move matter from inside to outside and from top to bottom. Break up anything that is clumpy or matted. Add water or wet, green materials if it seems too dry. Add dry, brown materials if the pile seems too wet. If you are still adding to the pile, take the opportunity while you turn it to introduce the new matter and mix it well with the older matter.

, They can be composted, but you may want to compost them separately because they will take longer to break down, especially in a cold climate with a shorter composting season. Shred heavy materials, if you can, for faster decomposition.








, Never compost the following items for reasons of health, hygiene and inability to break down: meat and meat scraps; bones; fish and fish bones; plastic or synthetic fibers; oil or fat; pet or human feces (except for manure of herbivorous creatures such as rabbits and horses); weeds that have gone to seed; diseased plants; disposable diapers (nappies); glossy paper or magazines; coal and coke ash; and cat litter. Place these items in the normal garbage collection.









You should also try to avoid composting bread, pasta, nuts, and cooked food. They don't break down very easily, become quite slimy, and can hold up the heating, rotting-down process. (Old nuts left in the garden will disappear quickly if you have squirrels or monkeys around!)
Manure of any animal that eats meat should never be added. While herbivorous animals' manure can be great for composting, the manure of a pig, dog, cat, or other carnivore/omnivore can contaminate your compost and plants with foodborne illnesses.

, If all goes well, you will eventually find that you have a layer of good compost at the bottom of your bin. Remove this and spread it on or dig it into your garden beds.









You may wish to sift it through a coarse mesh screen or use your hands or pitchfork to remove any larger chunks that haven't yet broken down.
Very fresh compost can grow plants, but it can also rob the soil of nitrogen as it continues to break down. If you think you are not all the way done, either leave the compost in the bin for a while longer or spread it in your garden and let it sit there for a few weeks before planting anything in it.
There is nothing wrong about leaving compost to wait (keep pitchforking) for high wood and bark. Pitchforking will usually move these materials to the top. Collect underneath the pile for this season. Leave the rest for next year. After about 5 years of this process (compost) the soil has enough nitrogen not to rob the plants. Peas and beans add to the nitrogen in the soil. Corn removes it. What you grow is as important as how to handle slow-composting material.

Choose the right mulch for your landscaping needs.,
Select the areas where you will apply the mulch.,
Measure the areas where you will apply mulch.,
Determine the amount of mulch to purchase.,
Decide to buy mulch in bags or bulk.,
Compare prices.",How to Buy Mulch," Cypress, pine, hardwood and cedar are the most popular types of mulches. Look for mulch that is readily available in your local area.


Buy cypress mulch for its water holding benefits. Cypress has the capacity to hold more water than other forms of wood mulch, which reduces water evaporation from the soil. However, cypress mulch may reduce the amount of water actually reaching the plant roots.
Consider pine and hardwood mulches for their long-lasting beauty.
Purchase cedar as a natural form of insecticide and a good option for reducing bugs.;
, Carefully evaluate your garden, lawn and general landscape. Good places to apply mulch include flower beds, vegetable gardens, borders, walkways, play areas and around trees and shrubs.

, Measure the width and length of every area that you intend to mulch. Jot down your measurements.

,


Calculate the amount of mulch you need in cubic yards. Bulk mulch is sold by the cubic yard, which is the measurement widely used in the gardening industry for mulch. One cubic yard (27 cubic feet) will provide 1 inch of coverage over 324 square feet.
Evaluate how deep you want the mulch. The amount of mulch you buy depends on how deep you want the mulch to be. Most gardening experts recommend 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) over general soil, with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) around vegetables, flowers and shrubs.
Figure out how many cubic yards you need by multiplying the width and length of each area to determine the square footage. Multiply the square footage by the desired depth of the mulch (1 to 3 inches or 2.5 to 7.6 cm), and then divide by 324.

,


Get bags of mulch to cover small areas. Bags of mulch usually come in quantities of 2.0 cubic feet. Note that bags of mulch come in different measurements than bulk mulch - cubic feet vs. cubic yards. For each cubic yard, you will need an average of 13 bags of mulch. Bags of mulch may save you time. You can empty a few bags into a wheelbarrow and apply it to your landscape without having to use a shovel. They are also easier to transport.
Purchase bulk mulch for larger landscaping needs. Bulk mulch is less expensive than the bagged version and may be a smart alternative if you have several areas that need mulching. Be prepared to shovel the mulch into wheelbarrows or other containers to transport it to your garden areas.

, Visit several garden stores to compare prices on bagged or bulk mulch. Factor in delivery costs if you are purchasing bulk mulch. If you are buying bags of mulch, check the store's return policy. Often stores will allow you to return extra bags of unopened mulch if you purchase too many.

Identify the needs of your plant.,
Choose between organic and conventional potting soils.,
Determine how often your plants will require fresh soil.",How to Choose Plant Soil1," Look your plant up online, flip through a plant identification book, or read the tag that accompanies the plant when you buy it. These are ways to find information about the specific needs of the plants you will be adding to your garden, and you can use this material to select the appropriate type of soil your plants require:Consider, for example, the amount of moisture your plant needs. A desert plant is going to require sandy potting soil that can drain more easily than the soil for a wetland plant.
Take the PH level that your plant needs into account. While most potting mixes have a pH of 7.0, a plant like the African Violet requires a more acidic soil, specifically one with a pH of 6.0.Native plants will have specific soil requirements. Always read more about the specific needs of your plant or ask at your local nursery what the optimum soil and pH are for any given native plant.;
, Different plants will require various nutrients, some of which may not always be produced naturally. The following knowledge will allow you to make an informed decision when the time comes to select the best soil for your plants or garden:Organic potting soil is eco-friendly, as it is composed of microorganisms, decaying plant material, worms, and other natural elements. It contains microscopic organisms that add nutrients and minerals to the soil.
Conventional potting soils contain ingredients such as peat, manure, and black hummus. All fertilizer or nutrients in non-organic potting soil have been manufactured and added by humans.

, If your plants require new soil at the start of every season, conventional soil might be a better option for you, for whereas organic potting soil is reusable, conventional soil is disposable.


If you decide to go with organic soil, you will be able to safely recycle ecologically friendly materials in pots or spread them in your outdoor garden.
Conventional soil must be discarded after only one season, when potted plants are no longer able to absorb nutrients from this soil; on the upside, you get to start every season anew with fresh, clean soil."
"
Select medium-weight potting soil for plants that are exposed to full sunlight.,
Use lighter soil for hanging plants or for plants that grow in the shade.,
Avoid using heavy soil.",How to Choose Plant Soil2," Medium-weight soil holds water better than light soil. Lightweight soil may become too dry to support the plant when exposed to the sun for long periods of time.Soil weight will be listed on the bag you purchase.

, If the soil is too heavy, it may become soggy and harm the plant.Re-pot a plant rooted in extremely light, airy soil when you get it home from the store, even if it is a hanging plant or a shade plant. Extremely light soil, composed of peat and sphagnum moss, dries out quickly and may kill your plant., It may be too compacted for your potted plant and won't allow air to get to the roots. Heavy soil also may have too much sand, which retains few nutrients, and may drain poorly, which can cause plant roots to rot.Use a sandier soil when planting desert plants. It should provide better drainage and contain fewer nutrients than the potting mix you use for most other plants. This will allow the plants to flourish."
"
Buy a potting mix with a continuous-release fertilizer included in the soil.,
Note the ratio of the various types of fertilizer.,
Replenish your plants' nutrition with a liquid fertilizer.",How to Choose Plant Soil3," This is a way to ensure that your plants have all the necessary nutrients they need. Follow the instructions on the bag when you use a soil premixed with dry fertilizer.

, The minerals nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium -- N-P-K -- are listed alongside three numbers on soil bags. For example, a mix of 20-10-10 means there is twice as much nitrogen as phosphorous or potassium. Different types of plants require different mixes of these minerals, so consult a plant identification guide to determine the right balance for your plant.Leafy plants require soil with more nitrogen. The higher nitrogen mix would be 20-10-10 on the bag.Flowering plants need more phosphorous in a ratio such as 10-20-10 for good blossoms and a healthy root structure.To promote plant health and foster disease resistance, use a ratio such as 10-10-20, which contains more potassium., Spraying your plants with liquid fertilizer every two weeks will supply additional nutrients and contribute to your plants' healthy growth.Popular liquid fertilizers include seaweed or fish emulsion blends.You can purchase liquid fertilizer online or at most gardening stores.

"
Select a center-axle drum with doors on both ends of the tumbler for ease of operation.",How to Buy a Compost Tumbler1," The center axle around which the tumbler turns breaks up compost and allows air to get at the compost, which helps break down the material.


One drawback to center-axle drums is that some are situated close to the ground. It may be hard on your back removing the compost, but a low wheelbarrow positioned right under the door will help ease the job.;
"
"
Buy a crank-operated drum tumbler for ease of use and emptying.",How to Buy a Compost Tumbler2," Many crank-operated drum tumblers are situated higher off the ground. These tumblers cost more than some other tumblers but have a crank handle and baffles inside to mix and aerate the compost.


To empty crank-operated drum tumblers simply situate a wheelbarrow underneath and turn the drum so the door is above the wheelbarrow. Open the door of the tumbler to let the compost empty into the wheelbarrow.

"
"
Beware if you select a base-rolling drum because some are harder to operate than others.",How to Buy a Compost Tumbler3," Select a base-rolling tumbler with rollers or wheels on the base and steps built in so you can easily roll the drum with your feet to aerate and mix the compost inside.


Base-rolling drum tumblers are close to the ground, which makes the tumblers harder to empty. You must shovel out the composted material through small openings instead of just tipping the compost into a wheelbarrow.

"
"
Economize with an inexpensive roll-around sphere tumblers shaped like a ball or a round geodesic dome.",How to Buy a Compost Tumbler4," Operate a roll-around sphere tumbler by placing the compost inside and periodically rolling the sphere around the yard to aerate and mix the compost.


Roll-around spheres are relatively inexpensive but are awkward to roll and the hardest type of tumbler to empty. The more material inside the sphere, the harder it is to tumble the sphere around the yard.
An advantage of base-rolling drums and roll-around spheres is that you can roll the tumblers to wherever you want to apply the compost.

"
"
Some composting tumblers have two drums in one composter so you can keep adding material to one drum and allow the contents of a second drum to finish composting fully.,
Consider buying a composter that automatically diverts fully composted material into a chamber you access separately from the main drum chamber.

",How to Buy a Compost Tumbler5," You have to stop adding contents to a composter at some point so the composting process can finish.

Identify where to go during an evacuation.,
Create a family communications plan.,
Assemble an emergency supplies kit.",How to Survive a Flood1," Sit down with your family to establish a plan of action. Pick several meeting spots in case you need to leave home, such as a friend’s home in a safe town or a shelter in your area. Make sure everyone in the family knows where these locations are and how to get there. Make sure the shelters and the routes to them are through high ground.Call your local Red Cross chapter, emergency management office, or planning and zoning department. These coordinators will have designated shelters, such as schools or stadiums.;
, Print out blank plans on fema.gov. Write down contact information, neighborhood meeting spots, and personal identification details. It’ll make everyone easier to find in case of an emergency.

It’s better to text during the flood. Texts have a better chance of getting through and don’t tie up lines needed for emergencies., Ready a kit that includes basic necessities. A good kit will have enough food and water for everyone for at least three days. Pack at least three gallons of water per person so everyone can drink a gallon a day. Bring a week’s worth of any special medications your family needs and a first aid kit. Pack at least one clothing change for each person. Include warm clothing and rain-resistant gear.Remember to check your food supplies every year. Replace expiring food.
Bring personal identification documents such as passports, driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and bank account numbers. Also pack some extra cash. Store these in a waterproof container.
Think of what you and your family will need to complete your kit. You may include items like a can opener, duct tape, pet supplies, baby supplies, and sanitary items.

Evacuate dangerous areas immediately.,
Move to higher ground away from water.,
Avoid crossing through water.,
Stay out of moving water.,
Swim backwards to survive moving water.",How to Survive a Flood2," You may have only a short time to escape. Act quickly, utilizing your planned route. Head to designated shelters during flood warnings. When emergency services tell you to leave, listen to their instructions. Some people think they can ride out the storm, but keep yourself safe by taking proper precautions.


Leave everything behind. Don’t stop to move valuables. Grab your emergency kit and go.

, Whether you are on foot or have to abandon your car, higher ground is your best option. Get away from areas with storm drains, streams, creeks, or rivers. If you’re stuck at home, head for the roof..

, Water up to your ankles is enough to be dangerous. You cannot see how deep the water is the rest of the way. Six inches (15.24 cm) of water is enough to reach the bottom of cars and cause stalling. 12 inches (30.48 cm) will float away most vehicles. Never try crossing standing water.Keep in mind the motto, “Turn around, don’t drown.” When you’re in doubt about water depth, don’t risk it.
Children should always be kept out of the water. It can get very deep or fast, and it’s difficult for even adults to escape once caught in it. The water also will be very dirty.
If you have to go through water, bring a stick. Use it to measure the water’s depth and feel for stable ground., Moving water is never safe to approach. The current is usually stronger than it appears and even a slight current is strong enough to carry off adults and vehicles. Most flood deaths come from people trying to drive through water. Don’t risk it..


Don’t drive around barricades. They’re there for your safety.
If your car does get stuck in water, open the windows, breaking them if you have to. Once water enters the car, you’ll be able to open the door and escape., Turn over on your back instead of fighting the tide. Keep your feet positioned upstream, using them to push away from obstacles floating with you. Try to find something to hold onto, such as a strong branch or roof. Once you do this, point your feet downstream and yell for help.Never go under debris. Keep your head above water and avoid the debris or pass over it.
Yelling for help makes it easier for rescuers to spot you. Wave an arm if you have the strength. Don’t give up until someone comes for you.

Insure your house against flooding.,
Barricade your home against floodwater.,
Reduce flood damage to utilities and valuables.",How to Survive a Flood3," Flood insurance can save you a lot of hassle if your home or business is damaged. Check with your insurance company for policy details. If you are in a high-risk area for floods, you should be insured. People in other areas may choose flood insurance to protect against water damage., Sealing your basement makes it more resistant to water. Fill in cracks and spread sealant over the walls. Keep the gutters on your house clean, too. Levees and floodwalls may also be built to help hold back floodwater.Install a sump pump. When the pump senses water on the floor, it pumps it out of your home. Make sure the pump drains properly and maintain its battery-powered backup with fresh batteries.

, Raise up your furnace, water heater, and electric panels. They should be installed on top of blocks or set higher in the wall than normal. This will better prevent them from getting wet. Before a flood occurs, store all valuables, such as expensive rugs, appliances, and important documents, on a higher floor in your home.Disconnect your utilities when there’s potential for a flood. Shut off the main valves and breakers. Unplug all electrical appliances unless you are standing in water.Take care of valuables before flooding begins. You may not have time to do this once the water starts rising

"
"
Listen to the news for flood risk warnings.,
Watch known flood areas.,
Listen to the authorities for directions.",How to Survive a Flood4," Flooding information can be found on your local news or weather station’s TV channel or website. Tune in to monitor changes in the weather. Also, listen to local radio stations for periodic updates.A flood watch means that flooding may happen in your area. A flood warning means flooding is happening or will occur soon.

, Keep an eye on dangerous areas such as drainage channels, canyons, and streams. These tend to overflow quickly in flash floods and are very dangerous. Stay far away from them and recognize any that are near you. They may cause flooding before there are any news reports., If you are evacuated, don’t attempt to go home until the authorities say it’s safe to do so. Floodwaters can persist for some time even after the immediate threat is gone. In addition, listen for the authorities to say that water from the community water supply is safe to drink.Stay tuned to news sources on the radio, TV, and online.

Watch out for damaged areas.,
Avoid downed electrical lines and flooded areas.,
Turn off all electrical and gas lines.,
Use a stick to check for snakes.,
Take pictures of your home for insurance purposes.,
Make repairs to your home.,
Clean your home.",How to Survive a Flood5," Roads and other paths will have been eroded. Stay off of bridges. The soil under usual routes will be muddy and less able to support the weight of vehicles. Find alternate routes over high ground or wait for the authorities to indicate which roads are safe.Buildings that were hit by floodwaters are also dangerous. They may have unseen damage and collapse on you. Stay away from them.

, Assume any downed power lines or electrical wires are live. Don’t approach them. Assume any floodwater you see is also dangerous. Stillwater may be contaminated with gas, oil, and sewage. They may also have become electrified.Don’t try to enter buildings surrounded by floodwater.

, Your home may have suffered structural damage, including wet electrical wires and gas leaks. Don’t depend on standard power sources. Instead, inspect your home for damage using a flashlight. When possible, have a professional repair the damage.If you smell gas or hear hissing, get away from your home immediately.
Don’t use candles or lanterns until you’re certain the gas lines are secure.

, Dangerous animals may have washed into your home or taken shelter there. Overturn hidden areas with a stick or pole as you search for damage. The last thing you need is to have a pet or family member bitten by a snake. Have an animal control specialist come help remove them., This may be the last thing you think of, but it’s important to document the damage. Get movies or pictures of your entire house. Use a disposable camera if you have to so you can get accurate pictures of the damage. Continue capturing the necessary documentation as you clean. Contact your insurance agent for more information.

Doing this will make insurance claims, disaster assistance applications, and income tax deductions much easier to complete down the road.

, Your house may be unsafe to occupy. A sump pump, wet-dry shop vacuum, or water pump will remove standing water. Have a professional check your home for structural damage.

",How to Build a Compost Pile," The pile should be easily accessible, and, depending on your preferences, hidden from the main view of your yard/garden. Some people do not mind looking at their compost pile in their garden, but if you prefer not to see it, be sure to find a location out of sight or screen it off.









The reason the pile must be easily accessible is because you will be using it — a lot. You will add to, turn and remove the finished compost from the pile, and you do not want it to be a chore just getting to the pile!
You will also need to add water during dry spells, so locate the pile within reach of the hose. It is important to locate the pile away from all structures, since the composting process is one of decay and rotting your house, shed or fence should be avoided.
Check your municipality for local ordinances against placing compost piles close to lot lines; you may not be able to simply place your compost pile wherever you want.;
, While you can set up your compost pile during any season, certain times are better than others. During the spring or summer, high-nitrogen materials are ever-present, but not that much carbon material exists. Fall is when both high-nitrogen (lawn trimmings) and high-carbon materials (dead leaves) are plentiful.







, The fastest compost pile to build is a simple mound — just throw everything to be composted into a heap and let it rot. Or, you can enclose the pile with rocks, boards, concrete chunks or fencing.









If you decide you want a faster, more efficient means of composting, try using a composting bin and introduce your own vermicompost system. Because of the enclosure, compost bins are generally more efficient at breaking down organic materials than compost piles.

, There are as many different ways to build a pile foundation as there are ways to dream it up. A very basic pile is all you really need, although you can upgrade to fancier, more aesthetically-pleasing containers if you'd like. Here's how to build your super-basic container:









Measure out a plot at least 3'x3'. This will be big enough to accommodate a lot of organic material without creating an eyesore in your back yard.
Get some wooden 2x4s or similarly-sized wooden stakes (bonus points for medium branches that have more of a rustic look). Grab enough so that you can drive the 2x4s into a 3'x'3 square about every half-foot along the perimeter. This will take anywhere from 15 to 20 stakes.
Drive a stake into the ground about every half-foot, until you've sectioned off a square. You may want to leave an opening on one of the sides. This will make it easy to reach your pile and turn it with a shovel or fork.

, You can compost anything that rots — except greasy or diseased plants. Foods like cheese or meat do not decay properly and will lead to rodent and non-beneficial insect problems.









Diseased plants are best composted in a container where the heating process can kill the pathogens. A compost pile heats unevenly, unless you turn it every few days being diligent in making sure that all plant material spends time in the center of the pile. So, it’s easiest to just leave the diseased plants out and avoid the possibility of spreading trouble in your garden.

, It is usually recommended that you add 60% carbon to 40% nitrogen.Layer your materials with a slight mist from a garden hose to dampen (do not wet or soak) each layer.









If all you have is green plant material (like grass), you can add newspaper as the carbon source. Other sources of compostable carbon include:

Straw
Dry leaves
Used animal bedding
Shredded cardboard
Sawdust and wood chips
Small branches/twigs
Paper towel, It is up to you whether you shred the material or not. If you want a faster composting cycle, then shredding speeds the process up considerably. Shredding also makes for a neater looking pile and one that is easier to turn.









What does shredding do? Shredding creates a bigger surface area for organic materials, thereby exposing them to more bacterial invasion.Larger pieces of organic material impede aerobic decomposition.
Do not shred highly vegetative or moist organic materials. These materials become too soggy. Their moisture contents make aerobic decomposition a lot more tricky.

, This part is the most fun. Every time you add to your compost pile, try to add in layers. There are three basic layers in a compost pile, and putting them down together and in the right order is important:










Layer one — carbon: Materials that will provide carbon include hay, sod, straw, leaves, untreated sawdust, chopped corncobs, corn stalks, or small twigs. Put the bulkier items at the bottom of the pile, and lighter materials on top.

Layer two — nitrogen: This is the ignition, so to speak, that starts the composting process. Manures, fertilizers, vegetable wastes, grass clippings, garden debris, and starters provide nitrogen for your microbial army.

Layer three — topsoil: Avoid sterile potting soils or those soils treated with insecticides, as these do not contain or nurture much-needed microbes.

, Every 8 inches (20.3 cm) or so, add some coarser material to guarantee proper air flow. Twigs or large plant stems can be good. You can use non-compostable material as well, so long as it does not leak toxins into your compost. The compost is, in a way, a living, breathing thing. The decay process is completed by microbes, beneficial insects and worms — all of which need air and water to survive.








, This is done by lifting the middle to the outer edges and the outer edges to the middle using a pitchfork. Also, water if dry. This will ensure proper and even distribution of the decomposition process.








, You want to keep the center of the pile hot and evenly moist. Whenever the center of the pile dips below 110 °F (43 °C), use a shovel to stir the pile and turn organic material around.








You will know if the pile is hot, because in cooler weather you will see steam. In warmer weather, you can feel the heat when you turn the pile.
Remember that too much water will drown the microbes and chase away the worms; this can also cause the pile to get a ""rotten"" odor. If the pile gets too dry, the decay process stops. Aim for evenly moist.

, If you seldom add new layers to your compost, you won't have to stir very often. A small compost pile that's assembled in the fall should be ready to use 3 or 4 months later at the beginning of spring.








, A hot pile rots faster, but it is not necessary. You can decide to just throw all of your vegetation onto the pile and let nature take care of it. This is a slower process and takes about a year to decay most plants. To keep the pile hot, every few days go out and turn it.

Avoid placing animal products into your compost pile.,
Ensure that the moisture level in your compost pile is ideal.,
Ensure that the ratio of carbon to nitrogen is ideal.,
Avoid compacting your compost too densely.,
Do not purchase earthworms or inoculation kits for your compost.",How to Avoid Common Composting Mistakes," An easy composting mistake can be avoided by leaving fats, dairy, meat, and bones out of your compost. These materials will go rancid and generate unpleasant odors as well as attracting rodents and other unwanted animals to your compost. Meats and dairy also provide a breeding ground for harmful pathogens.;
, Another common composting mistake is using too little or too much water in your compost pile. Ideally, a handful of your compost should have the consistency of a wrung-out sponge - moist but not dripping.


If a compost pile has too little moisture, it will decompose very slowly because the bacteria and fungus need moisture to break down the materials. A dry compost pile can also attract ants and wasps, so add more water immediately if you see these insects proliferating.
If a compost pile is too wet, the microbial organisms in it will start reproducing anaerobically because the water has choked off their oxygen supply. This can be diagnosed by a foul ammonia-like smell.

, Another composting mistake that can be made fairly easily is improperly adjusting the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the compost. Carbon-rich materials, including paper, dried leaves, and cardboard, should make up about 3/4 of the pile's volume. Nitrogen-rich materials, such as coffee grounds, vegetable scraps, and grass clippings, should comprise the remaining 25 percent.


If your compost has too little nitrogen, it will decompose very slowly. Unlike a compost pile with too little moisture, however, it will not necessarily attract ants and wasps.
If a compost pile has too little carbon, the excess nitrogen-rich materials will be metabolized anaerobically, generating an ammonia-like odor.

, The bacteria and fungus that drive the decomposition need a continuous supply of fresh oxygen to do their work. This oxygen will be cut off if your compost pile is too dense, leading again to an ammonia-like odor. Loosen your compost with a pitchfork and add loose materials like tree branches to remedy this problem.

, A composting mistake often made by newcomers is to purchase earthworms or microbial inoculation kits to get their compost piles going. These kits are essentially ""snake oil,"" and are never needed to start or maintain a healthy compost pile. Native worms, bacteria, and fungus will be attracted to your compost pile from its very first day.

Be sure to check back every so often; the maps are sometimes redrawn as conditions change.The main factor determining your risk is whether you are in a floodplain or not, which you can check with flood maps.Several other factors put you at risk for floods. For instance, if your main floor is below the base flood elevation in an area, you're at risk for flooding. You're also at risk if your near a body of water, such as a lake or a river. You're especially at risk near the ocean.;
, That is, know the best ways in and out of your neighborhood and other areas of the city when it's flooded. You'll need to stick to higher ground if you need to evacuate. Also, have a planned meeting place for your family members if you get separated. Have the plan written down. Go over it together so everyone knows what to do.The best way to plan an evacuation route is to use flood maps, which will show where the worst flooding will be in your area.When planning your evacuation route, have an established place to go. For instance, you can set up a plan with a friend ahead of time to evacuate to his or her house, or go to your workplace if it is out of the flood zone. Many communities also have areas designated for emergencies where you can go.

, That is, show them the emergency numbers you have displayed in your home. Show them how to dial the numbers, and go over what they need to say in an emergency. Also, have a safety contact in the neighborhood that they can go to if they have a problem., Designate one person who is not in the immediate area as the person your family checks in with. That way, at least one person will have all the information who is not in immediate danger., When thinking about how you will evacuate, don't forget to include your pets in your plan. Have enough carriers for all your pets so that you can evacuate them with you if needed.Carries keep pets contained so you can evacuate them without harming them.Don't forget to include other items for your pets. They'll need containers for food and water, as well as food and their normal medications if you evacuate. Remember, not all emergency shelters will allow pets. Also, try to take something that will remind them of home, such as a toy or blanket.If you must stay in your home, move your pets to the highest point in the house with you., If possible, buy flood insurance so that you can recover from the damage of flooding. If you live in an area with low risk, insurance shouldn't be too expensive. If you live in an area with higher risk, it will be more expensive, but it will be worth it if flooding ever destroys your home. In fact, you are required to have it in a high risk area if you have a federally insured loan.You can get insurance through a federal program, the National Flood Insurance Program, by filling out forms on their website., For water, that means packing enough for each person to have a gallon per day. For food, pack non-perishable foods like canned goods that you don't need to cook. Keep these supplies in a waterproof container.Don't forget to include a can opener with your food, as well as some utensils for eating.Also, remember your pets need to eat and drink, too, so take them into account., You'll need a multipurpose tool that includes items like a screwdriver and knife. You also need extra phone chargers and a spare set of keys., Keep a first aid kit in your box, along with a supply of soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, and other toiletry items. Antibacterial hand wipes are also good to keep on hand., These items can include things such as sunscreen, bug spray, emergency blankets, and rain boots., That is, have a weather radio with extra batteries. You'll also need to keep friends and family informed, as well, so remember to have emergency contact information on hand., As noted earlier in the article, you can ask the your county planning department about the frequency of flooding at a potential building site.If you have no choice about where you build and you're located in a flooding area, you need to build an elevated, reinforced house to protect against flooding., Your furnace, air conditioner, electrical unit, and hot water should all be lifted above the ground to keep them from being flooded.Also, electrical outlets and wiring should be a foot above any flooding that's likely.You should have a professional perform these tasks.

, Make sure you have copies of all of your insurance policies, pictures of your possessions and home, and any other important documents in a safe place. You either need to keep them in a waterproof box in your home or in a safety deposit box., A sump pump pumps out collected water, usually in basements. If you're home is prone to flooding, put one in your home, and be sure it has a battery back up in case your electrical goes out., These valves prevent flood waters from coming up drains., Have a professional evaluate your home and create barriers around your home that will prevent water from entering your house., If you have a basement, have the walls sealed with a waterproof sealer, which will help keep water out of that area., Turn on the weather radio for reports on flooding in the area so you can stay informed., If you have standing water, turn off the electricity by flipping the main breaker switch to your house's electricity. You should also turn it off if you plan to leave when there is flooding or if you see power lines on the ground., You should locate it ahead of time. Generally, you turn the handle a quarter of a turn until it is perpendicular to the pipe to shut off the gas. You'll need a crescent wrench to make the turn., Usually, you will need to turn a small valve to the right several times to turn it off., Wash the areas with a bleach solution, and rinse them clean. Fill them up to have clean water available to you. Also fill up any other pitchers or containers you have with water., If you have furniture or grills, bring them inside or tie them down to secure them., If you have enough warning, move any important items, such as electronics or valuable furniture to higher ground, such as upstairs or in the attic."

Keep it simple, in order to keep down the costs. If you'd like flowers and shrubs, consider where these are to be placed in the garden, for maximum show and effect.


For the sake of reducing costs, it's often best to choose plants that grow well in your area and climate. This increases the chances that the plants will survive and won't have to be replaced.
Perennials, shrubs and trees are good value because they don't need to be replaced yearly. Once established, such plants can produce interesting foliage, pretty blooms and, in some cases, edibles, throughout different times of the year, not just the warmer months.;
, If you have a large garden space, don't attempt to cover it all at once. Instead, plan to plant a portion of the garden first, ensure that is doing well, then gradually increasing the area gardened. You can make use of seeds and cuttings from the initial part of the garden as well.

, Seeds can save you a great deal of money over choosing seedlings. While seedlings are convenient, the amount you get for the price paid will be far less than purchasing seeds. Moreover, seeds give you a greater variety to choose from, including heirloom and long forgotten varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers.


Do some online research to find suitable suppliers in your area. In many cases you can have the seeds shipped to you after ordering them online.
Check the online prices against the local gardening store prices, to enable you to choose the lowest price.

, This includes potting soil, containers, digging implements, and so forth. Check the sales for some items, as you may be able to find good quality tools and gardening gear at reduced prices. Look for bargains related to buying in bulk, especially for soil, vegetable plants, garden stakes and fencing.


Look on Freecycle, Craigslist, or similar places to find infill soil. If you have the ability to transport this and you can verify it's quality soil, this can be a free source of extra soil for your garden.

, Check out their reduced price section on plants. Plants that aren't thriving or selling as well are often reduced for clearance. You take a risk on the plant not surviving but if you've only paid a few dollars, it can be worth the try and many such plants do pull through given TLC.


Some plants, such as end-of-season tomato and bell pepper plants in tubs, may go for very little in order to ensure the store gets something for them. These can be grown indoors for a while longer, producing some fruits and vegetables for you as it gets colder.

, After each season, when the annuals are spent, save the seeds for next year's blooms and crops. Ensure that the seeds are stored dried and place them in small envelopes. Label and date so that you remember which seeds are which. Store in a cool and dry place until the next season.

, There are plentiful instructions online for each plant type and how to propagate it from stems, pieces, etc. In some cases, it might be worth investing in rooting hormone, but read up on the plant's preferences first. Growing more plants through cuttings and division can save a lot of money and can also be a source of meeting the people who are growing the plant you'd like a piece of!

, Doing this saves you a lot of money and it's not hard to do. See making compost for instructions and check out How to fertilize a garden cheaply for a few ideas.

, Use unusual containers for growing plants in instead of expensive containers. For example, an old gumboot, a spent kettle or a washing machine drum. Make use of palettes for raised garden beds, hanging boxes and vertical gardens.


Visit thrift and charity stores for items that are no longer wanted but can be put to good use in the garden.
Look online for inspiration in reusing materials to help build and tend to your garden. Image sites are excellent for assessing the opportunities at a glance.

, This can help ensure the best health and vigorous growth of the plants you've purchased, ensuring that they survive and you don't waste your money.

Low-nutrient soil causes these plants to produce better flavor. They don’t require much water and can be grown in barren areas.Supplement their growing area with gravel. Stones absorb heat, helping the plants grow.;
, Look around your area for inspiration when selecting plants. The shrubs and succulents that grow naturally here are evergreens. Many of them have deep roots and features that limit water loss. Substitute taller, greener plants for thinner, smaller, and grey-green shrubbery and succulents such as aloe and agave.The off-green color of these plants helps them reflect sunlight.
Some plants that grow in this climate can also shed their leaves during dry periods or reorient their leaves to avoid direct sunlight.

, Many important fruit crops come from Mediterranean climates. Olive, pomegranate, and fig trees naturally occur there, as well as pistachios. However, other trees, such as citrus and nut trees, thrive during the winter. Give them adequate amounts of sunlight and water and they’ll grow well.Many trees in Mediterranean climates are small and thin in order to survive with minimal water.
Some larger trees including oaks and pines are common in Mediterranean greenlands, so you can grow them along with fruit trees in your environment.

, Many flowers well-known in gardening from northern parts of the world, such as rhododendrons and azaleas, struggle in a Mediterranean climate. These flowers grow slowly and require lots of shade and water. Instead, choose plants such as rockrose, jasmine, wisteria, and climbing vines.Drought-resistant roses such as teas also do well here., Mediterranean climates have gardening weather year round. Winter is a great growing time for many plants because of the cooler temperatures and rainy season. Leafy vegetables such as kale and root vegetables such as carrots are some of many plants that do well in winter. Begin planting in September and plan on harvesting by spring.Fruit and nut plants such as persimmons, citruses, and chestnuts will also produce in the winter.
Grow sprouts inside during this period along with herbs moved inside or kept near a window year-round.

, Warm-season crops cannot survive the winter frost and need sunlight to grow. These plants include tomatoes, watermelon, corn, and squash. Most other plants should be allowed to take advantage of the rainy winter season.Flowers with no frost resistance, also need to be attempted in summer or avoided.
Herbs favor the sunlight and go dormant during the winter.

, It may help you to separate your gardening area based on exposure to sunlight. Before you plant, try to plan out where you’ll place your plants. Herbs such as sage and rosemary, for example, live in the open while other plants wilt from too much sun.


Put space between your plants so that they don’t shade each other and their roots don’t compete for water.
Vine plants such as tomatoes climb on vertical growing platforms to get sunlight. These platforms can be used as shade for other plants.
Some plants, including leafy vegetables such as lettuce, benefit from some shade, while others, such as spinach require more shade and should be grown in smaller amounts.Don’t be afraid to move plants during the evening or hang sheets over vulnerable plants during the afternoon.

, This practice is called hydrozoning and, if you’re growing a variety of plants, can help you manage a limited water supply. Separate your plants according to low need, medium need, and high need. Allot your water as needed and consider replacing your area of high-need plants with native varieties in case of drought.Plants of low and moderate water need can be supplemented with mulch and compost to retain water.
Account for your lawn if you have one. Lawns consume a lot of water and limit what you can afford for thirsty plants such as begonias and hydrangeas.

, Compost is organic material such as kitchen scraps and bark that provides nutrients to plants. It can be bought in lawn and garden stores or made at home. Place a couple of inches of dark, moist compost around your vegetables and flowers to help them grow.Compost provides nitrogen lacking in Mediterranean-climate soil and also helps hold in moisture.
Remember to aerate the compost and water it throughout the season. When it begins to solidify and become less crumbly, moisten it again.

, Adding a layer of mulch, such as gravel or wood chips, can help most of your garden. Mulch prevents the soil from losing more water to the heat. Gravel also helps hold in heat for drought-resistant plants.Plants that prefer poor soil, such as herbs, benefit more from gravel than organic mulch.
Mulch also limits the amount of weeding and pruning work you need to do.

, Watering by hand is simple if you have a small amount of plants. Water them in accordance with their needs. Use a bucket or spray bottle to limit the amount of water you use. Not only do some plants suffer in wet soil, water is a commodity during drought months. Add enough water to moisten the soil of most plants every week. Deeply soak plants with a high water need.


Drought-resistant plants actually do worse when given lots of water. Remember that they evolved to survive in this environment.

, Drip irrigation is a slow method of delivering water to plants. This is good for drought-resistant and mulched plants. Connect your garden hose to your faucet then connect smaller hoses to the other end of the hose. Poke holes in the smaller hoses, then turn on the water. Instead of the spray from the big hose, water will dribble out of the holes.Another way to do this is to poke a hole in a bucket and set it on the mulch before filling it.
Many companies sell drip irrigation systems and kits. You can add timers, pressure systems, and sprayers to control your water use and reach thicker plants., Water conservation is important in Mediterranean areas. During the fall and winter, collect rainwater and save it for the summer. Gather condensation from your air conditioner. Try to collect any rain that falls on an impermeable surface such as brick or concrete before it runs off. Redirect this water towards your plants.

, Marginal water is the water you wouldn’t drink. This includes run-off from your sinks, showers, and machines as well as cleaned sewage water and standing water. Some of this water will help you irrigate your plants without having to sacrifice your water budget.Test this water ahead of time to find out if it is safe for plants and soil.

Decide what you want to grow or do with your garden.,
Consider how much space you have available.,
Determine how much sun your plants will get.",How to Garden1," There are many different types of gardens and uses for a garden, so think about what your ideal type of garden would provide. Some of the different types of gardens include:Vegetable garden. This may be the most popular and practical type of garden. By growing your own vegetables, you can save money and increase the amount of fresh vegetables you eat.

Flower garden. A flower garden adds beauty to your yard and it can be a relaxing escape for you. If you are mainly interested in beautifying your property, then a flower garden may be the best choice.

Butterfly garden. You cannot grow butterflies, but you can plant flowers that will attract them to your yard. This can be a great type of garden to plan with kids.

Wildlife garden. A wildlife garden is one that helps to support the animals in your area by providing them with sources of food and shelter.;
, If you have lots of space, then you can plant a garden in the ground. If you have limited space or simply do not want to plant in the ground, then you can also plant a garden in containers. You can grow a variety of different plants in pots and keep them on a patio or in a sunny spot of your yard. Some plants even thrive in containers indoors, so using containers may also be ideal if you live in an apartment.If you live in an area with good soil that is not too rocky or sandy, then growing your garden in-ground is a good option.
If growing your garden in-ground is not a viable choice, then consider buying containers to grow your plants in or building above-ground beds. Above ground beds are great because they are easier on your back and can be moved around your yard if desired.
If you are limited on space, but still want to have your garden outside, then you can grow a vertical garden. These types of gardens use small planters or stacked crates and upright-growing plants.

, Most plants require around 6 to 8 hours of full sun to thrive. If you do not have an area that will provide this much sun, then you can still plant a garden. You will just have to choose plants that thrive in the shade or with less sun.Try checking the area where you plan to grow your garden a few times per day on a sunny day to see how long the sun is shining in that area. For example, you could check at 7am, 11am, 2pm, and 5pm, and make a note if the sun is shining on that area around that time. If the sun is shining on an area during two or three of your checks, then sun-loving plants will probably thrive there.

Choose a plot.,
Test the soil.,
Research your area.,
Gather your tools.,
Prepare your soil.",How to Garden2," Location is important when you are planning your garden. Most importantly, determine if the area you want to use gets enough sun. Then, consider if the size is appropriate for what you want to do with it and also consider how you will water this garden. You should either be able to pull a hose over to it if it is a large garden, or be able to carry a full watering can to it if it is smaller.


If you are going to be growing a container garden, it is still important to identify a suitable area to place the containers. The area should have good sunlight, enough room for the plants to grow upwards, and they should be easy to transport to a source of water or located somewhere that is convenient to bring water to them.

, Good soil will have an adequate amount of lime, phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium. Find out how much of each you have in your soil, and what you need to add more of to get the best growing plants. If you are planting a container garden, then you don’t need to worry about this. You can just use potting soil that is appropriate for the type of plants you will be growing.


You can purchase an at-home soil testing kit from many hardware and garden stores. Follow the directions to find out the properties of your garden soil.
You can take soil samples from around your garden and have them sent to your local state-certified soil testing lab or university extension service, and for a small fee they will lab-test your soil and send you the results within a week. This is much easier than testing the soil yourself, but it does cost more.
Take multiple soil samples from around your garden to make sure that you are getting accurate test results.

Test your soil’s pH to see if you need to make changes to balance it. To do this, use a pH testing kit or make your own test at home and check the soil from your garden. Certain plants prefer different pH levels, but it is best to have soil that is as close to neutral - a pH of 7 -as possible., It is important to find out information about growing conditions in your area. Look online, speak to a local garden consultant, or call your cooperative extension service.


Find out when frosts start and end on average, so you know the right time to plant. Planting too early or too late can kill your seeds or plants, so it is vital to know when the best time to start is.
Learn about local weather patterns that might impact your garden.
Look-up the best time to harvest your fruits, berries, and vegetables in your area. Some of these may be straightforward, but some plants require a little more know-how about when the best time to harvest them is.
Make a schedule of when each of your specific plants needs to be planted based on their habitat requirement and growing needs. Some plants may need to be started very early in the season, while others may not need planting until the summer., To make gardening as easy and relaxing as possible, it is important that you have all the right tools. Use a shovel, gardening trowel, a garden fork, baskets or buckets to hold weeds, and a watering can at least. You can purchase other tools, but it is not necessary for a small to medium sized garden.


For a large garden you may also need to purchase a wheelbarrow, rakes and hoes, loppers, and a post-hole digger.
Look into installing an automatic sprinkler system if you don’t have time or the ability to hand-water your garden., Once you have your soil and pH tests completed, ready your soil by adding the necessary nutrients to help your plants grow.


Add organic matter to help enrich your soil with nutrients. You can use compost (from your own compost pile, if you have one), decomposing leaves, peat moss, or decomposed animal manure. All of these are available for purchase at local gardening centers if you don’t have easy access to them.
Add fertilizer to your soil to help substitute in nitrogen, phosphorous, or potassium that you may be lacking. The label on the fertilizer bag will tell you exactly how much of each of these nutrients is present. 5-10-5, for example, tells you that the fertilizer contains 5% nitrogen, 10% phosphorous, and 5% potassium.
Following the results of your pH test, if your soil is alkaline (above 7), try adding lime or wood ash to neutralize it. If your soil is acidic (below 7), add peat moss or decomposing leaves."

Determine if you want to start your garden from seeds.,
Consider transplanting mature plants.,
Check out flower bulbs.",How to Garden3," Many plants do well when you start them from seeds. Check your local garden center for seed packets and look at the label to see how long they take to grow, when is the best time to plant them, and how much water they need.


Growing from seed can take anywhere from one to four months depending on what you are growing, so it is important to plan ahead.
Growing from seeds is the cheapest option, as a pack of seeds costs only a few dollars or cents. Full grown plants purchased from a gardening store can cost anywhere from $1-$50 each.
Keep in mind that when you plant from a seed, you can start the seed in a container and keep it indoors or put it right into the ground. However, planting a seed in a container and starting it indoors may result in a healthier plant than starting outdoors in the ground., The benefit of transplanting a mature plant into your soil or container is that it is already partially grown and will bear fruit sooner. The plant will also be more likely to survive and thrive. Transplanting mature plants takes only a few minutes of work once the rest of your garden has been prepped.

Check your local garden store for mature plants and make sure to check the tags on the plants to determine if they will work for the type of garden you are planning.

, If you choose to grow flowers, you also have the option of planting bulbs. Bulbs are easy to plant, and they come back every year. However, bulbs only bloom for a few weeks at a time.


Check your local garden store for bulbs that you can plant in your garden and enjoy year after year.

Arrange your plants.,
Plant your seeds or plants.,
Add mulch.,
Water your plants.,
Keep an eye on your garden and weed it regularly.,
Consider putting up a fence.,
Harvest your garden.",How to Garden4," Choose where you want each plant to go in your garden. Keep in mind the amount of sunlight they need and the overall size they will grow. Starting with small plants can be misleading, as some may get very large and eventually need bigger plots or containers.


Typically it is safe to give about 10 inches (25.4 cm) of spacing between each plant, but make sure to read the seed package or tag on the plants to see how much room they will need.
You will also want to leave enough space between rows so that you will be able to walk between them. Plan to leave about 18 inches (45.7 cm) between rows.Try to keep your plants in groups by variety. For example, you can plant all of your vegetables in the same section of your garden, and keep your flowers or berries in another section.
Find out which plants will grow the tallest, as they will create shade over time and should only be planted near other plants that will also grow tall, or near plants that require less sunlight and more shade.

, Using the arrangement you have devised, place each plant in the garden. Dig a hole roughly the same size as the root ball.


Don’t dig a hole that is too deep. Only dig far enough to allow room for all of the roots without covering up the stem or leaves.
Gently set each plant into its hole, so as to not damage any part of it. Use your fingers or a trowel to slowly scoop dirt back into the hole over the roots.

, Getting as many nutrients into the soil as you are able will help your plants to grow full and healthy. Mulch will help with this and it will also help to prevent weeds from growing.Spread mulch between each of the plants in a layer about one inch thick.


For vegetables, add straw or decomposed leaves as mulch around your plants for the best results.
Flowers and perennials do well with wood chips or bark as mulch., The first few days after planting should have a bit more water to help the roots to get settled. Avoid over watering though, by flooding the top layer of your garden. You only need to provide about one inch of water per week, so you may not need to water your garden at all if it rains.Use a watering can or a spray attachment to your hose to water the plants. Water them from high up, so that you don’t damage any of their leaves or stalks.
After a few days of watering 1-2 times daily, you can water less often. Move to watering once every two days or so., Once your garden is settled, give it time to grow. A healthy garden will last several seasons if it is properly taken care of. Make sure to check your garden for weeds on a regular basis and pull out any weeds you spot.

, If you are growing a vegetable garden, then you may want to put up a fence around it to protect it from wildlife. This is not absolutely necessary, but it can help if you find that you have frequent invaders.

Keep in mind that deer can jump very high. Your fence will need to be at least 8 feet high to prevent them from jumping into your garden., When your garden has grown to maturity, harvest the fruits of your labor. Carefully pick or cut vegetables, berries, herbs, and flowers for use in your own home. Or, simply enjoy walking and relaxing in your garden if you have created it to beautify your property.

Make sure your plants get enough light.,
Keep the environment adequately humid.,
Do not place your plants by radiators, stoves, and air vents.,
See if you have room on your balcony.",How to Fix Common Indoor Herb Garden Problems1," One major problem with household herbs is a lack of light. If your herbs seem to be wilting, make sure they have enough access to quality natural or artificial light. This may correct the problem and lead to your herbs growing strong.Herbs require natural light to thrive and cannot grow adequately with regular household lights. For the best results, place your herbs near a window or allow them exposure to a natural light source.
If this is not an option, stop by a local greenhouse. You can pick up some LED grow lights that will allow your herbs to thrive. Regular lightbulbs will not help your herbs grow.;
, A common problem with indoor herb gardens is a lack of humidity. In general, the insides of homes and apartments are less humid than the outdoors. Heaters, air conditioners, and other appliances can dry out air, causing herbs to wilt.Mist your plants once a day with a spray bottle.
If the air in your home is very dry, invest in a humidifier. Keep that running in the room where you're growing your herbs.

, These places tend to be very dry. They can also cause sudden fluctuations in temperature, which is bad for herb plants. If your herbs are by a radiator, stove, or an air vent, move them elsewhere right away to prevent problems from occurring.Some herbs require specific temperatures during the germination period. Sage seeds, for example, will not grow if the temperature is not between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When planting herbs, be particularly careful about avoiding temperature hazards., Natural light is always best for herbs. If you have access to a balcony, and the weather does not get too cold in your area, this is the best place to place your herbs.This works best if you have a balcony facing east or west.
Make sure your balcony is big enough to accommodate all your herbs. Overcrowding can slow the growth of your plants.
You can also look into planting in an exterior window box, if you have one.

Watch for symptoms of overwatering.,
Make sure you're using the right soil.,
Switch the type of plant you're using.,
Address chlorosis quickly.,
Lower your use of fertilizer if you notice your leaves' tips burning.",How to Fix Common Indoor Herb Garden Problems2," Overwatering is a very common mistake people make with indoor plants. Make sure to read an almanac or ask someone at a local greenhouse about the precise amount of water you plants need. If you notice your soil appears water logged, you are overwatering and should reduce the amount of water your plant is receiving.Overwatering can be confusing, as the symptoms can mimic those of under watering. The plant may look wilted and yellow. In extreme cases, the plant may collapse.
If you've been watering your plant daily, and the soil is noticeably moist, the issue is probably over watering and not under watering.
How often a plant needs to be watered depends on the humidity of your home and how much sun it's getting. Only water herbs when the soil surrounding them is dry to the touch., You should not select just any soil for an herb garden, and it's not always best to take soil from outdoors. Instead, purchase a high quality potting mix from a local greenhouse.Make sure to select a mix that is specifically used for potted plants. Mixes designed for outdoor plants will be too heavy and will dry out too easily.
With the right soil, monitoring things like pH levels is unnecessary. A quality potting soil should already have the right nutrients and the label should provide suggestions for things like fertilizers.
With parsley, be careful of getting soil on your leaves themselves. Outdoors, parsley frequently gets muddied with soil during heavy rainfall. When planting parsley in new soil, be careful not to get soil on the leaves. Gently wipe off any soil that gets on your parsley., Not all herbs will work in certain situations. Some herbs may not thrive indoors as well as others. Review the herbs you're using and be honest with yourself about whether they work for your specific situation.If you can't provide more than 2 to 4 hours a day of natural sunlight, this limits the types of plants you can grow. Luckily, mint, cilantro, parsley, wasabi, and wild garlic can thrive in the shade.If you have access to a lot of natural light year round, you should be able to grow most herbs indoors without a problem.

, Chlorosis is a common problem people encounter when growing herbs indoors. It can be spotted if the leaves turn yellow while the veins of the plant remain green. Usually, this is due to poor drainage. You can spot poor drainage if your soil looks like sludge.Install another drainage hole in your pot if you notice poor drainage. You also may need to water less if your plant is displaying signs of being overwatered.
If you've ruled out poor drainage, your soil may have an iron deficiency. This can be solved by purchasing chelated iron at a local greenhouse. Follow the instructions on the package for use.

, Burnt tips are when the tips of your plant look brown or black. This is usually an indication you're over-fertilizing. If you notice burnt tips, cut back on your fertilizer.Usually, the salt in fertilizer is the culprit with burnt tips. To return the soil to a better state, water the pot until water begins flowing quickly from drainage holes.

"
"
Prune your plants regularly.,
Eliminate flowers right away.,
Control exposure to bugs.",How to Fix Common Indoor Herb Garden Problems3," Many problems with indoor herbs stem from a lack of pruning. You need to be vigilant about pruning your plants to prevent problems from developing.Once herbs are 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) above the ground and have three grown sets of leaves, you can safely prune them for the first time.
Make sure to only trim above a growing set of leaves.

, Herbs should never flower. Once flowering occurs, this signals to the plant that the growing stage has ended. Herbs will die shortly after flowering. Trim any flowers from the plant as soon as you see them developing. This will encourage your herbs to grow into edible plants rather than flowers., Many people neglect to realize that bugs are a hazard indoors as well as outdoors. You can use a commercial bug spray or pesticide if it's safe to use in your home. You can also try more natural methods.For natural solutions, you can wipe off pests as you see them. You can also use the natural pesticide neem oil to keep bugs away.Spider mites are a particular problem with rosemary, so be on the lookout for small spiders around the size of a grain of pepper. They can be red, white, brown, or black and should be removed from the plant right away."

Make sure you have all the tools you need listed in the Things You'll Need below.,
Use adequate protection.",How to Fell a Tree1,"






;
, Felling a tree is a very dangerous activity. Dress in protective attire before starting the process.








"
"
Assess the general condition of the tree.,
Walk around the tree and note the following:









The direction it leans.,
Examine the base of the tree.,
Other considerations:









Wind direction
Whether or not the drop zone is level.

,
Make an escape route.",How to Fell a Tree2," Look for dead branches, loose bark, cracks, or debris.








, Try hugging the tree and looking up to further assess.
Branch distribution
The height of the tree
Broken limbs in the canopy that can fall
The best place for a drop zone (should be free of people or anything that can be damaged)
Large branches from other trees touching or entangled with the tree you want to chop down. These will need to be removed from the adjacent tree.

,









Look for signs of root instability including: cow pie fungus, other uprooted trees, roots near a river or lake.

,,









Clear a path at least 30 feet (9.1 m) from the stump. Your exit should be at a 45 degree angle from the sides and back of the tree. Go behind another tree for protection, if possible.

"
"
Clear out a workspace.








,
Sound the tree.,
Determine the lay.,
Make the first cut, the horizontal cut.,
Make the wedge cut.,
Make the back cut.,
Use your escape route to escape the falling tree.",How to Fell a Tree3,",









Hit the tree with your falling axe to determine the soundness of the wood. Sharp 'thonks' or cracks indicate live wood, while dead wood sounds hollow or muted. Sound at several spots all around the tree and at different heights.

,









The lay is where the tree is going to drop or fall.
Select a direction that is as close to the tree's natural lean as possible, while avoiding getting the tree stuck in the branches of another tree.
Pick your lay, or drop zone, being thoughtful of what the tree will do when it lands. Uneven ground can cause a tree to roll, break, bounce, kick back at you, or explode.

,









The first cut is horizontal and determines the depth of the Face Cut, along with the direction of the fall. Make it no higher than hip height.
The horizontal cut should be no deeper than 1/3rd the width of the tree. The straight line of wood inside the cut is the front of the holding wood. The tree will fall perpendicular to this line.
Most professional saws have ""gunner sights"", a line that points perpendicular to the edge of the saw. When the gunner sights are pointing in the direction of fall, pick a point as reference for later.

,









The wedge cut finishes the face cut by cutting a wedge out of the tree.
The horizontal cut should be 3"" above the acute angle created by the first cut. This will prevent or reduce the chance of kick back.
The piece of wood that comes out of the tree should look like an orange slice.
The face cut can be made from the bottom or the top of the first cut. Face cuts that open down are known as a Humboldt cut, used to get the most wood out of a tree.

An easy way to make your cuts match up is to place a stick in the off-side of your horizontal cut, causing it to stick out a little.
Start a cut on your side of the tree, lining up the bottom of your cut with that side of the horizontal cut. You can project your cuts path by looking down the bar.
Stop cutting and peek down your bar to see if you are lined up with the stick on the other side. Adjust as needed.



,









Determine how thick you want your holding wood (the ""hinge"" with which the tree will fall) to be based on the lean, depth of face cut, and the size of tree. The safest way is to maintain the maximum thickness of wood and still have the tree fall.
Holding wood should have an even width in most cases. Differences in thickness on each side can be used to twist a tree into ""directional falling"" which is a technique beyond the scope of this article.
Make a mark on your side of the tree where you want your Back Cut to stop, determining the width of the Holding Wood. The Back Cut should be a horizontal cut least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) above your Horizontal Cut.
Start the cut on the back of the tree and bring the saw around toward the holding wood.
Bring the edge of the cut on your side to your mark and pivot on this point, cutting. As soon as you have space, place a wedge cut to discourage the tree from sitting back on your saw.
Continue cutting until your gunner sights are even with the spot you picked on the Horizontal Cut — indicating the holding wood is even on both sides — or the tree starts to move! As you do the Back Cut, keep looking up at top of tree and at the kerf of your back cut.
Tap in wedges or add additional wedges as the Back Cut progresses. Constantly look for signs the tree is moving in any direction and be ready to act based on where the tree may be going.

,









As soon as the tree shows signs it is going over, use your escape route. Never turn your back on the tree. Look out for broken branches in surrounding trees.

Keep records.,
Stagger your plantings.,
Choose crops that match your climate.,
Plant in raised beds.,
Mulch heavily.,
Water less often, but water deeply.,
Prepare for frost.,
Use a greenhouse.,
Start seeds inside.",How to Extend Your Gardening Season," Taking detailed notes on the weather in your area and about which plants do well in your own garden will give you valuable data to analyze over time. There are likely elements unique to your own yard or garden area that will affect when and what you can plant. A shade tree, for example, may allow you to plant tomatoes during the hot summer months when others' tomato plants are wilting.;
, Instead of starting your seeds all at once, consider starting them in waves 1 week apart. This allows you to consistently have plants at different stages of growth. This method is particularly effective for plants and herbs that have a fast growth/harvest cycle, such as lettuce or dill.


You can also try planting shorter cool-weather crops, such as lettuce, next to taller hot-weather crops, such as corn. The taller crops will provide shade for the lower ones, which will lower the temperature around them and lengthen the growing season.

, Research the ideal growing conditions for the plants you want to raise, and plan accordingly. Many gardeners plant cool-weather crops such as spinach in the spring, hot-weather crops such as tomatoes in the summer, and more cool-weather crops in the fall. Some plants are more frost-resistant than others and can be raised in areas where frost comes early.

, Planting in soil above the ground helps control weeds and provides better drainage. It also allows the soil to warm up and remain warm in the spring and fall. Raised beds can also be covered during heavy rains to prevent over-saturation, which can weaken or kill plants., This will help soil stay warm during cooler temperatures. Mulching also helps prevent moisture from evaporating during hot or dry spells.

, Plants that are watered a little bit each day will grow shallow roots, because they'll need them to reach the moisture. Watering less often but for a longer period of time encourages deeper root growth. Plants with deeper roots will last longer and be better equipped to handle seasonal changes.

, Planting early in the season or keeping plants inside later can expose your plants to frost. Watch the weather forecast, and make sure you have a plan for when frost is predicted.


Gather sheets or other large, light strips of fabric, and have them ready to cover plants overnight if necessary. Plastic sheeting can also be used, but take care to remove it immediately when temperatures warm up so the plants don't overheat.
Build or buy a cold frame (a box with a glass or clear plastic cover), and use it to cover your plants during cold snaps. Cold frames can be reused for years and can be propped open to allow for ventilation on warmer days. Some commercial garden supply companies sell cold frames that fit perfectly over raised garden beds.

, Although they require a significant investment, greenhouses can provide a climate-controlled environment that allows you to grow plants year-round.

, You can get a head start on your gardening by planting seeds inside, so that they're ready to plant when your soil warms up. Most seeds should be started 6 to 8 weeks before your last expected frost date; check the seed package for the appropriate lead time for your specific seed type.

Return everything to the pond.",How to Clean a Pond," String algae, which looks like strands of hair floating on the water or clinging to the walls, harms the pond’s ecosystem. A scrub brush such as a toilet brush can be used to lift up and remove the algae. Skimming nets from a home improvement store also help reach the algae, but you can also yank out the algae by hand.Some string algae is beneficial to the pond’s health. The algae that sticks on the pool liner, as long as its growth is under control, protects fish and combats green water caused by other algae. Try to control the algae using natural maintenance methods such as by adding plants, aerating the water, and removing waste yearly.;
, When your pond is very green, hydrogen peroxide may clear up the algae faster. Add about one pint (.48 L) of store-bought hydrogen peroxide for every 1,000 gallons (3785.4 L) of pond water. Dilute it if possible by letting it run with a fountain, waterfall, or other moving water.Results will vary between ponds, but you can increase the amount of hydrogen peroxide as needed. Be careful though, because it can harm fish and plants.
Chemicals such as String Algae Control are less harmful but more expensive options for existing algae problems.

, Purchase barley straw online or at a garden center. Stuff the straw into a mesh bag, hay net, or fishnet tights. Allow the bag to sit in the pond for several weeks, preferably where the water spreads, such as a fountain or waterfall, if possible. After a few weeks, the barley will start to degrade. Remove any rotting pieces to avoid adding more nutrients for the algae., UV lights treat the single-celled algae that causes green water. The UV light is installed in the water. Water passes through the light and the algae gets destroyed. The light needs to be replaced yearly and brought in during winter months., Your pond may have a filter, which is useful for growing bacteria that breaks down waste and food when you have lots of fish. If it is difficult for water to flow through the filter, follow the owner’s manual to clean the filter. Only use pond water so that you preserve the helpful bacteria in the filter., Plants are a way to naturally keep the pond clean and clear of algae. Plants such as anacharis, hornwort, and parrot’s feather live under the water and keep the water full of oxygen, which limits algae growth. Lilies and lotus plants also cover the surface of the water, blocking sunlight that aids excessive algae growth.You introduce plants by planting them at appropriate layers. For example, submerged plants such as anarachis rests fully below the surface with its roots in a basket. Marginal plants, including cattails, and lilies are rooted in water with aquatic potting soil. Floating plants such as water hyacinths rest on the water’s surface.

, Aeration adds oxygen to the water by churning it. Plants, waterfalls, and fountains all help, but you can also add an aeration pump to keep the water mixed, preventing algae and odors.Install small pumps by attaching the water recirculating hose and placing the pump in the water away from dirt, such as on a block or rocks. Hide the open end of the hose away from the pump near some rocks. Plug the pump’s power cord into an outlet, making sure it is away from water. You may wish to bury the cord underground in PVC pipe., Uneaten fish food leaves nutrients that cause algae buildup. Either use higher-quality food or rely on natural food such as the algae growing on the pond liner. Don’t offer extra food when it isn’t needed. Monitor the water for leftover food and offer less as needed.Feed fish high-protein fish food, such as Pond Care Summer Staple, two to four times a day when the water is warm. Feed them once every day or two days with a low protein food when the water goes below 60 degrees F (15.5 degrees C).

, In winter, the air filter keeps bacteria alive that would otherwise die in the cold. In the summer, algae prevention can be bolstered by adding a product such as Microbe Lift. Follow the directions on the label for the correct dosage.Beneficial bacteria breaks down chemicals harmful to fish, such as ammonia, and food and waste nutritious to algae.

, Pond vacuums may be found online or at home improvement stores. They have long handles and reach the bottom of the pond to remove decaying plant matter without removing water. If your pond is small or doesn’t have much debris, all you will need to do is vacuum.Routine pond cleaning to remove plant matter should be done once a year in spring or fall.

, If you need to drain the water to reach sediment collecting on the bottom, you’ll have to remove the fish and plants to avoid harming them. Set up enough glass tanks to hold all of them. Keep the tanks in a shady location. Fill them with pond water or, if the pond water is cloudy, tap water.Marginal plants, which live near the water’s edge, can survive out of water but must be kept shaded, as with a tarp, and damp, as with a spray bottle or hose.

, Utility pumps can be found at home improvement stores. Follow the owner’s manual to install them near the water. Connect them by hose to a large container that will hold the pond water, such as a tub or tank. Make the tank as large as possible to hold fish and plants too, if you plan on using this as a holding tank., As water is removed from the pond, plants will be exposed. Save your plants by moving them to the holding tanks. Place aside decaying plant matter. Small pond creatures may leave the plant matter and return to the pond.This is a good opportunity to repot plants and divide others that have begun to take up too much space in the pond.

, Fish will also appear as you pump. Use a net to catch the ones you can reach and drop them into holding tanks. Once the water reaches a low level, the fish will have nowhere to go and can easily be scooped up in a net.Placing them in a shaded holding tank containing pond water prevents stress that harms the fish.
Place leaf netting over the holding tanks to contain jumping fish such as koi.

, For ponds that can be managed by hand, the sludge at the bottom of the pond can be removed by sweeping with a broom and dust pan or shovel. Dispose of the waste in the trash.Larger ponds with dropping water levels due to sediment buildup may benefit from excavation and bulldozing by a professional.Dredging is an option for removing sediment without draining the water, but this requires heavy machinery and the sediment can break apart when moved.

, Use a scrub brush dipped in water to loosen any leftover sludge for removal. You may see carpet-like string algae covering the liner. This algae, as long as it is on the liner, protects against discolored water. The only time you should consider removing the algae on the liner is if you don’t like the way it makes your pond look. Otherwise, remove strands on the walls or water’s surface. Don’t use chemicals to attack algae, since this harms fish. Blast algae off rocks using a hose and pick up the string variety by hand or with a pole.

, Gradually pump water back into pond, placing plants as you go. When you are finished, let the fish back into the water. For cloudy pond water you wish to replace, use rainwater if possible or tap water.Rainwater can be collected by placing barrels under roof downspouts and wherever else you can find runoff.Tap water used in the pond will be too cold for the fish, so before you release the fish, remove some water from the holding tank and replace it with some of the new water. Do this several times."

Choose wood and stone materials that look as natural as possible.,
Be aware that stone can be expensive and difficult to install.,
Choose wooden materials that have been treated and preserved.,
Choose low-growing, compact plants as edging materials.",How to Create Natural Edging for a Garden1," It’s possible to get quite creative when using natural materials for creating lawn edging. Stone or wood make good choices. For the most natural effect you don’t want these to be too uniform, so choose rough-looking wood such as reclaimed railway sleepers or uneven shapes of natural stone.;
, Stone tends to be an expensive choice of edging material and it is laborious to put in place.


It’s also harder to avoid damaging the lawnmower or knocking the stones out of place when mowing. This usually means you’ll get a less neat finish after mowing.






A trimmer may help, or consider hand-trimming the edges to tidy them up.







, If you are using wood to edge your garden, make sure it’s been pressure treated or that a preservative has been applied to it. This will ensure a longer life.


If you are using reclaimed wood such as railway sleepers, check they are plant safe. Some wood can be contaminated with chemicals that will negatively affect plants.






If you plan to use the sleepers for sitting on or for eating off, make sure they aren’t sticky with creosote. Creosote will ruin your clothes and emit unpleasant smells.







, Plants can also be used to create a natural visual edge to define your borders. You’ll need to select something low-growing and fairly compact. Dwarf Perennial Lavender makes a good choice, as does Thyme, Speedwell or Geranium.


It will be necessary to keep these plants well-trimmed or you may not get a uniform look. You will also have the issue of how to mow the lawn right to the edges without damaging the edging plants.
You might like to use plant edging in combination with another type of edging such as trench edging. Plant the edging plants so they conceal whatever edging material you are using.

Their leaves are a bright green color, sometimes with hints of red or purple around the stems. They can either be broad or narrow, but almost always taper in a spade-like shape and feature multiple parallel veins lined up across the leaf.Mature plantains produce small flowers that grow on thin, fuzzy stalks.
There are over 200 species of plantains in existence, but they all share the same key physical characteristics.;
, The herb can usually be found in places with thick grass and underbrush. Chances are, you have a few plantains growing in your own backyard. You may also have some luck turning up plantains in wet, humid areas like river banks and marshes. They tend to pop up in greater numbers following a heavy downpour.Plantains flourish in the early spring months when temperatures begin to rise.Some variety of the plant or another can be found in almost every country on the planet.
The herb is often mistaken for a harmful weed, which causes it to go unnoticed.

, To make sure you’re not putting your health at risk, only gather plantains that you find on uncultivated land. Stay away from herbs growing in spots where you’ve sprayed pesticides or spread fertilizer. These may retain traces elements of the chemicals, which can be harmful if ingested or applied to a wound.It’s advisable to pass up plantains that you find near the edges of private and commercial properties, as these have likely been treated with poisonous chemicals.Don’t pick leaves that appear slimy, shriveled or discolored. The plant may be suffering from a blight or disease.

, Simply reach down and pull the leaves by the stalks to detach them from the base of the plant. It’s that easy! The tender leaves should come away with little resistance. Pick as many as you want, then move on to the next patch.Plantains grow quickly and abundantly like weeds, so you won’t have to worry about killing the plant by picking too many at a time.Make sure you bring along a basket, bucket or plastic bag to carry the leaves you’ve collected.

, For young and hearty plants, a separate utensil may come in handy for cutting through the tough stalks. Snip the leaves at the narrowest part of the stalk, leaving the root section behind. In no time at all the leaves will grow back, replenishing your supply.To harvest a whole patch, gather the leaves from the bottom, lift them up and cut across all the stalks at once.
Using scissors requires less ripping and tugging, which makes you less likely to damage the leaves.

, You can find the seeds in the small pods growing at the tips of the slender flower stalks. Make sure you peel the fibrous chaff back from the seeds themselves before processing or cooking with them. Like the leaves of the plant, plantain seeds can be ground and used in a host of holistic therapies.Pick the seeds once they’ve turned brown or black—green seeds will be too tough and fibrous to be of any use.Plantain seeds have a nutty, slightly spicy flavor. They go well in flours and homemade tea mixes, or simply roasted and eaten as a snack.

, Place the plantains in a colander and run them under the faucet, tossing occasionally to loosen dirt and debris. For especially dirty leaves, you can fill the sink or a shallow bowl and swirl them until the dirt has leached into the water.If you’re uncertain about whether the herbs have been properly sanitized, try soaking them in a mixture of three parts water and one part apple cider vinegar.
After rinsing the leaves, press them between layers of paper towels to absorb the excess water., Preserve your freshly-picked plantain leaves by wrapping them loosely in a layer of damp paper towels and stashing them in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. You can also slip them into a plastic bag—just make sure you squeeze all of the air out of the bag before you seal it.When stored correctly, you can expect the leaves to keep for 3-5 days.Like more other greens, plantain leaves will be best when eaten right away. After couple of days, they'll gradually begin to turn limp and soggy.

, Once you get the plantain leaves home, press them between two broad, heavy surfaces to flatten them out. Afterwards, set the leaves out in direct sunlight for a few hours, or arrange them on a baking pan and put them in the oven on a low heat (around 150 degrees or below) until they’re brittle to the touch.Store dried plantain leaves in a lidded jar or airtight plastic bag. Be sure to label the bags individually so you’ll know what’s in them.Dehydrated leaves will last much longer than fresh ones (sometimes as long as 1-3 years). Just grind them up when you’re ready to use them., Plantain leaves are just as useful for making simple medicines as they are for making dinner. Blend fresh leaves with a small amount of water and apply the resulting paste topically as a poultice. The compounds that the herb contains are astringent, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory, meaning they’re capable of killing bacteria and reducing swelling.Spread plantain balm on cuts, scrapes, bee stings and minor skin infections to clear them up.You can also grind dried leaves and steep them for a few minutes in hot water to make a soothing bath for sunburns and dry, itchy skin., Another way to enjoy the many benefits of plantains is to eat them. Once you’ve washed the leaves, tear or chop them the way you would similar greens like lettuce or spinach. The herb will be right at home when served raw in a salad, sautéd with fresh seasonal veggie or blended into a rich pesto or green smoothie.Plantains have a mild earthy flavor not unlike mushrooms or kale. This makes them a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into many different dishes."

Look at the plant of the potato.,
Keep note that the potatoes can be kept in the ground.,
Don't wait until it rains to harvest.",How to Harvest New Potatoes1," Generally this will tell you when it's time to harvest the potatoes by looking at the plant on top. When it is time to harvest, the plant withers and dies off - this is an obvious sign.;
, After the plant has died off the potatoes can continue to grow in the ground for a limit of 7 weeks. This strengthens the potato which is a good thing.

, Once the plant has died off and it's forecast to rain you'll want to harvest your potatoes before it rains. Otherwise the potatoes will rot in the ground from the rain.

Consider digging a trench instead of using an edging material.,
Mark out the path of the trench before digging.,
Cut the trench vertically on the lawn side and sloping on the bed side.,
Understand the pros and cons of trench-style edging.,
Re-define the trench edging every few years.,
Avoid standing along the edge of the trench.",How to Create Natural Edging for a Garden2," Natural edging can mean avoiding the use of edging materials altogether. Instead of using a hard material to define the edges, natural edging can be created by digging what is known as ‘trench’ (or ‘Victorian’) edging.


Create this type of natural edging by digging a shallow trench between your lawn and the start of the bed, then filling it with mulch.
It’s best to use the same mulching material as you used on the rest of the bed in order to create a harmonious effect.

, To dig your trench edging, mark out where you want your edge to be using spray paint or string. Cut straight down with a spade on the lawn side to a depth of about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm).


A pointed digging tool is usually best for cutting through the earth but a square spade will create a neater effect. Wear heavy-soled shoes or boots and use your foot to apply pressure to the spade to make the job easier.






You may find it pretty tiring making a large edge so you might want to spread this project out over several days.

, You should cut the trench vertically (i.e. straight down) on the lawn edge. The bed side, on the other hand, should slope down at a 45 degree angle to this trench.

You can use a rake to adjust the level on the bed side. Any earth you have removed should be put in the bed to raise it slightly. Once this is done, you can fill the trench with mulch.






This technique will work best on a soil that holds together well, such as clay or loam. Sandy or chalky soils might not be as easy to work with and get such clean lines. If you are working with an established lawn this will hold the soil together better than a new lawn.

, Edging doesn’t get any cheaper or more natural than trenching, however there are still some pros and cons to consider before you make a decision.

Your lawn will also be very easy to mow when you use this kind of edging as there is no physical or hard barrier to interfere with your mower.






The main drawback is the maintenance required by trench edging, especially if you are keen to maintain a neat effect.

, After a few years you might need to redefine the trench edging by re-cutting the trench, as time will soften the edges and may cause them to crumble.


If you are looking for a very defined look, you might like to do this more regularly.
Remember grass will soften the edges so you’ll get a softer, more natural look quite quickly once the grass grows along the perimeter of your bed.

, Keep in mind that standing right along the edge may cause the trench to cave in.


Try to avoid standing right at the edge of your trench, particularly after rain when the ground is soft and liable to slip.
Sandy or chalky soils are likely to crumble when dry.

Think about using inverted bottles.,
Get creative with your edging materials.,
Consider using lighting in your edging.,
Experiment with using multiple edging materials.",How to Create Natural Edging for a Garden3," Edging can be used as a real feature in your garden if you use an unusual or eye-catching material. Think about using inverted bottles (blue ones work well) as an edging material. Remember they may break if knocked.

, Blue slate or even glass beads or chips also work well. In a really small garden, marbles or mosaic may look wonderful.

Some vintage gardens even incorporate china plates into their borders.
Short bamboo canes or even short lengths of steel piping stuck vertically in the ground make other eye-catching choices.






Painted stones, especially in white, can look very striking.







, Some garden designers have also incorporated lighting into borders – check out some ideas in garden design books, magazines or online sites such as Pinterest for inspiration.

, There are some attractive examples of garden designers using multiple materials to create lawn edging. Have a look on Pinterest for ideas.


In general, the combination of a loose material such as river stones or blue slate shale alongside a rigid material such as pressure-treated wood works well.
To create a really natural effect, try to avoid using straight lines where possible. You might also like to confuse the eye by having your planting encroach on the edging in some areas so that it isn’t too neatly defined and the planting grows softly over it.

Collect your harvesting supplies.,
Use a large spade to dig up the potatoes.,
Check the skin of the potatoes.,
Arrange your potatoes.",How to Harvest New Potatoes2," You'll need a large spade or shovel and three containers (buckets) to help dig up the potatoes.

, Look for the base of the plant and dig 7 inches away from it to ensure you don't stab into the potatoes. There will be about 4 potatoes with each plant.

, If the skin rubs off easily they are called new potatoes. You can place these potatoes back in the ground to toughen up or use them quicker than the hardy potatoes.

, You'll usually get three kinds of potatoes which need to be kept separate; green potatoes, stabbed potatoes and potatoes that are perfectly fine. If you're lucky you'll get all potatoes in good condition but it's not uncommon to get some green potatoes or to accidentally stab one.


Green potatoes need to be chucked out and aren't edible. If they are eaten they will make you sick. Potatoes turn green when they are exposed to the light for too long.
Stabbed potatoes are still good to eat but need to be eaten first. They cannot be stored away otherwise they will rot.

"
"
Throw away any green potatoes.,
Place your potatoes on a sheet of newspaper.,
Transfer your potatoes to a suitable container.,
Store the potatoes in a cool, dry and dark area.,
Do not store potatoes in an intensely cold area.,
Check your potatoes regularly.,
Keep your potatoes stored for a limit of 7 months.",How to Harvest New Potatoes3," If you haven't already, you should do so now. Green potatoes can't be eaten or they will make you sick. They turn green when they have had too much light exposure.

, They must be placed in a dark room away from the rain and sun. This gets rid of any dirt and hardens the potatoes up. Keep them here for up to a week.


You can keep them like this for up to a week or only for a couple of days. Make sure they are protected from rain and sunlight.

, You can put them in a simple cardboard box, basket or a hessian sack for storage. The stabbed potatoes should be kept separately so you know to use them first.

, Most people tend to store their potatoes in the garage or shed where no light seeps through. Light will cause the potatoes to turn green or sprout. The area you store the potatoes shouldn't be humid or too hot either.

, This includes refrigerators and freezers. When potatoes are cold they sugar which gives them an unpleasant sweet taste. You don't want to cook with sugared potatoes.

, This is to ensure that none of them are rotting or going green. Once one potato rots it will cause the whole container of potatoes to rot. If the potatoes are going green make sure that sunlight cannot reach them.

, After this time the potatoes may turn bad and no longer edible towards you. 7 months is a good time so be sure to use them up by then. Many recipes can involve potatoes, get creative!

Pick an old shirt.,
Pick some pants.,
Pick tough shoes.,
Consider taking as waterproof or windproof jacket.,
Manage your hair.,
Bring gloves if desired.,
Put on sunscreen, and consider a hat.",How to Dress for Gardening," If you are gardening, choose your least favorite, most scrappy old shirt you have. This way if you get grass stains all over it, you hopefully won't care as much. Consider the weather, and whether you'll be sitting out in the sun.


If you'll be touching plants with sharp thorns that can poke you, long sleeves will help.;
, As with the shirt, choose your least favorite, beat up pants that you don't care about getting dirty. If you have overalls for things like this, that would be a great choice. Something with pockets big enough to hold a trowel or dibber might be useful. Make sure you can kneel or squat comfortably. You might be in your hands and knees in the dirt!

, Old boots are a great choice if there is any chance of rain. If it's going to be a bright and sunny day, you're probably fine with going with your old worn-out tennis shoes, but make sure they are not nice brand new clean ones; you want old shoes that can get dirt-covered.

, You'll be prepared if it gets cold or starts raining. You might find you are warm enough without a coat when you are gardening, but it may be chilly on the way home after and you'll be grateful for a jacket then.

, Longer hair can get in your eyes or even the dirt, so it's good to pull it back.


A bun or a ponytail can keep your hair out of the way.
If you're feeling fancy, a French braid will keep even the smallest strands out of your face.
If you have short hair, use hair clips to keep it out of your eyes.

, These can help prevent you from getting dirt under your fingernails (which is really hard to clean out) and be very helpful when handling rough stones and rocks or pulling up stinging weeds like nettles.

, Sitting for a long time in the sun can lead to sunburn or Sun Stroke. Sunscreen will help your skin stay healthy and smooth, and a hat can shield your face and take the edge off the heat. Try a wide-brimmed hat that will also protect the back of your neck, or, a base ball cap turned around.

Pick the right time to harvest.,
Put on protective gear.,
Gently smoke away the bees.,
Open the hive.,
Remove the bees.,
Uncap the honeycomb.,
Take the honeycomb to an enclosed room.,
Place the frame into an extractor.,
Spin the frames.,
Strain the honey through cheesecloth.,
Place the honeycomb into a large bucket.,
Chop the honeycomb into mush.,
Strain the honey.,
Sterilize your containers.,
Bottle the honey.,
Store and enjoy.",How to Harvest Honey," On a sunny day, most bees are out foraging between the hours of 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Harvest the honey within this time frame so that there are naturally fewer bees to deal with.The time of season you harvest in can also make a big difference in the yield and quality of your honey. In late summer and early fall, the bees stop producing honey to feed the queen, so more of the clusters are left empty. As such, you should generally harvest the honey earlier in the season.
Harvest two to three weeks after your prime nectar flow. You can ask professional beekeepers in your area when this is, or you can determine this yourself by weighing the hive every night throughout the mid summer. Prime nectar flow occurs when the hive is at its heaviest.;
, There is no way to completely prevent bees from attacking you when you remove the honeycomb from their hive. As a result, a full beekeeper's outfit is recommended whenever you intend to harvest honey.


At the absolute minimum, make sure that you at least have thick elbow-length gloves, a veiled hat, and bee-proof overalls. You should also wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants.
If you're serious about beekeeping, you may want to invest in a professional beekeeping suit.

, Light the smoker and move toward the back of the hive. Blow smoke around the entrance of the hive, then carefully remove the top and blow smoke into the opening.This process should cause the bees to move lower in the hive and away from the honeycombs near the top.
A smoker is essentially a can filled with newspaper. Light the newspaper on fire to produce smoke, and pump the smoke out through the hose.
When smoke invades the hive, the bees react as though the hive is on fire. They stuff themselves with honey and get drowsy, which causes them to sink to the bottom of the hive and ultimately put up less of a fight.
Use the least amount of smoke necessary. The smoke can affect the taste of the honey, so if you drown the hive with smoke even after most of the bees have settled, you are only tainting the flavor of your final product., Use a hive tool to lift the inner cover off the top of the hive. This tool looks like a small crowbar. Slip it under the cover and push down on the tool to lift the cover up.


Bees seal the edges of their hive with a resin material known as ""propolis."" The seal is pretty strong, so you will be unable to lift the inner cover off without the use of a specialized tool.

, There may still be a few bees hanging around the frame you plan to remove. One of the safest methods you can use to get rid of these bees is a small gas or electric blower.


If you do not have a blower, you could use a special ""bee brush"" and literally brush the bees off the frame. Bee brushes can be risky, though, because they tend to agitate the bees and make them more likely to attack you and anyone nearby.
If any bees fall get trapped in the honey before you can remove them, you will need to pick out the trapped bees by hand.

, The honeycomb will be capped on the frame with beeswax. Use an uncapping knife, fork, or dull butter knife to remove the wax and uncap the honeycomb from both sides of the frame.


If you have spare frames, you could remove the entire frame and uncap the honeycomb outside of the hive. Slip your spare frames in to the hive after removing the old ones. This is generally recommended since it minimizes your overall exposure to the angry bees., If you leave the honeycomb exposed to the open air, neighborhood bees will be attracted to the scent and will begin to gather in swarms. They will ""rob"" or feast on the honey, making the extraction process more difficult and less successful.You should process the honeycomb as soon as you remove it from the hive. At that point, the honey will still be in a relatively fluid state. It could start to harden if you allow it to sit.
If the honey does start to harden before you can process it, let it sit in a warm, sunny location for a few minutes to warm it up gently and return the honey to its fluid state.

, There are both electric and hand-cranked models available. Regardless of the type you use, you need to place the frame or frames of honeycomb directly into the barrel of the machine. Snap or clip the frames in place.


The exact method you need to follow when securing the frames in your machine will vary from model to model. Make sure that you have instructions for the model you use or otherwise understand how it should work.

, Crank the machine by hand or switch it on and let the motor do the work. As the extractor spins the frames, the honey will be forced to the walls of the drum. From there, it will gradually ooze down to the bottom.

, Place several layers of cheesecloth over the mouth of a collection bucket and place that bucket beneath the spigot on the bottom of the extractor. Open the spigot and let the honey strain through the cheesecloth.


This straining process will remove any bits of honeycomb, wax, or other debris that happened to fall off during the extraction process.
The extraction and straining process can take several hours, so try to be patient.

, If you have not removed it from the frame already, do so now. Break the honeycomb into as many pieces as necessary to fit it into the bucket.


You can usually break the honeycomb apart by hand for this part of the process.

, Use a large masher to crush the honeycomb until it turns into a thick mush. The comb should be so broken apart that you'll be unable to pick out any pieces of it by hand., Position a strainer, nylon straining bag, or several layers of cheesecloth over your collection bucket. Pour the smashed honeycomb into the straining mechanism and allow the honey to gradually separate and strain off into the bucket beneath.


Note that this process could take hours to complete.
If you want to speed the process along, you can crush the already mashed honeycomb in your hands and into the strainer. This can be extremely messy, though, and the process will still take a while.
Some of the mashed comb may not come out of the preparation bucket on its own. If this happens, you will need to use a scraper to get all of the honeycomb mush still clinging to the sides and bottom of the container.

, Wash the jars or bottles you plan on using in hot, soapy water. Rinse well, then dry completely.


Use glass or plastic containers.
Even if the containers have never been used before, you should still clean them thoroughly to avoid contaminating the honey.

, Spoon the honey into your prepared containers or pour them into the containers through a funnel. Close the jars or bottles with airtight lids.


Monitor your jars of honey for a few days after you first package them. If any debris still remains in the honey, it should rise to the surface of each container after two or three days. Remove the debris, then seal the jars of honey for long-term storage.

, Natural, organic honey can usually be stored for many months at room temperature as long as your container is sealed well.


The amount of honey you collect will vary based on the size of your honeycomb, the health of your bees, the time of season you harvest in, and the overall success of the season. In ideal conditions, though, you can get about 3-1/2 lbs (1.6 kg) of honey from one honeycomb.

Check the top ear.,
Test the corn without disturbing it.,
Peel back the husk only if necessary.,
Twist the corn off the stalk.,
Use or store immediately.,
Save the other ears for later.",How to Harvest Corn1," The top ear on any stalk will mature faster than the lower ears. Instead of harvesting all the ears at once, you should expect to harvest the top ears off your stalks first.


The top ear should be visibly plumper than the other ears on the stalk. It will become so plump, in fact, that it should start to lean away from the stalk so much so that it is nearly perpendicular with it.;
, Feel the corn to determine if it is consistently plump throughout the cob and check the silks coming off the ear to verify that they are dry.


The silks should turn brown and feel quite dry. If you try to handle the silks, they should also peel or fall off in your hand without much effort.






Note that the silks will be tinted red and will feel soft and wet if the corn is not yet ripe.
Feel the end of the ear to determine whether or not it has filled out completely. A mature ear will have a rounded or blunt end, but an unripe ear will feel pointed.
It is best to harvest corn as soon as it matures on the stalk. Ears of corn contain the most sugar at peak maturity, so they will be sweetest as soon as they turn ripe. The ears of corn gradually lose sweetness as they remain on the stalk since the corn starts to convert its sugars into starches at that point.

, If you are not quite certain about whether or not an ear is ready for harvest, you can peel back a small amount of the husk and check the kernels underneath. The end of the ear should look filled out and the kernels should be a creamy yellow or white color.Test the ear further by piercing a kernel with your thumbnail. The liquid inside the kernel should be white or milky in appearance. If the liquid seems watery or clear, the corn is still unripe. If the liquid seems too creamy, the corn might be overripe.
You should avoid opening the husk unless you cannot check for ripeness any other way. An unripe, open ear of corn is vulnerable to attacks by birds and insects.







, Removing corn from the stalk is a simple process. You should be able to grab and ear and pull it downward, then twist it off by hand.If possible, harvest the corn from the stalk in the morning. The ears are still fairly cool at this point, and the conversion of sugar to starch slows down in cooler temperatures.






Steady the cornstalk with one hand and use the other hand to twist the corn of the stalk. It should come off in your hands. You should not need to use shears to remove the ears of corn from the stalk.

, The conversion of sugar to starch speeds up after you harvest corn, so to maintain maximum sweetness and flavor, try to eat the corn within 24 hours of harvesting it.

Note that super-sweet varieties can stay sweeter for longer periods of time, but traditional varieties will convert more than half their sugar content to starch after the first 24 hours.






You can slow the rate at which corn converts its sugars to starch by keeping the corn cold. Lay the ears in single layers inside a refrigerator and cover them with a damp cloth to keep the corn as cool as possible.






In the refrigerator, corn should retain its sweetness for about a week.

, After the top ear becomes ripe enough, the remaining ears of corn on the stalk should ripen in another ten days or so.


Most corn plants will yield a minimum of two ears per stalk, if not more. Hybrids tend to produce more than pure varieties."
"
Wait until husks and stalks brown completely.,
Snap each ear off the stalk.,
Cure the corn off the cob.,
Remove the kernels.,
Save and use as desired.",How to Harvest Corn2," Unlike sweet corn that you plan to eat, popcorn needs to be harvested after it already passes its sweetest, ripest stage. In this regard, popcorn can actually be easier to harvest than sweet corn for standard consumption.


Let the ears of corn stay on the stalks until both the husks and stalks have turned brown and begun drying.
Make sure that you harvest popcorn ears before a frost passes over your area.

, Since the stalks and husks are so brittle at this point, snapping the ears of corn off is usually quite easy. You can do so by hand and without using any tools.


Grab the stalk with one hand and simply twist the ear of corn off with your other hand.

, The corn needs to be cured or dried for an additional four to six weeks after you harvest it if you plan to use it for popcorn. The kernels need to be partially dry with only a little moisture in them.

Prepare the the corn for indoor curing by removing the dried husks from each ear. The kernels should already be somewhat dry.






Place the ears in mesh bags or spread them out in a single layer. Store them in an area with warm, flowing air, or hang the bags in your garage.






The ideal moisture content for popcorn is between 13 and 14 percent.







, When the kernels have finished curing, remove the kernels by grabbing the ear in both hands and firmly twisting the cob back and forth. The kernels should drop out as you twist.

Note that the kernels should loosen and drop with very little pressure.






Be careful as you remove the kernels since some with sharp points could scratch you up. If necessary, wear gloves during this stage to protect your hands.






If you are not certain about whether or not the kernels are ready to be shelled, test a few after a few weeks. Shell only a few kernels and try popping them. When the finished corn pops well and tastes good, the rest is ready to be shelled. If the popped kernels are chewy, the corn is still too wet and should be cured for additional time. Continue testing kernels in this manner once or twice a week., If you dried the corn kernels correctly, the remaining moisture inside should turn to steam when those kernels are heated. That steam is what causes the kernels to ""pop"" open.

After you cure the corn, you can hang mesh bags of full ears in a root cellar or another similar cool, dark, and dry space. When stored in this manner, popcorn can stay usable for years.






Store separated kernels in airtight jars and keep them in a cool, dark, and dry location.







"
"
Harvest a month after the eating stage.,
Twist or snap the corn off the stalk.,
Dry as needed.,
Twist the kernels off.,
Save the seed in dry containers.",How to Harvest Corn3," When harvesting corn for seed purposes, the corn is usually ready to harvest four to six weeks after you would harvest it to eat.

The husks should be brown, dry, and papery before you harvest the corn. The stalk does not have to be fully brown yet, however.






Note that any corn harvested for seed must first be pollinated.







, As with corn harvested for eating or for popcorn, the process for removing the ears off the stalk is quite simple. Hold the stalk with one hand while twisting the ear off with your other hand. You should be able to remove the ear easily by bending it down and twisting it side to side.


Shears or other garden tools should not be needed.

, Pull the husks back to expose the kernels underneath. Store the corn in a cool, dry location until the kernels are completely dry.Place the corn in mesh bags and hang them in a dry, cool area for a month or two. Check the corn periodically through this stage starting at the third week. After you check the first time, check the corn once or twice a week until it is ready.






You can check the corn by twisting off a few kernels. Place the kernels in a small plastic container or bag and seal it. Put the container in the refrigerator and watch it for a day or two, noting whether or not any condensation forms. If condensation forms, the corn is not yet dry enough. If none forms, the kernels are dry and ready for shelling.







, When the corn has dried sufficiently, grab the ear in both hands and twist them firmly yet carefully. The kernels should drop off without much effort.

Any silk or chaff that remains should be filtered out before it drops into the container.






Clean shelled kernels by rinsing them. Place the on top of a screen with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) gaps, placed on top of a screen with 1/4 inch (0.625 cm).Dry completely after cleaning the corn.

, Place the dried kernels in an airtight container. Seal and store in a dry, dark, and cool location until you plan to plant them.

When stored under the right conditions, corn seed can stay usable for five to ten years.

Harvest the shoots in early spring.,
Measure the shoots.,
Cut the shoots just above soil level.,
Wash and store the shoots.",How to Harvest Daylilies1," In the early spring the daylily will begin to grow shoots out of the ground. These shoots will grow throughout the season, until the plant begins to flower in the early summer. These small shoots are edible and can be harvested for food., For the best tasting daylily shoots, you should harvest them when they are approximately 8 inches (20 cm) tall or smaller. Measure the shoots from the soil to the top. If they are taller than 8 inches (20 cm) the flavour will be stronger and they will not taste as good., Use a pair of clippers to cut the daylily shoots just above the soil level. Once they have been cut the plant will regrow the shoots. Harvesting daylily shoots does not kill or damage the plant.If you don’t have clippers, you can twist the shoots to remove them from the roots., Once you have picked the daylily shoots, you should peel back the outer leaves until you reach the tender inner portion. Wash the shoots to remove any dirt or insects that may be found on the leaves and store the in the refrigerator before eating.Shoots will last in the refrigerator for a few days.

Harvest based on what you need.,
Harvest when your herbs are healthy.,
Pick before your herbs flower.,
Harvest by age.,
Harvest by height.,
Pick in the morning.,
Harvest throughout the season.",How to Harvest Herbs1," Some herbs are harvested not just for their leaves but also their seeds and/or flowers. You will need to adjust when you harvest depending on what part of the herb you want. For example, cilantro's coriander (that is, the ""fruit"" or seed portion of the plant) only becomes available after the flowers form seed pods, but by then it will have very few leaves.If you're growing for seeds (ex: dill, fennel, coriander, or caraway) harvest around the time the seed pods change color.
If you’re growing for leaves, harvest before the plant starts to bloom. Some herbs like basil take on a bitter taste once they begin to flower.
For the flowers of herbs like lavender, borage, and chamomile, harvest before the flowers fully open.
Wait until the end of summer or early fall to uproot plants like ginseng and goldenseal.;
, If your plant is looking damaged, overgrown, or diseased, do not attempt to harvest from it. The likelihood that you will end up with a subpar product that tastes off or will mold is significantly higher. Instead, prune and care for your herbs until they are back in good health and harvest them after they have had sufficient time to recover their growth., Herbs lose much of their flavor and have a tendency to become bitter after they have flowered.In order to ensure that your herbs will taste right, harvest before they start to flower.


Timing can be key: oregano, thyme, and mint become their most flavorful just before they begin to bloom., Some herbs are very predictable for the earliest time you can start harvesting. However, it may depend on whether or not you've planted them as seeds or if you transplanted them. Use the following as guidelines for harvesting common herbs:


Parsley: 70-90 days after plantingRosemary: 6 weeks after plantingSage: 75 days after transplantingLemonbalm, peppermint (and mint), tarragon, and thyme can be harvested at any time once the herb has sprouted and leaves appear.Use your own judgment, too. It’s best to harvest based on how the plant looks – and whether it seems ready – rather than on days.

, It can be difficult to tell exactly when your herbs may bloom because herbs' growth cycles can be impeded or encouraged by the weather. Additionally, maturity varies from plant to plant. One accurate way to be sure you can start harvesting your herbs is to measure their height. If your herbs meet the minimum requirement listed below, you can start harvesting:Basil: 6-8"" tall
Cilantro: 6-12"" long

, Herbs are used for both their fragrance and taste, both of which are derived from the oils they naturally produce. Logically you should pick your herbs when they have the highest concentration of oil. This happens to be in the early morning hours, around the time the morning dew is evaporating. Be sure that you pick your herbs before the heat of the day sets in. The sun's heat will dry up the plants, reducing the amount of oil.
Do not wash the dew from the leaves or you will lose the herbs' fragrant oils.

, In addition to starting early, you should harvest often. This promotes new growth. In general you can continue to harvest until the first frost. However, perennial herbs (that is, herbs that live for three or more growing years) should not be harvested after August so that you don't accidentally encourage the plant to grow when it is too cold for it to survive."

Dig up a daylily between late fall and early spring.,
Cut off the tubers from the root.,
Replant the remaining roots and tubers.,
Wash and store the tubers.",How to Harvest Daylilies2," Daylilies also have edible tubers which are located in the root of the plant. Use a small garden shovel to dig up the root of the daylily plant. This can be done any time between late fall and early spring.It is best not to harvest daylily tubers during the summer when the plant is in bloom. This is because the tubers will become mushy in texture.

, The root of a daylily consists of spindly roots and tubers that look like small fingerling potatoes. The tubers will range in size from the size of a pea to the size of a large almond. Using garden clippers, cut most of the tubers from the root., Digging up the plant and removing tubers from the roots does not kill the plant. In fact, you can replant the remaining roots and tubers so that the daylily will continue to grow and bloom in the spring. This way you can harvest the same plant for multiple seasons., Once you have harvested the tubers, wash and scrub them with warm water to remove any dirt. Store them in a cool and dark place similar to potatoes. The tubers should be firm when you eat them, so make sure you feel the tubers before cooking with them. If they have gone mushy, you should discard them and harvest a new batch."
"
Pick buds in early spring.,
Harvest the flowers in summer.,
Clip the wilted flowers.,
Wash and store the buds and flowers.",How to Harvest Daylilies3," The buds of daylilies are also edible and taste delicious when fried in butter. In the early spring the small green buds can be harvested by pulling them off the plant with your hands or by cutting them with clippers. You can also harvest and eat the buds when they are larger, immediately before they bloom., In the late spring and early summer the daylilies will begin to bloom. These flowers are edible and can be harvested for food, or used in a floral arrangement. It is important to note that each flower only blooms for one day, which is how they got the name daylily.Use your fingers or clippers to harvest the blooming flower.

, Wilted or day-old flowers are also edible and can be harvested for food. Use your fingers to pull the wilted flowers off the plant. Alternatively, you can use clippers to remove the flower from the plant., Once you have picked the buds or flowers, you should wash them with water to remove any dirt or insects that may be found in the petals. Daylily flowers only bloom for one day, so you will need to eat them shortly after picking them. You can store the buds in the refrigerator for later use."
"
Use good tools.,
Locate the right area to cut.,
Prune your herbs simultaneously.,
Clip at ground level.,
Dig up root herbs.,
Prepare your herbs for immediate use.",How to Harvest Herbs2," When cutting your plants, be sure that your clippers are clean and sharp. This will promote faster healing and prevent your plant from getting sick.You may also want to wear gloves to keep your hands from getting dirty and to protect them from any potential pests.
Clean your harvesting tools with rubbing alcohol between plants, too, to reduce the risk of spreading diseases.

, Most people want their herbs to be a sustainable supply that will regrow even after being used. In order to be sure that you don't accidentally kill your herbs, don't harvest more than ⅓ of the plant that you can see.For harvesting leaves, you'll want to snip (from a mature plant) a few inches down the stem.You can also simply pick off the few pieces that you need when you need them, but clipping them will stimulate better growth afterward.
The most tender leaves, ideal for salads and dressings, are located at the top of the plant. Older, more flavorful leaves are good for cooking recipes and will be located at the bottom of the plant., While you are harvesting, look for yellowed and dying leaves as well as flower buds. Removing these unwanted items encourages better, faster leaf growth, and in the case of the latter it helps to keep the leaves more tender.Let one plant go to seed (that is, do not weed or prune it away and allow nature to do the work of reseeding for you) from your stock in order to have seeds for the next year's crop.

, Some herbs, like parsley and chives, do not have sprigs that produce leaves on their stalks. Rather, their stalk is the herb. In the case of parsley, you’ll need to clip them from the ground. Otherwise, the plant will not send up new shoots to replace the old ones.For other plants, however, you’ll want to leave some of the stalk intact. For chives, leave 2 to 3 inches when you harvest to support new growth.

, Herbs like dandelion, burdock, and yellow dock which have single-stemmed tap roots can't simply be pulled out: the top portion of the plant will break away from the bottom portion. You will need to use a shovel or digging fork to get the roots out. Be forewarned: some roots can be very deep and very large depending on the plant; burdock, for example, can have roots that grow up to 12 inches in length and 1 inch thick., If you intend to use your freshly picked herbs for cooking, you will want to remove them from the stem by sliding a thumb and your forefinger from top to bottom, pulling them off as you go. If you intend to use them for their fragrance or preserve them for later, leave your herbs' leaves and/or flowers on the stem.


If the herb will simply be used for flavoring in the cooking but will not be eaten, it's okay to cook the entire stem with the leaf to make it easier to remove the item when you're finished. For example, bay leaves are commonly used for seasoning soups, chilis, and other savory foods, but they are never eaten, so you might find it easier to leave them on the stem for removal.
If the leaves will not come off easily, such as with parsley and bay leaves, you can use a pair of scissors to snip them off."
"
Don't harvest too much.,
Clean your herbs.,
Dry out the herbs with a commercial dehydrator.,
Dry out the herbs by bundling them.,
Dry out your herbs' roots in an oven.,
Check that your herbs are completely dry.,
Properly store your herbs.",How to Harvest Herbs3," Even if you don't plan on using your herbs immediately for cooking, you will still need to deal with them within 24 hours. Herbs that are left sitting for a day or more may end up with bruised leaves and begin to deteriorate. This will result in a loss of aromatic and flavorful oil.


Even if it seems inconvenient, work in batches so that you will not waste any of your efforts., Especially if you intend to preserve your herbs for later use, you need to clean them first. Bugs can breed and hatch on herbs that have been left to dry out. For plants that have recently seen rain, brushing them off with a dampened cloth should be sufficient. If your plant is dusty, rinse it in cool tap water and then get rid of the excess by using a salad spinner. Gently pat the herbs dry with a towel to finish.


If you can avoid washing the herbs, do so, as this will slow down the preservation process. However, if you live in a region that is particularly dusty due to drought or the natural environment (say a desert or near the beach), you may have no choice.For root herbs, you will want to scrub off the dirt without soap and then wipe them dry., There are numerous dehydrators available to consumers. You can purchase them online at Amazon or at retailers like Target or Bed Bath & Beyond. Preheat the dehydrator to 95-115 degrees Fahrenheit and place your herbs in a single layer on a provided tray, removing larger leaves from thick stems.Periodically check on your herbs for dryness, and expect that it will take between 1-4 hours for your herbs to fully dry depending on how much moisture the leaves had to begin with.Herb leaves will crumble when dry, but roots will become even harder than before.

, This process works particularly well for herbs that have really sturdy stems like sage and rosemary. Remove the leaves from the lower portions of the stems so that they won't potentially mold later on, and then gather the stems into bundles about 1 inch in diameter. Tie the bundle together tightly with a rubber band or twist tie, and then hang the bundles upside down in an area away from direct sunlight (to avoid bleaching)., Particularly for root herbs that have been chopped, grated, or cut up, you can dry them in your oven. Collect all of the herbs you wish to dry in an oven-safe tray and place that in the oven. Set your oven's temperature to 200 degrees Fahrenheit and when it's heated to the appropriate temperature, turn it off. Open the oven door to allow the air to circulate and the roots to gradually cool off; they should be dry., If your herbs are still storing any moisture in them at this point and you try to store them away, you may end up with moldy, unusable herbs later on. Be sure they're really thoroughly dry by putting them in a jar, closing the lid, and leaving them on a countertop for a day or two. When you open the jar again, check the underbelly of the lid for condensation, which would indicate your herbs are still too moist for storage.Continue dehydrating your herbs as necessary.

, Store your herbs in an airtight glass container. Mason jars are often recommended. If you have surplus of an herb that isn't ground up, you can use a vacuum sealing apparatus to keep your bulk supply fresher for a longer period of time.You can also freeze fresh herbs for use later on.

Know how to spot lamb’s quarters.,
Look for lamb’s quarters in places with lush growth.,
Forage wild-growing plants only.,
Pull the leaves off at the stem.,
Cut and collect the stems.,
Remove the seed heads carefully.,
Remove the chaff from the seeds.,
Wash the leaves by soaking them.,
Use lamb’s quarters immediately after picking.,
Store fresh lamb’s quarters in a cool, dry place.",How to Harvest Lamb's Quarters," Lamb’s quarters is identifiable by its bushy leaves and slender, upright seed heads, which make it easy to distinguish from ordinary weeds. These seed heads emerge from the center of mature plants with the foliage bunched together closer to the ground. You can sometimes determine the age of the plant by examining its stem—young stems are green and firm to the touch, while older stems often start to develop a reddish or purple coloration.
The plant is most abundant in the warmer months of late spring to early fall.;
, Conduct your search in open fields, on cultivated lands and among thick wild grasses. Pay special attention to the spaces between other flowering plants. Lamb’s quarters is remarkably common in temperate climates, so there’s a good chance you may even be able to find some growing in your backyard. Lamb’s quarters plants favor sunlight, and will often be found just outside tree-lines and in bare, unshaded patches of earth.
Look closely to make sure that what you’ve found is lamb’s quarters and not another inedible species of weed., Avoid gathering plants in commercial and residential areas that might have been sprayed with pesticides or fertilizer. These may contain traces of harmful chemicals that can make you very sick should you ingest them. It’s safest to stick to herbs that you come across in secluded, out of the way areas.Steer clear of plants that you find sprouting in or near mulch or manure.
It’s not recommended that you attempt to grow lamb’s quarters yourself. Since it’s an invasive species, it can quickly overtake your yard or garden and may be difficult to get rid of., Stoop down to get closer to the leaves at the base of the plant. Holding the stem with one hand, use the fingers of your other hand to gently pluck the leaves free. Be careful not to tear or otherwise damage the leaves while you’re gathering them.Bring a basket, bucket or plastic bag along with you to collect the leaves you harvest.
Lamb’s quarters leaves tend to be small and will shrink up even more when cooked. If you’re planning on serving or storing them in bulk, you’ll want to gather as many as you can find., You can also take a few stems with you so that none of the plant goes to waste. Snip the stems a few inches from the soil with a pair of sharp scissors. Trim the smaller offshoots from the stems and scrub them lightly with your fingertips under a stream of cool water to clean them.The stems can be prepared by steaming, boiling or sautéing. When cooked, they have a hearty crunch similar to romaine hearts or broccoli florets.

, The tall, thin stalks of fully grown plants produce a grain that’s similar to quinoa. To harvest this grain, simply bend the seed heads over your bucket or bag and give them a good shake. Most of the mature seeds should fall right out. The rest can be pulled free by hand.Pass up seed heads if they’re green or appear especially small. They’re likely still too young to be any good.
Lamb’s quarters seeds range in color from a light tan to deep brown or black shades., Some of the seeds will likely still be covered with bits of thin, papery husk. Clear this away by transferring the seeds to a colander or wire strainer and running a stream of water over them. Afterwards, the grain can be eaten or processed safely.To free grains that are still enclosed, crush the seed head between two fingers, then brush away the rest of the chaff and rinse thoroughly.
Scrub away dirt, debris and any insects that might have made their home inside the seed heads.

, Because of the natural powdery residue clinging to the leaves of lamb’s quarters, a quick rinse won’t be enough to clean them. Instead, place them in a shallow bowl and pour in enough cold water to completely cover them. Swish the leaves through the water a few times, then take them out and shake off the excess moisture.Pick out and dispose of any leaves that are slimy or mottled.
If you’re planning on cooking with the herb right away, press the leaves between a layer of paper towels to wick away as much water as you can.

, The leaves will best when eaten right away, while they’re still fresh. Steam or saute them until they just begin to wilt, or enjoy them raw in a salad of seasonal vegetables. They have a mild and slightly sweet flavor that lends itself well to a variety of soups, stir fries and side dishes.Try substituting lamb’s quarters in your favorite recipes that call for spinach, kale, chard or similar greens.Once you’ve stripped the grains, you can roast them for snacking, grind them to use in flours or boil them and serve them like rice., If you have an unused portion, you can preserve them the way you would spinach or other leafy greens. Wrap them loosely in a plastic bag or layer of paper towels and stow them away in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator. The seeds can be stored in a lidded container or airtight plastic bag until you’re ready to use them.Try to use up the leaves within 3-5 days of bringing them home.
You could also freeze the leaves immediately after washing them. Frozen greens will stay fresh for up to a year."

Pick the ripe coffee cherries.",How to Harvest Coffee Beans1," Let the unripe cherries remain on the tree to ripen and be harvested at a later date. Ripeness is determined by appearance and touch. Gently squeeze the fruit. If ripe, it will be slightly soft and give a little under the pressure. Ripe coffee cherries will also be bright red and glossy. Place cherries in a basket.;

"
Strip all the cherries off the coffee tree.,
Rake the coffee cherries.,
Sort the coffee cherries.",How to Harvest Coffee Beans2," One sweep of a branch removes the ripe as well as the unripe berries. Commercial growers use machines to remove all the berries. This method is used when the majority of the berries are ripe. Though there is a significant amount of waste when coffee is harvested by stripping, the cost is worth it for commercial growers who find this method more cost effective than the time and financial investment involved in selective harvesting. You can strip harvest at home by hand by grabbing a branch and sliding your hand forward to knock all the cherries off the tree and onto the ground.

, Use a rake to gather the cherries that have been knocked to the ground. You can place a sheet or netting under the tree to collect the cherries as they fall. This will make the task of picking them up from the ground easier.

, Separate the ripe from the unripe cherries. Remove any leaves and branch pieces that may have gotten mixed in. The refuse can be thrown out or placed in your compost pile.

"
"
Remove coffee cherries with a machine.",How to Harvest Coffee Beans3," Large commercial growers use big harvesting machines to remove the coffee cherries from the trees. Some machines vibrate the trunk, shaking the berries to the ground. Other machines have brushes attached that sweep the berries off the tree.

"
"
Pulp the berries.,
Soak the beans.,
Dry the beans.",How to Harvest Coffee Beans4," Squeeze the cherries to separate the seed or the coffee bean from the fruit.

, After you have separated the beans from the fruit, some meat will remain on the beans. Soak them in a bowl or bucket of water for one to two days to break down the fruit and separate it from the bean. The fruit will float to the top and can be discarded, while the beans sink to the bottom of the bowl.

, Drying the beans is a lengthy process, taking between 10 to 30 days, depending on the weather. It is worth the wait, however. Lay the bean on a wire mesh or concrete somewhere outdoors in the shade. Several times each day, stir and rotate the beans to make sure they dry evenly. You will know the beans are dry when their outer skin flakes off easily.

Prepare the flower beds in spring.,
Uncover and rake the earth.,
Create a drill in the soil.,
Sow the seeds.,
Cover and let germinate.,
Replant the seedlings.",How to Harvest Heartsease1," At least a month before you intend to sow your seeds, choose a spot in your garden where you will plant the heartsease seeds and turn over the soil. Using a sturdy metal shovel, invert the first layer of earth, digging about ten inches into the soil. Cover the area with a plastic sheet or fleece (available in gardening or hardware stores) to keep the soil warm and prevent weeds., When you are ready to sow the heartsease seeds, remove the covering. Rake the soil to even out the surface and remove weeds and debris. Water the soil so that its moist before you sow the seeds.For best results, sow heartsease seeds in the springtime around April.

, A drill is a shallow depression on the top of the soil in which to sow seeds. Use a long, solid object (e.g. a cane) to gently push down into the first inch or so of the earth. Do not go too deep, as heartsease seeds will have trouble growing if they're too far below the surface., Purchase heartsease seeds from a gardening store, or online. Scatter the seeds every 2-3 inches along the drill. Gently rake earth back into the drill, covering the seeds.Make and sow as many drills as you desire, based on your available space.

, Cover the flower bed with fleece. The germination process usually takes about 16 days. After the 16 days, check up on the growth progress of the heartsease seedlings.Water the seeds during dry spells., After approximately 16 days, or when seedlings have grown to several inches tall, replant them in your flower bed. Using a spade, gently dig up the seedlings. Replant them approximately 6 inches apart, preferably in an area in sun or partial shade.You may also purchase heartsease seedlings from local nurseries or gardening stores to plant.
Heartsease seedlings can also be planted in decorative planters or pots.

Pick the flowers.,
Prepare fresh petals right away to eat them.,
Dry heartsease.,
Deadhead the crop.",How to Harvest Heartsease2," Pick heartsease when they first open. Harvest the flowers in a ""haircut"" style, using scissors to remove flowers from the stems of the plant.Choose a sunny day during the late morning or afternoon, as heartsease flowers will droop their heads for protection in wet weather or at night.The plant typically flowers from May to September and will continue flowering after you pick the blooms.

, If you wish to add fresh heartsease petals to soups, salads, or other meals, pick the flowers right before using them. Gently remove the petals and place them in a bowl of cold water for 10-15 minutes to plump up. Use them right away as a colorful garnish., Pick heartsease flowers and remove the leaves from the stems. Bundle flowers together and hang them upside down in a warm, dry, dark area (e.g. an attic). Leave them there for two to three weeks to dry completely.To make tea, which is often brewed and consumed for heartsease’s medicinal properties (e.g. as an expectorant or diuretic), dry heartsease flowers for immediate use or storage., Deadheading your flower crop will delay the plants from setting seed and cause them to re-flower, encouraging new blooms. Using gardening sheers or strong scissors, cut away stems of flowers that have already bloomed and grown to their fullest. Cut flowers just above the leaf nodes.Harvesting flowers will achieve the same effect, but deadheading is a wise move if do not intend to harvest all of the heartsease that you grow.

Know the right time of year to pick cranberries.,
Choose a dry day.,
Walk a mechanical picker through the fields.,
Know that cranberries grow in bogs.,
Flood the bogs.,
Stir the waters.,
Collect the berries.,
Pick up the cranberries.,
Sort the berries for qualities.,
Bounce the berries.,
Keep the bouncy berries and discard the rest.",How to Harvest Cranberries," Cranberries ripen in the fall. You can tell when they begin to ripen because they will change from green to bright red in color. This happens at the beginning of September and generally ends in mid-November. Cranberries that are dry harvested are less likely to get damaged than wet harvested berries. Dry harvested berries are the ones sold fresh at markets and stores.


Be sure to harvest by the first frost of the year for good quality berries.;
, Dry harvesting of cranberries cannot be executed if there is any moisture on the plant. This includes rain, dampness from a frost or even dew. If there is any sign of wetness on the plants, hold off harvesting until things dry out., Similar in workings to a large, push lawn mower, the picker mows over the field. It has moving comb-like fingers that separate the berries from their vine. The berries are then shifted into an attached container, like a grass catcher. The berries in the container are then collected and sent to be processed. The one downside to the mechanical picker is that the machine can occasionally damage berries. Damaged berries are best used for juices and sauces.

If you are not growing many cranberry bushes, you could consider picking your cranberries by hand. While this takes a good deal of time, it is a more affordable way to pick the berries. Picking by hand is not recommended if you have a cranberry bog. Invest in a mechanical picker, which you can order online or through your local yard supply store. You can also rent or borrow a mechanical picker before you buy to decide if you want to make the investment.
You can also use a handheld scoop if you only have a few bushes. This is much more cost effective for a few bushes than a mechanical picker., The reason that there are two ways to pick cranberries (dry or wet) is because cranberries grow in bogs. What a lot of people don’t know is that bogs are not always wet, thus farmers are able to dry harvest the berries. The other harvesting option is to flood the bogs with water. Cranberries float, so when the bogs are flooded, detached berries from the stems and float to the top of the water, where they are able to be scooped up., The harvest begins a day before the farmer actually collects the berries as he pumps water into the cranberry fields. The amount of water can range from six up to about 18 inches (45.7 cm). These bogs are impermeable--specifically created with layers of various growing mediums--so flooding them is not difficult.


However, keep in mind that flooding harvest requires that you prepare the ground before you flood it. It is also only worth doing if you have many bushes. If you only have a few, then picking by hand is your best bet.

, Machines, fondly called 'egg beaters' are used to agitate the waters. This process separates the cranberries from their vines. Because cranberries grow with a little pocket of air inside them, they float. All loosened berries come to the surface of the water., A net is stretched from one end of the bog to the other. It is walked across the field and gathers the berries as it moves. Instead of a net, sometimes a machine like the boom of a boat is used to gather the berries.

, Cranberries are then vacuumed up and into trucks to be shipped out to a processing plant. These berries arrive to consumers in some kind of processed form--either juice, sauce or other processed foods. Wet harvesting does more damage to the berries than dry harvesting, which is why these berries are made into sauces, juices or jellies., One of the best ways to do this is to look at the color of the berries. Depending on where your berries grow, their colors can range from light, but vibrant, red to a very dark crimson color. They should also be firm to the touch. These berries are the ones that make it into the fresh produce section of your grocery store. They are best used for cooking and baking., While this may sound strange, a great way to sort the best berries from the not as great ones is to bounce them. Quality berries are firm and springy--meaning they bounce off the ground nicely. They bounce because of the air bubbles inside the berries. Don’t throw them as hard as you can at the floor, but a simple drop against a flat surface should be enough to tell you whether or not your berries have the bounce.

, You can either use the fresh ones in a recipe, or freeze them for later use. You might also consider drying some of the cranberries for a delicious snack.


Fresh, bouncy cranberries will last for up to two months in the refrigerator.

Select the right part of the plant.,
Know when to begin harvesting chives.,
Have several plants growing at once.,
Gather the leaves into a bunch.,
Use your chives or store them.,
Use chives in a recipe.",How to Harvest Chives," Look for the long, green, hollow leaves. These are round in shape. These are the parts of the plant that you want to use in your recipes.The chive flowers are also edible but do not have the same flavor as a chive stalk. They are best used as a garnish in a salad or soup.;
, You can begin harvesting the chives when the leaves grow large enough to be clipped and used., This will help when it comes to harvesting. If you only have one plant, you might over harvest it by cutting the leaves before they have had enough time to grow. If you have multiple chive plants, you can harvest the leaves of one and then wait for those leaves to grow back while you harvest the leaves from another plant.

, Use a pair of sharp, clean scissors to remove the leaves. Do not cut too closely to the bulb, or you will spoil the chances of the chives regrowing. You want to leave about ½ an inch of green leaves attached to the bulb, above the soil.If you just need a few chives, harvest from the outside of the clump. Sharp scissors work best as they will not rip the plant like dull scissors will. Leave the rest to grow.
If you want to continue to harvest them in winter, transfer a clump of chives to a pot. Place it on a sunny windowsill. You can then have fresh chives throughout the winter.

, If storing, cut chives can be kept in the refrigerator inside a sealed plastic bag for up to one week. It is also possible to freeze them in ice cubes or to freeze dry them.Before using your chives, rinse them off under cool, running water to remove any dirt or debris from the garden.
Another good method for preservation is to make chive vinegar.


, You can use chives in a salad. They also make a great baked potato topping. The possibilities for chives are truly endless!

, If you are foraging for cattails to eat, you should avoid collecting them from heavily polluted roadsides, as well as bioswales and other areas that are likely contaminated.Cattails are increasingly used for the purpose of cleaning contaminated wetlands, such as areas where there is industrial pollution and dangerous chemicals like arsenic.You should exercise caution wherever it looks like the plants may have been planted with the purpose of remediating a polluted area.Avoid picking cattails from ponds in urban or suburban developments. Cattails are often planted in order to help clean the contaminated water from the development. You should avoid eating these cattails, since they will have accumulated toxins.If you are harvesting the cattails to make rope, however, it is fine to collect them from these areas.

, Cattails have a memorable shape that may remind you of eating hot dogs on a stick at summer camp. The flower head is brown and looks like a hot dog.Some people describe the flower head as a large cigar. These flower heads contain thousands of seeds., The leaves are long and flat, typically measuring one to three metres in length. You will see twelve to sixteen leaves on each cattail shoot. The cross section of a leaf is D-shaped and between ten and twenty millimeters in width., This edible plant grows to between one and a half and three metres in height. They have a seed pod on the top that looks like a cigar or a hot dog., The spikes or young shoots of a cattail plant look like large leaks. If you get up close to a bunch of cattails, you will notice the young spikes poking just below or above the water line., Look for a leaf that is slightly brown where it meets the stalk. Often, you will find the beetle grub hiding inside this leaf. You can use it as bait for fishing., Walk out into the marshy crop of cattails. Since cattails grow in wet, marshy areas, you may want to wear rainboots. You could also go barefooted, although you should assess risks like cutting your feet on broken glass. Gloves are also a good idea, since you will be working in the muck.If you go barefoot, it might be a bit cold.
A risk of going barefoot is cutting your feet on bottles, rocks or other sharp objects.
If you go barefoot, you could easily sprain your ankle on one of the plants.
Ticks are a concern in some areas and seasons. If it is tick season, you should definitely avoid going barefoot., The roots or “rhizomes” of the plant need to be loosened up, but first you need to find them. Use your hands to follow the stalk or shoot of the plant until you get to the base of the plant, which will likely be in the mud. Feel for one of the branches of the root system., Get a grip on the roots of the cattail. Pull and push the roots until you feel the plant loosen up a bit in the mud., Hold onto the base of the plant. Pull upwards with all of your strength to remove the cattail.

Bees don´t like dirtiness and will sting you under your arms if your are dirty., Not everything that buzzes leads to honey. Wasps and yellow jackets make nests, but they do not produce any honey. Also, there are solitary species of bees which don't make honey.

, If you see a hole in a tree or log where there are lots of bees going in and out, you've found their hive.

, (Pine needles are generally good for this purpose.)

, Waft the smoke into the hole. Smoke makes the bees expect a fire, which makes them concerned about their honey. They gorge themselves over the uncapped honey, which makes them less likely to fly around and sting you.

, Try to avoid getting comb that contains larvae. Don't try to take the whole hive, just take a piece.

The flowers are purple and smell strongly of grapes. The roots are thick and go deep underground.Make sure to watch for poison ivy, which is often found intertwined with kudzu. They both have three-part leaves of a similar bright green color. However, kudzu leaves are usually larger and aren’t as smooth on the sides.Some areas offer seminars on how to identify and use kudzu. Find one by entering your location and “kudzu seminar” into a search engine.;
, Look for it in overgrown fields or even along the sides of roads. When you locate an area to harvest, make sure that the plant has not been sprayed by herbicide. exhaust.It is best to choose kudzu as removed from roads as possible as it has had less contact with auto exhaust.

, Kudzu can grow almost anywhere, but you are less likely to find significant growths in the winter periods. The winter weather kills off many of the leaves and green shoots of the kudzu, making the roots easier to access in colder weather. If you are interested in the leaves, then it is best to harvest them in the late spring and summer. The flowers reach their peak in August and stay active until September., To harvest kudzu, you will need to go into overgrown areas, possibly with thorns and other hazards. Choose an outfit that fully covers both your arms and legs. If you plan to dig up the roots, bring a sturdy pair of gloves and wear work boots as well.

, Because of the foliage surrounding the kudzu, and the kudzu itself, it may be difficult to see the ground. This means that snakes and other dangerous animals and insects can be hard to see. For that reason, let other people know when you are going out to harvest and, if possible, don’t go alone. Try to make as much noise as possible when harvesting to scare off any animals.

Chop off any younger vines.,
Dig up the roots.,
Soften and split the vines, if needed.,
Blanch the leaves.,
Harvest as much as you need or want.",How to Harvest Kudzu2," As with any plant, it is possible to be allergic to kudzu. Before you start harvesting the plant, take one of the leaves and rub it onto the back of your hand. If you are worried about a reaction, do this at home. Watch to see if your hand looks irritated or red., Use scissors or garden shears to sever the flowers from the small stems that attach them to the larger vines. The flowers will be purple in color and will smell strongly of grapes. Look for the flowers that are open if you plan on using them for cooking.It is possible to keep the flowers for up to one day in the refrigerator.Remove the stems from the blossoms before using. Boiling them will also cleanse them of dirt and remove any bugs., If you plan to use the leaves for cooking, then choose those that are young and green. Gently pluck them off the stems using scissors, garden shears, or your gloved hands. Place them into a basket being careful not to crush them., Some people use kudzu bark for various craft and sewing projects. Remove the bark from the larger vines by going to the base where it meets the ground. Use a pair of sharp shears or a knife to peel away sections of bark. Be prepared to tug a bit to remove it, as the bark will be stuck rather firmly to the inside of the vine.The bark itself can be rather easy to tear once removed, so be careful when handling it if you want it intact.

, The green, thin vines that climb well into the trees can be used for weaving and other projects. Start by pulling them out from the trees as much as you can. Make any cuts with garden shears to separate the vines from others. Try to get as long of pieces as possible., Kudzu roots range widely in size and depth. Surface roots are about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter and only go a few feet deep. Mature roots can weigh over 200 pounds and be over eight feet deep. To access the smaller roots, use a hand and push shovel. Carefully remove the dirt around the root before severing it and pulling it out.Roots taste the best when harvested in the fall. Older roots are tougher in texture.

, If you plan to work with the vines and need them pliable, place them in a large pot with some water. Steam them for a bit and then remove. After they’ve cooled, use a sharp knife to make a cut at the end of the vine and peel downwards from there. Apply pressure to the vine halves to separate the fibers., After you’ve removed the leaves, place them in boiling water and remove after one minute. This will clean off any extra dirt and kill any kudzu bugs. If you plan to eat the leaves, boiling them will also remove the fine hairs on their surface., Kudzu will keep growing no matter how much you harvest. As long as you are careful about where you pick in order to avoid pesticides, you should be able to harvest as often as you choose as much as you choose. In fact, many people will consider it a public service."
"
Keep it away from your land.,
Build mulch barriers.,
Practice caution when applying herbicide.,
Smother it.,
Let animals feed on it.",How to Harvest Kudzu3," Once kudzu gets going it is very hard to stop and remove. Instead, it is best to watch out for the boundaries of your land and kill any kudzu that crosses over. Some people build a stone wall, but you’ll still need to pull the vines down.Be aware that kudzu seeds can also spread deep in the ground.

, Instead of chopping down vines, which can make the kudzu spread even more, erect natural barriers instead. Pile grass clippings or wood pieces around the perimeter of the land. Reinforce these barriers as often as possible to prevent encroachment., If you try to kill kudzu with chemicals, you will likely fail. Kudzu has shown itself to be very resistant to plant and weed killers. Do not apply any herbicides to kudzu that you plan to harvest for consumption.

, As with most plants, kudzu does require light and oxygen in order to survive and grow. Try to kill off the kudzu by robbing it of these things by covering it up. Smother it by placing a blanket of grass clippings over the base roots. Get a tarp or plastic sheet and cover the entire kudzu plant., Bring some goats into the area and let them free graze. They are capable of eating vast amounts of kudzu shoots, significantly lessening new growth. Goats are also very capable of navigating the rough terrain that kudzu often grows in."

Harvest the lavender before it's fully in bloom.,
Cut matured lavender flowers just above the leaves.,
Gather the lavender into a bunch.,
Tie the stems with a rubber band.,
Find a dark place to dry the lavender.,
Hang the lavender bunch upside down.,
Let the lavender dry for 2 - 4 weeks.",How to Dry Lavender1," Cut the lavender at the base of the stem when the buds are just opening. This will ensure that the dried lavender will retain a strong floral scent and remain it's bright purple color., Aim to get the longest stem possible on the flower. In harvesting lavender you are also pruning the plant, which helps it grow strong throughout the winter., Once you've harvested a good handful, gather it into a bunch. Tap the bottoms of the stems against your palm to line them up neatly.

, Wind the rubber bands toward the base of the stems. Keep winding until the stems are tightly secured, but not crushed.Using a rubber band instead of string or ribbon will ensure that the stems won't slip from the tie as they shrink during the drying process.

, Drying lavender slowly in the dark is the best way to preserve its color, since the sun will fade the purple flowers. Look for a dry, dark place that doesn't get much sunlight, such as your shed, garage, or a shaded place under your eaves.

, Loop a strand of the rubber band over a hook or nail. You can also tie a string from the rubber band to a hook or rack to hang the lavender.

, Check every so often to see when the lavender is dry. When you brush the flowers, they should fall easily from the stems. You can leave the flowers on the stems or brush them off to use in sachets or for baking.

Harvest the lavender.,
Lay the lavender on a block of wood.,
Place the lavender in a sunny spot.,
Allow the sun to completely dry the lavender.",How to Dry Lavender2," Harvest lavender just before the buds open. Cut at the base of the stems to preserve as much stem as possible.

, A cutting board or another large piece of wood is perfect for drying lavender in the sun. If you use a metal tray, the lavender will get too hot; if you use plastic, you might have a melted mess on your hands.

, Move the cutting board or wood block to a place that gets plenty of sun, either indoors or outdoors. Drying lavender this way is a much quicker process than drying it in the dark, but be prepared for the sun to fade the lavender to a very pale purple color.


If you live in an area that gets a lot of rain, either dry the lavender inside near a sunny window or be ready to move it inside when the clouds threaten to break.

, It should take under a week for the hot sun to dry the lavender. Check every few days to see whether the lavender is dry. When it's ready, the flowers should crumble easily from the stems.

Wait four to eight weeks (or more depending on the humidity and light conditions) you will have completely dry catnip!",How to Dry Fresh Grown Catnip," Is it winter? Simply buy seeds. It is very important to note that if you are picking wild catnip, be certain it has not been treated with chemicals as this could be deadly for you and your cats! Do not pick catnip that is growing near a road.;
, Be aware that you will want to cut more than you think you need, because the plant is going to dry up and shrink.


Wait till the plant is at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) before cutting it.

,, Stick a tack to the inside of the door, and tie your catnip around it.


Keep in mind that the plant must be hanging upside down and the door must be closed most of the time for the herbs to dry properly. The catnip will lose potency if exposed to light.

To ensure that the vegetables stay fresh for as long as possible, choose vegetables that are just barely ripe or slightly unripe. Steer clear of overripe vegetables which may go bad even when frozen.


Harvest your vegetables early in the morning and begin the freezing process immediately for best results.;
, If you do use damaged garden vegetables, remove these damaged spots before beginning the process.

, Even if the garden they came from is organic and free of potentially harmful pesticides, they will still be covered in dirt and bacteria. If necessary, use a potato brush to gently scrub away any stuck-on grime.

, Remove any non-edible parts and chop the vegetables into your preferred size for eventual serving.

Pick off each insect from your plant or work the insect loose from your plant by using tweezers or your hands and collecting the scales in a towel or paper towel to carry them away for disposal.,
Dab each insect using a cotton ball or swab that has been soaked in alcohol if your plant only has a light infestation.

,
Use an insecticide spray or create your own spray using mild dish soap.,
Prune heavily-infested plants to reduce the picking off or scrubbing that you need to do.,
Consider the use of horticultural oil or neem oil to remove scales on your plant.

",How to Control Scale Insects on Indoor Plants," This works best on plants with large leaves.;
,, Results are generally only seen, though, after at least 1 month of regular application either by spraying on the mixture or wiping it on with a soft cloth. Make sure that any insecticide you use has a container labeled for inside plant use only.

, Optionally, put what you have trimmed off the plant into a plastic bag before you walk through your home to put it in a disposal bin.

,, This technique is referred to as integrated pest management (IPM), and all you have to do is put the predator insect directly on your plant. Once the scales have all be eaten off, the predator insect will die from lack of food.

Lower the vegetables into the water.,
Cover the pot with a lid.,
Remove the vegetables from the pot and immediately transfer them to a large container of ice water.,
Drain your vegetables completely.

",How to Freeze Garden Vegetables2," A blancher pot, which holds 6 to 8 quarts (6 to 8 quarts) of water and contains a perforated basket for holding food, works best, but any large pot that comes with a lid will also work.

, The water should reach a full rolling boil before you add the vegetables.

, A wire-mesh strainer or cheesecloth bag may also work.

, Make sure that they are completely immersed.

, Boil your vegetables for as long as necessary according to expert recommended boiling times. These times do vary. For instance, asparagus must boil for four minutes, while cut corn needs to water blanch for five minutes.

, By shocking the vegetables with ice water, you halt the cooking process and preserve the color of the vegetables. Keep the vegetables in the cold water for the same amount of time you kept them in boiling water.


The water must be 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius) or lower.
Use approximately 1 pint (500 milliliters) of water for each pound (450 grams) of vegetables.

Set the steaming basket on the rack inside the pot.,
Once the recommended blanching time has passed, remove the vegetables from the pot.,
Drain your vegetables completely.",How to Freeze Garden Vegetables3," You need a pot that has a lid and fits an interior rack. The rack must be positioned 3 inches (7.62) or more above the bottom of the pot.

, Do not pile the vegetables, since the steam needs to be evenly distributed.


Select a garden vegetable that does well with the steam blanching method. Asparagus, broccoli, and chili peppers are among the best options. These vegetables benefit from slow steam blanching because this method allows them to retain more of their water-soluble vitamins, which might otherwise be lost by using standard water blanching.

, Cover the pot and continue heating for as long as necessary according to expert recommendations for each vegetable.

, Shock them by transferring the vegetables to a large bowl or pot of ice water. Allow the vegetables to sit in the icy water for the same amount of time they sat in the steam, using 1 pint (500 milliliters) water for every 1 pound (450 grams) of vegetables.


Keep the water at a minimum of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius), if not lower.

, Wait until the vegetables are firm before removing the tray.

, You must leave an appropriate amount of empty space to allow the food a chance to expand as it freezes. Otherwise, you risk breaking the container.


For container freezing, leave a 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) space between the top of the top of the vegetables and the rim of the container.
When freezing in a plastic bag, leave a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) space between the top of the vegetables and the top of the bag. Seal the bag and tie it shut with a rubber band placed 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) above the top of the food.
Some garden vegetables, like green beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, onions, peas, peppers, and turnips, do not need to be tray frozen before being packed. For these vegetables, tightly pack the blanched, drained vegetables into containers and follow the same guidelines regarding empty space.

, Write down the contents of the package and the date the food was first frozen.

, For best results, only pack 2 to 3 pounds (900 to 1350 grams) of vegetables for each cubic foot. If the vegetables are packed any tighter than that, they may take too long to freeze.

, The majority of garden vegetables will retain their freshness, taste, and nutritional value for a year or longer if kept at this temperature.

, Mealybugs thrive in a nitrogen-rich soil, so be careful that you only feed your plants when necessary.

, Immediately wash out rags. If you are using paper towels, place used towels in a plastic sack and discard.


Remember to look for eggs sacks and remove those as well. The egg sacks will look like small cotton balls attached to the plant.

,,, These sprays will suffocate or dry out the mealybugs and kill them. However, it is very difficult to get the egg sacks and crawlies that have gone into places where the spray cannot reach.


Spray a mealybug-specific pesticide onto the plant to get immediate results on mealybug control. Pesticide sprays, however, are only a short-term solution for mealybug control and should not be used as the only method of controlling the infestation.

, Sometimes it may be virtually impossible to get a mealybug infestation under control, and the best course of action may be to replace the plant with one that is not infected.

Search for milkweed populations in your area.,
Identify the plant positively as common milkweed.,
Use a knife or your hands to break off shoots.,
Take the shoots home.,
Rub off the fuzz and wash the shoots.,
Boil enough water in a pot to cover the shoots, then add the shoots in.,
Cook for about twenty minutes, checking occasionally for tenderness.

,
Taste-test.,
Season to your liking and serve.

",How to Harvest and Prepare Common Milkweed Shoots," The common milkweed usually grows in full sun, in waste places, fields, or hedgerows. Poke milkweed is also considered an acceptable edible milkweed.


Never take plants that grow near areas where pesticides are used heavily (for example, farms), urban areas, polluted water sources, or closer than 150 feet (45.7 m) from roads. These plants may have absorbed toxins from their environment that could make you sick. It's best to forage in wilderness areas, such as forests and meadows untouched by human advancement. In cities where green spaces are encouraged however, the milkweed may be perfectly fine to consume; you know your own locale, so trust that knowledge.;
, Research other milkweed varieties or lookalikes in your area, as other species of milkweed can be very bitter.


Two common lookalikes are dogbane and butterlfy-weed, both of which are toxic.
If the shoots you believe to be milkweed have stems covered with fuzz and ooze white sap when broken, it is not dogbane or butterfly-weed.
If you can't positively identify the shoots as milkweed, wait until they're fully grown and take notes of the areas where milkweed can be found. Try again next spring.

, Choose shoots that are less than 14in tall and do not have fully formed leaves.


Don't decimate the entire milkweed population in the area you're harvesting from. Pick a few shoots from several different patches of milkweed to lessen your impact on the ecosystem.

, Common milkweed is mildly toxic raw, so nibbling on uncooked shoots might give you a stomachache.

, Cut them into smaller pieces if you like.

, Alternatively, add to a soup to cook with other vegetables.


Alternatively, you can roast them.

,, Some foraging guides recommend changing the water to leach out bitter compounds in the shoots, but this unnecessary.

Know the signs of a cutworm infestation.,
Pick cutworms off your plants at night.,
Make plant collars.,
Install the collars around the plant stems.,
Bolster the plants' stems.",How to Control Cutworms1," You won't see cutworms during the day, since they feed at night. Most gardeners don't know they have a cutworm problem until they see evidence in the morning after a night of feasting has occurred. By then, there's no telling how many worms are in the garden. Catching the population before it explodes will help save your garden. Here's what to look for:


Plants cut off near the base of their stems.
Plants that are wilting or damaged.
Cutworm droppings.
Cutworms themselves, which you can find by overturning the soil with your hands in the vicinity of the damage.They can be many different colors, including grey, brown, pink, black, and so on. Some are spotted, some have stripes, and some have no markings.;
, Go out at night with a flashlight and pick them off your plants, one by one. Place them in a pail of soapy water to drown and then discard them. Repeat this every few nights until you notice the cutworm population declining. Keep checking throughout the summer for more cutworms.

, Cutworms like to feast on plants by chewing through the stems, essentially decapitating your precious vegetable garden. If you place barriers around the stems, the cutworms have a much more difficult time accessing the stems. Cut 4-inch pieces of cardboard, plastic, or another firm material cut in the shape of a tube to serve as collars for your plants. You could also use cardboard tubes or metal cans with the ends removed.


The downside to collaring is that every single stem will need its own collar to keep the cutworms away. If you have a large garden with hundreds of plants, you may need to combine this method with others so you don't spend your whole summer fashioning little plant collars.

, Push them into the soil about an inch deep, so the collars stand about 3 inches (7.6 cm) high. The cutworms won't be able to climb the surface of the cardboard and metal or scoot in underneath the bottom. If you cut out the collars from cardboard or plastic, make sure the seam is securely taped so that there's no gap for cutworms to crawl in.

, To further protect the plants, you can bolster the stems to prevent cutworms from being about to eat through them. Cut a plastic drinking straw to the appropriate lengths. Then, cut a slit in each piece lengthwise and slip the straws over the plant stems. Poke the ends beneath the surface of the soil.


Alternatively, you can wrap each stem with a piece of cardboard, thick paper or aluminum foil, taking care to push the sleeve below the soil.

Apply Bacillus thuringiensis in your garden.,
Try diatomaceous earth.,
Use cornmeal.,
Make a molasses treatment.",How to Control Cutworms2," This is a bacterium that is known to kill cutworms, and it's widely available in garden supply stores. It's a natural way to get rid of cutworms without causing harm to plants or animals. Apply it to the soil in the affected area.


This bacterium harms other types of moths and butterflies, so if you don't want to hurt any other types of insects, use a different method.
Spray pesticides in the afternoon for best results against cutworms. Since they feed after dark, you want the pesticide to be freshly applied when they come to dinner. Reapply the pesticide after each rain until the plants are large enough to be safe from the worms.

, This is a natural powder made from ground up fossils that can be sprinkled around the affected area. It isn't harmful to humans, plants or animals, but it kills insects that walk over it by piercing them and causing them dehydrate. Be sure not to apply this to areas where you want to promote a healthy insect population.


Apply the powder around the base of any plants where you suspect cutworm activity. You can apply with a bulb applicator to avoid getting it in your eyes or inhaling it, as this may cause irritation.
Try ground up eggshells or coffee grounds as an alternative.

, Cutworms love to eat cornmeal, but it hurts their digestive system. Many will overeat it to the point of killing themselves. Sprinkle some in the affected area of your garden. Just don't overdo it, or you may draw other pests., If you mix molasses with sawdust and wheat bran, you'll create a thick paste that can be painted in circles around the plants in the area where cutworms hang out. When they crawl over the molasses mixture, it will get stuck to their bodies and prevent them from ruining your plants."
"
Delay planting your garden for a couple of weeks if possible.,
Keep your garden neat.,
Clean up your garden after harvest.,
Make your garden hospitable to cutworm predators.",How to Control Cutworms3," After the initial eating frenzy in early spring, the number of cutworm larvae and the extent of the damage from them generally decrease.


Consider planting a perennial flower garden. Plant it around the outside of your vegetable garden as a form of cutworm prevention. Unlike weeds and tall grasses, the flowers die off in the fall when the adults are looking for places to lay eggs.
Till the soil in the spring before planting to expose and kill larvae that wintered over in the soil.

, Remove weeds from your garden and from the areas around your garden to cut back on places where moths can lay eggs. This also removes some food that keeps cutworms alive. Keep the grass around the garden cut short.

, Remove all plant debris from the garden after harvest to discourage adult moths from laying eggs. Till the soil again in the fall to expose larvae and decrease the number that survive winter hibernation.


If you can, consider allowing chickens to graze in your garden after tilling. They will eat any cutworms present in the soil.

, Keeping your yard animal-friendly is a great way to control cutworms, since birds and many other animals love to eat them. Encourage the following animals to enjoy cutworms in your garden:


Toads
Moles
Fireflies
Blackbirds
Meadowlarks

Take a preventative approach to grassy weed control.,
Maintain your yard so that it is up to date with all of the necessary treatments.,
After regular ongoing yard maintenance, apply a pre-emergent weed control treatment to your lawn.,
Identify which grassy weed is causing the issues in your yard.,
If all the above fails and weeds have already started attacking your yard, use a grassy weed control application.,
If you don't want to use chemicals but don't mind manual work, you can also try removing the weeds by pulling them out.,
Apply additional (and regular) yard care and weed control treatments to prevent the grassy weeds from coming back.",How to Control Grassy Weeds," Most often the best defense against weeds is to make sure that your lawn is healthy and strong enough to ward of the weeds before they even surface. This includes ensuring that you are using the correct types of seeds when planting parts of the lawn.;
, For example, check to make sure that you are fertilizing and watering regularly and properly. Read the instructions for fertilizing the type of lawn you have and mark dates for addition of fertilizer on your calendar.

, This will help prevent any weeds from sprouting out before they surface.

, Being able to identify the source of the problem will help determine the most effective treatments. Make sure you understand what the issue is before you try treating it, so that you can target the treatment of the grass to its type. Typical grassy weeds that you might come across in a lawn include:Grassy winter annual weeds: Annual bluegrass (Poa annua)

Grassy summer annual weeds:






Crabgrass (Digitaria)
Goosegrass
Japanese stilt grass (Microstegium vimineum)



Grassy perennial weed/sedges (sedges are not grassy weeds but may end up in the lawn as well):

Bermuda grass or wiregrass (Cynodon dactylon)
Dallisgrass (Papsalum)
Nimblewill (Muhlenbergia schreberi)
Orchardgrass (Dactylis)
Quackgrass (Elymus repens); and
Yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus).



, There are two types of chemical weed control––one for pre-emergent weeds and one for post-emergent weeds.Ask for advice at your local hardware store, based on the identification of the weeds in your yard.

, Be careful to make sure you are removing the entire weed if you decide to pull it out, getting all of the root as well.


If hand pulling, do so before the seeds emerge, to ensure that the plant is not more widely distributed as you carry it about while clearing.

, It is only with persistent and consistent care that you can keep grassy weeds at bay. It will only take a season of not caring for the yard for the weeds to re-invade the area, so if you're not able to undertake maintenance when needed, get in someone who can do it for you.

Determine the number of earworms per row foot.",How to Control Corn Ear Worms1," Some growers use pheromone traps to monitor the population. If your traps catch 20 to 30 moths a night for 3 to 5 nights in a row, begin your weekly checks.


Check high-risk areas first if you are a high-volume grower. Check late-planted corn, fields that are flowering or have young pots, and those growing on elevated areas of the land. Corn grown on elevated areas or knolls is more vulnerable to egg laying.;
, They lay eggs on the silk attached to the husks, which gives larvae easy access to the ears.

, If you are growing several acres of corn, take at least 1 sample per 4 acres. If you are simply checking a home garden, only 1 sample is necessary.

, A 3-foot-long cloth allows you to sample 6 row feet if you check the plants on both sides.

,, Check the sheet to see how many worms are on it are at least 3/8-inches long. Worms smaller than that can not do plant damage and may not survive long enough to be a problem.

, If you used a 6-foot-row sample, you would divide the number of worms by 6. Your tolerance threshold is determined by row foot count and varies with the specific crop and the percentage of it under attack.


If you are growing a small amount of corn for your own consumption even one per plant may be too many. Many large production growers usually have a higher threshold.

"
"
Choose a variety of corn that is known for being more resistant to earworm damage.,
Time the planting of your corn to minimize earworm damage.,
Avoid over-use of pesticides, which also kill off beneficial insects that help keep the earworm population under control.

,
Encourage or purchase lady bugs, damsel bugs, lacewings and minute pirate bugs, which feed on the eggs and small larva of corn earworms.,
Spray insecticides to control the earworms only if necessary and only when it is most effective.",How to Control Corn Ear Worms2," Those that have a long, tight-fitting husk withstand attacks better than varieties with loose husks.

, Corn earworm larvae is present all season, but is most abundant in late summer and early fall. Plant your corn crops early so they will be silking before the earworm population has peaked. Corn planted late, silks late, when many more moths are looking for places to lay eggs.

,, Parasitic wasps, which attack the eggs, are also beneficial.

,


The timing of your chemical treatment is very important. Once the larva has gotten inside the corn ears chemical treatment is very difficult. Apply the insecticide when the corn plants are silking if you see a high number of eggs on the silk or if your plant check reveals an unacceptable worm count.

Termidor must not be allowed to enter drains, waterways, streams or rivers because it is highly toxic to humans, fish and aquatic organisms.;
,


Do not use Termidor if rain is expected to occur within 48 hours of application because it may wash away.

,


Residents and their pets must not return to their home for between 3 and 4 hours after the treatment to allow the building to ventilate.

,,,


You may need to make holes or separate the soil to gain a depth between 1.96 and 3.14 inches (50 and 80 millimeters) so the Termidor can penetrate the wood or foundation.
You can also reduce the amount of water you use without reducing the volume of Termidor to minimize the amount of water that runs off the soil.

,


You may need to spray water on these types of soils to guarantee an even distribution of Termidor when you spray it around the house.

,


This will allow you to apply Termidor in places beneath the foundation using rodding equipment, which is special equipment used to inject chemicals into deep soil or similar places that you cannot reach with a spray tank.

,


Wear chemical-resistant clothing that covers your neck and wrists.
Wear a washable hat, a half-facepiece respirator with a combined dust and gas cartridge, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or nitrile gloves that completely cover your arms.

,


All soil should be at least 3.14 inches (80 millimeters) thick before you apply Termidor to allow for sufficient treatment.

,


Fill the spray tank with half the amount of water you need for the area you plan to treat.
Use 2.5 cups (600 milliliters) of Termidor in every 26.4 gallons (100 liters) of water.

, If only one section of the plant is infected, snip it off with garden shears and drop it into a plastic bag or bucket of soapy water.

, Both bugs are natural predators of aphids and can help tame your aphid population. Purchase a ladybug house and commercial ladybug food to lure ladybugs to your garden, or purchase ladybugs from vendors or nurseries. Lacewings can also be lured with the same food or purchased from the save vendors.

, Chickadees and wrens are both especially useful in reducing the aphid population. Put up birdhouses and spread birdseed in your backyard.

, Ants actually protect aphid colonies. Lure them away by placing small containers of honey below an aphid-infested plant. The honey should draw the ants away, exposing the aphids to more natural predators.

, Sticky bands and other ant traps destroy the ants that protect aphids instead of merely drawing them away.

, Mint, fennel, dill, yarrow, clover, and dandelions are known to attract lacewings, ladybugs, and a type of insect actually called the ""aphid predator."" Placing these plants around the plants you wish to protect may draw predators capable of controlling the aphid population.

, Garlic and onion plants are the most effective. The potent smell typically drives away most colonies of aphids.

, Grow plants that attract aphids, like asters, cosmos, larkspur, dahlias, and zinnias, but plant them away from the plants you want to protect. The aphids will be drawn to these plants and will stay away from less appetizing plants as a result.

, They find aphids great meals for them. Purchase a praying mantis or a praying mantis habitat."

, Most horticultural oils are actually mineral oils, refined to remove impurities. Many vegetable oils also work well, especially cottonseed and soybean oils.

, Use the same types of oil you might use for dormant oil.

, Mix crushed garlic and water together, allowing the water to become infused with the scent of garlic. This smell acts as a deterrent against aphids, driving them away.

, Mix 1 cup of vegetable or white mineral oil with 2 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of bleach-free dish soap. Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spritz it on infected plants to suffocate the aphids. However, do keep the treated plants out of direct sunlight, since the spray could magnify the light and burn the leaves.

, These products cause the aphids' cell membranes to weaken and collapse, ultimately dehydrating them through fluid loss. Sprinkle insecticide powders or spray soaps onto both sides of each leaf on the infected plant.

, Pyrethrins are made from the chrysanthemum, while pyrethroids are their synthetic counter-part. Both products are organic, and both are capable of killing off aphids.

Understand how snakes tend to react.,
Keep calm and keep your distance.,
Stand still if the snake has caught you unawares and you're too close to it.,
Identify the snake if possible.,
If you can identify the snake and you are positive that it is non-venomous, make a decision about whether or not to chase it out of the garden.",How to Chase a Snake out of Your Yard," On the whole, snakes prefer to strike or to slither right away to a safe hiding spot.And generally, snakes do not chase you. Hence, giving them wide berth makes good sense at all times upon discovering a snake, to avoid strike, and to give them the chance to slither off.


Striking distance for most snakes is half the body length of the snake.
Strikes are for protection, not for eating. As such, the bites will be shallow. This means that if you're properly attired, the fangs should sink into a boot, not your foot. However, if you've upset the snake by poking, prodding, or generally getting in its way, it may react by biting more than once, or more deeply.;
, Unless you're one hundred percent sure that the snake is not venomous, getting closer is not advised.

, This is especially important if the snake is hissing, rattling, or staring at you. Be patient and wait for it to back off. A snake has a short attention span and will be more concerned for its safety than worrying about you. Remain still even if the snake slithers over your feel or coils around you; it won't remain for long.

, If you know for sure that the snake is venomous, retreat the moment that you can. Call for professional help immediately and prevent children, pets, and anybody else from going into that area of your garden or yard until the snake has been removed.


If you cannot identify the snake, err on the side of caution and retreat. Call the professional snake remover and keep the kids and pets out of the garden.

, The benefit of a non-venomous snake in the garden is a free pest-catcher. If you'd rather not share your yard with the snake, however, grab a broomstick and shoo it away. Don't touch the snake or harm it in any way–remember that even venomous snakes would prefer the opportunity to slither off than deal with as large a problem as a human.

Avoid disturbing the soil before you begin.,
Remove any debris from the area.,
Mark trees, shrubs, or bushes you intend to remove.,
Weaken weeds with herbicides.,
Wear long-sleeved, protective clothing while clearing underbrush.,
Cut back weeds in a straight row.,
Clear unruly grasses or small plants with a line trimmer.,
Remove or prune your shrubs and bushes.,
Mow your area using the highest setting on your lawn mower.,
Till the soil.,
Conduct a controlled burn.,
Start a compost pile.,
Visit your local dump.,
Rent a wood chipper.,
Contact waste management.",How to Clear Underbrush," Heavy digging can bring weed seeds to the surface and worsen your underbrush problem. Weed seeds can lay dormant for years before growing. Wait until you're ready to work before touching the soil.Wait to till the soil until you have cleared the underbrush, as hoeing weed-prone areas can bring up dormant seeds.;
, Walk around the area you plan to clear with a trash bag, and throw out any trash you find. Use a wheelbarrow to remove large items, like tires, furniture, or tree branches., Using garden tape, tie a marker around plants you wish to remove so you don't cut down useful plants accidentally. Alternatively, you could also mark the plants you intend to keep. Mark whichever option is lower., Apply a broadleaf herbicide (used for many weed species) directly to the weeds, and avoid spraying the herbicide on plants you want to keep. Use herbicide on a sunny, windless day so only the weeds are killed. Plan on using the herbicide at least a week before you clear the underbrush.Remove any toys, clothing, or furniture from the area before you spray.Call poison control if the product is used in ways it wasn't intended for (especially if the herbicide was ingested).If you have large patches of weed growth, attach a herbicide sprayer to your garden hose to apply a large amount of herbicide at once.

, Clearing overgrown plants puts you at-risk of touching poison ivy or oak. Wear clothing that covers your skin from direct plant contact. A long-sleeve shirt, a long pair of pants, work boots, and safety goggles will all keep you protected from dangerous plants.

If clearing underbrush in the summer, work in the morning or evening when temperatures will be lowest.

, Pull weeds in rows to keep organized about what you've already pulled. You can use a weed whacker or you can pull by hand. After you've finished pulling the weeds, rake them up and dispose of them in a trash bag or wheelbarrow.

The best time to pull weeds is after rainfall, when moisture in the soil will make pulling weeds easier., Hold the head of the line trimmer level to trim the grass or plants evenly. If the string breaks, run the trimmer at full speed and bump it against the ground to extend the line. Cut until the grass is even and no longer an obstruction., Locate shrubs or bushes you marked to remove, and cut back the branches and stems in small, manageable sections. Bundle the sections together with twine and dispose of them in a trash bag. When you dig up the roots of the plant, pull it out entirely and haul it out using a wheelbarrow.

Once you've removed the shrub or bush, fill the hole with topsoil.

, Use a lawn mower as a finishing touch on large areas of grass. Mow in rows or columns to avoid missing any spots.Rake the yard to remove grass clippings and dispose of them as yard waste.

As an extra precaution, mow the lawn again the next day on a lower setting. After that, mow the lawn as needed for maintenance.

, Till any areas you want to re-plant with a garden tiller. Start at one end of the area and till in even rows, much like when mowing the lawn. Don't go back over a row or excessively till the area. Excessive tilling can compact the soil and limit its fertility., Stack up any cut brush (such as weeds, grass clippings, or shrubs) in a pile far from flammable objects to prepare it for burning. Burn the underbrush with a propane torch or flamer. Talk with your local fire department about local policies and gain approval for the burn before you start. Obtain a burn permit if necessary.

Practice safety measures around fire to avoid losing control of it.

, Use leaves or grass clippings in a compost pile to seed plants later on. To start composting, construct a compost bin and fill it with layers of carbon-rich and nitrogen rich-materials. Moisten the three layers and use it as needed when planting or gardening.Carbon-rich materials include: straw, leaves, wood chips, dead flowers, or shredded newspapers.
Nitrogen-rich materials include: grass clippings, vegetable peelings, fruit rinds, or animal manure.

, If you own or can rent a truck, load up the back with trash bags of debris and bring them to your local dump. Call the dump beforehand to ask if they accept yard waste materials. Ask them about fees and whether they charge a flat fee or charge by weight., If you removed a lot of shrubs from the area, consider renting a wood chipper to dispose of debris manageably. Typically, gardening maintenance companies rent out wood chippers for a daily fee. Use the resulting wood chips as carbon-rich materials in your compost.

Take extreme caution when using wood chippers, and follow the machine instructions carefully.

, If you have a lot of yard waste, call your local sanitation department and ask how much they charge for pickups. Waste management will take your plant debris and repurpose it as mulch. Typically, sanitation departments limit what they will and won't pick up, so specify what debris you have on the phone.

Alternatively, call a yard waste removal crew who can haul the waste away for a fee.

Earthquake-proof your home.",How to Deal With Being Indoors During an Earthquake," It can be tempting to run outside when an earthquake happens. After all, nothing can fall on you there. However, you likely won't make it outside before things start falling, so it's better to find a safe place inside than to try to make it outside., If possible, take safety precautions before the quake gets worse. This step is most important in the kitchen, where what you're doing could cause issues in an earthquake.The main thing is to make sure to turn off the stove before quickly taking cover, as it could cause a fire if you leave it on.
If you're near a lit candle, try to blow it out if you have time.

, The safest place for you in an earthquake is on your floor. However, don't lie flat on the floor. Instead, get on your hands and knees.This crawling position is the best for two reasons. One, it gives you a chance to move if you need to. Two, it provides you with some protection from falling objects.

, The best place for you in an earthquake is under a table. A table provides protection from falling objects. A desk is also a good option.Try to move away from the kitchen. Also, try to get away from your fireplace, large appliances, glass, and heavy furniture, as any of it can injure you. If you can't get under a table, move to an interior wall, and cover your head.
In a large building, move away from windows and exterior walls if possible. Also, don't get on the elevator. Most modern buildings are built to withstand earthquakes, as they are built to flex. In older buildings, you may be slightly safer on a higher floor, but you shouldn't try to move floors during an earthquake.A doorway isn't the safest place in modern houses, as it isn't any stronger than any other part of the house. In addition, you can still be hit by falling or flying objects in a doorway., Once you've found a good position, stay where you are. Don't move from that position until the earthquake is over. Remember, many earthquakes have aftershocks, too.Make sure to grab onto whatever you're hiding under. It should help provide you with some stability.
If the furniture you are under shifts, stay with it. The earthquake may move it around.

, If you're already in bed, don't try to get up. You are safer there than if you tried to move somewhere else, especially if you are groggy. You could easily be cut by broken glass if you try to roll out of bed.Grab a pillow, and put it over your head. This step can provide some protection from falling objects.
You can also try to cover up with a blanket, which can protect you from glass.

, Whether you are under a piece of furniture or not, try to use something to shield your head and face. For instance, a pillow or couch cushion can provide some protection. However, don't waste time trying to find something if the earthquake is intensifying. Also, don't leave your shelter to find a face shield., Remember that the calmer you are, the more rational decisions you will make. When you are flustered or panicked, you will not be able to make the best decisions for your safety and the safety of others. Sometimes remembering that your calm is critical is the key to staying calm.


You can also try to take deep, calming breaths. For instance, try counting to four as you breathe in, then try counting to four as you breathe out. Deep breathing can help relax you even when the earth is literally shaking around you.

, While it's tempting to light a fire or candle when the electricity is out, doing so can be dangerous after an earthquake. If your gas line has a leak anywhere, you could cause your house to go up in flames with a spark. Instead, reach for a flashlight., Look at yourself and the people around you, checking for major injuries. Major injuries include head injuries, broken bones, or major cuts.If injuries need immediate attention, deal with them first. If they can wait a minute, you may want to check the house first, since a gas leak or electrical damage may pose a threat of more harm.
Provide first aid as needed. For instance, bandage any wounds according to the first aid booklet you have. If you have injuries you can't deal with, you may need to call 911. Keep in mind, though, that emergency services will be overloaded, so try to take care of what you can.

, If parts of the house look damaged, don't hesitate. You may notice walls or floors crumbling, for instance, or cracks forming. If you're not sure whether an area is safe, get out of the house. You don't want to stay in a structure that is unsafe and may come down around you., Walk around the house, looking for issues. The main things you need to look for right now are gas leaks, water leaks, and electrical problems.Make sure you are smelling as you move around the house. Smell is the main way you can tell if there is a gas leak, though you may hear hissing as well. If you smell or hear gas, shut off the main gas valve. You should already know how to do this step if you prepared for the earthquake in method one. Also, open windows, and get out of the house. Call your gas company to tell them about the leak.
Look for electrical problems. If you see any damaged wires or sparks, turn off the electricity.
If you see water leaks, turn off the main water supply. If you're short on water, consider alternative sources, such as melted ice cubes, the water from your hot water heater, and water from canned vegetables and fruits.

, This information will likely be on the radio or television. You need to check if the city's water supply is still safe to drink. In addition, you need to make sure the sewer lines are still intact before you flush a toilet., If anything is spilled in the house that could be hazardous, you need to clean it up quickly. Cleaning supplies, for instance, can become hazardous, especially if they're mixed. Also, clean up any drugs or medicines.Try to wear gloves when cleaning to protect your skin.
Open windows to provide ventilation as needed.

, The roads need to be open for emergency vehicles to get through. Try to stay off the roads as much as possible, as that will allow easy passage for emergency vehicles., If you live in an earthquake-prone area, such as California, make sure you are prepared should an earthquake strike. Having supplies is one way to be prepared, so you'll have exactly what you need on hand should disaster strike.You’ll want to have a fire extinguisher, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, and extra batteries.
It is also good to have plenty of non-perishable food and bottled water, in case power is out for a while. At a minimum, you should have enough food and water for 3 days on hand.
The CDC recommends keeping 1 gallon of water per person per day. Don't forget to think about your pets, as they will consume food and water, too. Also, check the food and water you store for emergencies at least once a year to use up or throw away food and water that is near or past its expiration date., In an earthquake, injuries can happen. Having a first aid kit on hand can help you deal with minor injuries, especially since emergency rooms will likely be overloaded. You can buy a kit ready-made, or you can gather supplies to make your own.The American Red Cross recommends that you have the following items in your first aid kit: adhesive bandages (25 in various sizes), adhesive cloth tape, absorbent compress dressings (2 5-by-9-inch dressings), 2 roller bandages (1 each 3 inch and 4 inch), sterile gauze pads (5 3-by-3-inch pads and 5 4-by-4-inch pads), and 2 triangular bandages.
You'll also need things like antibiotic ointment, antiseptic, aspirin, cold compresses, a breathing barrier (for CPR), hydrocortisone, non-latex gloves (in case of latex injuries), an oral thermometer, tweezers, a first aid booklet (available from places like the Red Cross store), and an emergency (space) blanket).

, If you, a family member, or friend are injured during an earthquake and can’t get help, you will be grateful that you know how to take care of basic injuries. First aid and CPR classes teach you what to do in an emergency if someone is injured.Learning first aid can teach you how to deal with injuries such as cuts, bruises, head injuries, and even broken bones. CPR helps you learn what to do when someone is choking or not breathing.Check with your local American Red Cross to find first aid classes in your area.

, Though these are common comforts of daily life, during a natural disaster they can be life-threatening. Gas can leak; electricity can spark; and water can become contaminated. After an earthquake, you may need to turn one or all of these off.To turn off the gas, turn the valve a quarter turn, using a wrench. The valve should now be perpendicular with the pipe. If it’s parallel, it means the gas line is open.Some experts recommend keeping the gas line on unless you smell a leak, hear hissing, or notice the gas meter is running up quickly because once you turn it off, you will need to bring in a professional to make sure it is safe to turn it back on.To turn off the electricity, find the circuit box. Turn off all the individual circuits and then turn off the main circuit. The power should remain off until a professional confirms that there are no gas leaks.To turn off the water, find the main valve. Turn the handle clockwise until it is completely closed. You should leave the water off until you know it is safe to turn it back on. Your city should update you on whether the water is safe to drink or not.

, In an earthquake, your water heater can tip or be damaged, causing a huge pool of water. If you can protect that water and keep it from leaking out of the water heater in the first place, you can use it as a source of clean drinking water even if the city water isn't safe. Therefore, it's important to secure your hot water heater before an earthquake hits.Start by checking how much room is between the water heater and the wall. If you see more than an inch or two, you need to add a strip of wood to the wall using lag screws. The strip of wood should go down the length of the water heater, so it can't tip backwards.
Use heavy-gauge metal strapping to secure the water heater to the wall at the top. Start at the wall. Wrap it around the front and then all the way around the heater again. Push it back to the wall. You now have an end on either side to secure to the wall or the wood at the back.
For wood, use lag screws with oversized washers. The screws should be at least 1/4"" by 3"". For concrete, you need 1/4"" expansion bolts instead of screws. You can also by a commercial securing kit that has everything you need.
Add another round of strapping to the bottom, and secure it. It's also important to take out the rigid copper and metal pipping. Instead, use flexible connectors for both the gas and water, which are less likely to break in an earthquake.

, When earthquakes happen, phones can go down. You may not be able to reach your loved ones. Therefore, it's important to decide beforehand where you will meet if one happens.You could say, for instance, that everyone comes home once the earthquake has passed, or that you meet at a nearby safe spot, such as a church.
Also, consider designating a person who's not in the same area as the contact person. For instance, you could designate one of your parents as the contact, so that other out-of-state people have someone to call to hear news. That way, you can deal with the emergency while your family can still hear news about you.

, If you live in an earthquake-prone area, consider moving heavy objects from high shelves and anchoring heaving furniture to the floor. During a quake, these objects can fall or move, injuring you or others in your home.Books, vases, rocks, and other decorative items can fall off high shelves, crashing into people below.
Move them so they are below head-level. Below waist-level is best, where they can do less damage.
Try to attach heavy furniture, cupboards, and appliances to the walls or floor. Attaching objects to the walls or floors keeps them from moving or falling over in an earthquake. You can use nylon stripping or L-brackets to anchor furniture like china hutches or bookcases to the studs in the wall, though stripping will cause less damage to the furniture.You can also use nylon straps or velcro to secure items like televisions to their furniture."

, Do this as quickly as possible but keep your mind totally focused on safety. It is likely you won't be the only person on the road, so keep an eye out for traffic and be aware that some drivers may panic.


As best you can, avoid pulling up under bridges, overpasses, signs, building overhangs, power lines, trees, or any other hazards that might fall onto your car. Avoid parking next to buildings. The car offers very little protection should heavy objects fall on it.
If in a parking lot, exit the car and crouch down low and close to the side of the car to use it as protection - do not get under the car as it will take the impact of any large falling debris such as concrete.

,, Stay calm.

,, See ""Warnings"" below for what to do if a power line has fallen on your car. If you have emergency supplies inside your car, find them. The ideal items to keep in a car are listed under ""Things You'll Need"" below. Assess the damage to your car and in the immediate vicinity to see whether it is safe to proceed.


Check to see that the passengers are all right. Expect some shock or panic and do your best to reassure such persons.
Attend to any injuries using first aid.
The fire department and other emergency services will be dealing with their own issues. You, and those around you, need to work together. DO NOT phone 911 and needlessly overload circuits.

, Provided it is safe, rendezvous wherever it is safest and most convenient to do so. Remember that it may be safer to stay where you are, especially if there is chaos on the roads. Use your phone to call people and let them know you're alright. However, remember cell phone towers may be damaged. Listen to the local radio station for warnings and updates as you drive or walk.


Do not ever drive through flood waters.
Do not drive over large cracks in the road. You risk becoming stuck.
Do not drive under bridges that have cracks and other visible structural damage. Even without visible damage, be wary of all overhanging objects, bridges, signs, walls, and overpasses.
Be wary of the potential for landslides onto the road.
If you're driving along a coastal road in an area known as a potential tsunami zone, drive to higher ground as quickly as possible.

, The main quake will be followed by aftershocks which can easily dislodge damaged buildings and other structures that haven't already fallen apart.

"
"
Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle.,
Stay seated in your car and wait until the earthquake is over.,
Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped.,
Wait for city or municipal relief efforts.",How to Survive an Earthquake1," Avoid stopping near, or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. They can fall onto your vehicle.,


Stay calm, metal will protect you and your family from most debris and falling objects.
The only exception to this is when you are in a garage or multi-level parking lot. When you are in a garage, get out of the car immediately, and crouch down next to the car. The metal will not protect you from the concrete that will fall on it. If you are in a multi-level parking garage, survival mainly comes down to luck. The best way to maximize your chances of survival is to do what you do in a garage - crouch next to the car.
Do not try to rush back to your home. Most major earthquakes have aftershocks, which should not be underestimated.

Aftershocks have the power to bring down buildings that were damaged in the main quake.
Aftershocks can range from very slight, to the power of the original earthquake itself. These secondary quakes can last for about ten seconds or longer and can be life-threatening. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing when they will happen, so there is no choice but to stay alert.



, Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.

, You shouldn't have to wait in your car for very long for relief efforts to arrive with food, water, and supplies.

"
"
Steady yourself.,
Drop, cover, and hold.,
Cover your head and neck.,
Do not move.,
Slowly and carefully leave the building.,
Inspect your house for anything that might be in a dangerous condition.,
Check for damage around your building.,
Open your cabinets cautiously.",How to Survive an Earthquake2," Hold onto a solid object or get to the floor so that you do not fall. Try to hide under a piece of furniture.

, This is the national standard for earthquake safety in the United States. The alternate advice is to get next to a sturdy piece of furniture so that if a wall falls, it will create a crawl space in which you can survive. This ""triangle of life"" method, however, is inconsistent with earthquake research and not recommended by the American Red Cross, Structural Engineers Association of Northern California, and Earthquake Country Alliance.

, Use your hands and arms to protect these vital areas from falling objects


Your upper body should also be covered because that is what is holding your neck which is holding your head.
If you have any respiratory disease, make sure that you cover your head with a t-shirt or bandana, until all the debris and dust has settled. Inhaled dirty air is not good for your lungs.

, If it is safe to do so, stay where you are for a minute or two, until you are sure the shaking has stopped.


Remember, aftershocks are possible at any time, and are likely after a big earthquake. Aftershocks can range from being felt by only a few people to knocking down entire cities. They can collapse weakened buildings, especially fragile structures like mobile homes.

, As in the case of fire, it is suggested that you and your family meet in an earthquake-safe location previously designated by your family, such as a nearby baseball diamond or park. Government help should be on the way soon.

, Glass fragments, the smell of gas, or damaged electrical appliances are examples of hazards.


Do not turn electrical devices on or off. Simply switching a light switch could create a spark, which in turn could electrocute you and start a fire. These fires can be more deadly because they are near electrical cords.

, You should check your house or the building you are in for fires or other forms of damage. If you need water to put out a fire, you can get some from a water heater, but be careful, as the water is hot. After you've dealt with any fires, run through the checklist below:


Stay away from structurally damaged areas. Wait until a police officer, a plumber, a firefighter, or relief worker inspects the area and pronounces it safe to enter.
Clean up dangerous spills. Gasoline can be fatal if it explodes or ignites. If you only have paper towels, use several layers of them because gasoline is poisonous and is very hard to wash off. Covering gasoline spills with some shovelfuls of sand is a good idea, but remember to mark the area by placing a sign that says 'Gasoline spill here'.
Do not drink water from the sink since it may be contaminated. The sewage will be damaged in major earthquakes, so do not flush the toilet. Instead, shut off the water system from the main valve (have a plumber do this job for you if you don't know where the main valve is). Make sure that you plug up drains from sinks and bathtubs to prevent any sewage back-flow.
Inspect the chimney for any damage before using your fireplace. Invisible damage in these places can lead to fire.
Inspect utilities.

Check for gas leaks. If you smell gas or hear blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from your cell phone or from a neighbour's home. Remember, if you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.
Look for electrical system damage. If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.
Check for sewage and water line damage. If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water from bottled water or by melting and boiling ice cubes.



, Items inside may fall on you if you open the doors quickly. As you inspect the damage, use caution with glass bottles, which may be cracked and leaking. Use extra caution with alcohol, acids, cleaners, or anything that is toxic to the human body.

"
"
Stay where you are, unless you are somewhere unsafe.,
Move away from buildings, street lights, power lines, and anything else that could fall.,
Seek shelter near a hill or in a wide open area.,
Stay away from buildings, power lines, or anything large or heavy that can fall on you.,
Use caution when you decide to come out of your shelter.,
Wait a moment or two after the first quake before moving to any other place.",How to Survive an Earthquake3," Observe your surroundings, especially if you are in an urban area. Keep in mind that even earthquake-proof buildings have a chance of falling, so don't assume you are completely safe. Don't attempt to run or drive away from an earthquake - this only increases your risk of injury.

, Also make sure you are not near an open fault or sinkhole. People have died after falling into large holes which suddenly appeared at the time of the earthquake. These can appear anywhere, including on roads or in parks.

, If you are near objects that could fall on you, head somewhere without overhead hazards. If you can, seek shelter in a place where you are protected from the weather, but make sure that you're not somewhere where rock and soil can fall on you when aftershocks occur. Do not seek shelter under a bridge, even a sturdy one. Some bridges can be earthquake-proof, but not completely safe as objects like signs or lights can still fall on to you.

, Also, as in a blizzard, do not walk near power lines, fallen streetlamps, or rubble.


Beware of broken glass, as even a small piece can injure your foot. Wear heavy shoes to protect your feet.

, It is likely that there are other people near to you or near to your area. Things like a cell phone are handy for everyone, because if one person is injured, another can dial 911 for an ambulance.

, It is best to do this because aftershocks right after an earthquake are usually the strongest. If you eventually leave, observe the safety rules above and take care that debris does not fall on you.

Set a bucket under a tunnel.,
Cave in the sides of the tunnel way.,
Cover the dug out hole.,
Catch the mole in the bucket.,
Contact animal services.",How to Catch Moles1," You can spot a molehill by finding fresh piles of dirt around your property. The tunnels will extend out from the molehill, so feel around the grassy area surrounding the molehill for spots that are softer to the touch or step. When you find a path of a tunnel, dig a deep hole going through, and underneath the tunnel.Dig deep enough under the tunnel to place a 2 to 5 gallon (7.6 to 19 liter) bucket under the tunnel runway., Pack soil around the bucket, and block the mole runways on each side of the bucket.This will cause the mole to continue digging and fall into the bucket as they break through the packed dirt.

, Cover the top of the dug out portion of the tunnel with sod or a large board to prevent sunlight from shining through to the tunnel.This will give the mole the sense that he is still digging underground even though the top of the tunnel has been disturbed and dug up.

, Remove the plywood or sod and check the hole every day to see if the mole has fallen into the bucket. If the mole has fallen into the bucket, you have successfully caught the mole., Contact your local animal services agency for advice on where to release the moles you catch. You may be able to release the moles in a forested area far from your property, but there may be lawful restraints on relocating a pest to another’s property without permission. It may also be inhumane to release a mole that has experienced severe stress from being captured alive, especially if the mole has a low chance of survival upon being released.When in doubt, contact local animal services, and they will likely have the best disposal alternative.

Maintaining your seawall.",How to Build a Seawall," Walk along the area where you intend to build your seawall, carrying a tape measure, notepad, and pen. Use the tape measure to track the length you need to achieve. Use the pad and pen to sketch a rough outline of your shore, taking special note of any changes in elevation or sharp curves. Finally, use spray paint to mark off 8' (2.43m) intervals where you will place your poles., Once you know the exact location of your seawall, you can use existing rocks, posts, or other landmarks to track the height of the water. You must measure the high water mark for at least one month, during the highest tide of the day. This data will determine how high your seawall needs to be. The wall described here will be 2' (60.96cm) above ground.

, Depending on the body of water you are building on, as well as the county, state, and/or country you find yourself in, there may be regulations governing what you can build. In some cases, you may need to obtain a permit, or have the area inspected before you can begin. Contact your local town, city, or county offices to determine the rules for building a seawall in your area. If necessary, obtain the proper permits., To build this seawall, you are going to need some supplies, as well as some heavy machinery. The exact amounts you need will vary depending on the length of your seawall. All supplies can be purchased at a home improvement store. Look for a heavy machinery rental location near you. You will need:


Metal pipes, 4’ long (1.21m), 3” (7.62cm) diameter, one every 8’ (2.43m)
2 x 12” (5.08 x 2.54cm) treated lumber, 10’ long (3.04m), 2 boards between each set of poles
Threaded rebar, 4 - 10” (25.4cm) pieces per metal pipe
Quick-drying concrete
Galvanized nuts and washers, 8 sets per metal pipe
Circular saw
Drill
Jackhammer

, To begin, you are going to need to weld 4 pieces of U-shaped rebar onto each of your metal pipes (with the pipe fitting in to the “U”). You can weld these yourself, or take them to a shop.The first piece of rebar should be 4” (10.16cm) from the top of the pipe.
The second piece should 4” (10.16cm) below that.
The third should be 8” (20.32cm) below.
The fourth should be 4” (10.16cm) inches below.

, Digging the holes can be the most challenging part depending on the material you will be digging into. Each hole needs to be at least 2’ (60.96) deep and 10” (25.4cm) wide. Use a jackhammer to dig one hole for each metal post.If you do not have experience using a jackhammer, it is best to hire someone to help you.

, Position each of your poles into the holes that have been dug for them. Using a level, try to make sure that your posts are even and uniform with one another. Use your jackhammer to adjust the depth of the holes, if need be., Once your poles are properly positioned, pour enough quick-drying cement to completely fill each hole. Allow 24 hours for the concrete to set.If your holes are filled with water, you will need to use a sub-pump (or simply a bucket) to remove the water before adding concrete.

, Now you will measure and cut your boards. Your wooden boards are 10’ (3.04m) long. You will 2 of these to fill each (approximately) 2 x 8’ (60.96 x 243.8cm) space between each set of poles.You metal poles are all 4’ (1.21m) long, with half of each buried in the ground.
It will require 2 - 2’ x12” (5.08 x 2.54cm) boards to fill this space.
Use a circular saw to cut these boards (originally 10’/3.04m long) to the proper length (approximately 8’/2.43m).
Even though you set your poles 8’ (2.43m) apart, it is important to measure each space and each board individually before cutting.
Changes in the shoreline can cause discrepancies.

, Now you will line up each board with each set of poles and mark the locations where you will drill holes for the rebar to pass through. Each board will have 2 holes drilled on either side. Once again, be sure to specifically measure each board to each piece of rebar before you drill.

, Fit the boards onto the poles by sliding each piece of rebar into the hole that has been drilled for it. This is not so easy, and will require at least 2 people. Install your lumber so that it is flush with the post. Then twist a nut and washer onto each piece of rebar to secure it.You may need to bend or reposition the rebar in order to make it fit through the holes in your lumber.
You can accomplish this by sliding a 2-foot piece of hollow conduit over each piece of rebar, using it to bend the rebar to fit.
At the end of the project, you may want to remove excess rebar with a reciprocating saw.

, Fill in the land side of your seawall with rocks and large gravel, to allow for adequate drainage. Cover these rocks with sand, and finally finish with a layer of topsoil., It is an excellent idea to provide annual maintenance to your existing seawall. Look for broken, cracked, or rotten boards. Remove the nuts, remove the boards, and replace them with fresh wood. Your metal posts should remain in tact for 5 or more years. If they become loose, they may need to be replaced as well.

Have emergency supplies stockpiled.,
Have a survival plan for your home.,
Learn first aid and CPR.,
Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity and the gas.,
Keep dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves.",How to Survive an Earthquake4," In the event of an emergency, many services like electricity and water that are often taken for granted may become unavailable. To ensure your survival, have clean food, water, and supplies ready to go at a moment's notice. Make sure that every member of your family knows where to locate these supplies in case they need to be grabbed quickly. In addition to sterile food and water, you will want to include the following in your emergency supplies:


Torch/Flashlight
First aid kit
Money
Simple clothing
Blankets

, You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety at a moment's notice. Every member of the house should know exactly what to do and where to go when an earthquake hits. They should know the 'safe' spots in your house - under sturdy tables and against interior walls, especially in corners. They should also know the 'danger' spots in the house - near windows and hanging objects, e.g. mirrors and paintings.


Conduct practice drills every 6 months or so to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.

, If one of your family members is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a life-saver. Take a basic first-aid course and become CPR-certified so that if the worst happens, you'll be ready to save lives.

, Earthquakes can sever a house's pipes and/or damage electrical lines, creating situations that can easily become deadly. Be ready to turn off your house's utilities after an earthquake to preserve your safety.


When you turn off the gas after an earthquake or during a drill, DO NOT try to relight the gas pilot. This can cause the gas to leak and cause a fire. Call the utility company and ask them to do it for you.

, To minimize the risk of injury or damage in the event of an injury, keep any dangerous possessions, like breakable objects, heavy objects, flammable liquids and hazardous liquids, away from places where they are likely to fall or spill. Keep these things in safe, secure locations away from the designated safe zones in your house.

Find mole tunnels.,
Determine if the tunnel is active.,
Expose a section of a tunnel.,
Set a trap.,
Cover the trap.,
Remove the trap.,
Dispose of the mole.",How to Catch Moles2," Look for a molehill.A molehill will be indicated by fresh piles of dirt around your property. Tunnels will lead away from the molehill, so feel for grass areas extending away from the molehill that are softer to the touch or step. Moles like to dig their tunnels along structures like fences or other barriers, so look around any such structures in your yard to find their tunnels., Step on top of the tunnel to collapse it in one section on both sides. Dirt should be covering the tunnel way. Leave the collapsed tunnel for a day and then check to see if the collapsed dirt has been dug out again.If it has, you know that that tunnel is active.

, Use a gardening tool to carve out a section of the tunnel.Before you place the trap in the exposed section, pack down the dirt at the bottom of the tunnel so the mole can’t dig underneath the trap.You should also loosely cover the tunnel back up with dirt, so the mole will continue to dig through the loose dirt, and get captured by the trap., There are many kinds of mole catching traps out there. Most of the traps vary in the way they capture the mole, but nearly all are lethal. There are scissor jaw traps, harpoon traps, and choker loop traps just to name a few.Read the trap instructions very carefully to figure out the best way to set the device. Change the settings on your chosen trap to make the trigger apparatus really sensitive.Once you know how to open and set the trap, place the trap into the cut out section of tunnel.


For a scissor trap, place the jaws around loosely packed dirt in the middle of the tunnel. Leave the area between the jaws open and clear. The jaws should span across the runway of the tunnel and be pushed into the ground about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down.Cock the trap according to the included instructions.
For a harpoon trap, set and straddle the trap over the runway of the mole tunnel with both legs of the trap pushed down into the ground on each side of the tunnel.Gently push the legs of the trap into the ground, positioning the trigger pan (the square, flat piece of metal) just above the soil.Pull up the setting tee to set the trap.
For a choker loop trap, use a garden tool to dig a hole into the tunnel from the top. Dig the hole a tad deeper than the actual depth of the tunnel, but the same width as the tunnel.Place the loop into the tunnel so it follows the exact direction and angle of the tunnel. Pack the open area of the trap (in front of the loop) firmly with soil, so the mole will continue to dig through the tunnel and get caught in the trap., Cover the trap with some sort of large bucket to protect children and pets from coming near the area.The bucket will also help block out any light which will let the mole continue digging.

, Check on the trap every day to see if you have caught a mole. When the trap has finally been set off and has caught the mole, remove the trap and mole.If you have not caught a mole after two days, try moving your trap to a new area.There are many reasons a trap can fail (changed burrowing habits, too much tunnel disturbance, improperly set trap), but you will have to find out through trial and error, and consider setting your trap in a new location., Grab the mole with a plastic bag around you hand. Turn the bag inside out as you continue to hold onto the mole, and let the mole fall into the inside of the bag.Tie the bag to seal it, and place the mole in with your garbage.

"
"
Find a new tunnel or mound.,
Approach the tunnel or mound.,
Spade the mole out of the ground.,
Contact animal services.",How to Catch Moles3," A new tunnel or mound will most likely have a mole digging through rather frequently. You can spot newer mounds by finding fresh, piles of dirt on your property. Consequently, tunnels will lead away from the mound, so feel for softer grass areas extending away from the mound. Check on the tunnel or mound frequently during the early morning or evening to see if you notice any movement just underneath the surface of the soil.Moles tend to do most of their digging during the early morning and evening, so this is the best time to look out for them.

, Wait and watch the tunnel or mound to see movement as the mole digs through. When you see movements, approach the tunnel or mound very slowly so as not to alert the mole.Be sure you are wearing protective gloves before attempting this method. You will have to handle the mole with your hands, and don’t want the mole to bite you.

, Strike a spade or shovel deep into the ground (about 6 to 8 inches or 15 to 20 centimeters deep) behind the mole.Striking the spade or shovel behind the mole will prevent it from escaping as you try to remove them from the ground. When you have successfully spaded the mole out of the ground, quickly grab the mole with your hands and place it in a bucket for disposal later. Do not let the mole burrow it’s way back into the ground after you have spaded it from the dirt.


This can be a humane way to remove moles from your yard, but it can leave large holes and divots in your grass.However, there’s also the chance that you may accidentally miss the dirt surrounding the mole, and injure the animal., Contact your local animal services agency for advice and instruction on where and how to release your captured moles. As mentioned before, there may be property restrictions along with humane and ethical disposal restrictions that can play a factor in the manner of disposing the moles."
"
Find the active molehill.,
Flood water into the molehill.,
Have a bucket ready to catch any escaping moles.,
Contact animal services.",How to Catch Moles4," Fresh piles of dirt on the side of the mound will indicate an active molehill. The opening in the mound will be the mouth to the tunnels that you flood with water. When you flood the tunnels, dirt will wash back through the tunnels and drive out the moles., Place the tip of your hose into the molehill mouth, and turn on the water. You don’t want the water to run too fast, because you don’t want the tunnels to fill up with water too quickly. You want to trick the mole into thinking that it is going to be flooded out of its tunnels, and have it escape some other way., You will have to be ready at other nearby molehills to grab the moles as they try to escape, and place them in a bucket for later disposal. A bucket provides a safe area to contain the mole and ensure that it doesn’t escape and dig back into your lawn.Be sure to wear protective gloves when handling moles; their sharp teeth can pierce through skin.

, Contact your local animal services agency for advice on where to release the moles you catch. You may be restricted in where you can dispose the mole, and the condition in which you are disposing the mole, so it’s best to receive specific instructions from nearby animal services."

Drop to the ground.,
Take cover.,
Stay inside until it's safe to get out.,
Hold on.,
If you find yourself in bed while an earthquake strikes, stay there.,
Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside.",How to React During an Earthquake1," The drop, cover, and hold on technique is the cousin of the famous ""stop, drop and roll"" for fires. While it's not the only method of protecting yourself indoors during an earthquake, it is the preferred method of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross.Big earthquakes occur without much, if any, warning, so it's recommended that you drop to the floor as soon as it hits. A small earthquake could turn into a big earthquake in a split-second; it's better to be safe than sorry.;
, Get under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture. If possible, stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.



Do not:
Run outside. You're more likely to get injured trying to get out of the building than staying put.Head for a doorway. Hiding under a doorway is a myth.You're safer under a table than you are under a doorway, especially in modern houses.
Run to another room to get under a table or other piece of furniture.



, Researchers have shown that most injuries happen when people try to change the place of hiding or when the place is crowded and everyone has a goal to get outside safe., The ground may be shaking and debris could be falling. Hold on to whatever surface or platform you've gotten under and wait for the shaking to subside. If you were unable to find a surface to hide under, continue to keep your head shielded by your arms and tucked down low.

, Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.


Many injuries are caused when people leave their bed and walk across broken glass with their bare feet., Research suggests that many injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.


Be careful when you do go outside. Walk, do not run, in case of violent aftershocks. Collect yourself in an area without wires, buildings, or crevasses in the earth.
Do not use elevators for egress. The power can go out, causing you to be trapped. Your best bet is to use the stairwell if it's free.

If your injury is serious, call for help using a cell phone or try to get rescuers’ attention., Use a cell phone to call for help if you have one. If you can’t use a phone, try knocking loudly on something nearby until rescuers find you., Look to see if there’s anyone trapped nearby or if someone needs medical attention. If there’s a first-aid kit near you, grab it and use it on minor injuries.If someone is bleeding, apply pressure to the wound and wrap the injury in gauze if you have some.If someone has no pulse, administer CPR.If you encounter someone with substantial medical injuries, seek professional medical assistance., Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock of an earthquake, and they can cause significant damage. Expect aftershocks to occur and prepare to move to a safe location, like an open outdoor space or a structurally sound building.If an aftershock does occur, drop to the ground, cover yourself, and hold on to something until the shaking stops., Try to find a long-sleeve shirt and pants so your body is protected from glass and debris. If you have access to a hard hat, goggles, or a mask, put those on too. If you don't have access to shoes or clothes, walk around debris and fallen objects to avoid hurting yourself., The structure of the building you’re in may have been weakened by the initial earthquake, so you should exit in case of any aftershocks that could cause more damage to the building.If you’re in a high-rise building after an earthquake hits, do not use the elevators to exit. Slowly descend the stairs of the building and exit outside.If you’re in a stadium or theater, exit the building calmly, watching out for any debris that could fall on you., Do not enter any buildings unless they have been deemed safe by authorities. Buildings that look safe could be at risk of collapse if an aftershock occurs, or falling debris inside could seriously injure you. , Avoid standing near buildings or other large objects that could fall on you if an aftershock hits. If you’re near a coast, head for high ground in case a tsunami forms after the earthquake., Find out if they’re alright and what the status of your home is if you're not there. Make a plan and establish a place to meet., If you’re not sure where the nearest shelter is, ask an emergency official nearby or see if a neighbor knows. Do not re-enter your home until you are certain that it is safe., Traffic lights may not be working and there could be fallen debris on the road. Clear the way for any emergency response vehicles you encounter., Follow the instructions of local officials and check in regularly for updates. You can also check social media or cell phone alerts for further information from authorities., If a fire is small enough, put it out using water or a fire extinguisher if you have one available. If you encounter a large fire, contact the fire department or nearby emergency officials immediately.

Prevent a fire from starting by unplugging broken lights and appliances. Don’t light any matches or open flames until you’re certain your home is safe., If you smell gas, immediately turn off the gas valve. The smell could indicate a gas leak, which could cause an explosion or a fire., If there’s damage, immediately turn off the main breaker switch. Keep the power shut off until the electrical wiring is fixed and your home is deemed safe., They’re at high risk of collapsing after an earthquake. Never use your fireplace after an earthquake until it’s been inspected by a professional, and keep out of rooms with brick walls., Find an open outdoor space to go to or make plans to meet up with others. Take an emergency kit with you and leave a note in clear view detailing where you are."

Use the triangle of life method as an alternative to drop, cover, and hold on.,
Find a structure or piece of furniture nearby.,
Huddle in the fetal position next to the structure or piece of furniture.,
Consider this list of what not to do in the event of an earthquake.,
Know that the triangle of life method is unsupported by scientific findings and/or expert consensus.",How to React During an Earthquake2," If you can't find a desk or a table to duck under, you have options. Although this method is disputedby many of the world's leading earthquake safety officials, it could save your life in the event that a building you're in collapses.

, The triangle of life theory is that people who find shelter near, not under, household items such as sofas are often protected by voids or spaces created by a pancake collapse. Theoretically, a collapsing building would fall on top of a sofa or desk, crushing it but leaving a void nearby. Devotees of this theory suggest that sheltering in this void is the safest bet for earthquake survivors.

, Doug Copp, the main proponent and proponent of the triangle of life theory, says that this safety technique is natural for dogs and cats and can work for you, too.

, If you can't find a safe place to duck nearby, cover your head and get into the fetal position wherever you are.



Do not:
Go under a doorway. People under doorways are commonly crushed to death if the door jamb falls under the weight of the earthquake's impact.
Go upstairs to get under a piece of furniture. Stairs and staircases are dangerous places to tread during an earthquake, as they could collapse or break without notice.



, The triangle of life technique is controversial. If you find yourself with several options about how to proceed during an earthquake indoors, attempt the drop, cover, and hold technique.


There are several problems with the triangle of life technique. First, it's difficult to know where triangles of life form, since objects in a quake move up and down as well as laterally.
Second, scientific studies tell us that most deaths in earthquakes are linked to falling debris and objects, not falling structures.The triangle of life is predominantly based on earthquakes that cause structures, not objects, to fall.
Many scientists believe that it's also more likely to sustain injuries trying to move somewhere instead of staying put.The triangle of life theory advocates moving to safe areas over staying put.

Stay outdoors until the shaking stops.,
Stay away from buildings, street lights and utility wires.,
If in a vehicle, stop as quickly as possible and stay in the vehicle.,
If trapped under debris, stay calm and take preventative measures.,
If you are near a big body of water, be prepared to face a possible tsunami.",How to React During an Earthquake3," Don't try to 'heroically' rescue someone or venture indoors. Your best bet is to stay outside, where the risk of collapsing structures is diminished. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits, and alongside exterior walls.

, These are the main risks of being outdoors when an earthquake or one of its aftershocks is in progress.

, Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake., Although it may seem counterintuitive, waiting for help is probably your best bet if you find yourself trapped under immovable debris.


Do not light a match or a lighter. Leaking gas or other flammable chemicals may accidentally light on fire.
Do not move about or kick up dust. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or piece of clothing.
Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.

, A tsunami happens when an earthquake causes an extreme underwater disturbance, sending powerful waves towards shores and human habitation. If there's just been an earthquake and its epicenter is in the ocean, there's a good chance you'll have to be on the lookout for tsunamis.

Look for lip balm with healing properties.,
Treat minor skin abrasions.,
Rub onto dry, chapped lips.,
Use Chapstick as a mild anesthetic.,
Protect your face from the scorching sun.,
Make a mask.",How to Use Chapstick As a Survival Tool1," Lip balm that contains petrolatum is good for locking in moisture, and balm with dimethicone is useful for sealing up dry, cracked lips.Many balm products also include emollients, which help moisturize the skin, provide a protective film, and make dry, itchy skin feel more comfortable., This might include cuts and scrapes, bug bites, and rashes. First, use a clean tissue, cloth, or leaf to clean away any blood or dirt. Then, apply Chapstick thickly to the area. Be sure to thoroughly coat the wound with balm. Then, cover the skin with a clean cloth or leaf.


In a pinch, Chapstick can stop small cuts from bleeding.The waxy substance blocks off the wound and keeps the blood flowing inside your body.
As a wound or rash heals, Chapstick will protect the tender area from dirt and bacteria. This may reduce your risk of infection, especially if you are in an unclean or unfamiliar environment.

, Be sure to use Chapstick liberally and often when you're in constant exposure to the elements. If your lips take too much heat, cold, or wind, they might dry out, crack open, and even bleed.

, Smear lip balm on blisters, foot rot, and other painful (but not life-threatening) maladies. The protective qualities of the balm may have a tingling, mildly-pain-relieving effect on your skin. Do not expect Chapstick to ease any serious pain, and do not treat it as a substitute for real medical attention.


If you have a toothache, try applying lip balm to the gums or to the outer skin of your cheek. This method is not officially recommended, but some survivalists claim that it can ease the pain a bit.

, Apply to a clean, dry face. Use Chapstick like sunscreen. The waxy coating should put a thin, protective layer between your skin and the sun – but it won't last nearly as long as official sunscreen. Be careful to keep it out of your eyes!


Some lip balm actually comes with an SPF rating. Choose one of these products, and it may actually give your skin some serious sun protection.Chapstick may also help temporarily protect your face from wind-chill and frostbite. Apply to your face in cold, windy situations. Do not expect it to protect you from serious cold.

, To reduce glare in bright environments like snow and deserts, try dipping the Chapstick in ash and rubbing it in lines beneath your eyes. Layer the ash-balm combination all over your face to darken your skin and make a simple, camouflaging hunting mask. It functions much like mud, and it is somewhat water-resistant."

Place the can on a stable surface.,
Position the tip of the knife against the inner edge of the lid.,
Lightly smack the back of your hand.,
Scoot the knife over and make a new hole.,
Continue until you've punctured holes around the edge of the can.,
Pry off the lid.",How to Open a Can Without a Can Opener1," A table at hip height is ideal. Stand over the can so you can access it easily.;
, Hold the knife so that is vertical, rather than at an angle. Grip the handle such that your fingers won't be in the way of the blade if it slips. The back of your hand should be facing up.


This method is more effective than attempting to saw the lid off using the blade of your knife. That will ruin your knife and potentially leave metal shavings in your food.
Make sure the knife is completely extended and locked into place, so it won't slip.
This method can also be done with a chisel or another sturdy, thin object similar to a pocket knife.

, Use your second hand to lightly smack the back of the hand that's gripping the knife handle. This gentle smacking motion will cause the tip of the knife to puncture the lid of the can.


Do not smack too hard. You don't want to lose control of the knife.
Smack with your hand open, and connect with your palm. This will help you maintain control.

, Position the tip of the knife a few centimeters over and repeat the technique to puncture the can again.

, Circle the entire lid, as you would with a can opener. The lid should now be loose.

, Slip the tip of the knife into one of the holes. Use it to pry the lid off. Gently pull the lid from the can.


If necessary, use a smaller knife to saw through remaining connected parts of the lid.
Cover your hand with a towel or your sleeve before prying off the lid. This will protect your hand from getting scratched by the lid.

Create a Disaster Preparedness Plan for your house or place of work.,
Practice ""drop, cover and hold on"" until it becomes second nature.,
Learn basic first aid and CPR or make sure there is at least one person in the house knows it.,
Decide on a rallying point for your family for after the earthquake.,
Learn how to turn off the utilities in your house, especially the gas line.,
Write down and share emergency contact lists.,
Try to develop routes and methods for getting home after an earthquake has occurred.",How to Prepare for an Earthquake1," Know what you and your family are going to do before the earthquake happens. Form your plan together and go over it on a regular basis. The most important first step is understanding what to do the moment an earthquake hits.This plan needs to:



Identify the best places for cover in your building. Under sturdy desks and tables and inside strong interior door frames are good places. If there is no other cover, lay on the floor next to an interior wall and protect your head and neck. Stay away from large furniture, mirrors, external walls and windows, kitchen cabinets, and anything heavy that isn't bolted down.

Teach everyone how to signal for help if trapped. Rescuers searching collapsed buildings will be listening for sounds, so try knocking three times repeatedly or blow an emergency whistle if you have access to one.Practice until it is second nature. Practice this plan often -- you only have a few seconds to make adjustments in a real earthquake.;
, In a real earthquake, this is your number one defense. Drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table and hold on firmly. Be prepared for shaking and falling objects. You should practice this in every room of the house, knowing your protected areas no matter where you are when an earthquake hits.If you are outside, move into the open, away from anything that could fall or collapse like trees and buildings. Drop and cover your head from falling objects. Stay there until the shaking stops., There are resources in your community to educate you and your family on how to deal with first aid emergencies. Your local Red Cross has monthly classes as well that will teach you the basic skills to deal with most common injuries and situations.


If you cannot attend a class, purchase basic first aid books and put them with each stash of emergency supplies in the house. Also having a first aid kit helps.

, It should be away from buildings. Go over what your family should do in the event that not everyone makes it to the rallying point. If you have civil defense safety meeting points (as designated by your town), be sure that every member of the family knows the location of the one closest to home, school, and work.


Identify an out-of-area contact person, like an out-of-state aunt or uncle, that your family can call and get in touch with one another. If you can't call each other for some reason, make sure you call them to help coordinate a meet-up. Use FRS and GMRS service (GMRS requires a license by FCC in US) to contact each other. Phone lines get congested in disaster. Some FRS and GMRS radio can send radio waves up to 40 miles!

, A broken gas line leaks flammable gas into space, which can lead to a very dangerous explosion if untended. You should learn how to operate your utilities now so that, in the event you smell leaking gas, you can quickly stop the problem., This should include everyone in your home, office, etc. You need to know who must be accounted for and how to get in touch with them if they can't be found. In addition to normal contact information, ask each person to provide and emergency contact as well.You should also include:


Names and numbers of neighbors.
Name and number of the landlord.
Important medical information.
Emergency numbers for fire, medical, police, and insurance., Since there is no precise time of day when an earthquake might strike, you may be at work, at school, on a bus, or in a train when one strikes. It is highly likely that you will need to know several ways to get home since roads and bridges will likely be obstructed for long periods of time. Note any potentially dangerous structures, like bridges, and figure out a route around them if need be.

Use Chapstick as a ""fire extender"".,
Make a candle.,
Make a Q-tip candle.",How to Use Chapstick As a Survival Tool2," Uncap the container and rub the lip balm onto something flammable: cotton balls, Q-tips, cloth, gauze, lint, or even dry organic materials like leaves and bark.Then, light the material on fire. The oil in the lip balm will give your flame an extra kick of intensity, and it should help it burn for longer while you get a larger fire going.You can also use petroleum jelly like Vaseline for this purpose.Consider keeping cotton balls or gauze in your survival kit for precisely this purpose. Together, cotton and lip balm form a potent fire-starting combination., Add a short wick, and the waxy, oily lip balm will perform much like a standard candle. For the wick, you can use a string, a match, or half of a Q-tip – anything that will not burn too quickly. Coat the wick in Chapstick wax, then stick it into the end of the balm. Light it on fire, and you have a candle that you can use to make more fire.Make sure to plant the wick slightly off-center from the plastic screw in the center of the Chapstick.
Keep the wick very short. Otherwise, it might burn too quickly. Either way, there's a good chance that the fire will melt away the plastic rim of the container., Try cutting a Q-tip in half, then coating the fuzzy end of the Q-tip in lip balm. Stick the sharp end of the half-Q-tip into the Chapstick, then light the fuzz. It should burn well and last at least a few minutes.

"
"
Waterproof your shoes or gear.,
Use as a lubricant.,
Keep knives from rusting.,
Defog glasses.,
Use the empty container as storage.",How to Use Chapstick As a Survival Tool3," Smear the lip balm over a thin or non-watertight section of fabric for a quick fix. This will only be marginally and temporarily effective, but it might keep you just dry enough in a pinch. Make sure that your gear is dry and clean when you start – otherwise, the Chapstick won't be able to do much!

, There are a lot of zippers involved in survival gear—tents, jackets, backpacks—and these closing mechanisms are prone to getting caught on the surrounding fabric. Chapstick can act as a lubricant that might help you free the zipper from a tight spot. Use lip balm liberally, but don't expect it to fix all of your zipper woes.


As an added bonus, the waxy coating might make the zipper more water-resistant.
You can also use Chapstick to lubricate screws, tools, and other things that might get stuck.

, Coat the blade with Chapstick by rubbing the balm directly on. This can be helpful if you're using your knife in the rain. Make sure to wipe the blade clean once you're in a dry haven., Rub Chapstick onto the lenses of your glasses, then rub them dry. This should get the glass clean, and it may also keep them from fogging up.Be aware that this tip is not officially verified; it shouldn't damage your glasses, but the thick petroleum might gunk up the lenses and make it hard to see. Try it, if you're curious, but do so with a grain of salt.

, Once you've used all of your Chapstick, you can use the plastic tube to store thick products like toothpaste, soap, wax, and petroleum jelly. Make sure to rinse out the compartment beforehand to remove the waxy residue. If the lid is intact, try using the container to hold basic survival gear: a fishing hook, a waterproof match, a band-aid, and some fishing line.Try hiding cash in here if you're traveling. Fold paper bills and roll them in. This can be a discreet way to keep your money close and safe.

Place the can on a stable surface.,
Position the tip of a spoon against the inner edge of the lid.,
Rub the tip of the spoon back and forth.,
Scoot the spoon over and keep rubbing.,
Continue around the edge of the lid.,
Pry open the lid.",How to Open a Can Without a Can Opener2," Use one hand to hold it firmly in place while you work the spoon with your other hand.

, The lid of the can will have a small, raised lip that has been crimped to seal the can closed. You want to position the spoon in a spot along the inside of this lip.


Hold the spoon so that the inside of its bowl is facing the lid of the can.
You need a metal spoon for this method. Any other material won't work.

, Work it over the same small area right where the edge of the lid is crimped. The friction from rubbing the spoon back and forth will begin to thin the can lid. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid., Rub the spot next to the first area you rubbed. Keep going until you have rubbed through the lid. The hole you have made in the lid is now slightly bigger.

, Keep scooting the spoon over and rubbing through the lid until you have circled the entire can lid. The lid should now be loose. Don't tip it upside down, or your food will spill out.

, Dig the spoon under the edge of the lid. Pry the lid upward until it pops out of place. Carefully lift it away to reveal the food inside.


If you find it difficult to pry off the lid with the spoon, try using a knife instead. You can use the knife to saw through any small parts of the lid that remain connected to the can.
The lid will be sharp, so be careful not to cut your finger on its edge when you pry it off. Use your sleeve or a towel to protect yourself if necessary.

"
"
Position the can on a stable surface.,
Hold the knife where the handle meets the blade.,
Position the heel of the knife against the inner edge of the lid.,
Press the heel of the knife into the can.,
Scoot the knife over and make a new hole.,
Continue until you've punctured holes around the edge of the can.,
Pry open the lid.",How to Open a Can Without a Can Opener3," A table as high as your hips is ideal. Do not place the can on your lap or in between your legs. The knife could slip and injure you.

, Grip the top of the knife with your palm directly over the joining place. Your fingers should rest against the side of the handle, safely away from the sharp edge of the blade.Make sure you have a firm grip. This method can be dangerous if your hand or the knife is slippery.
Do not use this method with a knife smaller than a chef's knife. A chef's knife is a large, heavy knife that weighs more than a pruning or steak knife. You need the relatively heavy weight of the blade to effectively puncture the lid of the can.

, The heel of the knife is the place where the blade is widest. It's at the opposite end of the blade from the tip. Place it up against the raised lip at the edge of the can's lid.


The heel should be centered right under the place where your palm is gripping the knife.
Make sure it is firmly positioned against the edge of the lid, so it won't slip.

, Press down firmly so that it punctures the can, creating a small hole. If you have trouble puncturing the can, try standing up and leaning over it. Hold the knife in place with one hand. Place the other hand on top. Apply steady pressure with both hands and push down until the can is punctured.


Do not strike the can to puncture it. The knife may slip and injure you. Instead, apply slow, steady pressure until the knife breaks through the can.
Don't be tempted to use the sharp tip of the knife to puncture the can. The heel is more stable and less likely to slip. Also, if you use the tip you'll ruin the edge on your blade.

, Move it a few centimeters along the edge of the lid. Use the same technique to create another hole right next to the first one.

, Circle the entire lid, just as you would with a can opener. The lid should now be loose.

, Insert the tip of the knife into one of the holes. Push up to pry off the lid. Be careful to point the edge of the blade away from your body so that it won't hurt you if it slips. Remove and discard the lid.


If necessary, use a smaller knife to saw through remaining connected parts of the lid.
Consider covering your hand with a towel or your sleeve before prying off the lid. This will protect your hand from getting scratched by the sharp lid.

Find a flat rock or a piece of concrete.,
Position the can upside down against the rock.,
Rub the can back and forth over the rock.,
Use a pocket knife to pry open the lid.",How to Open a Can Without a Can Opener4," Look for one with a rough surface. A smooth rock won't create enough friction to puncture the lid of the can.

, Positioning it upside down will allow you to break the seal, which is located on the top of the can., Use a scrubbing motion to create friction between the rock and the can. Keep going until you see moisture appear on the rock or on the lid of the can.


Turn the can over to check it every so often. You want to stop as soon as you see moisture. This means the lid is thin enough to break through.
Don't rub so hard that you rub right through the can lid. Your food will spill all over the rock.

, The seal should be thin enough to allow you to easily slide the blade into the can near the edge of the lid. Push up with the knife to gently pry off the lid. Finish pulling off the lid, then discard it.


If you don't have a pocket knife, try using a spoon, a butter knife or another tool.
Or find a rock you can use to knock the lid of the can inward. This isn't ideal, since you may contaminate your food with small bits of rock or dirt.
When you pull off the lid, cover your hand with your sleeve or a towel so you won't cut yourself.

Prepare disaster supplies in advance, making sure the entire house knows where to find everything.,
Purchase enough emergency food and water for at least three days.,
Buy a solar or manual crank flashlight and radio, or a normal flashlight with extra batteries.,
Create a First Aid kit.,
Put together a basic tool kit that can help get out of the house in an emergency.,
Store miscellaneous supplies to make an emergency stay more comfortable.",How to Prepare for an Earthquake2," Earthquakes can trap people in their homes for days at a time in the worst case scenario, so you need everything for survival in the house.


If you have a large house or family, more than 4-5 people, consider making extra kits and leaving them in different sections of the house.

, You should have a gallon of water for each family member, plus a few more for emergencies. Make sure you bring a manual can opener to get into emergency rations as well. You can purchase any non-perishable food you prefer, such as:


Canned foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans, and tuna.
Processed crackers and salty snacks.
Camping food., You should preferably have one for each individual in the house. Get a portable, battery-operated radio as well. There are some models that are solar or kinetically powered that may be worth an investment as you'll never have to worry about batteries.


You should also Purchase and use glow-sticks, matches, and candles as backup options.

, This is one of the most important objects in your emergency kit, and needs to be fully stocked with the following.Bandages and Gauze
Antibiotic ointments and alcohol wipes
Pain-relievers
Broad spectrum antibiotic pills
Anti-diarrhea medication (essential to fight dehydration in an emergency_
Scissors
Gloves and dust masks
Needle and thread
Splinting material
Compression wraps
Up-to-date prescriptions
Water purification tablets, You may need to help rescue crews, or move fallen debris trapping you in the house. You should have:


Wrenches for gas lines
Heavy duty hammer
Work gloves
Crowbar.
Fire extinguisher
Rope ladder., While everything above is essential to a good survival kit, the following materials should also be rounded up if time and money allow:


Pillows and blankets
Closed-toe shoes
Plastic bags
Disposable cutlery, plates, and cups
Emergency cash
Toiletries
Games, cards, kid's favorite toy, writing material, etc.Scanner (would be helpful to see what's going on and the police/fire dept. support)

Fasten any large items securely to the walls and floor.,
Install shatter-safe window films to protect from breaking glass.,
Place breakable items (bottles, glass, china, etc.),
Remove or secure hanging objects from above seating and sleeping areas.,
Check with a professional, your landlord, or the zoning board that your house is up-to-date with earthquake protections.,
Work with your community to find meeting points, preparedness workshops, and support groups.",How to Prepare for an Earthquake3," There are a number of specific hazards in your home that you can deal with before an earthquake occurs. The biggest danger is actually from falling objects inside your house. Luckily, these sorts of injuries can be prevented with some forethought:


Fasten all shelves securely to the walls.Use brackets to attach wall units, bookcases, and other tall furniture to wall studs. Standard steel brackets are fine and easy to apply.
Place large, heavy objects on lower shelves or on the floor. They might fall during an earthquake and the less distance they have to fall, the better. You can also screw objects onto things, such as a desk.Use non-slip mats to prevent objects with a low center of gravity from sliding. For example, fish bowls, vases, floral arrangements, statues, etc.
Use an invisible nylon cord to secure tall, heavy items that can topple over to the wall. Place an eye screw in the wall, and tie the thread around the object (such as a vase) and then tie it to the eye screw., In a last-minute pinch, placing masking tape across the diagonals (in an ""X"") of your windows can keep them from shattering.Most earthquake prone areas will already require these windows, but you should check to make sure.

, in closed cabinets that have latches. Lock or latch them up so that the cabinet doors cannot fly open. Use poster tack/plastic putty to keep ornaments, figurines, and glassware adhered to shelves and mantelpieces.


There are even special commercial quake putties available, allowing you to secure objects in place without decorations.

, Heavy pictures, light fixtures, and mirrors should be hung away from beds, couches, and anywhere that someone might sit. Conventional picture hooks will not hold pictures during an earthquake, but they are easy to fix - simply push the hook closed, or use a filler material to fill the gap between the hook and its backing. Other alternatives include buying special art hooks and ensuring that heavy paintings have adequate, strong hooks and cord., f you have any deep cracks in the ceiling or foundations, repair these immediately. You might need to consult an expert if there are signs of structural weakness. Make sure your foundation is properly braced and that all modern laws are being complied with.


Have flexible fittings placed on your gas pipes. A professional plumber will need to do this. It's also a good idea to have flexible fittings on your water pipes, so have these fixed at the same time.
If your house has a chimney, secure it to the walls of the house using galvanized metal angles and bands at the top, ceiling line, and base. The angles can be bolted to the wall, and to ceiling joists or rafters if you have cladding on the house. For the part of the chimney sitting above the roof-line, brace it to the roof.Evaluate your electrical wiring, electrical appliances, and gas connections. Do any repairs if needed. During an earthquake, faulty fittings and wiring can become a potential fire hazard. When securing appliances, be sure not to drill holes in them - use existing holes, or make loops from leather, etc., that can be glued onto an appliance.

, If there aren't civic groups present in your area focused on earthquake preparedness, work on putting one together. The first step in keeping everyone safe is education.

Read all warnings before proceeding.,
Choose a charger that can supply enough current to charge the battery and keep up with the inverter's load.,
Choose only deep cycle batteries.,
Choose an inverter.,
Get cables and fuses and other hardware to interconnect batteries, charger and inverter.,
Wear protective gear and observe safety precautions.,
Securely attach the charger cables to the deep cycle battery, noting polarity.

,
Prepare the charging system.,
Attach and test the inverter if it is separate from the charger.,
Dismantle the test rig.

,
Design a tidy enclosure.,
Make the connections.,
Supplement alternatives where beneficial or necessary.",How to Build Your Own Uninterruptible Power Supply," This is for your safety.;
, This will be a fairly heavy duty charger.


Check RV suppliers for 'Converters', designed to run larger RVs if you are making a big system.
Check solar power sources for ""big"" whole house chargers and inverters for very large systems.
If an RV or home converter has an inverter built in, make sure it's isolated (or can be isolated) from the input power.
Make sure the charger handles the kinds of batteries you are going to buy.

, Do not use a car or truck battery, nor a 'marine' battery. If you will be using only one battery, a gel or 'maintenance free' battery will work adequately. For larger systems composed of multiple deep-cycle batteries, select only wet cells or AGM cells.


Make sure the batteries are ventilated for escaping hydrogen gas.
If you buy wet cells, make sure the charger supports an 'equalize' charge.
Lead acid batteries are sold in 6 volt and 12 volt sizes. You will need to connect them in series to raise the voltage, or in parallel to increase the amp-hours available.
12 volts = 2x6V volt batteries connected in series
24 volts = 4x6V or 2x12V batteries in series
When connecting series-parallel, connect pairs of batteries in parallel and then connect those pairs in series, not chains of series batteries in parallel.


Do not mix different kinds of batteries. Newer batteries added to existing sets of batteries will be as worn as the originals very quickly.
In larger series-parallel setups it's a good idea to swap batteries around every year or so.
Batteries that are shallowly drained (cycled) will last a long time, while batteries that are deeply cycled will have shorter lives.
A fully charged, new 12 volt battery is 12.6 volts at rest (each of six cells is 2.1 volts).
A fully charged, new 6 volt battery will be at 6.3 volts at rest.
When a 12 volt charger is operating on it, the voltage will be higher. A float charge (maintenance charge) for a 12 volt system is 13.5 to 13.8 volts; active charging requires at least 14.1 volts. You may see it go as high as 16 volts when charging, depending upon the charger. After a full charge, if the battery is not going to be float charged, the at-rest voltage will slowly return to the nominal full-charge voltage.
A discharged 12 volt battery is 11.6 volts at rest. A discharged 6 volt battery is 5.8 volts at rest. The voltage may temporarily fall below these levels while powering a large load, but should return to a point within the nominal range after a 1-hour rest. Over-discharging to less than 1.93 volts per cell at rest will permanently damage your battery.
Batteries can be measured with a voltmeter for an approximate state of charge, but many dead batteries can hold a 'shallow charge' which drops off rapidly when current is drawn. You'll need to test them with a 'live' load over a series of hours to verify them.
A regulated 12 volt power supply can not fully charge a discharged 12 volt battery, but it makes a good float charger if the output voltage is correct (again, 13.5-13.8 volts for a 12 volt system). Check the water level in the cells often, and replenish as needed with distilled water.

Enough 'peak' current to handle motor starting loads, which can be from 3 to as much as 7 times the rated running wattage.
Inverters are available for input voltages of 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96 volts, and a few less common voltages. The higher the voltage the better, especially for large systems. 12 volts is the most common, but in no case should one consider 12 volts for a system of greater than 2400 watts output (The amount of current that has to be handled is simply too high).
Some of the better inverters have a built-in 3-stage automatic battery charger and transfer relay, greatly simplifying the system. These inverters are well worth the extra money; if fact they save money overall, as the built-in charger is a bargain compared to the price of a comparable stand-alone charger.

,


These should be very heavy gauge, well made, and as short as you can fit it all together with. This is to keep the cable resistance low.
Consider spending just a bit more for a bus bar interconnect with big dividers, instead of just 'wires everywhere'. It is tidy and helps prevent accidental shorts. It also makes it easier to remove defective batteries.

,

Don your eye protection to protect against acid splashes to the eye.
Wear protective, non-conductive gloves if possible.
Remove any jewelry and any metallic items you might be wearing.

,, Plug the charger into the wall and power it on. Make sure it begins a proper charge cycle, and make sure the inverter is powered off.

, Hook up the cables to the batteries, noting polarity. Turn the inverter on and test it with some suitable AC load. You shouldn't see sparks, smoke, or fire at any point. Leave the inverter on with a load similar to your planned load and allow the battery to charge overnight. This will test that the charger and load are a good match. In the morning, the battery should be fully charged.

,, This could be shelves in a shed, or a very large container. This will hold the batteries, charger, and inverter. Generally the charger and inverter should not be right next to the batteries where escaping gas can get to them. If so, it can shorten the life of the electronics, or ignite gases from sparking if vents are blocked. Some partition should be installed and separate air circulation should be provided for the charger and inverter. Alternatively, mount the charger/inverter outside the battery box. Once ready, install the components into it.

, Runs of cable should be kept fairly short. You need easy access to every battery to check, so clean and tighten cables. For wet cells, you need to be able to easily take every top off to check fluid levels and get distilled water into them. Make sure the inverter is grounded. You may ground it to the ground wire on the charger's input AC, or use a grounding rod driven into the soil.

, You may supplement or replace the charger with solar, wind, etc., connected to their own applicable charge controller. This can keep the power running far longer than it otherwise would, even indefinitely. Also, you may supplement the charger with a generator. Attach a truck alternator to a small internal combustion engine, use a generator with 12 volt charging output, or unplug the charger from its AC outlet and then use a 'regular' AC generator to power the charger.


The UPS can be located outside.
Install an inside and outside outlet through a wall connected only to each other. You can plug the UPS inverter into the outside outlet (with a 'gender bender' extension cable) to power the inside outlet.
Disconnect and isolate an indoor circuit from the main circuit breaker panel. Route the wire out of that box through one of the punch-outs or remove it, and connect it to the inverter, providing conduit to shield as applicable. All plugs/lights/smoke detectors/etc. on that circuit will be powered by the UPS, so test and make sure nothing 'extra' is connected to it.
Run conduit and/or get fancy as you see fit, relative the permanence of your solution.

Know that survival continues after the tsunami has passed.,
Rally the community behind a rehabilitation plan.",How to Survive a Tsunami," It is important to consider whether or not you live somewhere that could potentially face a tsunami. It is likely that you are at some risk if:


Your home, school, or workplace is in a coastal region, near the sea.
The elevation of your home, school or workplace is at sea level or fairly low and on flat or only slightly undulating land. If you don't know the elevation level of your home, school or workplace, find out. Some local authorities use elevation as a warning indicator.
There are warning signs indicating that your area is prone to tsunamis.
Your local authorities have issued information about the potential for tsunamis.
Natural sea barriers such as levees of dunes have been removed for development.;
, Do some library research or ask at the local government office. FEMA has a website enabling online flood risk searches.Most tsunamis happen in what's called the ""ring of fire,"" an area in the Pacific ocean known for its geologic activity.Chile, the western United States, Japan, and the Philippines are especially vulnerable.

, If a tsunami (or another natural disaster) hits, chances are you'll need a few survival items, and you'll need them fast. It can be helpful to have both a safety and survival pack already assembled:



Make a safety pack. Food, water, and a first aid kit are among the basics required. Keep the safety pack somewhere obvious, well-known to everyone in the building and easy to grab in an emergency. It can also help to leave a raincoat or other coat for each person near the safety pack.

Make a personal survival pack for each person in the family, and a family survival pack with common items for everyone. Include a supply of necessary medications for each member of the family. Don't forget survival items for your pets.

, An evacuation plan must be prepared in advance to be of use. In developing one, consider your family, your workplace, your school, and your wider community. If necessary, begin to develop a community-wide evacuation plan if nothing is being done in your community. Take the initiative to start developing the plan, and involve local authorities and other residents. Lack of evacuation plans and local warning systems put you, your family and your entire community at increased risk for injury or death during and after a tsunami. These are the things that should be part of a successful evacuation plan:


Discuss with family, and colleagues the various options for evacuation. Know, for example, where you might reunite with your loved ones should a tsunami hit.Conduct practice drills to ensure that all members of the community are clear about what they need to do and where they need to go during a safety evacuation.
Include a plan that can ensure a head count of every single member of the community; ensure that assistance for disabled or ill persons can be provided.
Ensure that warning and evacuation signals are understood by the community in advance — distribute pamphlets or give lectures to ensure that everybody is aware. Read Understand Tsunami Notification Terms.
Remember to provide multiple safety routes owing to the possibility of an earthquake destroying roads and other infrastructure, preventing exit using some routes.
Consider what types of sheltered areas might exist in the evacuation zones; do such shelters need to be built in advance?

, If you live in a coastal zone, the occurrence of an earthquake should be immediate cause for alarm and evasive action.

, If the sea suddenly recedes (draws back), leaving bare sand, this is a major warning sign that there is about to be a sudden surge of water inland.

, Watch for animals leaving the area or behaving abnormally, such as trying to seek human shelter or grouping together in ways they would not normally do., If the local authorities do have time to issue a warning, take heed. Inform yourself in advance of how the local authorities plan to make warnings so that you do not mistake or ignore the warning when it comes. Share that information with family, friends, neighbors and the community; if the local authorities have pamphlets, a website or other information sources, ask for copies to distribute or request that the local authority fulfills this role.

, If a tsunami hits, save lives, not possessions. Trying to retrieve things and belongings may hamper your escape by causing you to lose valuable time. Grab your safety pack, something to keep you warm, your family and leave immediately. Tsunami survivors act quickly, and usually, don't bother with trying to save possessions.

, The first thing you should try to do, if possible, is to move away from the coast, lagoons or other bodies of water, towards higher ground and even into hills or mountains. Move until you are either 2 miles (3,200 m) inland or 100 feet (30 m) above sea level.Expect roads to be totally wiped out by a tsunami.If you're planning on using roads to get where you need to go, think again. In a full-blown tsunami, many roads will be wiped out, either by the seismic activity of the earthquake or by the tsunami itself. Have a good sense of the general direction you want to be heading in, and consider keeping a compass in your survival pack.

, If you cannot head inland because you are trapped, head up. Although not ideal because the structure itself could collapse, if this is your only option, choose a high, sturdy and solid building and climb up it. Go as high as you possibly can, even onto the roof., As a very last resort, if you find yourself trapped and unable to move inland or climb a high building, find a strong and tall tree and climb up it as high as you can. There is a risk of trees being dragged under by the tsunami, however, so this really is a measure to be used only if all other alternatives are impossible. The stronger the tree, the higher it stands, and the sturdier its branches for resting on (you may be there for hours), the better your chances are of surviving., If you did not manage to evacuate but find yourself caught up in the tsunami for one reason or another, there are things that you can do to try to survive:



Grab onto something that floats. Use a floating object as a raft to keep yourself above the water. Items that float such as tree trunks, doors, fishing equipment etc. may be in the water with you., A tsunami comes in waves. There may be many, many waves lasting for hours and the next wave may be even larger than the last., Listen to the radio for updates on what is happening. Do not trust word of mouth. It is better to wait than to return too early and be caught by more incoming waves.

, Only then should you return to your home. Find out in advance how local authorities propose to announce such a notice. Remember that roads may be extremely damaged by the tsunami waves and you may have to take alternative routes.A good pre-planned emergency plan should account for this possibility and provide alternative routes and gathering places.

, Once the tsunami has subsided, there will be debris, destroyed buildings and broken infrastructure. There may also be dead bodies. Fresh water supplies may be destroyed or disrupted. Food supplies will most likely be unavailable. The potential for disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, grief, starvation, and injuries will make the post-tsunami period nearly as perilous as the tsunami itself. An emergency plan should also consider the aftermath and what you'll need to do to protect yourself, your family and your community.

, If your local authorities have not put action plans into place, suggest that they do so or form a community action group to consider a post-tsunami plan. Things that can help survival post tsunami include:


Establishing an advance stash of fresh water. Whether bottled water or filtered water, an emergency water supply should be in place in your community.
Opening up undamaged homes and buildings to others. Help those in distress and provide them with shelter.Ensuring that there are power generators to enable cooking, maintenance of hygiene and return of basic health and transportation services.
Running emergency shelters and food distribution.
Getting health care into action immediately.
Quelling fires and gas ruptures.

Gather your supplies.,
Tape the wire to the negative ( - ) end of one of the batteries.,
Tape the bottom of the toilet paper roll/cardboard well so that it is completely covered.,
Insert the battery, wired end first, into the toilet paper roll.,
Insert the next battery, negative side first.,
Tape the bulb to the top of the battery.,
Light up your flashlight.",How to Make a Homemade Flashlight1," Clear an area to work in and invite the kids and family to come watch you manipulate electricity with your bare hands. You'll need:


An empty toilet paper roll (or lightweight cardboard rolled into a small tube)
2 D batteries
Tape (electrical tape works well)
5"" (12.5 cm) long piece of wire (if you're using a speaker wire, use the copper kind)
2.2 volt light bulb (different bulbs are an option, but it may or may not work as well. A bulb from a string of Christmas lights works quite effectively.);
, Make sure it's snug and not going anywhere, or your light will end up flickering.


You could use tin foil instead of wire, but it's a little less dependable and harder to work with.

, You don't want any light to sneak through, dissipating its strength -- that would be one poorly working flashlight.


If you didn't have reason to use black electrical tape yet, now you do.

, Even though the wired end is facing the taped bottom of the roll, the other end of the wire should be sticking out of the open end.


If the wire isn't sticking out enough to come around the edge of the battery, you need to shorten your tube.

, Its negative side will meet the positive side of the battery, which is already inside. This connection continues the flow of electricity from back to front, ultimately lighting up your device.

, Be confident there's an adequate direct connection between the two surfaces (basically, make sure it's sturdy). Make sure you can still see the bottom half of the bulb.

, With the wire, touch the silver part of the bulb. If it doesn't light up after a few tries, check the tips below for troubleshooting. If it does function, now you have a working flashlight with an on/off feature.

Gather your materials.,
Attach a brass tab to the end of each wire.,
Tape your two D batteries together.,
Tape the wire on the negative end to the battery.,
Cut a hole in your small cardboard strip.,
Cut a hole in the bottom of a paper cup just large enough for the bulb.,
Insert a pop tab in between the two brass tab ends.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Homemade Flashlight2," It's time to beckon the MacGyver within you and get started. You'll need:

2 D cell batteries (separate)






2 5"" pieces of number 22 insulated copper bell wire (1"" of insulation stripped off both ends)






Cardboard tube cut to 4"" in length






PR6, or number 222, 3-volt flashlight bulb






2 brass fasteners (brads)






1"" x 3"" cardboard strip






Paper clip






Tape






Bathroom-size paper cup







, Wrap it around to secure it. Punch the tabs through the same side of the cardboard tube, but with the wires coming out of different ends. The pointy ends should be sticking out of the tube. This'll be used to serve as part of the on/off switch.

, Make sure the positive of one end is on the bottom of the negative end. Your battery should double in length, not width. Make sure they're firmly attached to each other and slide the batteries into the tube.

, The negative end is the flat one. Masking tape is sufficient for this.

, Place the wire on the positive end through that hole and wrap that wire around the bulb. Place the end of the bulb into the hole so it can be supported by the cardboard.


Place tape around the base of the bulb and cardboard to keep it secure to the wire. It should start flickering on at this point.







, Place the bulb into the hole and secure the cup to the cardboard base with more tape.

, When the pop tab is touching both, it conducts the electricity and turns your flashlight on. If the pop tab is moved, your flashlight turns off. Voila!


You can use a paperclip instead of a pop tab, too!

Find some scrap steel, between 3/16 and 1/4 inch (4.7mm to 6.35mm) thick, and at least 4 inches by 5 inches (10cm by 12.5cm) in size.,
Mark out a 3 1/2 inch (8.89cm) height by 5 inch (12.5cm) width, with a radius as shown in the image.,
Cut out the rough shape of the blade with a steel cutting blade on a circular saw to save time and effort when doing the finished cut later.,
Use a bandsaw or a jigsaw with an appropriate metal cutting blade to cut the curved edges of the tomahawk blade.,
Use a grinder to smooth edges of the blade, and to sharpen the cutting edge of the tomahawk.

,
Clamp the blade to a welding table and position a 3/4 inch (1.9cm) pipe coupling along the straight, 2 inch (5cm) edge of the blade so that it is centered and aligned with the blade.,
Weld the blade to the coupling (which will be the thimble for attaching the handle), then clean the weld and look at the position of the blade in relation to it to make sure it is straight.

,
Cut a 17 inch (43.18cm) length of ash or other 1 inch (2.5cm) diameter hardwood dowel for the tomahawk handle.,
Clamp the head into a vice and screw the tomahawk handle into the threaded pipe coupling until about 1/4 inch (6.35mm) is sticking past it.

,
Clean up the metal's edges and sharpen the blade of your new tomahawk, and you are finished.

",How to Make a Tomahawk Without a Forge," You may find some in a junkyard or salvage yard, but it is also sold at industrial supply stores. Make sure it is not too heavy, but not too light that you cannot build up speed while swinging;
, The radius is hand drawn, as well as the blade curve, but an exact shape shouldn't be critical for the tomahawk to work.

, You can make all cuts using a metal cutting bandsaw if you have one available, or even use a cutting torch.

, Clamping the blade to a scrap piece of plywood that can be sawed through as you cut will make the task safer.

,, Be careful here – if the blade ends up skewed, the tomahawk will not perform well.,, Shave the end about 2 1/2 inches (6.35cm) so it fits very tightly into the thimble on the tomahawk head.

Container gardening is just as it sounds - a series of planters/containers that use traditional gardening soil and methods to grow your plants. A hydroponic garden is a special type of indoor garden that uses fertilized water and a non-soil starter for your plants, arranged vertically. Each is a valuable option for different reasons:


Container gardens are a good option for someone who may want to rearrange their plants or eventually move them outdoors. Container gardens can grow any type of plant, in any size.
Hydroponic gardens are a good option for someone who is looking to produce a lot of plants in a small amount of space. Typically, hydroponic gardens are used for growing vegetables.;
, Creating a successful indoor garden relies heavily on selecting a space indoors that will help your plants to grow. Choose an area that has lots of windows and sunlight; typically east and west facing windows are the best. When at all possible, place your garden (container or hydroponic) near a window to allow for more heat and sunlight.









Avoid rooms that have cold temperatures (such as an attic or garage); cold can kill or slow the growth of your plants while heat is typically more universally welcomed by your plants.
Avoid choosing an area near an air vent or fan, as these can dry out your plants and cause damage to them.

, The biggest reason for planting an indoor garden is the ability to completely control the environment. While this requires more work, it also greatly increases the success of your plants when done properly. There are three general things you’ll be in charge of controlling: air temperature, water frequency, and soil condition. These will vary slightly depending on the system of garden that you are using and the plants you decide to grow, but there are a few helpful tools to make controlling the environment easier.


Try soil heat mats. In general, most plants thrive in soil temperatures between 75–85 °F (24–29 °C). You probably don’t want to have your house heat on that high, especially in the winter. To remedy this, you can purchase electric mats made for heating pots from the bottom, regulating the temperature of the soil.
Get a drip system. Watering regularly can be a difficult habit to master; rather than setting reminders for yourself daily, try getting a drip system. This works with a series of small tubes supplied to each plant, and a timer that turns the water on/off for a certain period each day.
Choose a lighting system. Although windows let in a little sunlight, you’ll primarily be in charge of giving your plants light through artificial means. Fluorescent light tubes are typically considered the best choice because they are cost effective and give good results. Otherwise, you can buy a specialty heat-lamp for growing indoor plants., Just like a garden outside, there is a huge variety of plants you can grow indoors including vegetables, berries, herbs, flowers, and decorative greens. Before you head to the nursery and start picking out random attractive plants, you must determine which plants will work well in your garden. Some plants will flourish indoors while others will struggle. Some popular plants to grow indoors include:









Vegetables such as lettuce, beans, peas, and mushrooms, and fruits like strawberries.Herbs: basil, bay, chives, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, tarragon, and thyme.Flowers: peace lily, African violet, marigold, begonia, cactus, and succulents., Because you’re growing indoors, you have a wide variety of options for containers to plant in. You can go with traditional pots or containers from a garden supply store, or be unique and use old vases or plastic bottles. You don’t need a large container to start seeds, and if you’re transplanting a plant you’ll need a container twice the size of the root ball. Otherwise, look for a container that has holes in the bottom to allow for drainage, or simply drill holes into any container.


Plastic containers retain moisture the best, but terra cotta pots are typically seen as the most attractive option.
Try recycling old coffee cans or 1-liter plastic bottles to use. This way you’ll be green while gardening - a double bonus!
You can line the bottom of your container with rocks for added drainage.
If you use a wooden container, try to find one made of redwood or cedar, which are particularly rot resistant.
Don’t use any container that has been treated with chemicals, as this could kill your plant.

, Unfortunately, you can’t just grab a bunch of soil from your garden and use it for planting your containers. Soil from outside often contains diseases and insects that can kill off your plant over time, and is rarely the proper balance of sand/clay for the ideal porous-ness. While you can purchase pre-made potting mix, you’ll save more money and guarantee the quality of your mix by creating your own. To make your own potting mix, you’ll need 1 part coir peat, 1 part vermiculite, and 2 parts compost. These are all available at your local gardening center.









Soak the coir peat brick to rehydrate it; typically these come with directions, so follow the attached instructions on soaking.
Mix your coir peat and vermiculite together until well mixed, and then add in the compost.
If you’re able, worm castings are an excellent addition to your soil mix; add ½-1 cup of worm castings to your mix prior to planting your containers., If you’re planting a large indoor garden, you’ll need to create a shelving system for your plants. Otherwise, use the aforementioned tips to select a space for your container garden. You’ll also have to set up your control factors: your light, water system, and temperature controls. If you’re using a shelving system, it should be easy to hang fluorescent lights and your drip system to the shelves. Otherwise, work your space until you have all the components adjusted. Heat mats should be placed underneath the locations of your containers.


You can purchase timers for your lights, heat mats, and drip systems so that they are only on during certain times of the day.
Keep in mind that certain plants require different amounts of light, and group them appropriately. For example, put all the light-loving plants near each other and the shade-loving plants near each other, and adjust the light output accordingly.

, After planting your garden, you’ll need to upkeep it in order to be successful. Make sure that your plants are getting regular amounts of sunlight and water, and that the soil temperature does not drop below 70 °F (21 °C). When your plants become too large, you’ll need to transplant them into larger pots or split them into more plants, either to keep or to give away.









If you notice any plants with brown spots, that are wilting, or are clearly dying, remove them from the rest in case they carry a disease or pest that might spread.
You can incorporate compost or fertilizer into the containers every few months to help supply the plants with nutrients. If you have a drip irrigation system, you can dose a liquid fertilizer in the system every few weeks to keep plants going strong.
You can set your pots in trays of rocks so that the water that drains out will provide humidity for them as they grow., There are many different ways to set up a hydroponic garden, but they all follow the same theme: a water tank is located on the bottom, and stacks of shelves/plants are placed on top. The fertilized water from the tank is fed to the plants using a pump system, and the water filters down through the plants and excess is drained back into the original water tank. A few variations of this system include:









Creating a small-scale hydroponics system. You don’t need a massive shelving unit and lots of supplies to create a basic system. Instead, you can use cut-off plastic bottles and a sunlit window. Consider making a window system for a tight space.Using one large container instead of many small ones. There are so many variations of hydroponic systems, and one of them includes using a large tub to produce a lot of the same crop, instead of using multiple small containers.

, Just like with a container garden, a hydroponic garden will thrive with the most available sunlight. Choose a space near a window; in fact, if you’re using a small garden the window may be the only necessary source of light. Otherwise, you’ll need to find a location with a lot of vertical space for the stacking that is necessary for the system. Try using a shelving unit or organizational bookshelf for your hydroponics system.


Don’t place the shelves directly over or under an air vent/duct.
When possible, put your hydroponics system on hard floors rather than carpet to avoid mold and mildew growing.

, As with a container garden, virtually any container is appropriate for a hydroponics system so long as it isn’t chemically treated and allows for drainage through the bottom. You’ll need to drill holes into a container that does not have them so that the water can filter out at the bottom. Instead of using potting soil for your containers, though, you’ll be filling your pots with a hydroponic substrate. Then, plant your seeds as per usual and water them heavily to help reduce transplant shock.


Proper substrates for hydroponics include expanded clay, lava rocks, coco coir, and peat moss.
Consider the speed of your pump when deciding how many holes to drill. You will need to allow the container to fill with water while the pump is running, and drain in between pump cycles.
Install an overflow drain toward the top of your container to avoid flooding.

, If you purchased a commercial hydroponics system, you’ll need to follow the package directions for setting it up. If you’re making your own homemade system, you can follow these loose directions for setting up. Put your water tank on the bottom shelf, elevated at least a few inches above the floor. Then, place your plant containers on the shelves above the tank; the container closest to the tank should be nearly covering it completely - there shouldn’t be much distance from the top of the tank to the bottom of the container. Set up your water pump system to deliver water to the plants on the shelves above.


Your fluorescent lights should be hung directly above the plants.
You can purchase a special timer to control the water pump so that it runs at specific times. Set your pump on a timer that runs 15 minutes for every hour. This allows the plants to drain so they can get oxygen.
Talk to a local hydroponics expert at a nursery for specific advice to your system.

, Over time, you’ll need to make sure that your hydroponics system is in good condition so that it keeps running smoothly. Test your water for nutrients weekly, and add nutrients as necessary.Occasionally, you will need to drain all of the water in your hydroponic system and replace it.

Look at the construction methods used in the building to determine what type of supports will work best for your handrail system.,
Decide what the load capacity of your system should be.,

Consider alternate methods for projects where conventional handrails built with cables and steel posts, or wooden rails on metal or wood posts are not practical.,
Design your handrail system with the existing conditions in mind.,

Estimate the amount of materials you need.,

Lay out the location for the handrail posts, then, using a safe access method, install them.,

Fasten the posts around all edges requiring protection.,

Attach the handrail system to the structural members of the building where possible to increase its strength.,

Install the handrail material after you have installed the posts.,

Install the access ladder or other means for workers to climb to the elevated area.",How to Build a Temporary Handrail System," Steel framed multistory buildings may require welded handrail posts, while wood framed construction would require wood posts, or metal posts with fastening flanges installed on them.
, Government agencies in the United States like OSHA (and similar agencies in other countries) set standards for fall protection. In the case of the USA, these standards can be viewed at the OSHA website,while the US Army Corps of Engineers handbook also has specific requirements that must be met on a project they are overseeing., Safety nets systems, warning lines, safety harnesses, and safety spotters may be used in some jurisdictions under some conditions; you'll need to check the relevant regulations and requirements for your location., For the handrail system shown in the illustrations, a steel angle surrounds the perimeter of the second floor work area, so steel tubing with cables and angle iron bracing is used. The cables are attached to structural columns to anchor the cable handrails., Typical handrail post spacing lay on 8 foot (2.4 meters) centers, so you will need one post per eight feet (2.4 meters) of protected length. You may need two cables or rails, so you can figure double the outside perimeter length for this material. Also, consider whether a toe-board is needed to protect people working below the edge of the elevated platform from falling objects., Using an aerial lift can make this step easier. Otherwise, access the platform by other means, using a safety harness and related fall protection devices to protect the installer., Keep them as plumb as possible, and make sure the means you use for attachment will hold the required load., This will also reduce the number of handrail posts you will need for the job., Keep in mind that in most cases, all workers present at the elevated work area must use supplemental fall protection until the handrail system is complete, and this includes the person installing it., Make sure ladders are secured, and the top of the ladder extends 3 feet (91cm) above the deck."

Turn off the electricity or gas to the water heater.,
Preserve the cleanliness of the water in the tank by closing the supply valve to the tank.,
Find the valve at the bottom of the tank for draining.,
Turn on the hot water from any tap in the house.,
Remove any sediment that has collected at the bottom of the the water heater.",How to Get Emergency Drinking Water from a Water Heater1," Turn off the circuit breaker for electric water heaters or close the gas valve for natural gas and propane types. If the power is still on when the tank is empty, your tank will almost certainly sustain significant damage. Most electric water heaters in residential applications are 208/240 volts, and supplied by a double-pole circuit breaker or two fuses rated at 30 amps.


Some gas valves have a thermostatic control knob facing forward. The ""Off - Pilot - On"" gas supply knob is located on the top, between the red interlock button the black ""push-button"" ignitor. Simply rotate the top knob from the ""On"" to the ""Off"" position to stop the flow of gas to the burner.
Some electric-reliant heaters have double-pole 30 amp circuit breakers. Switch the circuit breaker from the ""On"" position to the ""Off."" Once off, there is no danger of damaging the heating elements.;
, When water service is restored, the water department will be pumping water that could be contaminated. This will be fine to use for flushing toilets and for cooking, but not for drinking.


Determine whether you're dealing with a ball valve or a gate valve. Unlike a traditional gate valve's handle, which needs to be turned completely several times in order to shut off, a ball valve handle is rotated just a 1/4 turn between full on and off positions.
If older, traditional gate valves were installed instead, bear in mind that the color of the handle does not guarantee an association with the temperature of the water in the pipe.

, This is where your clean drinking water will come from. Many water heater valves have a connector for hooking up a garden hose to the drain valve. A short 3 foot (0.9 m) length of garden hose will make the collection of the water easier. A washing machine's supply hose is the perfect length and is available in many homes. Connect the hose and open the valve briefly to flush any debris that may have collected in the valve. Make sure the drain, hose, and container are clean before using them.


Threads are usually provided to connect an ordinary garden hose (or washer supply hose). Some gate valves do not have a traditional handle, but rather a slot at the end of the stem where a handle would normally attach. The slot allows for operation with a screwdriver, or coin. Work this valve gently, as these valves are seldom used more than once or twice per year under normal service conditions, and could be damaged if forced.

, In order for water to be drained from the tank, you must allow air to get into it. This is easy to do by opening any hot water tap in the building such as the kitchen or bathroom sink. When either faucet is open, a sucking sound may be heard whenever water is drawn from the water heater's drain valve, and is normal.

, Water heaters are notorious for trapping sediments. The heavier-than-water sediment sinks and collects at the bottom of the tank because hot water is drawn from the top of the tank, rather than the bottom. If you have sediment in the drinking water let it stand for a period of time to let it settle to the bottom of container.


Typical mineral sediment that has settled in the hot water is usually harmless, but if your heater has an aluminum anode, there may be a lot of jelly-like aluminum corrosion by-product on the tank bottom.
Many people mistakenly believe that the tank is made of glass (or another inert substance). It is not. The inside of the tank will likely be lined with glass to prevent corrosion, since corrosion is the leading cause of water heater failure. There is no danger cooking or consuming water that has been contained in a water heater.

Prepare your work area to make cleanup easier.,
Put 3 or more inches (7 cm) of soil in each pot.,
Loosen the soil and any roots that are attached around the inside of the mother plant's pot.,
Remove the plant from the pot.,
Shake loose soil that adheres to the tuberous roots back into the pot.,
Separate the tubers to divide the plant.,
Plant each division into a new pot.,
Water the plant regularly.,
Finished.

",How to Divide a Spider Plant," Spread newspaper or plastic down on your work surface to catch soil spills.;
, You may need to add more later, depending on the size of the pot and root ball. The soil in the bottom should raise the base of the plant to surface level and allow ample room for plant growth.

,


Insert a butter knife or hand shovel into the pot along the side.
Move the tool around the inside of the pot, keeping it close to the inside perimeter. Wiggle the knife as needed to pry away attached roots.

,


Place one hand palm-side down on the surface of the soil. Spread your fingers on that hand to cover as much of the surface as possible.
Turn the pot upside down using your other hand, dumping the spider plant into your palm.

, Use your fingers to loosen and remove remaining dirt to get a better look at the plant's root base.

, The root base of a spider plant is made up of water-rich tuberous roots. A network of roots grows from each tuber.


Pull the tubers apart into 2 to 3 smaller clusters using your fingers. The roots of the plant will separate from each other to stay with their attached tuber. Don't worry if some of the roots tear off, new ones grow quickly.
You can also use a clean, sterilized knife to slice through the tubers.
Determine the size of your divisions by the size of the pots you are using for your new plants. The root base of the new plant should sit entirely below the soil in the pot and have room to grow before needing transplanting or division. The roots of these plants grow quickly.

, Place the roots under the soil and make sure the base of the plant is at surface level. Fill the space around the root base with moist potting mix.

, Keep the soil moist to encourage the tuberous root base to grow. Spider plants take quickly when divided and transplanted and rarely show signs of transplant shock or distress.

Although water from a water heater is considered safe to drink, consider purifying or filtering it before drinking.,
Seriously consider replacing the original valve on the water heater with a ball-valve drain assembly.,
In an emergency, consider other options for potable water.",How to Get Emergency Drinking Water from a Water Heater2," Although it's probably fine to drink water from the heater during an emergency, it's best to be on the safe side.You can purify water by boiling it or using iodine or bleach in very small quantities. You can filter water in an emergency by layering filtering agents on top of each other.

, Factory valves do not have a straight path and have small orifices. In hard-water areas, those can easily clog with sediment buildup and then no water will flow from the tank.

, If you can't, for whatever reason, access your water heater in an emergency, don't panic. You should have plenty of other options. Consider these to get at potable water:


Possible indoor sources of water:

Liquid from canned fruit and vegetables
Water from the toilet tank (not the toilet bowl), unless it has been chemically treated with toilet cleaners
Water from melted ice cubes


Possible outdoor sources of water:

Water from a rainwater collection system.
Water from rivers, steams, springs, and other moving bodies of water
Water from ponds, dams, and lakes

Try terra cotta pots.,
Look into wood pots.,
Go for lightweight and affordable plastic pots.,
Try moss containers.",How to Design a Container Garden1," Terra cotta looks good with a variety of plants, and can be simple or elaborate, but it is heavy and isn't resistant to frost. Unglazed terra cotta has good air circulation and can give a refreshing Southwestern vibe to your garden. Try a variety of sizes for visual appeal. , Wood has a natural look and will give your garden an earthy, holistic feel. Wood is usually used for window boxes and barrels. You can line the container with plastic or burlap to protect the wood. If you use plastic, cut drainage holes in the bottom. Make sure that the wood has not been treated with plant-harming chemicals.


Wooden planters will need to be properly maintained over time or else the quality could deteriorate. Plant-safe, low chemical sealers are available at your local garden center.Pour the sealer into a container, such as a large paint tray and use a paint brush to apply the sealer to the wooden planter.
Allow the sealer to dry for 24 hours before placing plants inside.
Test the sealer with a little bit of water to see if it is completely dry. If it is, the water will form small droplets but will not soak into the wood.

, Plastic pots are lightweight and come in almost all colors, shapes, and sizes. They are readily available at your local garden center. They can also be made to look like clay or other materials. The benefit to plastic is that it won’t chip and break in cold weather; however, plastic pots do not allow very much air circulation., Moss is usually used in hanging baskets. It allows you to have plants come through the sides of the container as well, not just at the top. Since moss dries out quickly, you will need to water it often.


Hanging plants you can try out are ivy, geranium, petunias and black-eyed Susan vines.

Soften the appearance of a corner with an indoor tree.,
Nourish an orchid in a humid room.,
Grow fresh herbs in your kitchen.,
Create a dramatic display using small succulents.,
Place air plants in unique containers.,
Build a terrarium for a more composed look.,
Place a large urn planter just inside your front door.",How to Decorate With Houseplants," Corners can be challenging to decorate effectively, and they can feel empty or even harsh and angular. A good way to counter this effect is by growing a tree in a corner. Trees that grow well indoors, including rubber tree and fiddle leaf fig, can provide a soft, lively touch to a corner that integrates it seamlessly into your décor.;
, Orchids are some of the most dramatic houseplants available, prized because they keep their colorful blooms for months. Orchids make ideal houseplants for tricky, humid spots like bathrooms, because they respond well to humidity and need to be kept in fast-draining potting mix that dries out too quickly in dry air.

, Houseplants don't solely have to be decorative - they can provide you with fresh herbs for your cooking as well. A row of fresh herbs in unadorned terracota pots along a kitchen windowsill can make your kitchen feel rustic and inviting. If herbs are given plenty of sun, they will easily grow to a usable size indoors.

, Succulents are a classic choice when decorating with houseplants, as they are extremely hardy and tolerant of adverse conditions. In addition, the wide variety of shapes, textures, and colors that succulents offer makes them ideal for clustering in eye-catching groups. Pair violet with green, matte with shiny, and pointy with soft in a range of coordinating pots.

, Air plants (tillandsia) are a special type of houseplant that can be grown without soil or water. For this reason, you can place them in any type of container, from a cereal bowl to a conch shell. Like succulents, air plants look especially dramatic when clustered in groups. Make sure to mist the air plants with water regularly to keep them healthy., Terrariums are enclosed glass containers in which various plants are grown in the extremely humid environment created. Part of the joy of terrariums is the act of composing them - combining soil, moss, small plants and grasses, and even decorative elements like stones. For extra drama, place humidity-loving carnivorous plants like Venus fly traps or pitcher plants in your terrarium.

, Large urn-style planters are mainstays on front porches and decks, but you can also move the planter just inside your door for dramatic entryway appeal. Grow a hardy, tolerant plant in this location so that it can weather the constant temperature swings of an opening and closing front door.

Rinse the leaves of houseplants regularly.,
Wipe large houseplant leaves down with a moist cloth.,
Clean dust from fuzzy-leaved houseplants using an old toothbrush.,
Swish houseplants with small leaves in water to remove dust.,
Bathe in a shower of tepid water.,
Try using mayonnaise to help shine up the leaves of your plants.",How to Clean Your Indoor Houseplants," The best preventative step you can take to avoid dirty leaves is a regular rinse with lukewarm water. Avoid applying cold water, which can cause spots on the leaves and shock the roots (remember that houseplants nearly all hail from the tropics - they are accustomed to warm rainfall).


For rinsing small houseplants, place the plant into your kitchen sink. Spray it down with your kitchen faucet if you have a sprayer; otherwise use a spray bottle.






Large houseplants can be rinsed by placing them into your shower. Flexible, extending shower heads work well for this task. Allow the plant to drip dry before returning it to its home.





;
, For regularly removing dust buildup from houseplants with large leaves (such as a peace lily), wipe the leaves gently with a cloth moistened in lukewarm water.


Paper towels and terrycloth towels are acceptable for this task, but can be abrasive to the plant's leaves. Ideally, you should choose a very smooth cloth; rags made from old tee shirts work well.






It helps to support the leaves and stems with your free hand to prevent breaking any of them by applying too much pressure with the cloth.







, Houseplants with bristly leaves, such as African violets, can be dusted using a soft toothbrush.


Supporting the leaf with your free hand, clean it using gentle strokes of the toothbrush. Work from base to tip of each leaf. Clean the dust from the toothbrush occasionally.






In addition to a toothbrush, you can also use this technique with a soft-bristled paintbrush, a pipe cleaner, or even one of the plant's own fuzzy leaves.







, Houseplants with many small leaves, such as nerve plants, would be intensely time-consuming to clean leaf-by-leaf. Instead, these plants can be swished around in lukewarm water to remove dust.


Begin by filling a bucket with lukewarm water. Adding a few drops of mild dish soap will help clean the plant's leaves.






Supporting both the pot and the soil with your hands, turn the houseplant upside down and submerge its leaves into the bucket of water. Swish it around gently, and then allow it to air dry.







, Once a year, or every few years, use this method. It's ideal for plants that can get really dusty, such as Christmas cactus and Philodendron plants, especially when big.

Place the plants in a shower of tepid water. Set them on a waterproof stands if large.
Use a handheld shower (be careful to adjust the water temperature adequately) and gently spray the leaves to rinse off all grime and build-up. Don't spray too long.
Allow to drip dry.
Restore to their original place once dry.

, This process takes lots of time, and does not work for plants such as African Violets because the leaves are fuzzy.

Dust the leaves off first as well as spraying it with dishwashing soap and lukewarm water.
Put a bit of mayonnaise onto a wet cloth and wipe down each individual leaf. The oil in the mayo will create a shine on once dull-looking leaves!
Lightly wipe off the mayo with a cloth afterwards.

Experiment with analogous colors.,
Try out a monochromatic theme.,
Utilize complementary colors: These are colors opposite to each other on the color wheel.,
Get creative with your color scheme.",How to Design a Container Garden2," These are groups of three colors that are all next to each other on the color wheel. For instance, red, red-orange and orange. Warm colors, like red and yellow, are bright, and look good with terra cotta or wood. Cool colors, like blue or lavender, look tranquil and go with terra cotta, stone, or other cool colored containers.The color wheel is a concept that is part of color theory, which consists of a circular diagram of colors.

, For a modern feel, choose pots that are monochromatic. Monochromatic colors are different shades of one color. If you want it to look more interesting, you can use a contrasting container.


For example, your entire scheme could be made up of different shades of blue -- sky blue, midnight blue, navy blue, etc.
Another example would be a range of purple shades. For instance, deep purple, indigo, lavender and lilac shades.

, They have a vibrant look, but if you want it to look subtler, use colors that are not as bright or contrasting.


For example, you could pair together shades of both yellow and purple. Yellow with dark purple would more dramatic than yellow with lavender.
Another complementary color scheme would be shades of both blue and orange.

, You can use any combination of colors you want. For example, you could coordinate red, white, and blue. Or you could use your favorite combination of colors. Whether it is purple and orange or black and white, you can be as colorful or as simple as you like.

Arrange plants according to their “habit.” There are different ways to organize the plants within each container, usually according to size and habit.,
Arrange plants according to their size.,
Experiment with different textures.,
Arrange plants by function or color.",How to Design a Container Garden3," The different plant habits are upright, mounding, and trailing. You can use all three types of plants in your container.


One idea is to use a tall plant in the middle for the focal point, mounding plants to put around the focal point, and trailing plants to hang over the edges.Other terms used are “thriller,” “filler,” and “spiller.” Thrillers refer to the upright habits, fillers, refer to the mounding, and spiller refers to the trailing plants.

, You could put plants together that are all somewhat similar in size. You could also group plants together in a range of sizes that complement one another. For example, tall sunflowers could be in the same container with medium-height zinnias and small daises. You could use filler like baby's breath to round out the variety.

, Be creative and don’t be afraid to use plants of a variety of textures for the fillers and spillers. This will generally make the design look more natural and less contrived. For example, sweet potato vine is leafy and bright, creating a thick texture. You could contrast this with a brightly colored thriller, such as a bird of paradise. Ornamental grasses are also a good choice; they come in many different sizes, colors, and growth habits.

, Try planting a variety of herbs, since they have different textures, grow well together, look attractive and all share a similar function. You could also arrange different kinds of flowers in containers. Choose flowers with a variety of petal colors -- they could complement (or contrast) with one another.


For example, you could group a variety of herbs like lavender, thyme, basil, catnip and rosemary together.
If you wanted to try something visually appealing with flowers, try a few different types of blooms in a range of shades. For instance, for a purple theme, you could plant violets, purple pansies, irises, bell heather, verbena and lavender.

Arrange containers on your front porch.,
Create a group of hanging containers.,
Place containers on tables and other outdoor furniture.",How to Design a Container Garden4," Choose a color scheme that works well with your house and assemble your containers in an attractive arrangement on your front porch. You can even utilize your front porch steps, as well, to create different levels of height., Hanging baskets filled with blooms and vines can look gorgeous all by themselves, so assembling several together can look very striking. If possible, choose a place with a backdrop that will allow the colors of the plants to pop, such as in front of a white brick wall., Tabletop container gardens are popular, especially among those who have an outdoor table situated near their ground garden. The container garden that you assemble on and around the table can create bright focal points. Place the containers on wooden benches and other outdoor furniture to create an aesthetic around height differences."

Attach an air plant to a wall mount.,
Mount the decoration on the wall.,
Be creative with different types of wall mounts.",How to Decorate with Air Plants1," One way to decorate with air plants, is to mount them on your wall. Air plants do not grow roots, and as a result they can be attached to a variety of different objects and mounted on your wall as a form of wall art. Decorating with air plants using wall mounts is an excellent idea if you do not have a lot of space in your home or office. You can attach air plants to a panel of boards, a piece of driftwood, a seashell, a wreath, a wall sconce, a frame, or any object you desire.Once you have selected a suitable object, for example, driftwood, attach the air plant to that object. This can be done using glue, wire, twist ties, fishing line, nails or staples.
In this case you may want to glue the air plant onto the driftwood along with some other decorations.
If you are using wire, make sure that there is no copper in the wire because this can kill the plant.If you are using staples or nails, make sure that you attach the plant at the root. Nailing or stapling through the green base of the plant can kill it.;
, After you have attached the air plant to a desired object you can then hang the object on the wall. Choose a location that has good airflow and sunlight. Air plants do not require much water, but they do need minimal sunlight. When mounting an air plant display on your wall consider the following tips:Determine the surface material of the wall. Most houses will have drywall, but some older homes have plaster walls. Plaster is much thicker and may require a different type of nail. For instance, a push pin will not be sufficient for mounting on drywall.
Find a stud. When you are mounting something on a wall, you should always try and find a stud. This is especially important if you are hanging something heavy. In order to find a stud, you can use a stud finder, or you can simply knock on the drywall. Once you find a stud the knocking noise will change from hollow to solid. Studs help to anchor the mount to the wall.
Make sure there are no pipes or wires behind the mount. This can be done by using a stud finder. If you find there are a lot of wires in the area, then you should cut off the power to that area of the house while you are drilling.
Drill a hole and then fasten and anchor the mount to the wall.

, When you are decorating with air plants be creative. There are a variety of different ways that you can mount air plants onto your wall. For example, you could purchase or find a nice piece of driftwood. Fasten multiple different air plants onto the wood and also add some seashells and moss for added decoration. Here are some other creative ideas for air plant wall mounts:Fasten a number of air plants directly to the wall using nails or staples. You can arrange them in a cluster or space them evenly apart. Then choose a frame and hang the frame around the plants. This will give the look of a living picture.Purchase a wreath made of twigs and fasten a number of air plants to the wreath to give it some colour and life. You can hang the wreath on the wall or door.
Purchase a variety of seashell and fasten a magnet to the back of the shell. Place a single air plant into the shell’s opening and then mount it on your fridge. These make stylish fridge magnets.

Choose a unique base for air plants.,
Create an air plant terrarium.,
Make an air plant centerpiece.",How to Decorate with Air Plants2," Air plants can also be used as table top decorations. Because these plants are so versatile you can essentially attach them to any type of base and situate them on a bookshelf, coffee table, countertop, or bedside table. Air plants can be displayed on decorative plates, in transparent vessels or cups, or placed directly on furniture. When choosing a unique base for air plants consider the colour scheme of the room, and the amount of space you have. Here are some unique ways that you can decorate by displaying air plants:Partially fill a glass container or vase with sand or rocks and then place an air plant inside the vase. You can display plants this way in a small group of three or four.
Select different colours of sand or rocks to make the display stand out. For example, fill one with light sand, another with clay coloured sand, and another with dark sand.Use a wooden bowl or ceramic dish and cover the bottom with moss, pebbles, or sand and then place air plants on top.
Recycle old tea cups by filling them with pebbles and topping them with an air plant.

, Another way that you can decorate with air plants is by making an air plant terrarium. Air plant terrariums can be purchased pre-made, in a DIY kit, or you can buy and collect each item separately in order to design your own unique terrarium. When buying or making a terrarium, make sure that the container you choose has plenty of holes to allow for airflow. Do not create a terrarium in a dome with no airflow. Air plants get most of their nutrients from the air and therefore require airflow.Try collecting rocks from the different places that you travel in order to add a personal touch your DIY terrarium.
Find a unique glass container to use for the terrarium.
Add shells or larger rocks to create a focal point within the terrarium.
Use a variety of air plants to create a diverse looking terrarium.

, Air plants can also be used as a centerpiece for your next big dinner party. If you want to create a rustic and simple centerpiece using air plants, try this DIY design.Purchase three white pillar candles of various heights and encircle them with a glass pillar.
Choose a variety of large and small air plants and place them directly on the table around the three candles like a wreath.
This will give your dinner table a rustic feel.
Alternatively, if you have a rectangular table, you can line up the pillar candles lengthwise across the table and sprinkle the air plants throughout in a random pattern. This is a simple way to decorate using air plants.
Be creative and come up with your own idea for a table centerpiece that uses air plants.

Select a hanging vessel for air plants.,
Hang the plants from the ceiling.,
Reinforce heavier hanging displays.",How to Decorate with Air Plants3," You can also decorate with air plants by hanging them from the ceiling in a variety of different vessels. For instance, you can purchase glass globes with a small hole in them for airflow. Place an air plant inside the globe and hang them by a window. This is a simple and elegant way to decorate with air plants and does not take up much space in your home. Here are a few other suggestions for hanging air plants:Use a macrame hanging planter. Place air plants in a pod or small pot and hang them from a macrame hanging planter. These can come in a variety of colours and will add texture and vibrancy to a forgotten corner in your house.Attach air plants to any form of hanging decoration. For example, you could add air plants to wind chimes or other hang decorations both inside and outside.

, In order to hang your air plant displays from the ceiling, you need to take into consideration the weight of the object you are hanging. Typically anything under five pounds can be hung using a toggle bolt. To use a toggle bolt, simply drill a hole in the desired location. Then pinch the toggle end of the bolt together and push it through the hole. Once it is through the toggle with snap into place. Pull on the screw gently to ensure it is secure., For hanging displays that weigh more than five pounds, you will need to use a stud finder to locate the ceiling beam. This will ensure that you are hanging the object from a beam and not just relying on the plaster or dry wall. Then use an eye-bolt with lag threads to attach to the wooden frameLag screws are much larger than regular screws and are used primarily for load bearing purposes. You can find them at your local hardware store.
Drill completely through the beam and then insert the screw.

Grow a vegetable garden in containers.,
Plant herbs such as parsley, rosemary, basil, mint, and dill in pots.,
Choose from among a myriad of annual flowers to use in containers.,
Use good potting soil and be sure to allow enough room in the container for the root system of the plant you are potting.,
Consider planting perennials in containers.,
Remember to use ornamental grasses and plants with interesting or colorful foliage as well.,
Maintain your container plant by regularly checking for pest infestation and disease.",How to Choose Plants for Outdoor Containers," Many vegetables do well in containers. Tomatoes, peppers, onions, beans, lettuce and squash are typical vegetables which can be container grown.

Climbing plants like cucumbers and pole beans need a trellis or fence upon which to grow.



 


Small fruited tomatoes such as cherry tomatoes do well in hanging baskets.





;
, Keep herbs pruned to keep them from over growing. Use them regularly to season your cooking.

,

Snapdragons, zinnias, petunias, geraniums, and marigolds are among the flowers that do well as potted plants. Cosmos, coreopsis and periwinkles are also good choices.






Be sure to place shade loving plants such as impatiens or begonias where they get only partial sun.






Plant taller flowers in the center of the pot and surround them with shorter plants. Cascading flowers are especially good to use in a container such as a hanging basket or window box.






An advantage to planting flowers in containers is that you can easily move them around to take advantage of sun and rain or to protect them from strong winds or hail. Placing a very large container on wheels will allow you to move it easily as well.







, Water and fertilize as the requirements of your plant dictates.

, Choose those that need only moderate watering and have longer blooming seasons.


Be sure your container will contain an expanding root system as a perennial plant can live and grow for years.
Since your perennial plant can be overwintered and will grow for many seasons, planting perennials is practical and economical.
Lavender, yarrow, coneflowers, astilbe, hostas, and lilies are some perennials you may consider growing.
Plant a perennial shrub such a rose, hydrangea, or camellia in a container. Small fruit trees or citrus trees also do well as potted plants.
Many perennials can be divided and thinned to make new plants which makes them an even more practical choice.

, Coleus plants have a range of bright foliage from which to choose. Ivies and even cactus also are good candidates for your container garden.

, Since plants in containers tend to dry out rapidly, use a water retaining potting mix or mulch. Placing plants in larger pots also helps keep them from drying out too easily.

Decide how you would prefer your plants to look.,
Check your plant’s needs.,
Grow your own food.,
Choose plants that are easy to care for.,
Choose plants best suited for your environment.,
Choose what kind of basket you will use.,
Select plants that can be moved.,
Monitor the amount of sunlight your plants will receive.,
Decide on your hanging planter’s placement.,
Give your plants room to grow.,
Put similar types of plants together.",How to Choose Outdoor Hanging Plants," Once you have identified plants best suited for your environment, choose what you want them to look like. Certain plant species will grow over the sides of a hanging basket, while other species will look more like a floating bush. Some species may flower, while others will not.


Certain vine species, such as Impatiens, bloom with beautifully colored flowers. Choose these, or similar varieties, if you are looking to add some color to your garden.Petunias grow in a bush shape and will bloom often with many different colored flowers. Petunias are a low maintenance plant, and will attract hummingbirds to your hanging garden.Make practical use of your hanging garden by growing cherry tomatoes. Your tomato plant will use the vertical space to grow, and with plenty of water, will yield a good harvest of rich tomatoes.;
, Read the tags on all hanging baskets carefully. Even if you find a pre-planted outdoor hanging basket that would beautifully compliment your garden or house, if it does not receive the amount of sunlight it requires, it will not grow well. The tag will also instruct you on the use of fertilizer and the frequency of watering. Choose plants that are well suited for where you intend to hang them.

, Make use of the vertical space available in a hanging garden by planting fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Not only will your plants look beautiful, but you'll also reap the benefits of growing your own food. With plenty of water and care, you can also pull in a large harvest at the end of a season.


Strawberries will grow well in a hanging basket. Strawberry plants are low maintenance and will cover the edges of your hanging basket.Eggplants are a great choice for a veggie to grow in a hanging basket, as the elevation will provide more warmth and help the plant to ripen for harvest, sooner than planting them in the ground.Plant mint in your hanging basket for a gorgeous plant that will grow quickly and easily, while providing a fresh addition to your kitchen. Make sure to plant mint and peppermint by themselves, as they are known for strangling other plants growing near them., After you have identified plants that will thrive in the climate you live in, consider how much time you have to devote to maintaining your plants. Certain plants are low maintenance and easy to care for, such as petunias or jade, while other hanging plants require more time for care, such as azaleas. Plants that are low maintenance are best for hanging planters.

, Consult a guide to help find what “plant hardiness zone” you live in. This will help you to identify which plants will thrive in your garden.Depending on where you live, it may be better to choose plants that can withstand hotter or colder temperatures. To find out what plant hardiness zone you live in, consult the USDA’s map of hardiness zones at http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/.


For climates with temperatures that are consistently higher, focus on choosing heat tolerant plants such as Angel’s Trumpets or Plumbago.Succulents are also low maintenance plants that thrive in high temperatures.For climates with temperatures that are consistently lower, focus on plants that can survive the cold, such as a Siberian Iris or Lily of the Valley,If you live in a drier climate, choose plants that do not require daily watering, such as succulents. Many species of succulents can survive in arid weather and high heat, making them ideal for drier climates.
If you live in a more tropical climate, choose plants that can sustain heavy rains and humidity, such as begonias.

, Decide if you want an open or solid basket. Consider if you have time to devote to watering your hanging plants every day. Open baskets are better suited for plants that require maintenance and care every day, whereas solid baskets may be better for plants that require less attention to thrive.Open baskets are usually made with a mesh and lined with soil. Because the water drips through the planter and evaporates, they must be watered regularly, and may be less well suited for drier climates.
A solid basket is filled with soil and needs to be watered much less often, but also may not be suited for plants who are more prone to mildew damage. These pots are best suited for a drier climates., Hanging outdoor plants have the convenience of easy mobility. If you live in a climate that has any sort of extreme temperature shifts, choose plants that can also thrive inside if necessary. If you live in a more temperate region that does not often experience temperature shifts, make sure to select plants that are best suited for a temperate climate.


Petunias are a great example of low maintenance plant that grows best when in direct sunlight, but can also thrive near a window if necessary.
Wandering Jew plants have beautiful purple and green leaves that sparkle in the light. They are versatile enough to grow outside in any amount of sunlight, but can also grow well inside.

, Make sure when you are hanging your baskets that you are considering how the sunlight will affect the basket at all times of the day. Certain plants prefer morning sunlight to afternoon sunlight, while some grow best in complete shade. Before you place your baskets, consider how the sunlight will hit the baskets in the areas you've chosen.


If your hanging garden receives the most sunlight during the early hours of the day, try planting Morning Glories in your hanging basket. Morning Glories are fast growers, with beautiful flowers that grow in shades of pink, periwinkle, blue and white.If your hanging garden receives lots of sunlight throughout the day, be sure to choose plants that can beat the heat. Plant succulents that need minimal water, such as a Painted Lady or Jade. If you prefer plants with more flowers, try growing Australian Daisies, which may be purple, yellow, or light blue in color.
If your hanging garden receives most of its sunlight in the afternoon, choose plants that prefer the shade, such as an Autumn Fern, which grows in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Purple Heart Plants also prefer the shade, and grow in rich hues of violet and lavender.

, Choose a spot based on the amount of sunlight your hanging plants will need. When you are selecting a spot for hanging plants, make sure you can easily access the basket to water and care for your plants. Keep in mind that where you choose to place the hanger may have more or less sunlight depending on the time of day, which can affect the growth of your plants.

, Consider how much room there is for growth in the place you have selected. Many hanging baskets draw their beauty because they grow and hang over the side of the planter, often nearly covering the basket. Ensure you have enough space to support this growth before choosing vine-like plants.


If you need a bit more room below your hanging basket, choose hanging baskets with adjustable straps, so that you can hang the basket higher or lower, depending on how large or long your plant grows.

, Group plants with similar needs together, if you choose to plant them in the same pot. Place plants that need full sunlight together or group shade plants together. Do not mix these varieties, as certain plants may damage others. Be sure that the varieties are not mixed in pre-planted hanging baskets.There are certain plants that can be planted together without causing damage to each other, and may even benefit each other by using opposite soil resources in the pots.Certain herbs will do well together, such as basil and thyme, while on the other hand, certain species such as Kudzu and Pepperweed may kill any plant also growing near it."

Use your aloe plant to heal burns.,
Make face masks, hair conditioner, soap, and much more.",How to Care for Your Aloe Vera Plant," A sunny kitchen window or another sunny place in your house is perfect for an aloe plant. Aloe also does fine in areas with indirect sunlight. Aloe in full shade will not thrive, so make sure there's a least a little sun in the room where you place the aloe.


You can move the plant outdoors in the summer months as long as there is no chance of frost. Aloe plants are made up of 95 percent water, and even a slight frost will freeze them and turn them to mush.If you live in a warm growing zone and are planting your aloe outdoors, choose a place that gets full sun (six to eight hours of sunlight a day).;
, Aloe plants are pretty low-maintenance, since they don't require much water. Wait until the soil is dry at least two inches below the surface, then water slowly and deeply until you see water coming through the drainage holes. Do not water the aloe again until the soil is dry at least two inches below the surface once more. In most environments this equates to watering once every week and a half to two weeks, and less in the winter.If you've just repotted your aloe, wait two or three days before watering. This gives the roots time to adjust to the new soil before taking in water.
When in doubt, water less, not more. When aloe is overwatered, the roots begin to rot, and the plant eventually dies. It's better to wait a few extra days if you're not sure whether it's time to water.
If you truly love your aloe plant, consider using rainwater. When it rains, the aloe gets watered, and when it doesn't the aloe goes without. This replicates the aloe's natural environment., From April through September, the aloe will grow vigorously. You can help it along if you'd like by providing some fertilizer twice a month during these months. Dilute a 15-30-15 fertilizer by mixing it with water, one part fertilizer to five parts water. Deliver the fertilizer on the days when you water.


Stop fertilizing during the winter, since the plant can't use fertilizer when it isn't actively growing., Aloe plants often come in flimsy and small plastic pots when you first buy them. To help your aloe last for years, it's a good idea to repot it in in a bigger pot where it will have more room. If the aloe is already in a large, sturdy clay pot with holes in the bottom, you don't necessarily need to repot it.

, Aloe, like other cacti, prefer dry, sandy soil, and they don't do well in the rich moisture of regular potting soil. Check your garden store for a mix made especially for cacti or succulents, plants that store their water and prefer their roots to be dry instead of wet.


If you live in growing zones 10 to 11, where there is no chance of freezing, you can grow your aloe outdoors as a garden plant instead of as an indoor house plant. Amend the soil by breaking it up and working in a bag of soil for succulents. If the soil where you live is extra rich and wet, work in some sand to make sure it's well-draining., The root ball is the mixture of roots and dirt at the base of the aloe plant. Aloe loves to spread out and grow, so you want to choose a big pot that gives your plant plenty of room. Get a clay pot with drainage holes and a tray to place underneath to catch the soil and water.


After several months or a year of care, you might notice your aloe plant is starting to outgrow its pot. If the aloe leaves are as tall as the pot, it's time to graduate your plant to a bigger container. Buy a new pot that's three times as large as the current size of the root ball and repot it.

, Fill the pot partially with soil, then set the aloe's root ball right in the middle. Place more soil around the root ball, all the way up to the base of the leaves. Pat it lightly with your hands to keep the aloe plant in place.

, This will help to hold in moisture and replicate the aloe's natural environment. Choose any type of small pebbles, rocks or shells that you like. Press them lightly into the soil at the base of the plant.

, These are the tiny aloe plants that sprout from the main plant. When you see a baby that has fully formed, detach it from the mother plant, taking care not to break the roots. Set it on a clean, dry shelf to let it callous over for a couple of days. Then repot it in a small pot using potting soil for succulents or cacti.


If the baby has no roots, you can still propagate it. Fill a small pot with the correct potting soil and place the baby cut-side down on top of the soil. Instead of watering it, spritz it with water every few days. Eventually you should see some roots start to sprout. When you do, you can pot it in the soil.

, Aloe plants can be very handy to have around since they provide immediate relief for sunburns and other types of burns. If you spent a day in the sun and your skin is red, break off an aloe leave and rub it over your skin, or squeeze the gel from the plant and rub it in. The area where you broke the leaf will callous over an the plant will be just fine.


You can place the broken-off leaf in the refrigerator to cool it down, then rub it over your burn.
Don't use aloe on open skin or wounds that are below the surface of your skin. Use it only on surface burns. If you have a major burn, see a doctor instead.

, Aloe vera gel is a wonderful natural moisturizer, making it the perfect ingredient to add to all sorts of body products. You can use pure aloe gel on your skin as a moisturizer or mix it with other ingredients to make masks and other products. Try the following concoctions:


Aloe face mask: mix 1 teaspoon aloe gel, 1 teaspoon honey, and 1 teaspoon cosmetic clay. Apply to your face for 15 minutes, then rinse.
Aloe hair conditioner: mix 1 teaspoon aloe gel, 1 teaspoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon honey. Smooth into your hair for 1 hour, then shampoo as usual.
Aloe skin cream: mix 1 teaspoon aloe gel and 1 teaspoon coconut oil. Smooth onto your hands and feet.

You should look for a container that has drain holes at the bottom so the water drains through the soil when you water your mini garden.Terracotta pots are ideal, as they often come with drainage holes and are good for holding potting soil. Look for a terracotta pot that will hold several small plants, as you want your container to be big enough to house your mini garden.
You may decide to repurpose a broken clay pot by using it for your mini garden, especially if it is only broken on one side. You can then prop the broken piece up and add it to your mini garden as a unique, fun feature.;
, You will need regular potting soil to lay down at the bottom of your container. You can find potting soil at your local plant nursery or in the gardening section of your local hardware store.You should also pick up small stones of various colors and textures to lay down in your garden as decoration.
If you are planning to a glass bowl to house your mini garden, you should get horticultural charcoal in addition to potting soil. The horticultural charcoal will help your plants grow better in the glass container. You can then lay down the horticultural charcoal and the stones at the bottom of your glass bowl or container., When it comes to selecting plants for your garden, you should go for plants that will stay small and require very little trimming. You should also choose plants that are easy to grow in a small space and that will produce attractive blooms. Possible plants for your mini garden include:Herbs like thyme, basil, rosemary, sage, lavender and oregano
Lemon-scented geraniums
Firecracker plants
Dwarf licorice
Marjoram
Miniature orchids and miniature ferns
Begonias
Spider plants
Moss and lichens
Winter greens
African violets

, Start by rinsing and drying the container you are using for your mini garden. Fill the container with potting soil up to the rim. You can make the potting soil slightly higher on one side if you would like your plants to be visible from the side.Use a small knife or a small shovel to dig small holes for the roots of the plants. Space out the plants so they are not in one cluster in the pot.
You may also want to lay out the mini garden before you plant anything by noting where you are going to place your plants and your accessories. You can then make holes in the potting soil based on your design.

, If you are using a glass container, you should lay a one-inch (2.5 centimeter) layer of small stones on the bottom of the container first. This will ensure your plants get enough nutrients in the glass container. It will also help your plants drain properly.Then, add a half-inch (1.3 centimeter) layer of horticultural charcoal. Finally, add in a three to four inch (7.6-10.16 centimeter) layer of potting soil.

, Once you have laid down the soil, you will need to prepare the plants. This will ensure they grow healthy and beautiful in your mini garden.Start by taking the plants out of their pots. Avoid touching or breaking the root ball. Then, use small a pair of garden shears to trim any damaged leaves off the plants.

, Place the plants in the prepared holes. Once the plants are in place, pat soil over the roots.Try to place taller plants in the back of the garden and shorter plants in front. You should try to have a variety of plants in each area so your garden showcases interesting patterns and colors.
If your container has a narrow opening, you can use a pair of chopsticks or the end of a long paintbrush to position your plants in the soil.
Water the plants after you are done.

, You can get creative by putting miniature accessories among the plants in your mini garden. Almost anything can be used as an accessory in your garden, as long as it is miniature in size.You may also decide to add miniature structures to your garden, like a miniature bridge, a miniature fence, or a miniature set of tables and chairs. Maybe you decide to add in miniature figures and create a garden scene, complete with miniature food items.If you are going for a more minimal mini garden, you may decide to add simple elements like marbles, beads, or decorative pieces of wood.

, Once your plants have been added, you can decorate the garden with rocks and figurines. Try out a few different accessories next to your plants to see what might work best.You may decide to accessorize with simple items like decorative rocks, twigs, and colored stones or marbles. Get creative and make the garden appear colorful and fun.

, If you are going for a certain theme for your garden, you may add in accessories that fit the theme. Decorating based on a theme can make your garden feel cohesive and artistic.One popular theme for mini gardens is a fairy-garden theme, complete with mini benches, mini rocking chairs, mini painted eggs, and mini garden gnomes.
You may also go for a woodland garden look, complete with tree stumps, a mini wrought iron fence, and small fairy figurines., You can also add in a stone pathway in your garden for a more permanent accessory. You can use small stones to create a pathway or a mixture of stones and marbles.Use a small shovel to draw lines in the soil to mark where the pathway is going to go in the garden. Then, lay down the stones to form a path. Keep the stones close together so they form a pathway.
Use stones of various colors or mix marbles with the stones to create a colorful pathway in your garden.

, Once you have completed your mini garden, you should place it outside or inside on a flat surface, like a table or the ground. Keep the garden in indirect sunlight so the plants still get some sun.If you are keeping the mini garden by a window facing south, place a window shade or a lightweight curtain over the window. This will block out any direct sunlight and only allow indirect light to filter in.
South-facing windows with a shade or curtain may still provide too much light. You may decide to place the mini garden by an east or west-facing window, as this angle will provide enough indirect light for most of the year.
Avoid north-facing windows. North-facing windows usually do not get enough indirect sunlight year round to sustain plants.

, You should always check the soil in the mini garden periodically to ensure it is not too dry. Keep the soil damp by running water through the pot once the soil feels dry around the roots of the plants.Depending on the types of plants in your mini garden, you may have to water some plants more often than others. If there are any succulents in your mini garden, for example, they may not require as much watering as herbs or other plants in your garden. Make sure you follow the watering directions recommended on the label of the plant.
If you used a glass bowl for your plants, water slowly. Stop when you see water reach the stones at the bottom of the bowl.

, As your mini garden grows and thrives, the leaves of some of your plants may start to overcrowd your container. To keep them under control, you should trim the plants using small gardening shears."

Keep potting soil moist, but not wet.,
Stick your finger in the soil to determine how wet it is below the surface.,
Use water that is at room temperature.,

Learn your plant's classification.,
Realize not all plants on sale as indoor or houseplants are long term residents.,
Determine if your plant is a green foliage plant or a plant that has flowers.,
Choose a plant that's easy to care for.",How to Care for Indoor Plants," If your soil is either too dry or over watered, it can damage the plant’s roots and prevent the plant from growing. In some cases under or over watering your plant can also kill it. Plants with lush, thick leaves require more water than plants with waxy or leathery leaves.There is no specific frequency that works for all indoor plants. Instead, what you must do is determine what kind of plant you have, and follow guidelines on how often to water it by doing research on it’s specific type.


If mold starts to form on the surface of the soil or there’s standing water at the bottom of the container, you’ve over watered your plant.
Water your plant if the soil becomes lighter in color or cracked.Plants in the succulent family require periods of dryness between watering.If you notice standing water in or under the the pot, empty it out, so that your plant is not sitting in it. Standing water can kill plants.;
, If you poke your finger into the soil up to your knuckle, you can feel if your plant needs more water. If the soil feels damp, then you don’t need to water it. If it feels dry then it’s likely you need to water it. Again, this varies from plant to plant. These conditions will work for most plants but not all of them.
Signs of over-hydration include discolored leaves, lack of leaf growth, loss of leaves, and soft rotten patches.
Signs of dehydration include slow leaf growth, brown and dried leaf edges, and and lower leaves becoming yellow and curled., 68° F or 20° C is the best temperature to keep the water that you’re using to water your plants.You can use a thermometer to determine the temperature of the water, or you can leave the water out, after you pour it, and allow it to become room temperature.


If your water is too hot it can cause root damage and plant shock, potentially killing your indoor plant.
Water that is too cold causes dormancy in your plant, which will stifle any existing and future vegetation.

, Moisture meters are the most accurate way to determine how hydrated your plants are. The mechanism probes the underlying soil to give you a reading on how hydrated your soil is.You can buy a moisture meter online, in a home and gardening store, and certain department stores.

, The amount of drainage in the pot you're keeping your plant in is very important because over or under watering your plant can damage or kill it. Make sure that there are drainage holes at the bottom of your pot.


Materials like plastic, metal, and glass will absorb much less water than ceramic or clay, so keep this in mind as well. Make sure that there are holes in the bottom of the pot so that the water can drain. If you are using a cachepot (which has no holes), water can build up and kill your plant.

, Plants require sunlight in order to undergo photosynthesis.The quality, duration, and intensity of light all affect a plant's growth.


Avoid putting the plant in direct sunlight. Instead, give them plenty of indirect light by putting them in a well-lit room. Fluorescent lights can work as an alternative to sunlight for some plants.
Give flowering plants 12-16 hours of light per day.
Give foliage plants 14-16 hours of light per day., Plants acclimate themselves to their surroundings fairly slowly, so it’s best that you don’t move them around a lot.This also includes putting it in a place where there would be a drastic change in temperature.


Moving a plant suddenly from a darker area to a sun rich area will have a negative effect on the plant.If you want to move the plant, take it to the new area for an hour a day. Slowly increase the amount of time it is left in the new area until it has fully adjusted.

, Dry air may serve certain plants well, like cacti, but most plants require humidity, especially tropic plants. You can buy a room humidifier with a cool mist, and make sure it’s close enough to provide moisture in the air to the plant, but not get the foliage or flowers wet.


A cheaper option to buying a humidifier is to fill a tray with pebbles. Add water just up below the tops of the pebbles. As the water evaporates, it will humidify the room.
You can also fill a spray bottle with distilled water, and mist the plants to give them extra moisture.
Wilting, browned leaves, and flower buds that develop poorly are signs that your plant is suffering from low humidity.
Grouping your plants together helps raise humidity., Most houseplants thrive in balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer. House plants need the nutrients from potting soils and fertilizers in order to survive. If you don’t repot the plant, or add new nutrients to the soil, the plant will eventually die. The first number stands for nitrogen, second number for phosphorus, and the third for potassium.


If you have a flowering plant, you can buy a fertilizer that is high in potassium.
If you have a foliage plant, you should get a fertilizer or potting soil high in Nitrogen.
Plants also require micronutrients that need to be replenished by adding potting soil or fertilizer in order to survive.Cacti or succulents require a special potting mix specifically designed to drain water efficiently. They also need pots with plenty of holes on the bottom. These prevent too much moisture from being held in the soil, which can kill the plants., Certain plants must have their roots pruned at different intervals, so it’s important to read up on how often you should be pruning your plant. A plant that isn't pruned can grow out of control, and the roots from a plant can outgrow their pot or vase. Regularly prune your plant to keep it healthy, and to prevent yourself from having to replant.Cut off dead branches or stems that can attract bugs.
Prune above the a leaf node at a 45° angle to promote growth of a fuller more robust plant., Putting coffee or tea into your potted plant will draw flies that can eat away at your indoor plant. Sugars make it a perfect breeding ground for these insects as well.While some people claim that adding coffee grounds is good for plants, doing this to plants that have a low acidic tolerance can actually kill them., There are a variety of online encyclopedias you can find that will detail how you should care for the specific type of houseplant you own, including recommended humidity levels, sunlight exposure guidelines, and watering guides.Since many houseplants differ, it’s important to find what is ideal for your specific type of houseplant.

Most houseplants come with a tag that will have their common and scientific name. If it doesn’t, ask the florist you got it from. The scientific name consist of two parts the genus and species. For example, Spathiphyllum wallisii is the scientific name for peace lily. Many plant names like poinsettia and begonia are both common names and scientific names. If you see a x, third name or a name in quotation marks it's a cultivar, hybrid or subspecies (in easy terms, a special breed).
Some plant types however will leave the plant stumped with general names like general foliage, assorted palms, or desert cacti. With reference and advice from a garden pro, you can learn to identify many genus (if not the exact species) by looking at them.
If you were given a houseplant and are unsure of what type it is, go through the photos in a flower book, encyclopedia, handbook of house plants and find the picture that best matches your plant.
Get the name of the exact species and cultivar to make sure you get the right plant. A genus can have a group of a million species and cultivars within it. Some species or cultivars are less difficult to grow in the house than others or the original species. Also there are many different sizes and growth rates. Some ficus species grow into huge trees over time and others are creeping vines. Same goes for the Philodendron and Anthurium groups.

, Many of the plants on the market as house plants do not really belong in the indoor environment. In fact many people unknowingly buy these species and it likely dies on them. The people get discouraged and never want to buy indoor plants again.

Many flowering houseplants are annuals that (living on year then dying). Persian violet and ornamental pepper plants die after flower and need to be thrown out. Bromeliads die after flowering but will produce little plantlets, called pups, that can be separated from the mother plant and potted up or left on.
Others such as mini roses, hydrangea, and living Christmas trees are hardy perennials shrubs or trees that really want to go outside and live there like their outdoor counterparts. Same goes for tulips, lilies, daffodils and other spring blooming fall bulbs.
Many other plants are tropical shrubs, bulbs and perennials that, after a period of attractive bloom, go through a not-so-attractive period and need special pampering to return to their previous state. The very popular Poinsettia (sold around Christmas time), caladiums, and the vast number of summer/tropical bulbs like clivia, gladious and calla lilies are examples of this.
Then there are others that don't keep their attractive looks over a year or two despite the best care and need to be replaced with new ones. Coleus, pilea, Herbst's bloodleaf, and rex begonias are examples of this group.
Most plants sold in mixed species baskets or pots need to be separated. They are group for appearance and not the requirements of the species. This exclude desert plantings or tropical terrarium specialty plantings.

, Green foliage plants and flowering houseplants are different and require different nutrients, as well as different levels of water and sunlight.Most of the indoor plant species that the houseplant consumer runs into are a member of a large group called angiosperms or flowering plants. However, not all angiosperms produce attractive flowers or desirable blooms. Also, if kept indoors, many species never reach fruiting age.
Angiosperms that are grown for flowers and or fruit include various species of jasmine, peace lilies, clivia, poinsettias, flamingo flowers, and amaryllis. Most orchids also belong to this group.
Angiosperms that are grown for foliage include Chinese evergreens, marantas, calathea, spider plants, draceanas, English ivies, and the two popular groups of palms and ficus.
In some cases, the species possess attractive leaves and flowers. The huge genus of Begonias as a great example of this. Others include cacti, succulents, and many cultivars bred to produce multicolor or variegated leaves.
Gymnosperms are plants that don't produce flowers but produce seed cases called cones. The conifers, like pines and spruces, are examples of such plants. The popular ""Christmas Tree,"" called the Norfolk Island pine, and its close relative the monkey puzzle, are also included. The sago palm is not a palm tree at all put a member of the cycad group, along with the ""ZZ Plant."" These take years to produce cones and therefore are foliage plants.
Ferns belong to a group not related to angiosperms or gymnosperms. These guys as well as some plants, referred to as moss, produce spores not flowers or cones. These are also considered foliage plants.
Some plants are marketed as something they are not. Some companies and florist will attach flowers to cacti or any plant to make it look like it's blooming. Lucky bamboo is not a grass or a bamboo species, but a species of Dracena or related plant. Some companies also will paint or dye the flowers or leaves of a plant in order to make the buyer think it's the plant natural colors. Dying flowers is no big deal but painting a plant blocks light the needs for to make food.

, Certain tropical plants require specific environments in order to thrive, while other plants like geraniums, sago palms, pothos, and cast-iron plants are low maintenance, durable, and are easy to care for. Most cacti and succulents also offer fantastic shapes and variety of foliage and are easy to grow as well.Other good plants that require low light include the snake plant, dracaena, and spider plant.Chinese evergreen or painted drop tongue (Aglaonema), commonly seen in public displays, is another easy low light plant that only doesn't like cold damp conditions. It drops its lower leaves over time but can easily be rooted in water.

Determine the types of plants that thrive in your climate or region.,
Determine whether you want plants that provide shade or sunlight for your home.,
Select landscape plants you have time to manage.,
Determine whether you want colorful plants in your landscape.,
Select landscape plants that will not disrupt the foundation of your home.",How to Select Landscape Plants," The landscape plants you choose should be compatible with the weather and climate of the region in which you live. For example, if you live in a region with snowy weather and freezing temperatures, plant pine trees instead of palm trees, which thrive in tropical regions with warmer weather.


Speak with an associate at your local nursery or gardening shop to determine the types of plants that grow best in your climate.
Verify your climate type by visiting the ""Landscape Design"" website listed in the Sources section of this article. An interactive climate map can be found by clicking on the ""planting zone"" link within the body of that particular article.;
,


Choose tall, full trees that provide shade if you live in an extremely hot and sunny climate, or if you want your home or yard to have the extra privacy provided by these types of plants.
Choose small shrubbery and other flowers or small plants for your landscape if you want lots of sunlight to enter your home; as tall, full trees or bushes may block the sunlight from entering through your windows.
Verify that the plants you choose for your landscape will grow to a width and height that will satisfy your needs in terms of providing shade or sunlight for your home.

, Some plant breeds may require constant pruning, watering, and other types of maintenance; whereas other plants will thrive naturally with little to no maintenance on your behalf.


Determine if additional maintenance for your plants is required during certain seasons. For example, if you live in a climate in which trees will shed their leaves during autumn, you may be required to spend time raking up the fallen leaves from your lawn during these months.
Consult with a nursery or gardening shop to learn of the maintenance required by certain plants.

, In some cases, you may want to choose plants or flowers with colors that compliment one another or the color of your home's paint job.


Verify whether the plants or flowers you choose maintain their color all year long or if the plants are seasonal, as this factor may impact your decision when choosing certain plants.
Select landscape plants or flowers with contrasting colors that compliment one another or that blend well together. The color wheel located on the ""Landscape Design"" website in the Sources section of this article can help you with choosing particular colors for your landscape.

Grow a snake plant.",How to Choose Houseplants for the Bathroom2," This small, shrub-like tree grows well in moist climates that receive limited amounts of sunlight. Because it naturally grows in the tropical climates of Africa, this plant will enjoy the extra moisture of your bathroom. However, it may not be suitable for smaller bathrooms considering that its leaves can grow to be 24 inches (64cm) long. This plant can grow to be 7 feet (2m) tall. However, it grows very slowly. The plant will take several years to reach its full height.
You can keep this plant in a windowsill for the first few years you own it but you will eventually want to put it on the ground.

, This flowering plant will thrive in the moist climate of your bathroom. This plant is also a great idea if your bathroom occasionally gets on the cold side since it normally grows in temperatures between 53-70 °F (12-22 °C). This plant also needs minimal light but will do best when placed on a windowsill.Because it is a flowering plant, removing faded flowers and leaves will improve its health.

, This flowering, ivy-like plant will grow well in a cool, moist bathroom. Because of its trailing stems, you will likely want to hang this plant from the ceiling in a pot. If you place it near your shower rod, the stems can grow out along it.Although this plant typically struggles in temperatures above 65°F (18°C), the extra moisture of your bathroom should keep it healthy.
Be sure to trim off any wilted leaves or flowers.

, This low-light plant is also an extremely low-maintenance choice. It needs little watering beyond your bathroom’s humidity and it will not grow very large.

Plants that need direct sunlight will do well in a windowsill. It also helps to have mirrors in your bathroom that can catch and reflect the sunlight coming in your windows., Most bathrooms do not have an overabundance of space. Because of this, you may want to consider installing some simple selves. You can attach floating selves to your walls or purchase shelving at your local hardware store. This will free up floor space and provide an area where your plants are out of the way.Shelves are a great location to keep plants that need indirect sunlight.

Cut branches off a boxwood plant.,
Crush the end of your boxwood stems.,
Choose a container for the glycerin solution.",How to Preserve Boxwood Cuttings1," Select branches that are in good condition and carefully cut them off with a sharp knife or garden shears. Keep in mind that you can preserve many cuttings at once, so don’t be afraid to select multiple branches. Continue to sever the branches off your boxwood plant until you have enough to complete your project.For the best results, you should treat high-quality cuttings as soon as they have been cut. Keep in mind that the treatment will not hide discoloration or dried leaves.
If you’re using the cuttings for a project, you can adjust the size after they’ve been preserved.
You can also buy high-quality cutting from home and gardening stores.;
, Re-cut the end of each stem before placing it in the solution, by cutting off approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm). Then, use a mallet or hammer to crush the ends of the stems. When placed in the solution, the crushed ends will absorb more of the glycerin solution., Find a container that you can use for several weeks to preserve your cuttings. Make sure to choose a plastic or glass container that is tall and narrow. Do not use a metal container. Choosing a tall and narrow container will allow for the stem to be immersed in a greater depth of the solution with minimal waste.


Rinse the container before using it.
Mason jars make for good containers when preserving your cuttings."

Avoid planting toxic plants.,
Remove plants that are spiky or sharp.,
Consider the main ground cover you use.,
Remove large rocks near trees that children might climb up.,
Seal up or remove a garden pond.,
Teach your kids about respecting animals and insects.,
Build a fence around your garden.,
Protect your plants from getting trampled.",How to Plant a Child Friendly Garden1," A child-friendly garden should ideally be free from toxic plants, particularly ones that may look inviting. Plants with berries that look edible but are actually toxic should be avoided. These plants include nightshade, ivy, laburnum and yew.


It’s important to warn children about not touching plants such as poison ivy, nettles, and thistles as they may encounter these elsewhere (but hopefully not in your garden). Older children should be able to learn to avoid these plants without having to remove them from the garden.;
, You may also want to get rid of spiky plants and anything likely to prick or scratch your child. Young children learning to explore their environment are most likely to grab plants for support and are more likely to be stung or pricked.


Some plants that are sharp or have thorns include roses, yucca, raspberry and blackberry bushes, and a variety of cacti.

, Children are also likely to fall over, so keep the surface of your garden in mind. Gravel is painful to fall on and hard surfaces can make for a rough landing. Instead, play areas should ideally be grassed or covered with a softer surface such as bark chips rather than gravel.


This is especially important under climbing frames or swings where falls are more likely.

, Children generally love to climb trees; while this is a wonderfully fun pastime, falls can occur. Try to minimize the danger of falling out of a tree by laying down soft ground around the base of the tree. This could include mulch or soft soil.


Remove rocks, spiky surfaces, and hard objects from under the base of the tree.

, An average of five children drown per year in the USA in garden ponds alone.Because of this, if you are trying to create a child-friendly garden, consider removing any installed pond or water feature that your garden may correctly house.


If you can’t remove the water feature, consider installing safety guards around your water feature that should help to keep your children from falling in. You should also consider installing a ladder on the edge of the pond or large fountain to make it easier to climb out of.
Children should always be supervised around water, even if the water is very shallow.

, If possible, try to eliminate infestations of biting insects, such as fire ants, from your garden. If elimination is not possible, teach your children to avoid getting close to insects or animals that might sting or bite them.


If you have a specific area in your garden where a stinging or biting insect has taken up residence, try to keep your child out of that area by putting up short-term fences, or supervise your child whenever he or she wanders into that section of the garden.

, Another aspect of keeping your child safe is to install a fence around your garden, particularly if you don’t have any fences separating your yard from the street.


Fences can help to keep intruding animals and people from wandering into your garden, while also making sure that your child doesn’t put him or herself in danger but leaving the yard.

, Not many plants will appreciate being trampled on or picked by children. How you handle this depends on the size of your garden and how you hope your children will entertain themselves in the garden. For instance, if you plan on having a part of the garden for your children to grow edible plants, consider placing a fence around the part of the garden that you don’t want them to pick (or try to eat).


If you have certain plants you don’t want trampled, consider giving those particular plants their own mesh fencing.

, On a day when you’re home, chart out where the shadows fall in your yard to make sure that your selected area does not fall under shade. You may find that during times you’re out of the house a large shadow covers your desired spot.If you live in a region that gets very cold, you also want to avoid areas susceptible to frost. Frost can destroy your rock garden, so choose a spot in your yard that is least likely to freeze over., Rock gardens need to allow the water to drain off in order to thrive. The plants that work best for a rock garden are drought-resistant, so make sure that they won’t drown in poorly drained soil.If you don’t find an area with good drainage, then you can build a raised bed., Protect your rock garden from competition by ensuring that it’s clear of weeds before you begin your planting. You can pull the weeds yourself or use a herbicide., You should have about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of stone to support your rock garden. You will cover this stone with your topsoil, plants, and selected stones., Include your rocks, the plants, and any shaded areas. If you are building a raised bed, factor that into your sketch.You can choose complementary plants, such as all flowers, or a layered design, which would include different types of plants with varying sizes.Great layering options include shrubs, flowers, mounded plants, and ground cover.
Choosing different types of plants and rocks creates visual interest and more accurately portrays natural growth., You can use any type of rock or stone, ranging from large boulders to gravel. For best results, choose a variety of sizes. Be sure to buy smaller rocks to support your large stones while also planning for stand-alone smaller rocks.Save money by recycling rocks and stones.Use varying sizes of stones for more visual interest., Use a light colored sand to recreate the designs from your sketch. The sand will help you place the heavier stones without risking having to move them., Use a shovel or trowel to create a small indention in the ground. Go beyond your base level of rock or gravel and into the dirt below so that your large stones will be stable. You only need to remove a few inches of dirt to create a resting place for your stones., Before you move your large stones into place, put smaller stabilizing rocks near the indention you created. Some of the rocks may need to be moved into place after you place the larger rock., Use a shovel or crowbar to move the large rocks in your chosen locations. After you have your large stone in place, reposition the smaller stabilizing rocks to help support the larger stones., Based on the design you created, place the rest of your stones into your plot. Think about where you will be doing your planting., Choose a top quality topsoil that meets the needs of the plants you’ve chosen. Your soil should cover at least one-third of the rock so that your stones will be stable in their positions. Keep the soil between your stones loose so that you can easily add your plants., You can either purchase compost or make your own. Use it to enrich your rock garden before you add your plants., Perennials will return year after year, making your rock garden resilient to the changing seasons.Popular perennials for rock gardens include rock cress, blanket flower, periwinkle, switchgrass, peonies, phlox, soapwort, coral bells, hardy hibiscus, oregano, and agave plants.
If you really want the look of your favorite annuals, add them sparingly to your garden. Plan to replant those areas each year as the plants succumb to the seasons.

, Rock gardens usually include plants that can thrive in harsh conditions, such as a mountain. Make sure that the plants you want to include in your rock garden are strong enough to thrive.Your rock garden should be low maintenance, so choose plants that are drought-resistant.Use the USDA plant hardiness guide by visiting http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/phzmweb/interactivemap.aspx.

, Buying the plants at one time will help you visualize how they will look together, but it is possible to plant it in sections if you are working on a large plot.

, Don’t remove the plants from their temporary pots. Use your garden hose, flower pail, or a cup to wet the dirt.Once your rock garden is planted, how often you need to water your plants depends on your climate and plant choices. Because rock gardens are meant to be drought-resistant, you should not need to water them much., Refer to your sketch and move the plants around until you are happy with the arrangement. Once you have your arrangement laid out, make sure that you aren’t creating a shady spot by putting a larger plant too close to a ground plant., Overtime, your plants will grow in height and width. Plan for this growth as you do your planting so that your garden will flourish. Each plant should come with an informational card with the plant dimensions at maturity. If you did not receive this information, then look up your plant online., Gently pull each plant out and shake the roots to untangle them to prepare the plant for transplant., Pat the soil down around the plant to keep it stable., Finish your garden with a loose layer of gravel or grit.

If you need more glycerin solution, use a ratio of 1:2 glycerin to warm water and adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly., These ingredients will make up your dye mixture and will be added to the glycerin and water mixture after. Pour 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of hot water, 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of floral dye, and 1 tsp. (4.92 ml) of citric acid in a separate bowl. Stir continuously until the mixture is dissolved. Once you've mixed them together, combine them to your half-gallon (2 L) mixing container and continue to both liquid solutions together until they are well incorporated.The dye will help the plant to retain its natural color.
If you don't use dye your boxwood cuttings will turn a golden hue.

, You can pack as many boxwood cuttings into a single container that you want, as long as you have enough glycerin solution. For every ounce (28 g) of cuttings add 1 fluid ounce (0.125 cup) of glycerin solution in the container. Weigh your boxwood cuttings on a scale so that you know how much of the solution has to go into each container.


Using the correct amount of solution will ensure that the cuttings will be flexible and won't run out of solution to absorb.

, Get the container that you set aside previously for your boxwood cuttings and pour the glycerin solution into the container. Use a measuring cup to make sure that you're pouring the right amount of solution into the container.


For instance, if you had 10 ounces (280 g) of boxwood cuttings, you'd need 10 fluid ounces (1.25 cups) of the solution.

Ensure that the air can circulate around each leaf to allow for the best possible absorption of the glycerin.

, Leave the cuttings in their containers for 2-3 weeks, or until all of the solution has been absorbed. When the cuttings are ready, they will be glossy and flexible to the touch.For best results, create an environment that has an air temperature of between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 and 23.8 degrees Celsius), has a medium humidity, good air circulation, and is lit but not in direct sunlight.

, When all of the solution has been absorbed, remove the cuttings. If there's any excess solution on the stems, rinse it off under cold water. Place the cuttings in a warm, sunny, and dry location for 3 to 5 days. This will allow the remainder of the water to evaporate and for the dye and glycerin to set., To complete the drying process, hang the cuttings upside down in a dark, dry, and warm place for 2 to 6 weeks. After this, they should be preserved for an indefinite amount of time. Use them in a wreath-making project, put them in a vase, or use the leaves for your next craft."

Make a runner bean teepee.",How to Plant a Child Friendly Garden2," If you have a big enough garden, one area could be specifically designed for your children, where they can be supervised and the damage they do to the garden is minimized. Some ideas for things you could add to this designated kid-friendly area include:


A grass pitch for ball games
A climbing frame
A sandpit
Some children may do better if left to their own devices to create their own games and entertainment in the garden rather than have play options spelled out for them.
Gardens create lots of opportunities for messy play so allow children the freedom to mess around with mud, paint, sand or water.

, Gardening is a good way to teach children about healthy eating and how plants grow. You can choose easy and quick plants for them to grow themselves. Easy jobs in the garden that children can join in with include watering plants and deadheading (removing dead blooms).


Good choices include sunflowers, nasturtiums, radish, beans and peppers or tomatoes.

, You can encourage healthy eating by getting children to grow or harvest their own food with things like blueberries, peas, tomatoes, and strawberries.


Be aware that this may encourage children to pick other non-edible plants and berries so make sure that they are aware of what can be eaten and what cannot.

, To do this, make an oblong frame that is about the height of your child. You can use sticks or wooden lengths to do this. Tie twine or string about an inch apart across the longest length. Give children the creativity to make their own patterns using string, lengths of rag, ribbon and long grass to weave their own pattern into the loom.


You can also have your children make woven masterpieces out of purely green materials such as pliable green stems, lengths of ivy or Virginia creeper. However, keep in mind that these last two are toxic, so they should only be given to older children that understand that they should not eat them.

, To plant a sunflower circle, find a sunny spot with fertile soil and mark out a circle in the ground using something like a hula hoop. Plant sunflower seeds around the circle, leaving a space for an entrance. Eventually you will have a tall den of sunflowers.


Try to plant two sunflower seeds in each hole, as some may not sprout. When the seedlings emerge, discard the weaker seedling if two grow together.

, To make a runner bean teepee, start by forming a wigwam or teepee out of sticks such as tall garden canes. You’ll need about 8 to 15 canes. Leave a space for an entrance. Plant runner beans or other climbing plants at the base of each cane and they should grow to form a canopy over the canes.

Take into consideration the type of herbs that you wish to grow, their growing size and needs, their compatibility, etc. when you are designing the shape. Look at basic knot garden designs in a gardening book to get ideas for the possible shapes. It is a good idea to keep it simple; the more complicated designs are better suited to hedge plants.;
, Remove all weeds, dig through the soil and rake neatly.

, Use string attached to stakes and a tape measure to get the measurements accurate and the lines, etc. straight. You can also use flour or lime trails to designate where the lines go and where herbs should be placed. It is important to get this part of the designing accurate, so that it looks good and to ensure that the herbs are planted in the correct positions.

, The best herbs for an Herbal knot garden are small herbs that are yet to grow. This will ensure that the undergrowth produced from new growth will be strong and healthy rather than top heavy. While this will require extra growing time, the end result will be well worth it as the classic full-bodied knot design takes shape. Make sure that the herbs chosen are perennials. See ""Tips"" for a list of suitable knot garden herbs.

, These will determine the spacing of the remaining herbs to be planted, and the spacing should be evenly distributed.

, Measure from the corner herbs and take into account growing needs such as height and breadth. A good guide is to leave 30–45 centimeter (17.7 in) between each plant.

, Don't mulch around the stem, however, as this might encourage root rot. Water well and frequently.

, This will encourage the herbs to bush out and grow into one another to form the knot.

, The spaces in between the knot can be filled with various items, such as brickwork, gravel, mulch, flowers, other herbs, etc.

, The fully fledged knot garden won't appear for 2–3 years. During this time you must tend to it well to encourage its healthy growth. Once established though, the knot garden will take good care of itself with minor intervention needed from you.

",How to Make a Gravel Garden,"


Try succulent plants like those which grow naturally on rocky hillsides because they prefer to grow where there is optimum drainage. These plants tend to rot in ordinary rich soil. Sedum is an easy plant you can use to start a gravel garden.






Plant grasses. Grasses grow naturally in semi-arid places and are wind-tolerant. There are many showy specimens from which to choose when you create a gravel garden.






Consider cacti for hot arid climates. Plants native to alpine areas are a natural for your cool climate gravel garden.






Experiment with plants grown in Mediterranean climates. Daisies and herbs often grow successfully in a gravel garden.






If trying to make a gravel garden atop regular soil, lay out the shape of the garden with a garden hose and then clear the area of weeds.





;
, After planting, water well. Before adding gravel, add a layer of weed cloth or newspaper to further suppress weeds. Pieces of flattened cardboard box can be used as well. You might try a combination of materials.

Cut an ""X"" in the cloth or paper to allow each plant to come through.






Cover cloth or newspapers with pea gravel, scree, or river rock. Slate scree is very fine and adds color. River rock comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes. Avoid use of white rock or gravel as it can become dirty.







, Realize that your gravel garden will require maintenance from time to time. Control unwanted plants by using a gentle weed killer or remove them by hand.

, Fit the features to compliment your garden's theme. For example, use driftwood in a seaside gravel garden or add Mexican pottery to a garden with a Southwestern look.

, Be sure to break up the gravel gardens by incorporating pathways of other materials including bark, moss, grass, or other types of rock.

Consider your gardenscape.,
Have patience and a willingness to learn.",How to Make a Garden With Native Plants," Get out of the mindset that cultivated plants are better than the ones that naturally grow in your area. A weed is simply a plant which is somewhere a human doesn't want it. If you do want it in your garden or landscaping, it's not a weed. While invasive species (see below) are undesirable and should be removed whenever possible, many plants eschewed by gardeners can--with a little imagination and a fresh eye--take their rightful place in your world. Your neighbors might consider you insane at first, but may well come around.;
, You don't want to unintentionally hurt your local ecosystem, so you will need to do some research.



Know your Endangered and Threatened Plants. Unfortunately, some plants are threatened, and should not be transplanted for any reason (unless maybe under threat of destruction by home building). Even plants that may look ordinary--like ferns--may in fact be off-limits. Check with your areas endangered and threatened species list.
Some plants may live and thrive in your area, they may actually be pests. For example, in Vermont, USA, purple loose strife is a beautiful plant, but is an invasive species that hurts the native habitat.
Know what local plants are dangerous to have around. For instance, you do not want to start a garden of poison ivy, or encourage highly poisonous plants like nightshade with your baby brother playing in the yard.
Most high-quality nurseries can guide you into choosing appropriate native species. Some can offer cultivated versions of ""wild plants"" that should not be re-located. (For instance, trillium or cacti)
In the USA, some colleges and universities may have agricultural extension services that can help you.
If you are a student, check with your botany or biology teacher...or a teacher who is fond of gardening (there is almost always one in every school).

, Some plants germinate from seeds, others by ""runners"" or otherwise clone themselves, or come from tubers, and this is important to know so that you can nurture it the right way. Does it live in sun, shade, in sandy soil, clay soil, damp soil, on rocks...observe the environment and plant accordingly. Although some plants thrive in a variety of situations, others are particular.


Nearly every species of plant has a web page based on those who love them, whether it's moss, day lilies, cactus, or wildflowers. Usually there will be information on how to care for your plants.

, Along with knowing how to nurture your plant, it's important to understand when is the appropriate time. For instance, planting blackberry bushes in January will doom your vines.


For many plants, spring is an excellent time to transplant or plant, as plants are often more receptive to change than more mature plants.
Mid to late summer or fall is an excellent time to save seeds or bulbs, and sometimes to plant for next spring.

, Plants are often adapted to a certain type of soil, amount of sun, water conditions, and so forth. Usually plants fail to thrive when conditions are simply unfavorable, no matter how lovely they look in a certain place.


Plants with large leaves usually love shade.
Plants with big flowers typically need lots of sun.

, While well-established, mature plants are usually low-maintenance, young plants need as much attention as cultivated ones. Be sure to water regularly, if needed, weed, and protect from frost if needed.

, If you buy wildflower seeds, be sure to read the soil preparation information on the back of the container. Just throwing the seeds to the wind will not likely yield flowers.

, Although obviously plants are featured in a garden, including such natural features as rocks, driftwood, water, and so on. Rock gardens lend themselves to natural plantings, and so do fences made from branches or rock.

, To a large extent, your garden will grow and thrive by Mother Nature's clock, not yours. And the results may not be the ones you expect--as in gardening in general. Every year, you will learn more and more.

Add water and turn on the pump.",How to Make a Garden Fountain1," Get a 5 gallon (18.9 L) cylindrical bucket and cut a hole for a 3/4 PVC pipe at the bottom.Turn the bucket upside down and fit a piece of 24"" PVC pipe through the hole, leaving about 6"" of space at the bottom. Use silicon or caulk to seal any gaps. Place this structure on a large piece of spare plywood, and then center a 12"" wide piece of concrete forming tube around the bucket. This is your form for the base and will be filled with quick-set concrete. Fill it until the bucket has at least 2"" of material covering it and then give it a shake to remove bubbles. Let it set according to the manufacturer's instructions.;
, Get a glass light fixture globe, spray the inside with cooking spray and then fill it to the top lip with concrete. Tape off the end of a PVC tube and shove the taped end down through the center of the ball so that it sits snugly against the glass. Tape it in place until the concrete sets.

, Break both pieces out of their forms and use a flexible saw to cut off the extra PVC pipe.

, Dig a shallow hole big enough to get a plastic garden basin in. Fill it part way with river stones set a 100–155 gallon (586.7 L)-per-hour pump into the rocks and then cover the pump with a layer of rocks.

, Run 1/2"" vinyl tubing from the pump and, with the base tipped on it's side, up through the PVC pipe. Tip the base into place and then insert the tubing through the ball.

, Cut off the excess tubing that protrudes from the ball and then remove the ball in order to trim the tube so that it will fit just below the lip of the ball. Return the ball to it's location and this time secure it in place with some adhesive silicon.

Plant the Acmena Smithii variety minor if you feel that it's necessary to acquire a great screening plant that that is not too tall, (10 feet or 3 meters) not too wide, (about 3 feet or one meter) grows in sun, grows in shade, is drought hardy when established and has colored, new growth.,Choose Syzygium luehmannii and its cultivars such as ‘Royal Flame’ and ‘Little Lucy’, and the hybrid Syzygium ‘Cascade’ because they are (almost) psyllid resistant and quite beautiful.,
Forget the Spring Flush.,
Try growing Dendrobium kingianum and D. delicatum.,
Know that long flowering Mint Bushes Prostanthera’s are not renowned for their long flowering time, unfortunately as they are very attractive in flower.,
Kangaroo Paws Anigozanthos species are promoted as drought hardy.,
Try some hardy, pest free plants.,
Be ruthless with plants that do not perform in your garden.,
For a longer flowering season, try a long flowering plant look no further than Ricinocarpos pinifolius or as it is more commonly known - the Wedding Bush.",How to Grow Australian Native Plants1," You should find it in your local nursery. They are psyllid resistant and have great cultivars such as ‘Hot Flush’, ‘Allyn Magic’, Hedgemaster’, ‘Minipilly’ and ‘Dusky’.;
,, Design your garden so you have plants that flower at different times of the year and not only during spring. There are now better ways to beat the winter doldrums than to see a patch of colour on a cold day – try Croweas or Correas.

, They can be grown in harsh conditions such as on: rocks and logs, above ground, in dappled light to full sun and are tough near drought tolerant plants (water only every two to three weeks) and they flower great in spring., Two that have been found to flower for nearly a month are: P. ’Poorinda Ballerina’ and P. phylicifolia. The later also grows and flowers well in shade. Both recommended as they are hardy and only grow to a meter tall.

, If yours are just sitting there looking unhappy and not flowering they need a lot of water in winter (especially the taller flowering forms that flower in spring only) as this is what they receive in their original habitat - the Southwest corner of Western Australia. For the smaller flowering Bush series that flower all year round, it is best to give them less winter watering than their taller cousins., Lillypillies are a name adopted for Acmena and Syzygium and a few other related plants. They are generally hardy and pest free. However when grown in dappled light or shady areas some of them are particularly prone to being attacked by Psyllids – a small insect that gets into the leaf and produces tiny “bubbles” on the surface and it can create quite bad distortion of new growth and looks unsightly. Acmenas and Syzygium luehmannii and most Syzygium australe cultivars are resistant to it.

, There are far too many new and exciting plants to try, so dig out the under performers and consign them to the bin., A local to Sydney, it starts to flower in August then rests with the odd spot flowers and then starts flowering again more heavily in November/December. The showy 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) five petal white flowers stand out well against the attractive green linear leaves. For me this plant is very hardy and is about 1.8 metres tall and is in a well drained position protected from the western sun.

Prune your bottlebrushes when the flower has finished, and before new growth has commenced, cut the top 2/3’s off the flower.,
As you do not want to end up with a jungle, you will need to selectively hand weed or mow at the appropriate time as well as prune.,
After flowering they all need to be cut back hard to the ground and remove all cut leaves.,
Severe pruning You could have something like a Crinum pedunculatum which in a very dry situation that might be getting a little scruffy looking.,
Pruning rainforest shrubs.,
After this they start to grow strongly to about April.",How to Grow Australian Native Plants2," This will encourage multiple shoots from the remaining 1/3, each of which will produce a flower for next year. Well worth the effort., This is all part of becoming a habitat gardener, more so if you use indigenous plants.

, Some growers it is rumored actually mow them with their lawn mower – effective but a bit extreme., One thing you can do is cut them down level with the ground and forget them. So do not hesitated to resort to this type of “pruning”. Incidentally while this plant has the common name of Swamp lily it is very hardy and will survive and flower well in situations which are dry and receive only dappled light – a great accent pant if grouped in clumps of three or five.

, Over the years I have noticed that many of my smaller growing rainforest plants such as: Acmena species, Syzygium species and Archirhodmyrtus beckleri, etc flower and set seed around the months of December January., During this time of strong growth, I have found it to be the best time to prune (as severely as you like) as they quickly recover and look good again. Thinking about this, it is logical that this happens, as these are the months when Sydney gets it most rainfall and humidity.

Maximize your success of getting your plants to grow by planting them as close to the trunk of a gum tree as possible.,
Group you plants with others in like conditions.,
Do not be afraid to fertilize your native plants and orchids during the warmer months when they are growing.",How to Grow Australian Native Plants3," Two reasons to do this are:

There are very few tree feeder roots to rob your plant of nutrients and moisture.
During rain, a lot of water runs down the trunks of the tree and hence toward your newly planted plant.

, Low water requirement together, shade loving plants together, moisture loving plants together. Basic, but vital.

, Use any fertilizer labeled suitable for native plants. It will help your plants look much better and healthier."

Invite birds to your garden.,
Soil.",How to Grow Australian Native Plants4," You will be fascinated to find that such a large bird as the King Parrot can eat very small seeds from plants such as Baeckia crenatifolia and Crowea Festival to name a few.

, When you are preparing new beds or refreshing existing garden beds it is best to try not to import “garden soil” from another property as there is every chance you could be importing trouble. The soil could have been heavily limed or had added fertilizers high in phosphorous – thus making it unsuitable for native plants especially those that belong to the Proteaceae family (Grevilleas and Banksias to name a few). As well, there could be many micro-organism that may have harmful effect on your plants."

Snail Baits.,
Treat psyllid infected vegetation by cutting off the damaged growth.,
If you have soil that is too heavy to grow plants like Boronias then buy a large plastic pot, cut the bottom out of it place this on the ground (loosen the soil first) then fill the pot with potting mix and plant your plant.,
Apart from planting native plants, you will also be creating a habit style garden where native plants will play a part of the food chain for any animals and insects etc.,
Understand what the benefits of rain (versus watering) are.,
Repot into the next size pot up or maybe the next two sizes of pots.,
Do not repot pot plants on too quickly it is best to wait until grow slows and roots appear out of the drainage holes.,
The best option is to work with what you have got and improve your soil with your own home made compost.,
Yellowing of new leaves.,
Watch for the new growth – it should be healthy green.,
This treatment will not change the colour on old leaves.

",How to Grow Australian Native Plants5," Be careful when using snail or slug baits as most commercial products contain metaldehyde which, when exposed to water, quickly breaks down to a harmless alcohol. (Fresh metaldehyde is toxic to slugs, snails, birds, cats, dogs, elephants, rabbits, humans and many more other creatures great and small)

, The other method is to spray with a systemic insecticide however this is always not effective as the insect is often gone when you notice the damage. If you have plants that are attacked it is best to remove them and replace with forms that do not suffer from Psyllids., Finally mulch well the soil around the base of the plant. The advantage of this method is eliminating the need to repot the plant every two years or so.

, That is why it is important not to remove any rotted stumps/fallen timber (unless a nest for white ants) and puddles in your desire to obsessively tidy up. You should be aiming for retaining a wide diversity of habitats., It has been found that rainfall contains small quantities of dissolved nitrate and ammonia, which are forms of nitrogen, hence the growth spurt.

, An example of this would be to pot on a plant growing in a 150 mm (6”) pot into a 200 mm (8”) or 250 mm (10”) pot size.

This is true because the potting mix can remain quite wet if there is no plant roots to take-up the excess moisture. This is especially so if the plant is potted on late into the growing season and their growth slows down, the roots can rot and you loose the plant. There are exceptions of course, like plants with a strong and quick growing root system (e.g. Prostanthera species). However, as a general guide follow this rule and you will increase your success when repotting plants.

, Another sign will be when the plant needs daily watering in summer.

, If you need large amounts of new “soil”, obtain it from a reliable supplier and make sure it is suitable for native plants., Sometimes when I plant new Grevilleas or Banksias they do not perform well and their new leaves are yellow. This is often a sign of phosphorous toxicity in native plants. Once phosphorous is present in the soil it takes a long time to leach out. So to lock-up the phosphorous and prevent the plant taking it up, water the plant with Chelated Iron as per the directions on the packet. At the same time, I usually water the plant with some trace elements just in case the soil is lacking in one or more of the minor elements.

, If this treatment does not work the first time do it again in two weeks time.,"

Lomandra Tanika, this plant has attractive fine green leaves, is very hardy and only grows to 50 centimeters (19.7 in).,
If you install a pond you will quickly attract (stripped marsh) frogs.

",How to Grow Australian Native Plants6," In paved areas water must be allowed to percolate downwards, therefore no mortared joints.,,, Three things you should be doing: reducing the amount of plants (native and introduced) with berries as this is a major source of food for them; stop artificial feeding; and plant dense and spiky shrubs to provide safe nesting and hiding spots for smaller birds which the Currawongs prey on.

, Mine are growing in very dry situations and only get a burst of mid day sun the rest of the day they receive dappled light. Talking to some “gardening industry” people the only maintenance appears to be lifting them every five years and dividing them up and starting again.
Poa australis, this is a very attractive small grey-green grassy clump which has its flower seed heads appear above the plant in spring – summer. It is hardy in all situations and the only maintenance is again to divide them after flowering as it is very easy to do and results in many more plants.

,Choosing flower colours Australia has more native plants than any other country in the world and there are a huge range of colours to choose from and we are particularly fortunate to have an abundance of blues coloured flowers.,
Colour helps to create moods.,When choosing flower colours it is important to remember:,
Warm colours – red, pink, orange and yellow, give a sense of fun and activity; they tend to come to the foreground and thus appear larger.

,Cool colours - blues, greens and some blue-violets, give a feeling of space and serenity; they tend to recede from the eye and can appear smaller.,
Neutral colours - white, grey and black.,
Limit the amount of contrasting colours.,
Cut flowers There are a few simple techniques to help you maximise vase life of native plants.,
Cool: pick them in the cool of the day and place straight away in a bucket of water, out of the sun.,
Watered: ensure buckets and vases are clean, top up as necessary, strip leaves that would be underwater, re-cut stems at an angle underwater.

,
Fed: add two teaspoons of sugar per litre, after first adding half a teaspoon of bleach.,
The dwarf kangaroo paws such as Bush Pearl and Bush Ranger are only good for about three years.,To keep Philotheca (Eriostemon) myoporoides looking great and flowering prolifically, prune 50% off the shrub after flowering.,
The advantages of using tube stock: they are economical and cheap to buy.",How to Grow Australian Native Plants7," If you do not have these beetles that originated in Queensland on your Dendrobium orchids read no further and count yourself lucky., These orange and black beetles grow to about 10 mm long and can fly. In summer months, the adult beetle eats the new leaves of orchids. They then lay eggs in the soft, new stems and the larva a soft white maggot like grub hatches, then eats and destroy the stem and growing tip. At their worst, they will destroy all the new seasons’ growth on your orchids.

, The easier and more challenging way is to sneak up on them (there are always two of them), place your hand slowly below the leaves being eaten by the buggers and then, with your other hand try to grab them – if you miss, they will hopefully drop into your other hand as their defence is to drop to the ground when disturbed, now crush them., It is a very popular plant for indoors, because when young they do not need much light. In their natural environment they do not receive much light when young as they are growing under existing mature palms – it is only as they mature that they need more light.

, This is a good reason to use a good layer of mulch over the soil. As the mulch breaks down, with the aid of these many micro-organisms, the soil is enhanced and over time the soil fertility builds up., These fungi are also crucial to many orchids especially those without any leaves – they often need the right fungus to supply their nutriments.

,,,,,,,, You can use a colour wheel to choose colour harmonies or just go for a riot of colour – the choice is all yours and will be reflected in the character of your garden.

,,,, Grey is an excellent ""linking"" colour, be careful with white and black, both can appear as “holes” or spaces in a colour scheme. Both work well as highlighters of other colours.

, They are high impact so use them sparingly to create a focal point in your garden. Use more of the harmonious colours. They lie next to each other on the colour wheel; they relate to one another and do not clash., The three basic rules are: Keep them cool, watered and fed.

, Keep arrangements away from heaters, draughts and air conditioners.,, Adding a pinch of citric acid or a teaspoon of vinegar to each litre of vase water acidifies the water as plant stems take up acid water more readily than neutral of alkaline solution., After that they do not flower as well and are well past there prime and should be replaced.

,, They adapt quickly when planted out. They only need a small hole to be dug when planting. If the tubes are a square section, the roots run straight down and they should be easy to remove from the pot. Sometimes it the plant is pot bound then the tube will need to cut away to minimise root disturbance. Many Thanks to Tharwa Nursery for reminding me of this."

Maintain your garden.",How to Grow a Cold Weather Garden," These plants should grow well in cold weather and may or may not be frost resistant. They should also be hardy, not delicate. See the list below for some choices.;
, You could either buy the plants that are already grown from a nursery, or you could buy the seeds. It is easier to buy the plants, but also much more expensive. If you are a beginner, you may want to choose the plants, but if you have a green thumb, think about using seeds.

, Choose a place where the plants you have chosen will get an adequate amount of sunlight. Make sure there is enough room too. Some plants start out tiny, but in a matter of weeks have grown several inches, so keep that in mind when choosing where to plant.

, Most plants grow well if they are in rows, but they will need to be spaced out. Make sure you know which plants you are planting where. If you need to, make signs to place in front of each row. For example, there would be a sign saying “lettuce” in front of the lettuce row.

, Plants need to be able to grow and develop their roots in order to stay healthy, but if the soil is too hard or rocky, they won’t be able to. So you need to make sure that the soil your planting in is loose enough for the plant’s roots to grow in. To loosen the soil, take a trowel and shovel up the dirt over and over, until it is light and loose. Some plants only need the soil to be a little loose, while others need it to be as light and sandy as possible.

, Make sure you plant the seeds at the right depth. Some plants like to be closer to the surface while others grow better deeper underground.

, This can insulate the soil and help prevent frost. You can use wood chips, leaves or compost. It should be several inches thick.

, Water your plants every day, more or less if you find they prefer it that way. If the ground freezes, water at a time when it isn't frozen. The amount of water you give depends on the plants and the temperatures, but the minimum is at least every five weeks. Remove weeds if they grow and kill any harmful bugs.

Choose the location in which you will grow your annuals.,
Decide which type of flowers to plant.,
Loosen the soil in the flower bed.,
Rake the soil in the flower bed smooth.,
Plant the annuals in your flower bed.,
Water the flowers.",How to Grow a Bed of Annuals," Your location should be selected before any other planning is done, because light and soil conditions will affect which plants will grow well. Outline the boundary of your planned annual bed by sprinkling flour along the ground.;
, Choosing flowers will largely depend on aesthetic preferences. However, if your bed is partially or even fully shaded, you will need to choose flowers that can cope with low light. Information regarding preferred light conditions for each plant can be researched online or found on the back of seed packets.

, Using a pointed shovel or spade, dig to a depth of approximately 6 inches (15 cm) following the outline you created with flour. Continue to loosen the soil through the entire area of the flower bed, piling the soil back into the bed when you are finished.


Ideally, the soil in the flower bed should sit about 6 inches (15 cm) above ground level. This will improve drainage and keep the soil warmer. If loosening the soil alone does not raise the level adequately, add local topsoil over the top of the flower bed.
Folding compost into the soil is best accomplished at this point. If you do not have a compost pile on your land, you can buy compost in bags from a nursery or hardware store.

, Once an adequate height has been achieved, you should smooth the soil out to prepare it for planting. You can do this with either a rake (ideal for large flower beds) or a hand cultivator. This process will also help to break up any large clumps of compacted soil.

, Gently remove each plant from its plastic cell pack and work it into the soil. Pay attention to the ideal spacing based on the type of flower; this information will be provided on the plant ID tag or on the seed packet. The outermost row of flowers should be positioned around 6 inches (15 cm) from the perimeter of the bed.

, Once the entire bed is planted, water the annuals until the soil is moistened throughout. Keep the bed watered and weeded carefully for a few weeks until the flowers are firmly established. Add fertilizer if desired after a few weeks.

Consider where you need to add color and flowers.,
Choose your bulb varieties.,
Prepare the location.",How to Make a Bulb Garden1,"


During the spring and summer months, carefully watch your existing garden to see where it might benefit from early spring flowers. Keep in mind that some bulbs will bloom very early in the spring. You want a garden that maintains color for as long as possible.;
,


Do your research. Some bulbs will bloom earlier than others, while some may grow larger or faster. Keep this in mind when deciding what kind of bulbs you want to place. Always plan to have the larger, fuller plants bloom behind or around smaller plants. Also consider how much room you have and how much room each bulb needs. The package of each bulb will suggest how much space it needs.

,


Once you've identified where you want to plant your bulbs, you need to prepare the soil. Start in the summer by adding fertilizer to the ground, working it in so that the ground remains loose. Keep this area as weed free as possible.

It should also be close to your home (rather than on the far end of the yard) so that it is convenient and easily accessible., Most plants need 6 to 8 hours of sunlight to flourish. If the ""ideal location"" does not get enough sunlight, then you will need to stick with a less-traditional potager garden, and plant it elsewhere. After all, if the plants don't get much sunlight, you won't have much of a garden., An enclosure is an important element of a potager garden because it helps reign it in. You can have a natural enclosure, such as boxwood, climbing plants, or raspberries. You can also have an unnatural one, such as part of a fence or your house wall., Most gardens don't have the right type of soil for growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables. Raised garden beds are the perfect solution for this. You can create simple gardening mounds. You can also build large planters out of wood or brick, and then fill them with soil instead. Keep the raised garden beds no bigger than 4 feet (1.2 meters). This way, you can easily reach the center when harvesting.You will need to fill the raised garden beds with well-drained loamy soil, especially if you are growing vegetables.Your garden beds don't have to be rectangular or square. They are be oval, round, or even L-shaped., This will allow you to go through your garden without trampling your fruits, herbs, and vegetables. Something around 3 feet (0.91 meters) wide would be ideal. This way, you can push a wheel barrow down for transporting your harvest, soil, mulching, etc.Your pathways can be made from anything you want, including: bark, bricks, gravel, or stepping stones., Items such as trellises, garden orbs, and birdbaths will help add color to your garden during the winter months when hardly anything grows. You can also add some ornamental evergreens, such as artfully-trimmed boxwood shrubs or topiaries, to your garden as well. This way, there will be at least something green in your garden when everything else has died., This is where you can get really creative. The focal point is the center of your garden. It can be as simple as four raised garden beds, to as ornate as a fountain or a fruit tree., Most potager gardens are laid out in a grid-like pattern with four raised garden beds. You don't have to design yours this way, however; you can get creative. Popular garden patterns include spirals and wagon wheels., Vegetables are great not only for filling your tummy, but also for adding color to your garden. Start with vegetables that you eat most often, then add some new ones as well. Instead of going with just the standard varieties, consider adding some non-standard ones as well, such as purple broccoli, white pumpkin, or striped tomatoe.Beans and peas are vertical growers and great for adding height to your garden.
Fleshy fruits and vegetables, such as peppers, pumpkins, squashes, and tomatoes, are great for adding splashes of color to your garden.
Don't forget the salads. Lettuce, kale, and spinach will add not only texture, but also some color (depending on the variety.
Root veggies, such as carrots, potatoes, and radishes, don't add much color to your garden, but are still worth it at harvest time.

, Herbs not only add flavor to your food, but some also put forth beautiful flowers as well. Grow herbs that you use often in your cooking. If you don't use many, great choices include: basil, cilantro/coriander, mint, oregano, and parsley.Try some large, shrubby herbs as well, such as lavender and rosemary.
Some herbs are aggressive growers and an easily overgrow your garden if you are not careful. It might be a good idea to rein these in with metal borders or plant them separately.

, Flowers are a key feature in a potager garden. They add color and attract pollinators for your fruits, herbs, and vegetables.Choose flowers that bloom at different times during the year. This way, there will always be some color in your garden.


Add some edible flowers, such as borage, chamomile, lavender, marigold, rose, and violet.Consider some climbing flowers as well. They are a great way to add color to your garden walls. Great choices include roses, morning glories, and sweet peas., When designing gardens, most people tend to focus only what's on the ground. This leads to a very ""low"" garden. You can make your garden look larger and more interesting by adding vertical growers. Vertical growers include small fruit trees, climbing plants, and large shrubs. They also include plants that needs supports, such as tepees, towers, and trellises.Great shrubs include berry shrubs, such as blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, and elder berry.
There are lots of small varieties of trees suitable for small gardens, including lemon and lime.
Morning glory, rose, and sweet pea make great climbing plants.

, A typical potager garden will have at least four garden beds arranged in a grid-like pattern, with paths in between. Sketch out four raised garden beds on a sheet of paper, then use the steps below to get some design ideas.

, Fill the center of your garden bed with a focal fruit or vegetable, then plant flowers all around them. For example, you could plant a row of cabbages, cauliflower, and broccoli down the center of your planter, then add short, filler plants around the border, such as alyssum and violets.You don't have to plant in straight rows. Try diagonals, zigzags, spirals, or rings., This will make your garden look neater and more harmonious. For example, you could plant orange/yellow heirloom tomatoes and yellow squash in the same bed, along with some marigolds. You cold also plant violets and lavender alongside eggplants and purple cabbage., If harmony and organization don't appeal to you, try contrast schemes instead. Plant oranges and yellows together. Play around with round and jagged shapes, fuzzy and shiny, frilled and lacy. For example:Lacy, feathery carrot leaves work great alongside the frilly leaves of lettuce and kale.
Thin and straight chives work well alongside soft, oval, and fuzzy sage.

, Don't put all of your June-blooming plants in one planter, and your May-blooming plants in another. If you do that, you will end up with bare patches in your garden. Instead, put different types of plants together in the same planter. This way, there will always be something growing., A potager garden needs an enclosure. Unless you already have a natural enclosure, such as a shrub, your will likely be stuck with a fence or house wall. This won't be very interesting to look at. Instead, plant some of your vertical growers (such as beans, berry shrubs, small fruit trees, or climbing roses) along your wall or fence.


Don't forget about the spaces at the base of you fruit trees. Plant some strawberries, herbs, or flowers at their base."

Order your bulbs through the mail.,
Buy local bulbs.,
Store the bulbs.",How to Make a Bulb Garden2,"


By ordering your bulbs in advance from a plant catalog, you'll be taking advantage of the largest possible variety. You can usually order anytime in mid to late summer, and the bulbs will usually ship in the early fall, just in time for planting.

,


Buying your bulbs from a garden center will give you a selection of bulbs but not necessarily the largest selection. They'll carry all the usual types that are appropriate for your area.

,


Bulbs should be kept in their packaging in a cool, dark spot that is free from excess moisture. Never freeze the bulbs or place them in air-tight containers.

The best time for planting bulbs is in the early fall. You want to ensure that the bulbs have 2 to 3 months to root before the ground freezes or gets cold.

,


Before planting the bulbs, prepare the flower beds. Make holes in the ground as per the instructions on the bulb package. Follow their guidelines on how close to put the bulbs and how deep to plant them.

,


Place the bulbs, 1 in each hole, flat root end down. The pointed tip of the bulb should be facing upward. Cover the bulbs with soil and press it down with your hand. Never walk on the soil as it will compress the soil too much. Then water your bulbs. You need to water the bulbs so that the moisture reaches the bottom of the bulb. This is imperative if you want the bulbs to root and bloom in the spring.

Do the pop test to see whether or not the corn is ready.",How to Grow Popcorn," You can use plain popcorn from a bag, but you will want to do a fertility test first. Not all store-bought popcorn will be fertile because of the heating and sterilization processes popcorn goes through before being packaged and sold. You can also buy popcorn seeds from a seed company or from a farmer.To test store-bought popcorn for fertility: sow 20 seeds, water, and wait. If the corn grows in about a week, you have fertile seeds. If 2 weeks pass, and you still don't see any sprouts emerging, you have infertile seeds. The seeds must be fertile in order to grow.;
, This helps moisten them so they will germinate faster., Make sure that the spot will receive lots of sunlight and that the soil drains easily. You will need lots of room to grow corn.


Don't plant within 100 feet (30.48 meters) of other types of corn, or you may get cross pollination. This could result in hybrids, and may affect the flavor., Depending on where you live, this will be sometime between the first week in March and the middle of May.The soil should be between 50 and 55°F (10 and 12.7°C).Expect the seedlings to emerge in 3 to 12 days.Space seeds 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.4 centimeters) apart. If you are planting in rows, space the rows 18 to 24 inches (45.72 to 60.96 centimeters) apart.Plant the corn ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) deep in the spring. Plant the corn 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) deep in the summer.
Put 2 seeds in each hole. Only 75% of seeds germinate., Don't thin them any sooner, as not all seedlings survive. Thin them until they are 10 to 15 inches (25.4 to 38.1 centimeters) apart., Popcorn is a thirsty plant. It will need about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water each week (depending on soil condition) until it is ready to be harvested. This will take about 100 days., Spread the fertilizer between the rows. Water it to get it into the soil. You do not need to fertilize often. Only two or three times. Here is when you use fertilizer:When the corn is about knee-height, or gets 8 to 10 leaves: use ½ pound (226.80 grams) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.29 square meters).
When the ears form silk: use ¼ pound (113.4 grams) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.29 square meters) once the ears form silk.
Add more fertilizer if: the leaves turn yellow or pale, especially after getting silk., Weeds can damage popcorn by using up all of the water and nutrients that the corn needs to survive. To get rid of weeds, you will need to cultivate the soil around the corn. Be careful so that you don't damage the roots., You will want to be alert from the moment your corn starts to sprout—or possibly even before. Here are some ways you can keep those feathered thieves away from your crop:Place much around your corn. By the time the seedlings come up, the crows won't be as interested in them anymore.
Put up a scarecrow.
Place a tunnel of chicken wire over each row of seedlings., Raccoons will go after corn once the ears form and start to ripen. Fortunately, there are a few ways you can protect your crop from those furry bandits:Install an electric fence around your field
Put some hot pepper on the silk.
Install a flood light and train it on the corn.
Use portable radios around the corn.
Try the Native American trick of planting pumpkin around the corn. No one is quite sure as to why this works, although there are many theories.

, They attack mainly the stalks. They leave behind tiny holes filled with dust. The easiest way to kill them is by squeezing the stalk. The most effective way is to apply pesticides, such as rotenone or Bacillus thuringiensis (BT)., True to their name, earworms attack the ears, just as they start to form silk. There are two ways to handle earworms:Before the silk turns brown, sprinkle the tip of each ear with a pesticide, such as: Bacillus thuringiensis (BT), pyrethrin, or rotenone.
After the silk turns brown, put a drop of mineral oil on the tip of each ear.

, When the stalks start to grow, they will need more support. Pack some soil around their bases to help them stand up., Depending on when you planted the corn, this will be around October. It also depends on the species of corn; some species are ready for harvest sooner than others.

, If the autumns where you live are dry, you can let the corn dry right on the stalks. If the autumn starts to get rainy, harvest the corn, and take it inside, to finish drying.

, The husks should be dry, and the kernels hard. Pull the corn off the stalks first, then peel the husks off., Place the husked ears in mesh bags. Hand the bags in a dry, warm, well-ventilated area. You can also use nylon stockings instead.

, Preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, place the popcorn flat on a large baking sheet, put it into the heated oven, and immediately lower the heat to the lowest setting. Stir the popcorn occasionally while drying it in oven over the course of five hours. Then, turn off the oven, remove the popcorn, and allow it to cool overnight., Simply twist a few kernels off of the cob, and put them onto a hot pan. Heat them in some oil as you normally would. If the corn pops, it is ready. If it sticks to the pan, it is not ready and needs to dry/cure longer."
"
Plan your garden well in advance of the first warm day of summer.,
Sow the seeds six to eight weeks before the last expected frost date in your region.,
As the seedlings grow tall, thin the crop by removing most of the sprouts, leaving one strong plant.,
When the early spring days become warmer, set the young plants outside to ""harden off"".,
Prepare the soil about two weeks before you install the seedlings.,
You can design your garden by setting the plants above ground according to the width and height requirements of each cultivar.,
If the design appears satisfactory, remove the plants from their pots and insert them into the soil.",How to Grow a Chocolate Garden,"


To do this, research mail-order or online garden catalogs for the plants you wish to grow.
Order your seeds early in the season when supplies are plentiful. Once ‘’spring fever’’ arrives and gardeners end their winter hibernation, it may become difficult to purchase specific varieties of vegetables or flowers. See the ""Sources and Citations"" section for suggested seed suppliers.;
,


If you don’t know when that is, contact the County Extension Agent or Department of Agriculture in your area. These agencies provide a wealth of information and offer workshops and seminars designed to improve your gardening skill.
Fill your growing trays or cell packs with commercial soil and sow the seeds according to the manufacturer’s directions. Water the growing trays well and place them in a warm, sunny spot but avoid setting them on top of radiators or other heating elements.

, You can do this by cutting the seedlings with sharp trimmers.


Clipping unwanted seedlings may seem tedious and difficult to do but unless you have an unusually large garden, you don’t need 35 pepper plants. It’s much better and easier to grow five health plants than to have a dismal array of withered vegetables and flowers.

, This means that they will acclimate themselves to the brighter sunshine and wind so that they are able to withstand the transition into the outside garden world.

,


If you are breaking ground for a new garden or tilling the soil from last year’s patch, add organic or commercial fertilizer, mixing it into the soil with a shovel or a rotary- tiller.

,


Remember, those little three-inch (7.5 cm) tomato plants are going to grow to almost five feet. You don’t want them to overshadow smaller varieties.
When planting chocolate flowers, clump them in sets of three to five per given space so that they have a lush, showy effect when fully mature.

Perform a soil test.,
Pick an organic or inorganic fertilizer.,
Choose granular or liquid fertilizers.,
Look at the fertilizer’s nutrients.,
Determine the portion of nutrients on the bag.,
Add the fertilizer to your plant.,
Fertilize your plants often.",How to Grow Plants Faster1," In order for you to pick the correct fertilizer, you will have to see what your soil composition is. Many home and garden stores sell soil testing kits. The results from this test will tell you what nutrients you need to add to create the best balance for your plants to grow.;
, Choose between organic and inorganic fertilizers. When you select inorganic fertilizer, look for the blend that supplies the best balance of nutrient requirements your soil needs. Organic fertilizers are harder to gauge because they vary in the amount of nutrients they supply. The organic fertilizer must also be broken down into inorganic substances in the soil for the plant to be able to use, which means it will take longer your plants to see a benefit.


Inorganic fertilizers provide immediate nutrients to plants and help them grow faster. Organic fertilizers take longer to release in the soil, but they create a healthier soil over time. If your goal is to take an existing plant and make it grow faster, then use inorganic fertilizer. If you are looking to make a long-term garden or flowerbed, then organic fertilizer is more beneficial.

, Granular fertilizers come in small pellets. Like organic fertilizer, they are best for long-term projects like flowerbeds. The coating on granular fertilizer is resin, which causes the nutrients to be released slowly into the soil. Liquid fertilizers work much faster, but they require more applications. Usually, you will need to spray liquid fertilizers on your plants every few weeks. Liquid fertilizer is also more expensive.


Choose the fertilizer based on the urgency of your project. If you want future plants to grow faster, then choose granular fertilizers as this will make the soil richer over time. If you have a plant that needs immediate attention, then use the liquid fertilizer.
If you choose a liquid fertilizer, make sure the read the directions on the bottle. Too many applications can over-fertilize and kill your plant.

, Plants require 16 nutrients to grow successfully. The three main nutrients are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These three are referred to as macronutrients. The secondary nutrients required are sulfur, calcium, and magnesium. Last, plants need the micronutrients boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc.Without the three macronutrients, a plant will not be able to grow.
Some fertilizers will have plant foods added to them. If you are growing one plant, such as a particular flower, this will help it grow. However, if you are growing many different types of plants at once, it is better to get a fertilizer without plant food.

, Different types of fertilizers use different blends of these nutrients. For instance, a 6-12-6 bag of fertilizer has 6-percent nitrogen, 12-percent phosphorus, and 6 percent potassium. Based on your soil test, choose the mixture that will add the most to your soil.

, The best approach is to add the fertilizer uniformly to the soil. If you choose to use granular fertilizer, a drop spreader will help you distribute it. If you are fertilizing plants outside, be sure to clean up any fertilizer that spill into the streets or sidewalks. This will prevent it from getting into waterways.

, Plants go through nutrients quickly. In order to keep your plants consistently fed, make sure to add fertilizer to the soil as often at the plant requires, which will vary based on both the plant and fertilizer. Read the instructions on the fertilizer to see its recommendations. If you buy a pre-plotted plant, check the label on the plant to see what soil they were planted in. This will give you an idea how often you need to feed it."
"
Choose the type of plant you want to grow.,
Consider growing greens.,
Pick your vegetables.,
Select fast growing flowers.",How to Grow Plants Faster2," Various plants grow at different speeds. Look at various species of the plant you wish to grow. For instance, the glacier tomato will grow in 50 days compared to the average 70-90 day growth period of normal tomatoes.

, Certain types of greens grow very fast. Microgreens grow in 14 days. Arugula takes 21 days to grow. Lettuce takes 28 days to grow. There are many greens that grow quickly, particularly those that are used in salads., If you are growing vegetables, pick ones that grow quickly. Fast growing vegetables include, snap beans, beets, broccoli, green onions, radishes, squash, cucumbers, okra, and peas., Fast growing flowers are useful for gifts or for filling out a garden. Pot Marigolds, Cosmos, and Yellow Flags grow fast and look great. Other great flowers to consider are sunflowers, sweet peas, and nigellas.

"
Grow seedlings inside.,
Talk to your plants.,
Give it light.,
Use coffee grounds.",How to Grow Plants Faster3," If you are growing plants outside, but you have to wait for spring, grow your seeds inside. Seedlings take between 4 to 12 weeks to sprout. If you let them sprout inside and then transplant them into your garden, the plants will grow 4-6 weeks earlier than if you had waited to plant the seed directly into the flower bed.Gather a small group of containers that are 2–4 inches (5.1–10 cm) deep that have drainage holes.
Avoid fertilizers. Instead, use a mix of peat moss and vermiculite inside the container.
Let the plants set outside in their containers for a few hours each day. Do this for at least two weeks before you transplant them into the flower bed. This will help them acclimate to direct sunlight.
The best plants to transplant are tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and melons. Some plants, however, do not transplant well. These are zucchini, beans, beets, corn, spinach, turnips, and peas.

, Studies show that plants respond particularly well to being serenaded. When you are fertilizing the plant, talk or sing to the plant. Record your voice using a device such as a radio or tape recorder and play it to them while you're gone. This will help your plant grow faster..

, Use a grow light if you are growing your plant indoors. The best grow lights are high-intensity discharge lights (HID). HID lights come in two types: metal halide (MH) and high-pressure sodium (HPS). MH bulbs cast the strongest light in the blue end of the spectrum, which causes a compact, leafy growth. HPS bulbs last longer than MH bulbs and produce light at the red/orange end of the spectrum. MH bulbs cause a flowering growth., Coffee grounds help plants grow faster because of their caffeine. If you drink coffee, put the grounds in your plant instead of throwing them away. The grounds are rich in nitrogen, which is a key nutrient in a plants diet. There have also been studies that suggest that caffeine helps the plant grow faster."

Take cuttings from mature plants.",How to Grow Sweet William Plants," Due to the multiple varieties of Sweet William and the different methods of growing them, you may hear conflicting information on when your flowers will grow and how long they will last. Biennial varieties bloom in their second year, and then die. Perennial varieties are supposed to regrow flowers year after year, but Sweet William perennials usually take two years to bloom and often die before they bloom a second time.


Correct care of Sweet William perennials increases the chance of reseeding, as described in the section on caring for Sweet William.;
, If you want your Sweet William to flower reliably within a year, acquire seedlings or adult plants in fall or spring.Confirm with the previous owner that the plant will bloom this year before you take it home, since some seedlings may not flower until their second year.


Seeds that claim to be annuals (flowering and dying within one year) may or may not live up to the promise, depending on the variety and how it reacts to your local climate.

, Sweet William seeds are tough enough to survive most winters, and can be planted in fall or late spring to bloom 12 to 18 months later.If the plants have already started growing, or if you are concerned about a harsh winter, you may keep the plants in indoor pots, then transplant them outdoors in early spring. Once the seedlings are six to eight weeks old, they will transplant easily, with low risk of causing damage., Sweet Williams grow fastest in full sun, but are best suited for cool climates. Ideally, they should receive four to five hours of direct sunlight a day, but planting them in light shade is a wise option if you live in a hot climate (USDA zone 8 and above)., Sweet William prefers loose, rich soil that is well draining. Water should drain quickly through the soil, and never pool on top of compact, hard soil. Optionally, you may churn up the existing soil and supplement it with potting soil to provide more nutrients. While you do not need to test the pH of your soil to successfully grow Sweet William, you may adjust the pH to slightly alkaline (approximately 6.75) if you already have a pH garden kit.Garden soil pH kits are available at garden supply stores or online. Again, this is not a mandatory tool for growing Sweet William, which are fairly adaptable when it comes to soil pH., Plant Sweet William in winter (hot climates only), spring, or summer (cool climates only). Place them on the surface and lightly cover them with 1/8 inch (0.6 cm) of soil, or dig a trench to this depth and refill after planting the seeds. Space the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart in ideal circumstances to reduce the chance of rot and disease transmission.If you do not have room to give them this much space, you may bunch them closer together, but take special care not to overwater in this case.


If you are transplanting seedlings, simply transfer the soil around the roots into a hole twice as wide as the soil ball, then refill. Take care not to bury any part of the seedling's stem; the plant should be buried to the same level it was before.

, Sweet William seeds and seedlings benefit from an immediate watering after transplanting, but take care not to soak them with more water than can drain from the soil. Transplanted seedlings should be kept in moist but not soggy soil for a few days.Once they are established and recover from any withering that may occur, care for them as described in the care section.

, Keep the soil around seedlings slightly moist to slightly dry. Once the plant is mature and no longer growing, most varieties will not require watering except during hot weather.As with any plant, water more frequently if it appears withered or the soil cracks.


Sweet William plants can rot if exposed to too much moisture, so be careful not to over-water. The soil should never feel soggy or contain pools of water.

, If you wish to encourage faster growth and flowering, apply a general-purpose fertilizer to the soil once every 2–4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer, when growth or flowering is noticeable). Follow the instructions on your specific fertilizer carefully to avoid burning or damaging the plant.


It’s usually a good idea to dilute the fertilizer even more than specified on the container.

, Spray a general purpose insecticide on young plants to discourage disease. Sweet William is susceptible to nematodes. If you see the presence of nematodes, which look like tiny, round worms, use a fungicide on the plants according to the manufacturer's instructions.



Note: if you are planning to eat the Sweet William flowers or feed them to a pet, do not treat with any type of pesticide.

, Sweet William plants typically bloom during late spring or early summer, and then lose their flowers to the summer heat. When the flowers of Sweet William plants have dried, gently cut them off and discard them. This will encourage new blossom growth, and prevent the plant from dropping seeds if you wish to control your garden more closely.

, If your Sweet William plants are cared for correctly, and the variety is suited to the climate, there's a good chance they will seed your garden with a new generation before dying. If you want a wide scattering of Sweet William plants in your garden, simply let the flowers mature, die, and drop seeds on their own.


Be aware that some flower varieties are hybrids of multiple plants, and may produce seeds that grow into plants with different appearance or characteristics than the parent plant.

, In mid to late summer, after the flowers die, they will form dry, brown seed pods. Remove these once the pods are opening up at the end, about to release the seeds.Shake these pods into a container to get out the black, disc-shaped seeds for planting in fall or spring.

, Once the seeds have dropped, or after you have harvested them yourself, cut the seed pods off at the stem. Usually, the Sweet William plants will have expended too much energy producing seeds to continue growing another year, but removing the pods will increase the chance of another bloom.

, If you are lucky enough to have a Sweet William which survives more than a year or two, it may become quite large. In autumn or early spring, before much growth has started for the season, cut off one of the larger stems from near the base using a clean knife or shears. These cuttings can be planted to form new plants, although you may need to stake them to keep them upright.


Newly planted cuttings take time to form roots. Keep them in a warm, moist area away from direct sunlight to prevent them drying out while this happens. A few days underneath a transparent plastic bag or container may help create the moist conditions it needs."

Choose a style to match your climate.,
Consider colour impact as well as the range of colours of leaf type in Australian natives is large.,
Consider the speed of growth.,
Limit out species you may be allergic too, many Australian species flower en masse and release a lot of pollen.,
Explore the range of options, either be looking online or visiting a local botanic garden if it has a display of Australian plants.,
Plan your layout to according to the species you wish to plant and your climate.,
Incorporate natural features into your garden.,
Enjoy the best output of your garden by applying mulch each year, removing old dead flowers on shrubs or lightly pruning to encourage new growth and trimming back trees as required.

",How to Grow an Australian Native Garden," The general range is from tropical, arid, Mediterranean, temperate, alpine and grassland. If you live in an area that doesn't freeze, you have a large advantage as the range of species will be far wider. There are still a large range of plants to go for in cold environments.


Scrub land type gardens should focus on thick mulch and low levels trees and shrubs. Soil need not be rich, although the tropical specimens do prefer compost. Australian soils broadly are ancient, very weak in structure, nutrient poor and generally are high in salts, so many dry scrub forest species in the inland regions grow well in sand that is little better than beach sand. The other thing  is while many species tolerate and appreciate fertiliser, it is best to use sparingly.
Consider as well how much maintenance you wish to spend in your garden. Most Australian natives actually need very little work, but many require or benefit from occasional pruning and ""deadheading"" of old flowers. Many drop leaves, bark & flowers as well, so in some cases it can be a burden or an advantage.;
, Many Australian natives often have olive green or blue-grey foliage, this is another accent characteristic that can be an advantage. Some species sport red or orange new growth and there are flowers in almost the whole colour spectrum.

, Many species are also very slow growing (a result of the harsh environment they come from), but some grow quite quickly and may overcrowd existing landscapes. Some species of Australian trees are best for large open gardens.

, There are many times of the year in various cities that are known ""hay fever"" times. Some species, such as grevilleas contain pollens which can cause quite strong allergic reactions in rare cases.

, While there are many more species than those listed, some popular ones to consider are:



Large Trees: Eucalypt & Ficus species (of which there is a big range), cottonwood hibiscus, native frangipani, umbrella tree.

Flowering small trees & shrubs: Acacias, Dwarf eucalypts, Callistemon, most Melaleuca species, Banksia, Geraldton wax, waratah, grevillea species, native frangipani.

Small flowering shrubs: Kangaroo paws, Sydney rock lily, boronia, leschenaultia, desert ""everlastings"", schoenia species.

Character plants: Xanthorrhoea, Alexander & other palms, tree ferns, wollemi pine, gymea lily & cycads.

Hedges: lilli pilli, lemon myrtle & melaleuca can make very showy hedges.

, It is wise to group the same kind together to form an ecosystem more like they would experience in the wild. Dry landscape species often prefer maximum sun exposure. Shade is tolerable for many species of the forests, but several grassland species do not grow as well in shade. Most Australian plants like heat, but there are many from the Tasmania and alpine regions that tolerate frost.


If you are lucky enough to have a large area, planting an under canopy of tree ferns & other flowering shade plants is hauntingly evocative of some of the forests.

, Rocks can be very common in mountain and hilly areas but rare in coastal sand plains. Large granite stones, limestones or red desert stones are all useful to help give that feeling of Australia. You can cover existing stones with glue and colour them with sands while the glue is still wet.


Water features such as a creek, waterfall or pond are also great additions. Water can often be rare in the bush so many species grow around them like an oasis.
Dead tree logs are also characteristic features in almost all forest conditions and many support plant specimens.

Figure out why tree seeds are not growing.",How to Grow Plants from Seed," In most cases, you'll want to start your seed indoors. However, this depends on what you are planting. For example, lettuce and green beans do better when you sow them outside directly in the ground. This means you can plant before the spring frosts have passed. Cold-hardy plants can be planted indoors in late winter or early spring. Plants that thrive in heat need a later seeding date (mid- or late spring), so the weather is warm when the plants are ready to go outside.


Plants usually take three to six weeks to grow from a seed to a healthy plant ready to be moved outdoors, but some take up to fifteen.;
, Seeds planted outdoors are vulnerable to disease, insects, and bad weather. The survival rate will be higher if you care for the young plants indoors. A seed starting tray from a gardening store is a convenient option, but you can use any small container with drainage holes.









Before reusing an old container, scrub thoroughly with soapy water. Dip it in a solution of one part household bleach and nine parts hot water, then air dry. This will kill microorganisms that could harm the seed.Some plants such as lettuce, cucumbers, melons, and sunflowers suffer when transplanted if their roots are disturbed. You can start these seeds outside instead after the last spring frost, or plant each seed in a separate cell of a ""plug tray"" and transplant the whole chunk of soil., Making your own is simple, and much cheaper than buying it from a store. Just mix together equal amounts of perlite, vermiculite, and coir (or peat moss). This light mix drains quickly to prevent rot, and makes it easy for the sprout to emerge from the surface.Moisten the seed starting mix thoroughly, then fill containers to within ¼"" (6mm) of the top. Use any clean object to gently press the mix into a firm, level surface. Let excess water drain before you continue.








If you're using a store-bought mix, check whether it contains compost. If it does, you won't need to fertilize your seedlings. (Don't try to add compost to a homemade mix for your first project — it's more trouble than it's worth.)
If you use peat moss instead of coir, add hot water to make it easier to mix in.Since peat moss is acidic, it helps to add garden lime (calcium carbonate) to balance it out. Try ¼ tsp of lime per gallon of potting mix., If the seed starting mix has dried out, moisten it again before planting. Check your seed packet for exact spacing and planting depth instructions, or follow these guidelines:









Shared tray, one variety: Scatter the seeds loosely and evenly across the tray.

Shared tray, multiple varieties: Scratch shallow rows 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) apart with a clean ruler. Drop seeds of each variety into a separate row. Label each row.

Separate pots or plug trays: Plant one large seed (e.g. cucumber or melon seed) or two small seeds (e.g. most flower seeds) in each container.

, As a rule of thumb, bury seeds to a depth twice the diameter of the seed. Most tiny seeds need light to germinate, including petunia, lettuce, and snapdragon seeds. Just leave these on the surface of the mix.









Dry vermiculite or milled sphagnum moss (not peat moss) are ideal for covering seeds, but you can use dry seed-starting mix instead.Sprinkle the material on lightly. If you press it on hard, the sprout may have trouble breaking through the compact layer.

, Seeds are very vulnerable to over- and under-watering. A layer of plastic wrap or a plastic bag seals will often keep the mix moist until the seeds have germinated.








Most seed trays from garden supply centers come with a plastic cover to keep in moisture. If your seed trays did not come with a cover, then you can make a miniature greenhouse instead, or grow seedlings in an old, covered aquarium.

, If the seed packet doesn't specify a temperature, keep it at daytime temperatures between 65 and 75ºF (18–24ºC), and night temperatures no lower than 55ºF (13ºC).Put a heating pad under the tray if the room is cooler than this. Most seeds do best in plenty of light, but avoid direct sunlight if the containers are covered in plastic.









Some seeds germinate best in complete darkness, including tomatoes, larkspur, calendula, and coriander. Block the light with black plastic or cardboard.If you want to maximize success, you can look up your variety's specific temperature needs. In most cases, though, you'll only lose a few seeds to the ""wrong"" temperature, or the seeds will take longer to emerge.

, If the mix looks dry, place the container in a container of water. The mix will absorb water from the base of the container.This is less risky than watering from above, which can wash away the seeds or overwater them.









As mentioned before, the plastic is often enough to retain moisture for the whole germination period. This is just a backup.

, Most seeds germinate (sprout) within a couple weeks. Once sprouts have emerged from the soil, take off the plastic cover (if you were using one).









If you planted in rows in a shared tray, cut strips of plastic or cloth to cover the rows that have not yet sprouted., Move the container to a bright, south-facing window (north-facing in the Southern Hemisphere). If the temperature or lighting conditions on the windowsill are very different from the last location, move the seeds in several stages, gradually increasing brightness levels. Sudden changes may kill the plants.








If it is quite cold outside, you may need to place a heat pad between the planters and the window. Otherwise, the cold will be absorbed through the window and slow the growth of the tiny seedlings.
At far northern or southern latitudes that don't receive much sunlight, place a grow light 6 inches (15 cm) above the seedlings and turn it on for 14–16 hours a day. Move the lamp farther away as the seedlings grow to avoid burning them., Plants grow toward the light. If light only comes from one window, the seedlings will lean into it and grow long, weak stems. Give the containers a quarter turn each day to promote even growth.







, Unless your seed packet says otherwise, continue to keep the plants at daytime temperatures between 65 and 75ºF (18–24ºC), and night temperatures no lower than 55ºF (13ºC). Excessive cold or heat during this stage can cause unhealthy growth patterns, such as weak, ""leggy"" stems.







, The mix must stay moist but not soggy, or the delicate roots will rot or drown (unable to absorb oxygen). A water bath that lets the container absorb water from the base is ideal, since watering the sprout may break it or encourage disease.








Seeds will quickly die if allowed to dry mid-germination. Check at least once a day.

, The first set of leaves that appear are known as the seed leaves or cotyledons. The second set of leaves are the first ‘true leaves,’ and a sign that your plant is getting mature and ready for serious growth. Dilute a balanced fertilizer to ¼ the strength recommended on the label. Pour it into a tub and place the container in the diluted fertilizer to absorb it from below. Repeat once a week or as directed by the fertilizer label.








If the seeds were planted in a mix that contained compost, do not fertilize them. Too many nutrients can cause ""burns"" or other problems.
You can fertilize at ½ strength once the seedlings are in larger pots, and full strength once they are adults.

, If the seedlings are sharing a container, they may need a larger home to prevent them from crowding each other. However, this isn't necessary for all seeds. It depends on the variety. If you do need to thin out the seedlings, delay this delicate process, until the seedling looks sturdy enough to handle it. Typically, gardeners will only transplant the largest, healthiest seedlings. You can compost or give away the rest. Here's how to approach the transfer:








Wash the new container in soapy water, then rinse.
Fill the new container with moist, room temperature potting soil. Push a hole into it large enough for your seedling's roots.
Gently tease away the starting mix around the seedlings root using a popsicle stick or similar thin tool.
Lift the plant by the topmost leaves. Do not handle the stem.
Lower the plant into the hole. Use a pencil to spread out the roots a little, but don't worry if it's not perfect.
Sprinkle moist potting soil over the roots until the seedling is planted to the same depth as before. Press the soil down lightly.
Avoid changes in temperature and light levels for at least a few days, while the plant is recovering.

, ‘Hardening off’ is a process in which you slowly expose your plants to the fluctuating temperature and weather conditions outdoors, so that they don’t suffer from transplant shock. Start this process two weeks before the outdoor planting date appropriate for your plant:









Lower the temperature indoors slightly.
Water less frequently, but do not let the plants dry out.
Move them outdoors for an hour or two a day, in a shady area protected from wind. Avoid temperatures below 45ºF (7ºC).Increase the amount of time spent outdoors by an hour or so each day. Gradually expose the plants to sunlight. (The correct amount of sun depends on the plant and where you plan to move them.)

, Once the weather is warm and your plants can handle being outdoors all day, transplant them to a permanent outdoor pot or garden bed. Follow the specific directions for your plant, since every species has different temperature and sunlight needs. This is the basic outline only:








When possible, transplant on an overcast morning with minimal wind.
Wet the soil both in your plant's pot and in the new hole.
Carefully transfer the root ball to the new hole. Spread out the roots as much as you can without breaking them.
Add soil to the same planting depth as before.
""Water in"" heavily to bring the soil in contact with the roots.

, Transplanting is rough on plants, and it can take several weeks before new roots become established. After the initial watering, keep the plant moist but not soaked. Protect the plant from strong wind and rain until it's back to its healthy self.








, Newly sprouted seedlings die to fungus so often it has its own name: ""damping off."" Try again with new seeds, and take extra precautions to prevent spores from landing and taking hold:









Use sterile potting mix and clean all containers and tools with a 1:9 ratio of household bleach and water.Sprinkle dry vermiculite or perlite over the surface of the container after planting.
Avoid cool, damp conditions. If the soil drips water when you squeeze it, it is too wet.
For best results, treat the mix with fungicide, following label instructions.

, Many tree seeds, including seeds taken from oranges or apples, need special treatment to trigger germination. Following the exact instructions for your species will provide best results. Most seeds of this type need one or both of the following treatments:









Scarification: Seeds with a hard coat may need it removed or thinned. Try rubbing with a nail file or nicking it with a knife. You can even boil some tough seeds to soften the coat.Stratification: Many tree seeds in nature lie on the ground all winter and germinate in spring. A few weeks in a cold, damp environment mimics these conditions so the seed ""knows"" that it should sprout. Try keeping the seeds between two damp paper towels in the fridge, inside an unsealed zip-locked bag.

Grow sunflowers for your birds.",How to Grow a Pet Friendly Garden," There are several plants that your cats will absolutely adore if you add them to the garden. These include:

Cat grass (Dactylis glomerata) – this is great for chewing on to aid digestion. It is also loved by dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs.



 



Lemongrass – the smell intrigues many cats. If you're growing it for yourself, grow another bunch for the cats because they will probably chew it.







Catnip (Nepeta cataria) – the plant that cats will love to roll in. When dried, it makes excellent stuffing for toys.






Catmint (Nepeta x faassenii) – another beloved rolling-in plant. This can also be used dried in cat toys.






Mint family – most members of the mint family entice cats. Mice don't like peppermint though, so this can also help to keep mice away from the garden.







Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) – this appeals to many cats. As an added bonus, you can use it to make a flea repellent.






Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) – cats enjoy playing with the foliage and flowers.





;
, These are idea hiding spots for both cats and dogs and can also be a form of play entertainment for them to swat. Look for grasses that grow in bunches and have fun seed heads.

, Keep all of your pets and your children cool during summer with lovely shaded trees. Shady trees will allow pets to relax under them whenever needed, and cats will enjoy climbing them to escape the dogs and kids.


Avoid any trees that grow poisonous pods, seeds, berries, etc., if you have pets and young children. If you already have these growing, fence them off or pick up fallen berries, etc. regularly.

, Many pets will appreciate at least a small space of well tended lawn. Rabbits and guinea pigs enjoy spending time on a lawn with you nearby, and both cats and dogs enjoy lawn at all times of the day, rolling on it, sleeping on it, and playing on it.


Be careful about the pesticides and fungicides that you add to lawn, as pets and children playing on lawn can easily be infected by whatever you've sprayed onto it.

, A good crop of carrots and lettuces will keep your rabbits and guinea pigs happy for a long time. Pick regularly and feed to them. You can also cook up vegetables and mash into dog and cat food for added vitamins and nutrition.

, Not only are sunflowers beautiful in the garden, but you can take the opportunity to harvest the sunflower seeds and feed them to your pet birds. Simply add them to your bird's usual feeding dish.

Start from seeds.,
Propagate from stem cuttings.,
Air-layer from another plant.,
Buy one from a greenhouse.",How to Grow Philodendron1," It takes a long time to get a sizeable philodendron from a seed, but you can buy them from online gardening suppliers or personally collect them during blooming time. Put the seeds about 1/3 of an inch (1 centimeter) deep in nutritious breeding soil and cover them lightly. Spray the soil regularly to keep it moist.Philodendron seeds do not need to be soaked prior to planting.
The seeds will take about 2 to 8 weeks to germinate when the temperature of the soil is kept between 68 and 73 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 23 degrees Celsius).
When the seedlings sprout and become sturdy enough to handle, move each one to a small pot of its own to foster strong root development.;
, If you know someone who has a healthy philodendron or you find one growing wild, you can take a stem cutting from it. Make sure to cut at least 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) below a joint in a leaf stem and remove lower leaves near the cut. Place the cutting in a jar filled with water near medium light. When roots appear, plant the cutting in a small pot with potting soil.Orchid soil (with bark pieces) and a mixture of sphagnum peat and vermiculite or a mixture of sand and turf/compost can provide good nutrition for your newly planted cutting.It’s important to keep the cutting watered regularly.
Be sure there are drainage holes in the bottom of your pot, so that the cutting is protected from over-watering.

, Air-layering can be used when the philodendron you want to propagate from is too mature or thick to cut. Start by cutting halfway through a mature branch at a 45 degree angle. Insert a small piece of plastic (like from a bottle) in the semi-cut, wrap the cut site with a moist ball of moss, and then wrap and tie the moss onto the stem using plastic wrap and string.In about 2 weeks, you’ll see roots forming in the moss.
You may need to tie the semi-cut branch to a support if it’s unable to support itself.
Once you notice a healthy root system growing into the moss, you will be able to sever the stem about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the air-layering site.
Remove the plastic wrap and place the rooted moss ball into a small pot with rich soil. Make sure the pot has good drainage.

, If you want to enjoy a full-bodied philodendron right away, visit a local greenhouse and buy one there. There are many different varieties to choose from, and most of them aren’t expensive. Small philodendrons shouldn’t cost more than $10 USD, and they’ll come with their own custom care instructions."

Enjoy!",How to Grow Pistachios," Ideally, you should buy directly from a nursery, as you’ll usually get a better quality product. However, it’s also possible to grow trees from seeds bought in a grocery store. If you do this, make sure they are not salted or roasted. Otherwise they won’t germinate and will be useless for growing your own pistachios. You should be able to buy raw pistachios seeds from health food stores and some grocery stores.Keep in mind that pistachio trees are unisex (either male or female) and you won’t know the sex until the tree is first supposed to bear fruit, seven to eight years into its life.
Female pistachio trees are the only ones that will have fruit, but they need a male tree to fertilize them. As such, you should plant multiple trees to maximize your chances of having both female and male trees.;
, Fold up a standard paper towel until it’s just small enough to fit in the sandwich bag. Slide it into the bag. Using a mug or measuring cup, add just enough water to moisten the paper towel. The exact amount of water you use will vary depending on the absorbency of your paper towel., Don’t put too many seeds in the same baggie; about five seeds should do. Ideally, you should use a resealable sandwich bag. Using plastic bags with holes in them or an improper seal will hinder the germination of your pistachio seeds. Seal the bag once the seeds have been added.

Once you’ve put the seeds in, you should be ready to wait at least a week for the seeds to germinate.
Keep the plastic baggie at room temperature, in a location where it won’t be disturbed by children or pets., The sprouts will look like small green strands and should eventually burst from the seeds. As soon as you see these, you should transfer each seed over to a plastic party cup filled with soil. Make sure to drill a hole at the bottom of the cups for proper drainage. Water them just enough to keep the soil damp; too much water will hinder the tree’s growth.

As the plant grows, you’ll need to transplant it into bigger pots until it’s time to plant it outside., If you don’t want to wait for seeds to germinate, or you want to make sure you get a fruit-bearing tree, you can buy a grafted tree from a nursery. These are female trees with a single male branch attached, which allows the tree to fertilize itself. This way, you’ll just need to grow the tree rather than deal with the seeds., The hole should be as deep as the root ball that’s formed at the bottom of your pistachio tree. It should be twice as wide as the root ball. Use a shovel or a rake to break up the soil at the edges of the hole which will allow the roots to spread more easily.

Before planting pistachio trees, you should make sure you live in the right climate. They need hot, dry summers to thrive, and don’t do too well in excessive humidity., Make sure the plant is as vertical as you can get it. You can use a level if you want to make sure it’s completely vertical. Once it’s in the hole, use your fingers to gently pull the roots away from the ball and down into the soil. Start by pulling where the roots meet the trunk., Pick out stones, plants and weeds from the pile of soil. This kind of debris can hinder the growth of your plant. Use a rake or a shovel to transfer the dirt back into the hole.

To prevent any air pockets from forming in the soil, water it as you place it back in the hole., Pistachio trees are used to dry climates and don’t require a lot of water. A monthly deep watering should be sufficient to keep them healthy. If you notice that the tree’s leaves start to turn yellow, that means it’s getting too much water and you need to give it less.

You should stop watering your pistachio trees around October; this will allow them to go dormant and prepare for the winter., You’ll know the pistachios are ripe when the shell pops open and the meat inside goes from green to more of a reddish color. It’s important to harvest ripe pistachios as soon as possible, since they become vulnerable to bugs and disease when they ripen. Shaking the tree is enough to harvest ripe pistachios; they’ll fall from the branches themselves.

If you have a lot of trees to harvest, you may want to consider using mechanical agitators., Because pistachios open as they ripen, they’re vulnerable to mold and diseases. You should check any harvested pistachios to ensure there’s no mold forming on the meat. This mold can release aflatoxin which are carcinogens., If you’re harvesting pistachios for your own consumption, dig in and enjoy! If you’re harvesting commercially, you can either roast them for packaged snacks or use them in the preparation of other foods."

",How to Grow Moss," Moss is a wonderfully diverse plant, with dozens of variations of the traditional pillow-soft green roughage. There are two general types of moss though: pleurocarpous and acrocarpous. Pleurocarpous type moss grows low to the ground and spreads out horizontally very quickly. Acrocarpous type moss grows primarily in clumps and grows in height/thickness before spreading outwards.No mosses are flowering. At times they will produce small stalks with enlarged tips containing spores for reproduction. These are the sporangia.
If you’re covering a large space - such as your entire lawn - with moss, consider using a mixture of both pleurocarpous and acrocarpous moss.;
, If you want to get some professional advice on the best type of moss for your garden, or if you just would like the ability to view a wide variety of plants, head to your local nursery to get your moss starters. Different types of moss are compatible with each other, so don’t be afraid to mix and match the plants.


If you want the convenience of a large selection of mosses but aren’t near a nursery, there are plenty of mosses available for mail-order on the internet.
Check the growth rate for the moss you choose on the plant tag. Some mosses grow at an incredibly fast rate of growth, so you may not need to purchase as much of some species as others.

, If you’re not too picky about the type of moss you want to grow or are a bit more frugal, try getting your moss from the wild. Simply use a spade to dig a patch out of the ground or off the trunk of a tree. Try to pick up a bit of the matter/soil it is growing out of when you grab it, to help keep it alive and make transplanting easier.

, Moss isn’t too terribly finicky, but there are some ideal conditions under which it can be planted. Moss prefers moisture and indirect (slightly shaded) sunlight. It is great for using as ground cover underneath taller growing trees and plants. If your only available location happens to be sunlight-heavy, don’t fret too much; your moss should still be able to grow well enough.


Moss is great for irrigating out areas of your yard that tend to flood in heavy rains. Plant it instead of grass to help endorse drainage in the soil.
Moss doesn’t have a root system, so it can grow easily over rocky soil that grass wouldn’t otherwise be able to cover.

, If you’re planting in soil, loosen the soil by taking a garden rake and plowing it until it is fine and soft. You should be able to easily pick up handfuls of loose soil. Test the soil pH and make changes if necessary; moss prefers acidic soil with a pH between 5 and 5.5. Clear any plants or weeds beforehand. If you’re planting in soil or over a flat surface, make sure the surface is smoothed and totally flat. Unlike grass, moss will show small divots and holes in the ground or area it is planted., Use a hose or sprinkler to heavily water the area you plan on planting your moss. Then, place each selection of moss onto the area with a firm hand. Press the moss down into soil/onto rocky patches to get it situated and to keep it from moving away.

, After first planting the moss, it should be watered daily for 2-3 weeks. This will help to increase its growth and to keep it in place. A sprinkler head or hose with a very fine nozzle that mists the moss is much better than direct water pressure, which may damage the plants. Alternatively, you can use a very gentle irrigation system to continually water it.If the moss begins to appear dark green or patchy over time, it is likely receiving too much water.
You can lessen the watering after a month or so, but the moss should be kept moist whenever possible.

, One method of propagating moss is by dividing an existing piece into ¼ inch sections, and replanting them spaced apart. Break up a piece of moss into smaller pieces, and replant them near each other with about 1” of spacing between each piece.


This method only works if you’re planting moss in soil; trying to accomplish this on objects will be much more difficult as the small bits of moss are less likely to stick.

, No, not to drink. Create a super-growth moss mixture by blending up moss into a liquid that can be spread onto objects and vertical items - such as walls, rocks, planters, and trees. Fill an old blender with a large piece of moss, two cups of buttermilk, and two cups of water. Blend the mixture until it has the consistency of a traditional milkshake.


This concoction does not have the greatest scent, so try to make it outdoors to avoid smelling up your home.You can use moss that is dead or alive for this, and both will work in growing new moss.

, Coat your desired objects/garden plot with the moss milkshake. You can pour it directly onto things, use a paintbrush, or a spray bottle to get it spread out. Although not as visually appealing, you can spread this mixture onto the ground rather than planting live bits of moss.

,, If you don't have non-safety aspirin, soak the pills in a little water until the coating can be peeled off, and pour the whole thing into a blender.

, The mixture should be a little chunky, and not super pourable.

, This is not a great method for bare rocks, but works well around the bases of plants.

Pinto beans need soil temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) to germinate properly.These plants also need between 80 and 140 days without frost to reach full maturity.;
, To mature properly, pinto bean plants need at least six hours of direct sunlight per day.


Make sure that you have not grown other legumes in your chosen planting site within the past three years.

, The soil needs to be loose, well draining, and fertile. Consider mixing mature compost into the soil to improve these properties before planting the beans.


Also note that the soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.0. If the soil tests below 6.0, add lime or wood ash to raise it. If the soil tests above 7.0, add organic matter like pine needles or peat moss to lower it.
You can also consider adding pinto bean inoculant to the soil. Doing so is not especially vital, but it often helps the plant fix its own nitrogen more effectively.
Make sure that the compost and other amendments reach a depth of 6 inches (15 cm) within the soil.

, Pinto beans come in bush and pole varieties.


Bush beans are easier to grow but produce a smaller yield.
Pole beans require the use of a stake, trellis, or similar support system but tend to produce more.

, Place the beans you intend to plant in a shallow dish of water and allow them to soak overnight the evening before you plan on sowing them.


The beans should soak anywhere from 8 to 24 hours before you plant them.
Soaking the beans will prepare them for germination., If you are planting pole beans instead of bush beans, install a trellis, stake, or vegetable cage before you plant the beans.


The support system you use should be 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) tall. Ideally, the texture of the surface should be fairly rough since this will make it easier for the vines to climb it., Each hole should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep.Pinto bean plants do not transplant well, so you should plant the seeds directly in the soil instead of trying to start them early indoors.

, Place one bean in each hole. The eye of the pinto bean should face down.


For standard or light soils, cover the sown seeds with a loose layer of garden soil. If your soil is notably heavy, though, cover the seeds with sand, peat moss, vermiculite, or mature compost, instead.

, You should not drench the seeds, but you do need to make sure that the soil is adequately moist to promote better germination.


Water the seeds well immediately after planting them.
If you have not received much or any rain, water the seeds a second time three to four days after planting.

, When the seedlings have established themselves, thin them out, leaving only 6 inches (15 cm) or so between them.


Consider adding a little extra space to this if you are growing bush beans instead of pole beans.
Pinto beans will usually take between 8 and 14 days to germinate when the soil temperature consistently falls within a range of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 27 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the soil to dry out before watering the plants again.


Pinto beans can survive in mild drought, but if the roots become soggy, they can rot away.
Apply water at the base of the plant, directly to the soil. Avoid getting the leaves wet since this can lead to mildew and similar fungal disease. You should also water early in the morning to allow the plant and soil enough time to dry before the cool dampness of evening sets in.
Pinto beans should receive an average of 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water per week.
Withholding water is especially important once the bean pods begin maturing since doing so can help the beans dry on the plant.

, Mulch can keep the soil warm for a longer period, thereby extending the growing season. It can also help prevent or minimize weeds.


Mulch can also help prevent bean pods from rotting if any low growing ones touch the ground, and it promotes consistent soil moisture.
Black plastic mulch works especially well. Organic mulches, like weathered straw, untreated lawn clippings, and shredded bark are also great choices.
The mulch should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) deep.
Add the mulch shortly after the soil has warmed.
When weeds do pop up, carefully pull them out by hand. These plants have shallow root systems that can be disturbed very easily. It may even be best to simply shave off the top of the weeds using a shallow stroke with a garden hoe. These weeds may re-sprout from the roots, but they will eventually die off, and the roots of the bean plant will ultimately be safer.

, Apply a compost tea or similar fertilizer roughly halfway through the growing season.


The best fertilizers for pinto beans will be rich in phosphorus and potassium.
Pinto beans provide their own nitrogen, so you should usually avoid fertilizers that are nitrogen-rich. If the leaves begin to pale, though, the plant may not have enough nitrogen, in which case you should apply an organic fertilizer like fish emulsion that can offer a quick dose of nitrogen.

, If you have planted pole beans, you will need to train the vines to grow vertically during the first few weeks.


Tie the vines to the support system you installed using soft twine or small bits of cloth.
As the vines extend further, tie them higher along the support system. Never stretch the vines to the point of breaking, though.
After a few weeks, the plant will usually begin to grow vertically on its own and may no longer need training.

, Pinto beans are weak against fungal diseases and several pests, including aphids, leaf hoppers, mites, and beetles.


Prevent most fungal diseases by avoiding wet foliage and waterlogged roots.
Good air circulation should also help prevent diseases like blights and mosaic disease.
When you spot pests, use organic pesticide sprays, pick them off by hand, or spray them off with a garden hose.
Rabbits and deer can also pose a threat to your pinto beans since they eat away the leaves. If these animals start causing problems, install pest netting or fencing to keep them out of your plants.
Fungicides may be used if you spot signs of fungal disease, but you should select an organic fungicide if you plan to actually harvest and consume the pinto beans later.

, Most pinto beans will reach this stage between 90 and 150 days.


Bush beans mature at once, giving you a single harvest.
Pole beans yield several harvests and should be picked regularly so that more beans can grow.
Note that mature beans can barely be dented when bitten.
If the weather starts getting damp before the seeds fully dry, pull the entire plant after most of the foliage has already died and hang it by its roots in a well-ventilated, dry location. The bean pods can finish drying this way.

, You can shell pinto bean pods individually by hand or in batches.


To shell the beans in batches, place the pods in an old pillowcase and walk on it for a minute or so, crushing the pods open.
You can remove the chaff by pouring the beans back and forth between two containers or by letting them sit out in a breezy area.

, Place the beans in a freezer-safe container and let them sit in your freezer for several hours before transferring them to long-term storage.


This added step can help prevent problems with weevils and similar pests.

, Place the shelled, cool beans in airtight jars and store them in a dry, cool place, like a pantry or cellar.


Dried pinto beans will usually last at least one year if stored properly but may last even longer.

Provide shade and indirect sunlight.,
Use high-quality soil.,
Water regularly.,
Provide good drainage.,
Monitor the temperature and humidity.,
Let it creep.",How to Grow Philodendron2," Philodendrons are native to rainforests and grow wild under towering treetops, so you’ll want to choose a place in your home that provides shade and indirect sun (8-10 hours per day) to mimic these conditions.


If your plant is in a room without sun, you can create artificial light with a mixture of fluorescent and incandescent lighting.

, A light-weight, nutritious soil provides the best growing conditions for philodendrons. You can enrich cheap garden soil by adding compost, rotten leaves, coconut fibers, or flower soil., You want to keep the soil moist at all times, but never soaking wet. An ample water supply is key to growing large, uniform leaves.There is a common myth that philodendrons should be watered less in winter, but this is not true. Their native rainforests receive ample rainfall year around, so it’s important to mimic these conditions when you care for the plants., Philodendron roots will rot if they get too wet, so make sure that your soil doesn't get too compact and that your pots always contain drainage holes. To fix excessive compaction, gently knead and fluff the soil with your hands to add air and break up soil clumps., Philodendrons are native to temperate climates, which means they do best in warm, humid weather. The ideal temperature for a philodendron is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) with 60% humidity.


The plants are adaptable to temperature fluctuation and can survive in temperatures as low as 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius), but they cannot survive frost or freezes.You can buy temperature and humidity monitors at most garden centers.

, A well-cared for philodendron can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) in height. In order to reach that height, many types of philodendrons need to climb and creep up something sturdy for support, so make sure you place the plant within touching distance of a beam or pole.


You can also place tree branches or moss sticks right in the pot to facilitate climbing.

"
"
Fertilize 5 to 6 times a year.,
Watch for signs of sickness.,
Re-pot annually.,
Prune it during periods of slow growth.,
Keep your plant clean.",How to Grow Philodendron3," Philodendrons need nutritious soil. Liquid fertilizer is a great food source, but be sure to follow the directions and use the weakest dilution that is specified on the label. Because philodendrons don’t get direct sun, they can’t process strong fertilizer.


If your plant is exposed to varied seasonal sunlight, you’ll want to fertilize a little more often in the fall and winter months. This will keep growth steady.
As your plant grows bigger, you’ll want to switch to a fertilizer with increasing amounts of nitrogen to support broad, green leaf growth., If you notice yellow patches or sunburn spots on the leaves, your plant is getting too much direct sunlight. If your leaves turn brown and fall off, you are using too much fertilizer. If the leaves start to yellow, you are watering too much. Wilting leaves mean that you need to water more.

Spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and thrips are pests that can damage your plant. If you notice them, try wiping them away with a mild soap, luke-warm water, and a soft cloth., As your plant grows, it will need a bigger pot to live in. Philodendron roots prefer a bit of cramping, though not excessive cramping. When you notice your plant’s roots begin to compact into a ball, it’s time to move the plant into a pot that is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) larger.Repotting should be done before the plant experiences new growth. Each plant will be different and growth habits will be dependent on where you live, but it’s usually best to re-pot in late winter or spring.
Monitor water levels closely after a re-potting. You don’t want the roots to dry out in the new soil space.

, If you notice your plant’s growth slowing, it is a good time to prune it. Using pruning shears, trim rotted roots and any areas on the plant where you see stunted growth. You can also trim tips of the plant to achieve a shorter, more-desirable height.To access the roots for pruning, de-pot the plant and gently remove any clinging soil. The best time to prune roots is when you are moving the plant to a larger pot.

, Many people keep their philodendrons indoors and the leaves can collect dust and clog their pours. Be sure to keep your plant clean and dusted with a soft, damp cloth."

Pick off any beetles, caterpillars, snails or slugs on the ivy.,
Place shallow cans filled with beer around the ivy to attract snails and slugs.",How to Grow Ivy," Ivies spread aggressively through spreading roots and seeds that are dispersed by birds after their inconspicuous flowers finish blooming. They are considered invasive in certain areas because they invade nearby areas and kill off the native plants.


It is extremely difficult to get rid of ivy once the roots begin to spread.;
, English Ivy is considered an invasive plant species in these areas.As well, Boston ivy is considered invasive in a few areas in the northeast United States. Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) grows well in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 8and has dark glossy green three- to five-lobed leaves with lobes that are pointed rather than rounded.
Swedish ivy (Plectranthus australis) is another commonly grown ivy but it is usually grown indoors.It only grows well in Zones 10 and 11where winter temperatures rarely drop below −30 °F (−34 °C).

, If you live in an area that does not allow you to grow ivy outdoors, you can plant non-invasive species like the Crinkle-leaf creeper (Rubus calycinoides), which grows well in Zones 6 to 10., You can also plant them in areas with full sun exposure.


Boston ivy thrives in full sun or partial shade and Swedish ivy grows well in partial shade.

, When growing ivy indoors, put the containers in an area with bright indirect light or where they will get an hour or two of direct morning sunlight.

, English ivy grows best in loamy soil that is high in organic matter but will grow in nearly any type of soil except wet clay, as this type of soil does not drain quickly.Boston ivy will thrive in nearly any type of soil as long as it drains quickly. Swedish ivy requires fast-draining soil that contains plenty of organic matter.
When the soil drains too slowly, the ivy leaves will turn yellow and drop.

, If you do not use a fence or trellis to allow the ivy to climb, they will grow along the ground like a ground-cover plant. They can also be planted about 8 inches away from a fence, trellis or other climbing structure and allowed to climb.Do not plant Boston ivy along a building with wood shingles where it will grow beneath the shingles and into the house siding.Ivy will also grow around wiring, shutters and downspouts where it can eventually do serious damage so be aware of any possible structures near the ivy that you do not want to be invaded by the ivy.
English ivy does not grow as aggressively as Boston ivy, but it can also do serious damage to structures if it is allowed to grow freely.

, Give them 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water each week, or about 6 gallons (22.7 L) of water per a week.


Use a soaker hose or watering can and always water below the leaves to help prevent mildew and leaf spots.

, Check the container periodically while watering. Dump it when it gets full, put it back in the soil and turn off the hose when it gets full the second time.

, English ivy, Boston ivy and Swedish ivy are all drought tolerant and can survive long periods without supplemental water after they have been growing for a year or two. This supplemental water is more important for English and Swedish ivy than Boston ivy, which will do just fine with even less than 1 inch of water per week., This will help the soil to retain moisture.

, Pour the water evenly over the soil until it runs out the bottom. Always empty the catch basin beneath the container to prevent the caught water from leaching back up into the soil and making the soil too wet.


If ivy is not watered enough, the leaves will turn brown and crispy and fall from the plant. If it is watered too often, the leaves will turn yellow and drop.

, Sprinkle 8 ounces of fertilizer per 50 square feet over the soil around the ivy and water it to wash the fertilizer down to the roots.Use fertilizer with a ratio of 19-6-12., You can also spread slow-release fertilizer beads over the top of the potting soil in the spring.


Do not give ivies fertilizer in the winter., Fertilizer can burn the plant’s roots if the soil is too dry.


Ivy that is not given enough fertilizer will grow much slower than ivy that is given fertilizer.

, A container full of roots means the plant has become pot-bound. The potting soil may also dry out more quickly than usual.Use a new pot that is only one size larger than the old pot.

, Pour 1 inch of potting mix into the bottom of the new container, pull the ivy out of the old container, set it in the new container and finish filling it with potting mix.


Water the newly repotted ivy generously to help settle the soil.

, Dull cutting tools will crush and damage the ivy stems.

, The stems generally grow about 1 foot per year but they may grow faster, depending on the species and growing environment.


Outdoor ivies should be trimmed back by 6 to 12 inches each year to control their spread. But how much you remove from each stem on either indoor or outdoor ivies is a matter of preference.
If the ivy is intended to cover a large fence or wall, it can be left to grow without pruning. Once it has reached the size you want, however, it should be pruned back as much as necessary to keep it in its place., Indoor ivy stems can be left to grow all the way to the floor or up a moss pole or trellis, but they generally look better when they are trimmed back.


Use hand pruners or sharp scissors to trim back any unruly stems to your preferred length.

, Downy and powdery mildews, leaf spots, cankers, stem rot, root rot and wilt are not life-threatening diseases for ivies; however, they can be rather unsightly.Downy mildew produces yellow spots on the tops of leaves and fluffy gray mildew on the bottoms.
Powdery mildew produces a white, powdery-looking substance on the tops of leaves.
Leaf spots are black or brown spots on the leaves that are caused by bacteria or fungi.
Keeping the leaves of the ivy dry will help prevent these diseases.

, Combine 2 tablespoons of any type of cooking oil, 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo and 2 tablespoons of baking soda mixed into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Shake the ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed. Pour the solution in a spray bottle.Diseased ivy can also be treated with chemical fungicides that contain copper but these chemicals are tightly regulated and can cause harm to people, pets and the environment., Do this every seven to ten days during cool, rainy weather.


Do not spray the ivy with the solution when temperatures are over 85 °F (29 °C) or in the hot mid-day sun as the solution will dry too quickly and could damage the leaves.

, This will also remove any fallen bacteria or fungal spores that could re-infect the ivy.


If the ivy is being grown as a ground cover plant, pick the fallen leaves and debris out of the stems by hand to avoid disturbing the roots.

, Make the cut a few inches below the canker where the ivy stem is still healthy.


Cankers are bacterial infections that often set in when a stem is injured. The cankers are dark brown or black. The ivy stem beyond the canker will not grow well and the leaves will turn yellow-green.

, If any sections of the roots are blackened or brown and mushy, they are rotten will need to be removed and thrown away.Stem and root rots and wilts go hand in hand. When these diseases occur, new ivy leaves will be small and yellow, the tips and edges of the leaves may turn brown, the leaves will drop and the entire plant will wilt.
If only a few roots are rotten but the rest are white and healthy, try watering the ivy less often. It may recover.

, All of these pests will suck the plant juices from ivy leaves and stems and secrete honeydew, a clear, sticky liquid. However, once they are sprayed off, they often cannot get back onto the ivy or are killed by the strong spray of water.


If watering them with a strong spray from a hose does not work, spray the ivy with the same solution used to kill mildew but leave out the baking soda.
Aphids are tiny, oval or egg-shaped, soft-bodied insects that can be nearly any color.Leaf hoppers are small, wedge-shaped brown, green or yellow insects.Mealybugs and scale insects are flat, tiny, immobile, oval-shaped insects that are commonly tan, brown or off-white.Spider mites are barely visible. They spin a very fine web between ivy stems and leaves and cause a light stippling or tiny white or yellow dots on the leaves., These pests will chew on the ivy leaves. Wear protective gloves when picking off caterpillars as some species can sting., They will then crawl into the beer and drown.Sink a tuna or cat food can of beer into the ground near the ivy so that the top of the can is level with the ground.
Check the cans every afternoon and dump the dead snails and slugs. Then, re-fill the cans and place them back into the soil near the ivy.

Choose the right time to sow.,
Select an outdoor site with well-draining soil.,
Avoid over-sowing the seeds.,
Water the seeds after planting using a fine watering spout.",How to Grow Moss Rose1," Sow your Moss Rose seeds indoors about six weeks before you expect the last frost in your area. If you would prefer not to grow your plants inside to begin with, wait until after the last frost has passed and then sow the seeds directly into your garden.


If your area doesn’t experience frost, you can sow your seeds around March.;
, The spot should get full sun throughout the day. The soil should drain well as Moss Rose’s do not enjoy soggy feet.Because Moss Roses prefer well-draining soil, avoid planting these plants in clay soil.

, Moss Rose seeds are very tiny, so take care not to over-sow them as this will eventually crowd the plants and may cause some plants to die off. Some gardeners mix the very fine Moss Rose seeds with sand to make the seeds easier to sow.


Sow the seeds so that they are about eight inches apart. Cover the seeds up with about ⅛ of an inch of fine compost.

, Use a fine watering spout to water your seeds. Using a fine watering spout is important because a heavy spray could wash away the seeds and young seedlings.

Cut off a piece of the house plant's stem.,
Trim the stem to prepare it for new growth.,
Dip the cut stem into rooting hormone.,
Place the houseplant cutting into its container.,
Position the plant pot in a warm, well-lit spot.,
Repot the plant if desired.",How to Grow Houseplants From Clippings," When you make the initial cut, try to preserve a piece of stem about 2- 6 inches (5 - 15 cm) long with 3 leaves on it. You can make this cut with a regular pair of scissors. The sharper the scissors, the less damage there will be to the plant's cells, which will increase your chances of a successful propagation.;
, After making your cut, you will need to trim the cut piece in a few ways to get it ready for rooting.


First, trim the bottom of the piece just below a node. A node is the joint where a leaf meets the stem, so you will cut the piece so that the lowest leaf joins the stem right at the bottom of the overall length.
Next, cut all 3 of the leaves in half. Cutting half of each leaf's area away will keep the plant from diverting too much of its energy towards the leaves, instead using that energy to grow new roots.
Remove any flowers or fruit. Flowers, fruits, or flower buds should be removed as well to conserve energy for root growth.

, This step is optional, but will greatly increase your chances of a quick, successful propagation. Rooting hormone is a liquid product available at nurseries that encourages a plant to grow new roots. You can simply dip the bottom of the cut stem into the rooting hormone to soak it effectively.

, Prepare a pot with damp potting mix and poke a pencil into the mix to make a hole for the bottom of your cutting. Lower the stem into the hole, making sure that the lowest node is completely covered by soil, as the new roots will grow from this node.

, Your plant cutting will grow best in bright but filtered sunlight and in a warm temperature. Water the potting mix every few days as it starts to dry out; aim to keep it damp but not completely saturated.

, You can check for root growth by gently lifting the cutting out of the potting mix. Once the roots have started to grow, you can either leave the plant to grow in its current container or pot it in a new, larger container. For the first few months of the plant's growth, pay special attention to its watering and lighting to make sure it becomes established.

Store the remaining microgreens in a glass of water.",How to Grow Microgreens," You will need a container that is two inches deep and has enough surface area for the amount of greens you want to grow. To save money, keep your old takeout containers for this purpose. You could also use one an old plastic salad container. Make sure the container has holes at the bottom for drainage.If you prefer, you could pick up some propagation trays from your local garden center, which are designed for this purpose.;
, You will need potting soil and coconut coir. Potting soil will be the base of your soil, and the coconut coir is added to improve water retention and air flow. Coconut coir is excellent for seed propagation purposes. For each tray, you can use three quarters potting soil and one quarter coconut coir. You can get both products at your local home and garden center.You can also pick up some vermiculite to use at the planting stage. Vermiculite is a mineral that helps with seed propagation.

, If you are growing in a warm climate and have lots of light in your house, simply place your tray of microgreens beside a sunny window. However, if you are growing microgreens indoors and do not have much light in your house, you will need a grow light. If you use artificial light, you should place the light four inches above your tray of microgreens. You can use a cheap fluorescent shop light with fluorescent bulbs.If you have a bit more money, you can use full spectrum fluorescent grow lights. These lights will help your greens grow a little better but are more expensive.You can also use a four inch T5 CFL grow light., Since microgreens are harvested early, all of the nutrients and any of the pesticides that may be on the seed will be highly concentrated. If your seeds are not organic, they could contain a higher amount of toxins than regular greens. So, you should always purchase organic seeds for microgreens., If you are looking to spice up a salad or sandwich, you may be interested in growing some of the spicy microgreens. For example, try growing one of the following spicy microgreens:


Purple delight basil grows in four weeks, has purple leaves and a sweet, spicy flavor.
Red giant mustard has red veins and is spicy. It grows in four weeks.
Lemon basil has bright green leaves and a spicy lemon taste. It grows in four weeks.
Ruby streaks mustard grows in two weeks. It has a sweet and spicy flavor.
Green wave mustard grows in two weeks. It has a spicy flavor and ruffled leaves.
Daikon radish grows in two weeks and has a spicy taste.

, If you want something a bit more on the mild side for certain dishes, there are a number of celery, beet and other microgreens to choose from. For instance, you might be interested in growing one of the following microgreens:


Celery microgreens have a mild flavor and mature in four weeks.
Bull’s blood beet has a spinachy, earthy taste, growing in four weeks.
Dark purple mizuna grows in two weeks and has a mild mustard flavor.
Hong vit radish grows in two weeks and has a mild radish flavor.

, You should cover the container with two inches of soil, in a ratio of three quarters potting soil and one quarter coconut coir. Lightly pat down the soil to make a flat seeding surface but without compressing it too much., The seed packet may give you specific instructions for propagating the microgreens, such as how deep to plant the seed and the time to maturation. If there are specific tips or instructions for the type of microgreen, you should follow them., Place a handful of seeds in one hand. Place your hand palm upwards, at a slight angle towards the surface of the soil. Use your thumb, index and middle finger to gradually spread the seeds as they fall from your hand. Try to spread the seeds evenly.If you are growing smaller seeds, you should aim for a ratio of ten seeds per square inch.If you are growing larger seeds, you should aim for a ratio of five seeds per square inch., If you have any vermiculite, you can use it instead of the soil. Vermiculite is a mineral that is used for seed propagation. After applying the thin layer of soil or vermiculite, you should still be able to see some of the seeds. You don’t want to bury them completely., You should mist your greens once per day. If you are not sure whether they need water, stick your finger a half inch into the soil. If the soil is dry, they need to be watered. If it is damp, the seeds should be happy. If it is extremely wet or marshy, you may be drowning your microgreens., If you are using propagation tray, simply place another tray on top of the one you are using. If you are using a takeout or other container, you could cover it with a plastic bag. Make sure you put a few holes in the plastic bag so that the seeds don’t suffocate., It should take about a week for the seeds to germinate. A couple days after germination, take off the cover to expose the seeds to more light. Let them grow for two to four weeks before harvesting, depending on the type of microgreen.

, You know they are ready to harvest when they are one to three inches in height. At harvest time, cut the base of the microgreens, just above the soil. Since they are tiny and grow close together, you should be able to cut a whole bunch at once. One or two clippings should be enough for a salad or sandwich.It will take anywhere from two to four weeks for your microgreens to mature.

, You can wash your microgreens under tap water. Dry them in a salad spinner or with a clean towel., A handful of microgreens such as spring onion or radish microgreens tastes great on a burger. Once you have all of your usual ingredients on the burger or sandwich, simply throw on a handful of microgreens.For instance, salmon burgers taste great with microgreens.
You could also throw some microgreens on your tacos.

, The next time you are making a green salad, throw some microgreens on top for some extra flavor. Swiss chard, beet and radish microgreens are among the most flavorful in salads.For instance, you could make a rainbow beet and pistachio salad with microgreens., If you are making a spinach omelette, for instance, you could add the microgreens at the same time as the spinach.If you are making an egg white omelette with avocado and goat cheese, microgreens are a wonderful addition., If you have any remaining microgreens after your harvest, you can put them in a glass of water in the fridge. Place a quarter inch of water in a cup and then add your leftover greens. They will stay fresh a little longer if you store them in a cup of water. The next time you are craving greens, grab your leftovers instead of harvesting more microgreens.You should not fully submerge the microgreens in the water. Rather, you just want the roots and the bottom of the stems to be submerged in the water.

Keep the plant moist but not over watered.,
Don't worry too much about the care needs of this plant.",How to Grow Mind Your Own Business," Ask them to get some for you if they don't have any in stock.


If you know someone with the plant, take pieces of it. They can be detached easily and simply potted to grow new ones.;
, It tolerates good light or slight shade. It also needs a mild climate.


If wished, grow in the pots (containers) of tall plants to act as cover over the compost given to the that plant.

Take more cuttings than you expect to grow.,
Prepare the cuttings and allow them to take root.,
Keep the cuttings well watered.,
Root the cuttings in water if you can’t plant them outside.",How to Grow Moss Rose2," Moss Rose is very easy to root from cuttings. However, you should assume a failure rate of about 2/3, so take about three times more plants than you require (though you may have much better success than this!).


Moss Roses can be grown from cuttings every year. This means that after the first time you plant Moss Roses, you will not have to buy these plants again, you can simply take cuttings from the plants you are already growing.

, Take four to five inch sections of healthy growth, strip the lower foliage, and insert about an inch of this cutting into the soil.


Press the soil gently around the cutting to help your Moss Rose cutting grow roots, or ‘root’, more quickly.

, If you can, root your cuttings outside, as they grow well with direct sunlight. However, if you do this, don’t forget to water your cuttings regularly until they become established.


Water your cuttings regularly until they take root. Once they are established, however, you can water them less. Wait until the ground around your cuttings feels dry in the top two inches of soil.

, You can also get cuttings to grow roots in a glass of water. Once they have grown their roots, move them to the site where you hope to grow them in your garden.

"
"
Consider soil drainage.,
Plant the Moss Rose into a hole as deep as the root ball.,
Keep the moss rose well watered until it is established.",How to Grow Moss Rose3," If your soil doesn’t drain well, consider planting your Moss Roses in containers. If the soil already drains well, turn the soil over using a spade.


Incorporate some sand into the soil if the soil isn’t already sandy.

, Dig a hole in the soil that is about as deep as the root ball of your rose, and twice as wide. Place the Moss Rose into the hole and then fill the hole in with soil.


Pat the soil down around the rose gently. Water the rose to help settle the soil around it and get rid of any air pockets in the soil.

, After you have planted your rose, water your rose a few times a week for at least two weeks after planting.


After two weeks, your plant should be established in the ground, which means you can water it less (this will be discussed more extensively in the next section).

"
Water your Moss Rose approximately once a week.,
Fertilize the moss rose before blooming.,
Pinch off dead flowers to encourage new growth.,
Trim and fertilize the Moss Rose in mid-summer.,
Keep pests under control.",How to Grow Moss Rose4," Moss Roses will tolerate drought but try to water them regularly if you can. Simply watering them once a week should be enough for the plant. Use a watering can to water the base of the plant; try to avoid watering the foliage and flowers.Avoid using a hosepipe or sprinkler to water your rose, as these devices may damage the delicate flowers. Irrigation systems work well for Moss Roses as these systems water the roots of the plant, not the foliage.
Do not over-water your plants, as they do not grow well in waterlogged soil.

, An all-purpose fertilizer, or one for growing tomatoes, can be applied to this type of rose before it blooms. For store-bought bedding plant, apply this fertilizer just after planting.


Apply fertilizer to seed-grown plants when they grow to their full size.
These plants only require a small amount of fertilizer; too much fertilizer could keep these plants from flowering.

, Try to remove dead blooms once they wither (a process called deadheading), so that the plant has the energy to produce new blooms.


You can use your fingertips to pinch off dead flower heads.

, Moss Roses will keep blooming all summer and into the fall but by the height of summer they may become a little faded. If this happens, trim the plants back by about a third of their size and give the plant a light water-soluble fertilizer such as tomato feed.

, You may find your plants attract aphids. Control aphid attacks with an insecticide spray. You can also mix dish soap with water. Pour this mixture into a spray can and then spray it on your plants.


You can also hose your plants off with a high-pressure hose but this will usually be too strong for the delicate blooms of a Moss Rose. Only do this after blooming has ended.
Slugs and snails may also attack young plants. Control these pests by laying down pellets.

,
Cover the whole hotbed with a plastic sheet.",How to Build a Compost Hotbed," This will essentially be your hotbed. While hotbeds were traditionally made with horse manure, any compostable materials will do. A pile of leaves and grass clippings will do the trick; you might be able to find a local landscaping company that will happily ""donate"" this material. Try to keep the top of the pile level. You'll also want to avoid making the pile so wide that you can't reach into the middle of it if you need to.

There are many other varieties of Hoya plant, including the larger Hoya carnosa, Hoya australis, and Hoya bandaensis.If you need help finding a Hoya bella, speak with the nursery staff and ask for their assistance.


The Hoya australis is larger than a Hoya bella, and has waxy pink and red flowers.

Hoya carnosa has deep green, oval-shaped leaves.;
, If no Hoya bella plants are available at a local nursery, you can find and purchase one online. Check large and well-known online plant retailers, such as Nature Hills, Wayside Gardens, Burpee, or Spring Hills Nursery. Wax plants can also be purchased through Amazon.


It’s uncommon and difficult to grow a Hoya bella plant from seeds, so you probably won't be able to find any online. The Hoya blooms infrequently release seeds, and the seeds are tough to grow., If you know someone with a Hoya bella plant, or are having trouble locating a Hoya bella in a nursery, you can grow this plant from a cutting. Take herbaceous or woody stem cuttings in the summer. When cutting a section to plant, take at least 3 inches (7 cm). Make sure that the cutting includes at least one set of leaves.When planting a Hoya cutting, use a porous, well-draining soil.Place the cutting in a small pot (with about a 6-inch diameter). Water the plant weekly, and the Hoya will produce roots within a week or two.
Keep the planted Hoya bella cutting in partial sunlight. At this stage, full sun may cause the plant to wither.

, Wax plants will grow in nearly any type of planter, as they can adjust to most soil types. Since the plants tend to form vines and long, leafy tendrils, hanging baskets are an ideal container for Hoya bella.However, they can also thrive in a ground planter. Look for a large planter, with a 12-18 inch (30-46 centimeter) diameter.


This plant is a tropical or a tender perennial and is best kept in a container for bringing inside during winter months if you live in a region with frequent (or heavy) frosts.

, If you choose to grow your wax plant outdoors in a garden, the plant will need physical support to grow on. Plant the flower near a trellis or climbing fence. It can also be grown well against a wind-sheltered fence that gets plenty of light.To successfully maintain a Hoya bella outside, you need to live in a climate that is warm and humid all year.

, Hoya bellas can thrive in a variety of soil types, including most potting mixes. The soil must drain well, but should stay moist in between waterings.To increase the drainage quality of a potting soil, add a handful of sand, grit, or charcoal.


You can find a variety of potting mixes at your local plant nursery or garden center.

, While Hoya bella plants do not need to be set in direct sunlight, they do benefit from frequent exposure to indirect sunlight. If you have a north-facing window in your house, office, or apartment, place the Hoya bella plant on this windowsill.The Hoya bella will wither and may die if placed in the hottest sunlight for a long duration.

, The soil of the Hoya bella should be kept damp during these seasons to encourage growth. Water the plant sparingly during winter, as the plant will be dormant and not need much water in this season. A good rule of thumb in winter is to water the Hoya once you notice the leaves starting to wilt. 








Use a mist sprayer during the warmer months, to increase the humidity.
Do not over-water the wax plant. The soil should never be swampy or saturated with water.

, This will help the plant grow and produce a larger number of flowers. During spring, summer, and autumn (roughly March through October), fertilize the plant once every three or four weeks.Fertilize the plant using a liquid all-purpose plant fertilizer. You can also use tomato fertilizer or orchid fertilizer.









Do not fertilize the plant during the winter months (November through February), as the Hoya Bella will not grow during these months even if fertilized.

, Use your fingers to remove dead flower heads and scraggly stems that are clearly dead. You can also use a pair of household scissors to trim long vines, if you’d like to keep the wax plant small and compact.








Do not prune the small, leafless stems. These will eventually develop and produce flowers, and too much pruning can inhibit blooming.

, The root system of a Hoya bella will grow over time, and the plant that you initially planted it in will become too small. To encourage growth, replant the wax plant every two or three years. Hoyas can thrive when slightly root-bound, so there is no easy visual method to tell when the plant needs repotting. Always replant in the spring, since this will allow the wax plant to start growing into its new pot promptly.Every time that you repot a Hoya plant, increase the pot size by about 2 inches (5 cm).
Do not repot the Hoya bella when it is already in bloom. If you do, the plant will likely drop all of its flowers.

Purchase vermiculite.On your next trip to a home improvement store, ask a sales representative to direct you to the vermiculite stock.,
Ensure vermiculite works for you.Vermiculite is a solid choice for gardening in containers because of its high level of water retention.,
Prepare a container.Growing plants in a container will allow you to better control the growth conditions.,
Make a foundation using newspaper or cardboard.Giving your box a floor will limit the plant's roots from encroaching beyond the container while it's growing.,
Pour vermiculite from the bag into soil.20-25% vermiculite will have a major effect on a soil plot's ability to retain water and promote plant growth.,
Spread the vermiculite evenly.,
Seed, or transfer plants into your container.After you have aerated the soil, add your seeds or plants to the container.,
Cover small seeds.Covering smaller seeds with an added bit of vermiculite will help lend them some much-needed moisture during the early growing stages.,
Water your container.,
Pour out excess water.Because vermiculite retains water so well, you don't have to have too much water in your container.,
Improve an existing compost.In addition to a container garden, you can add vermiculite to existing compost in order to further aerate it.,
Acknowledge vermiculite's association with asbestos.Because vermiculite is sometimes associated with asbestos, you should keep asbestos risk in mind whenever handling it.,
Avoid the attic for storage.Asbestos is commonly used in insulation with housing.,
Call an expert if there's trouble.",How to Use Vermiculite in a Container Garden," It is usually shelved alongside other garden fertilizers. Fortunately, vermiculite is relatively cheap; you'll be able to purchase a 1kg bag for under $10.Medium grade vermiculite is the standard choice for gardening.Because vermiculite isn't a particularly popular material to use with gardening, there's a chance a more general store won't keep it in stock. When in doubt, check a gardening outlet for supplies. Looking up stores online will give you an idea of a store's stock without having to physically visit it.;
, Clay-based soils will become soggy with the addition of vermiculite. Although this isn't necessary for soil that already gets adequate rainfall, vermiculite will help maximize the moisture your container receives if it needs that extra push.


Although you should still regularly water a gardening container manually, vermiculite is good if your climate is hot and doesn't get much rain on its own.Peat, perlite and manures are alternatives that may better suit your gardening situation if you're looking for a more general fertilizer.

, Take four 2x6 wooden boards and nail them together to create a four foot square box. This amount of space should be enough to grow the majority of container plants.


Saw down the boards first to make sure they're smooth-edged and are the same width and length before you nail them together.
Two nails (on near the top and one near the bottom) should be enough to firmly secure one board to another.

, Something simple and biodegradable like cardboard or newspaper is a perfect foundation. From there, you can fill up your container with plant-appropriate soil.


Landscape fabric is another alternative for this purpose.

, Open up your vermiculite bag and drain the contents into the soil you have prepared for the container. When this is finished, you can add the soil mix to the container.


It helps to measure out the soil into your container beforehand. That way, you can add vermiculite until it reaches the 20-25% goal.
Add vermiculite with soil or moss peat. Peat is another well-known fertilizer. You can increase the fertilization by combining vermiculite as such. Vermiculite may also be used on its own.

, Because a container is relatively small you'll want to make the most of the entire soil area. You can do this by spreading the vermiculite throughout the pot with a spade. You may add vermiculite to the soil before adding it to the container. This way, you can mix it together without worrying about damaging the plants.


If you've properly measured out how much soil needs to go into the container, having that amount in a bag and adding the vermiculite to the bag will allow you to shake it up, thereby distributing it without having to proportion it out yourself.

, If you're transferring a plant, lift it out gently from its original pot and place it in the desired spot in the container. If you're seeding the container from scratch, add seeds and bury them just beneath the soil's surface.


The seeds should be buried just beneath the surface. Don't put them too far into the soil or they'll have a hard time germinating.
Be careful not to damage the roots of your plant if you transfer them into the container. Dig a small hole for it beforehand, and gently place it in. It may be helpful to place some fresh vermiculite around the plant to account for the dry soil the new plant brought in with it.

, In addition, vermiculite helps fend against weeds, although you shouldn't have a problem with them in a closed container environment.

, Watering plants is a vital part of gardening. This is especially true if you're gardening with a container, as you'll need to take that much more control of the growth process. Due to the high level of water retention in vermiculite, you should take care not to overwater your plants. Give your container a shower dispersed evenly throughout the area, but don't allow pools of water to form on the soil's surface.

, Turn the container slightly on its side and let out the excess water.


Alternatively, you can allow the water to drain out naturally., Add 20-25% of the compost's volume worth of vermiculite and mix them together thoroughly.

, Although the main source of contamination (a mine accident at the Libby Mine in Montana) is no longer being sold, there's still some stigma due to the association.


If you are concerned about this, you can have a sample of your vermiculite sent to a lab for testing.Asbestos is a material used to insulate buildings. It is poisonous to humans.

, Because vermiculite picks up asbestos so easily, you shouldn't store it in an attic, or other places where there's a lot of insulation.


Putting it in a shed should be fine, so long as the area is free of moisture.

, In the case where you think asbestos may have tainted your vermiculite, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional. A professional well-versed in insulation and asbestos should help out your situation.If you notice something acting up in the vermiculite or negative signs to your personal health, you should see a doctor immediately.
Shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain are all signs of asbestos contamination."

Research to see whether your plant is acid-friendly.,
Use coffee grounds on other plants.,
Brew your coffee as usual.,
Use only untouched brewed coffee.,
Dilute the coffee.Combine about 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water more than coffee as a standard mixture.,
Add the coffee liquid to a water sprayer or can.

,
Water the plants.",How to Water Plants with Coffee," Look up the type of plant that you have and see if it correctly digests acidic products. Many herbs and indoor plants will be suitable for this liquid coffee treatment. These are some examples that you can spray a coffee mixture on:

Spider plants
Roses
Hydrangeas
African Violets.;
, As well as using up the liquid, there are ways to also get rid of the grounds that are beneficial for suitable plants. For example, you can combine coffee grounds with soil, compost or fertilizer. These products can then be given to plants such as the following, to boost their growth:


Lettuce
Gardenias
Azaleas
Hibiscus.

, Decide if you wish to brew a normal batch or a strong mixture, as this will determine how much water you will need to use later.

, Consume, save, or discard any coffee that has been mixed with sugar and/or cream.

,


For example, if you have 1 cup (240 ml) of leftover coffee, mix it with 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) of water.
The amount of water can be more or less, depending how strong the original coffee is.

,, Select one day out of the week to apply the diluted coffee on the plants. Coffee can be quite acidic, so you will only need to use it sparingly versus natural water.


Start out small. It is better to give just a little and work out what your plants respond to than to overdo it and cause the plant to react poorly. You can slightly increase the dosage until you consider it is sufficient.

Add the clippings in thin layers to the compost so that it doesn't clump up into big chunks.Make sure that your grass clippings are fresh because dried grass clippings will add carbon to the compost.;
, Green plant clippings, weeds, and freshly cut flowers from your lawn can also increase the nitrogen found in your compost. After trimming the plants on your lawn, add the remains to your compost. Do not, however, let the green material dry out or you'll be adding more carbon to the compost.Do not add badly diseased or insect-infested trimmings to your compost.
Avoid adding weeds that contain seeds to your compost.

, A ratio of one part manure for every five parts of carbon material will bring your compost's nitrogen level to a healthy level. Look for manures or fertilizers that have a high nitrogen number, such as a 48-0-0 fertilizer.In a 5x5 foot (1.52 x 1.52 m) bin of compost you'd add 1/3 to 1/2 cup (113 - 170 g) of fertilizer to the compost.

Combine one to two pounds (453.59 - 907.18 g) of bone or blood meal per 100 pounds (45.35 kg) of carbon material., Read the instructions on the back of the corn gluten meal to know how much you should add to your compost. Sprinkle the meal on top of the compost to increase the compost's nitrogen levels. You can purchase corn-gluten meal online or at some gardening stores., You can buy nitrogen-rich granular fertilizer at a home and gardening store or online. This fertilizer comes in small balls and can be sprinkled on top of your compost to increase the nitrogen levels.

Combine coffee grounds into your compost.,
Add fruit and vegetable scraps to your compost.,
Do not add meat, feces, whole eggs, and dairy products to compost.",How to Add Nitrogen to Compost2," Add one part coffee grounds to one part grass clippings and one part leaves to create a nitrogen rich compost pile. Coffee grounds contain 20 parts of nitrogen to one part of carbon, making it an exceptionally nitrogen-rich amendment.Use the leftover coffee grounds from after you brew coffee.
If mold grows on your coffee grounds you can still use them because it will be broken down during the composting process.

, Instead of throwing away vegetable and fruit scraps, add them to your compost pile after you're done with ingredient preparation. These are high in organic material and will add nitrogen to your compost pile., These compost ingredients will attract wild animals and aren't ideal for compost. You should also avoid adding pet feces to the compost because it could spread disease."

Wait two months.",How to Add Nitrogen to Compost3," Lay 4 - 8 inches (10.16 - 20.32 cm) of dry leaves twigs and straw on the bottom of a closed container. This carbon-rich material will help aerate the bottom of the compost and help keep it moist., Use organic material like lawn clippings or table scraps and layer it on top of your twigs and leaves., Continue to lay down the dry twigs and green organic material in layers until your compost pile is around 3 feet (91.44 cm) deep., The compost materials should remain moist so that it breaks down to form compost. Check on your compost daily to make sure that it isn't drying out from the hot sun. Spray down the organic material every day so that it stays moist., The center of the compost should be kept at 130 -150°F (54.4 - 65.5°C). Use a thermometer to get the temperature of the compost. Keeping the compost at a high heat will increase decay and quicken the time that the material turns into compost. Cover the container for the compost so that animals can't get into it.Without heat, the compost will take anywhere from 6 -12 months to fully break down.

, Continue to keep the compost hot and wet. Turning the compost over once a week will add oxygen to the compost, a necessary component to composting., Continue to turn your compost once a week and water it regularly. In two to three months the compost will ultimately break down. When the compost is ready it will be brown, crumbly, and sweet-smelling. You can now use the compost to promote healthy growth in your lawn and plants."

Brace yourself for impact.,
Undo your seat belt.,
Open the window as soon as you hit the water.Following Professor Giesbrecht's recommendation, leave the door alone at this stage and concentrate on the window.,
Break the window.,
Escape through the broken window.,
Escape when the car has equalized.,
Swim to the surface as quickly as possible.,
Seek medical attention as soon as possible.",How to Escape from a Sinking Car," As soon as you're aware that you're going off the road and into a body of water, adopt a brace position. This is done by placing both hands on the steering wheel in the ""nine and three"" positions. The impact your car makes could set off the airbag system in your vehicle and any other brace position could cause serious injury in such an event. If your hands are located at ""ten and two"" position when the airbag inflated it could force your hands into your face resulting in serious injury. Remember, an airbag inflates rapidly, within 0.04 seconds upon being triggered.Once this aspect is out of the way, prepare for the next step immediately.



Remain calm. Panic reduces energy, uses up precious air, and causes you to blank out. Repeat a mantra of what to do to get out (see next step) and stay focused on the situation at hand. Panic can be left for the shore when you reach it.;
, Professor Dr Gordon Giesbrecht, who specializes in cold water immersion, says that the seatbelt is the first thing to attend to, yet it often gets forgotten in the panic.His motto is: Seat belt; children; window; OUT (S-C-W-O).


Unbuckle the children, starting with the oldest first (who can then help the others).Forget the cell phone call. Your car isn't going to wait for you to make the call and sadly, people have lost their lives trying this.Get busy getting out.
There is a counter-theory that suggests the seat belt should be left on. This theory suggests that if you release your seat belt, you may, due to underwater disorientation, end up moving away from the window or door opening due to the ingress of water through the opening. If you need to push the door open, being anchored by the seat belt might give you additional leverage, versus pushing the door while you're suspended in the water. Having your seat belt on could also help you maintain your sense of orientation if the car flips upside-down. On the downside, having your seat belt on can also make it harder to get out quickly and to move out, which is the point of reacting quickly from the start and not waiting in the vehicle. In the video featuring Rick Mercer and Professor Giesbrecht below, they show clearly that it's important to be able to move around from the start, including if you need to move to the backseat to get out of the car as the engine-heavy front part starts tipping deeper first., A car's electrical system should work for up to three minutes in water,so try the method of opening it electronically first. Many people don't think about the window as an escape option either because of panic, lack of using the window for exit normally, or because they're focused on lots of misinformation about doors and sinking.There are several reasons for not bothering with the door according to Professor Giesler. Immediately upon impact, you have only a few seconds in which opening the door of your sinking car is possible, while most of the door is still above water level. Once the car has started to sink, it is not humanly possible to open the door again until the pressure between the inside and the outside of the car has been equalized (leveled); this means that the car cabin has to be filled with water and that's not really a state you want to be in.Moreover, Professor Geisbrecht says that by opening the door, you invite a quick sink in place of the floating time available to get out. In his experiments with 30 vehicles, he found that all vehicles float, anywhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes. You could be using this float time to escape rather than opening the driver's side door and giving the water 5 to 10 seconds to sink the car and drown everyone in the backseat.There are numerous theories that advocate staying in the car calmly until it hits the bottom, fills with water, and you open the door and swim up. Mythbusters termed this the ""maximum conservation of energy"" approach and it looks viable when you watch it. The trouble with this theory (tested only in a swimming pool of known depth with a rescue crew on full standby) is that most times you won't know the depth of the water into which your car has plummeted, so waiting this long will usually prove fatal. This method worked just over 30 percent of the time in Professor Giesbrecht's study, while his S-C-W-O approach worked over 50 percent of the time.The end of the car that contains the engine will usually sink fastest, often leaving the car at an angle where the heaviest part of the vehicle is lower than the lightest. As such, you may be able to open some doors while the car is still floating.

, If you aren't able to open the window, or it only opens halfway, you'll need to break it. You will need to use an object or your foot to break the window. You can also take your headrest off and use the metal inserts to break a window.It may feel counter-intuitive to let water into the car, but the sooner it is open, the sooner you will be able to escape directly through the broken window.


If you have no tools or heavy objects to break the window with, use your feet. If you have high heels, these might work when placed at the center of the window. Otherwise, Professor Giesbrecht advises that you aim to kick near the front of the window or along the hinges (see the demonstration in the video below).Be aware that it's very hard to break a window by kicking, so find these breakpoints. Don't even try the windshield; it's made to be unbreakable (safety glass) and even if you did manage to shatter it (unlikely in the time you have), the stickiness of safety glass can make it hard to get through.Side and rear windows are the best options for escape.
If you have a heavy object, aim for the center of the window. A rock, hammer, steering wheel lock, umbrella, screwdriver, laptop, large camera, etc., might all serve as suitable battering objects. Even the keys might work if you're strong enough.
If you've already thought ahead, you might have a window breaking tool handy in the car. There are various tools available. Professor Giesbrecht recommends a ""center punch"",which is a small tool that could be easily stowed in the driver's side door or on the dashboard, for fast retrieval. This power punch is usually spring-loaded and can also be found in a hammer shape. Failing that, you could also carry your own small hammer.

, Take a deep breath, and swim out through the broken window as soon as you've broken it. Water will be gushing into the car at this point, so expect this and use your strength to swim out and up. Professor Giesbrecht's experiments have shown that it is possible to get out through this torrent (contrary to some theories) and that it's better to go now than to wait.Look to children first. Heave them up toward the surface as best you can. If they cannot swim, see if you can give them something that floats to hold onto, with strict instructions not to let go. An adult may need to go with them immediately if there is nothing to hold onto.
As you exit the car, do not kick your feet until clear of the car - you could injure other passengers. Use your arms to propel you upward.
If the car is sinking quickly and you haven't gotten out yet, keep trying to get out of the window. If there is a child in the car, tell them to breathe normally until the water is up to their chest.

, If it has reached the dramatic stage where the car cabin has filled with water and it has equalized, you must move quickly and effectively to ensure your survival. It takes 60 to 120 seconds (1 to 2 minutes) for a car to fill up with water usually.While there is still air in the car, take slow, deep breaths and focus on what you're doing. Unlock your door, either with the power button (if it is still working) or manually. If the doors are stuck (which they probably will be in most cases, with the pressure being massive), hopefully you've been busy breaking the window already, as advised in the previous steps.


Continue to breathe normally until the water is at chest level, then take a deep breath and hold your nose.

Stay calm. Keep your mouth closed to preserve breath and to prevent water from entering. Swim out through the broken window.
If exiting via an open door, place your hand on the door latch. If you are unable to see it, use a physical reference by stretching your hand from your hip and feeling along the door until you locate the latch.

, Push off the car and swim to the surface. If you don’t know which way to swim, look for light and swim toward it, or follow any bubbles you see as they will be going up. Be aware of your surroundings as you swim and surface; you may have to deal with a strong current or obstacles such as rocks, concrete bridge supports, or even passing boats. If it's ice-covered water, you'll need to head for the obvious hole created by the car's impact. Do your best to avoid injuring yourself on obstacles, and use branches, supports, and other items to cling to if you're injured or exhausted.

, The adrenaline in your bloodstream after the escape may make you unable to detect any injuries you may have sustained in the accident. Hail passing motorists who can call for help on their phones and provide you with warmth, comfort, and a lift to nearest hospital.



Hypothermia may be a real possibility, depending on the water temperature, level of shock passengers and drivers are experiencing, and external temperature.

Deal with any health issues impacting your family.,
Stay healthy.,
Take care of your children's specific needs.,
Set a manageable schedule to start rebuilding.,
Seek help.,
Be patient.",How to Cope Following a Flood1," Before anything else, ensure that everyone is safe and in the same place or at least somewhere you know they're safe. In bad times, togetherness is more important than ever for providing mutual support for all family members.;
, It's important to deal with health impacts such as protecting against waterborne diseases, stress, and fatigue.


Take care of emotional health. Discuss what is happening, talk together and share your anxieties. Let others talk to you to help release tension. Allow space for releasing emotions: crying is a natural response to a disaster and it’s also a great way to release pent-up emotions. Watch for signs of stress. You've just been through a disaster and the recovery period can be long, hard, and chaotic.
Ensure that everyone is getting enough sleep. Fatigue can bring on other health problems as well as reducing energy levels. Rest often.
Eat well. You are more likely to suffer from stress and health problems when you are weak and nutritionally impoverished.

, Prevent the flood waters from causing further damage to your family's health by keeping good hygiene as much as possible.


Wash your hands with soap and water, thoroughly and often.
Confirm that the water is clean and safe. Don’t drink it or wash dishes until you’re sure. Typically, flood waters mix with septic tanks and city sewer systems, so it is best to wait for civil authorities to declare the water safe to drink.
Be safe around poisons. Many of the products you'll use to clean, disinfect, and repair your home are poisons. Keep them out of the reach of children and wear appropriate covering to protect yourself.
Take care not to hurt yourself. Injuries, especially back injuries, are a common side effect of cleaning up after a flood. Be conscious that infections are everywhere.
Report health hazards. Tell the Health Department about animal carcasses, rats, dangerous chemicals, and similar hazards on your property.
Infants, pregnant women, and people with health problems should avoid the flooded area until cleanup is complete. When you work in an area that has been flooded, you'll be exposed to dangerous chemicals and germs that you are not used to and can make you very sick.

, Watch your children closely. You can expect to see them display fear or symptoms of stress.


Make an effort to re-establish normal family routines as quickly as possible, including schooling.
Listen to what children say. Encourage them to talk or otherwise express their feelings.
Explain the disaster factually. Knowing the facts can help children deal better with the disaster.
Reassure children. Show them through words and actions that life will return to normal.
Be understanding. Remember, they are also going through a rough time too. Be aware too that some children have heightened sensitivities to the emotions of adults around them and will react accordingly.

, Getting active as soon as possible can help restore a sense of coping and well-being. Make a list and do jobs one at a time. Establish a schedule to clean up and rebuild. See the later sections of this article for more details.


As part of your plans, be sure to include flood-proofing. People who are prepared ahead of time are better able to deal with disasters. Getting ready for the next flood can give you a sense of control over the future.

, Special outreach programs and crisis counseling are often set up following a disaster because so many people need help to cope with their situation. You might be able to get shelter, food, supplies, debriefing, etc., through such services.

, Above all, try to be patient with your family, your neighbors, the local, state, and federal authorities, and volunteer agency personnel.

Be aware that the biggest plant does not always mean the best.,
Look for signs of unhealthiness.,
Look for blemishes, spots, discoloration and other pest damage on leaves, stems, and branches of the plants.,
Avoid plants with weeds growing in the pot.,
Avoid plants whose roots are growing out the base of the pot.,
Check to see if the plant has been well tended or neglected.,
Choose from the best plants left.",How to Choose the Best Plant at the Nursery," A large plant might suffer more shock being transferred from the pot to the garden than a smaller one. If you are going to grow a large plant, such as a 2-3 year old tree, get good, solid advice from the nursery employees about its chances and your garden situation, as you're going to be paying a good price for this plant and it's important that it take to your garden well.;
, When looking at the plants you would like to take home, look for any signs of disease.

, This is likely a sign of pest infestation.

, This means it has been sitting in the pot too long and its care has been neglected.

, Again, the plant's needs have been neglected.

, Check soil moisture, pruning, general look etc. Recent pruning might indicate removal of unhealthy growth. Be a careful inspector.

, Once you have discarded some plants for the above reasons, it is a case of which plant looks best in shape and appeals to you most. After a while, you'll get a very quick ""feel"" for doing this.

Unplug everything first.,
Soak up as much water as possible with a wet/dry vacuum.,
Steam clean the carpet.,
Disinfect everything.,
Apply a product to prevent mold growth.,
Use fans and a humidifier.",How to Clean Up Water Damage1," Before you begin cleaning, unplug everything. It is very dangerous to enter a water damaged home if electronics are plugged in. Carefully unplug everything from the wall and turn off any appliances before you begin cleaning.;
, If you don't have a wet/dry vacuum, you can rent one at a hardware store. To begin the process of drying out the floor and walls, run the vacuum over your floors, walls, and anywhere else where you notice built up water damage. Sop up as much set in water as possible with the wet/dry vacuum., For water damaged carpet, your best option is steam cleaning. You can rent a steam cleaner at a local hardware store if you do not own one. Run the steam cleaner over the water damaged carpet to remove moisture and clean your carpeting.For very water damaged carpet, professional steam cleaning may be the best option.

, Water damage can cause the build up of bacteria in your walls, floors, and carpeting. Disinfecting these areas to remove water damage is important. You can buy a disinfectant cleaner at a local grocery store or hardware store. If possible, ask a worker for a disinfectant specifically designed to treat water damage. Scrub down your walls and floors with a disinfectant.Read the directions of the disinfectant you purchase. Different disinfectants will need to be diluted with different levels of water.
You can also make a solution at home using a combination of bleach and water. It depends on the type of bleach you're using, but half a cup of bleach per gallon of water is usually a safe ratio., Mold growth can occur, especially in wood, after water damage. After cleaning and disinfecting your floors and walls, apply a product that inhibits mold growth. Purchase your product at a hardware store or department store. Apply it according to package directions., Even after sopping up most of the water, there is likely some lingering water in your floors and carpeting. Keep fans in the room and have them on for 24 hours a day. This can speed up the drying process. You should also place a dehumidifier in the room if you have one.If you don't have a dehumidifier, consider renting one, purchasing one, or borrowing one from a friend. They can really speed up the drying process.

"
Check your home before entering it again.,
Turn off the electricity.,
Turn off the gas.,
Go inside carefully.,
Rescue the most valuable items.,
Protect your home from further damage.,
Drain your basement carefully.,
Hose the house and its contents.",How to Cope Following a Flood2," Once it's safe to go back in, you'll be able to start protecting your home and contents from further damage. Things to check before entering include:


If there is standing water next to the outside walls of your home, don’t go in. You won’t be able to tell if the building is safe or structurally sound.
Walk carefully around the outside of your home and check for loose power lines and gas leaks. If you find downed lines or leaks, call your utility company and don't enter until they've checked.
Check the foundation for cracks or other damage. Examine porch roofs and overhangs to be sure they still have all their supports. If any supports or portions of the foundation wall are missing or the ground has washed away, the floor is not safe.
If you have any doubts about safety, contact a contractor before going in. Proceed very carefully.

, Even if the power company has turned off electricity to the area, you must still make certain your home’s power supply is disconnected. You don’t want the power company to turn it on without warning while you’re working on it.

, Gas appliances and pipes may have moved or broken during the flood, creating a gas leak. If you suspect a leak or smell gas, leave your home immediately and call the gas company from a neighbor’s home or emergency shelter. Leave the door open and, if the gas meter is outside, turn off the gas.

, If the door sticks and has to be forced open, it has probably swollen. If it only sticks at the bottom, it can be forced open. If it sticks at the top, your ceiling may be ready to fall.


Once inside do not smoke or use candles, gas lanterns, or other open flames.
Air out your home completely—there may be explosive gas. This also ensures that moisture is given a chance to start drying out. Open doors and windows if the weather permits.

, Find and protect the irreplaceable valuables such as money, jewelry, insurance papers, photographs, and family heirlooms.


Wash the mud off, so the items can dry.
Resist the urge to stop and clean everything you pick up. You need to get to work on protecting your home, assessing all the damages, and planning your recovery.

, Your flood insurance policy may cover some of the cost of protecting your home from further damage or moving the contents to a safe place. Read your policy before you need it and ask your agent what expenses are covered by your policy.


Patch holes. Cover holes in the roof, walls, or windows with boards, tarps, or plastic sheeting. It may not look pretty, but you need to do this so further rain won’t cause any more water damage.
Repair sagging floors or roof sections. Use 4 x 4’s or other heavy lumber to brace weak areas. If you’re uncertain how to shore up floor or ceiling joists, call a contractor.
Remove debris. Tree limbs or other trash that may have landed on or floated into the home should be cleared away.
Check for broken or leaking water pipes. If you find any, cut off the water supply by turning off the valve at your water meter. If the water pipes aren't leaking, use your tap water for hosing and cleaning. But don't drink or cook with tap water until it has been declared safe!

, If your basement is flooded, don’t be in too big of a hurry to pump it out. The forces in the water soaked ground outside could make the basement walls buckle or even cave in.

, Most of the health hazards you'll face come from the mud, mold, and algae left behind by flood waters. It's very important to get rid of the mud as soon as possible. This is a lot easier if it's done before the mud dries out.

"
"
Call your insurance agent.,
Start listing the damage.,
Check for structural damage.,
Plan your recovery.,
Check on the availability of financial assistance.,
Seek government emergency funding where relevant.",How to Cope Following a Flood3," The sooner you can talk to your agent, the sooner your claim will be filed and an adjuster will be assigned to review your damage. Your agent may also be able to give you advice about where to get help with cleanup and repairs.


You may have as many as three separate insurance policies: homeowner’s, flood, and wind and hail. Call your flood insurance agent to report your damage as soon as possible after the flood. If you are unable to contact the local agent, in the United States you can call the National Flood Insurance Program at 1- 800-638-6620.

, List the damage and take pictures or videotapes as you clean up so you'll have a complete and thorough record. If you have flood insurance, you'll need to file a ""Proof of Loss"" form within 60 days of the flood. Completing your own inventory form will make this form easier to complete and will also help the adjuster determine the costs to repair the damage to your home and belongings.

, Is there evidence of broken or cracked basement or foundation walls? Are there broken pilings, shifted stairs, or slanted floors or walls? Any of these things could mean that the foundation, floors, or walls will have to be totally rebuilt.

, Get organized with a recovery plan. A recovery plan is simply a list of jobs that need to be done. Planning can help you save time and money. To develop a recovery plan, follow these steps:


Make sure it is safe to work in your home.
Decide what repair work you can and can’t do.
Decide if you need financial assistance.
Check with your mortgage holder.
Think before you use credit cards.
Keep talking openly with your family about what's happening and where things are headed.

, Voluntary agencies, businesses, insurance, and government disaster programs can help you through recovery. Private voluntary agencies such as the American (or other country) Red Cross, Salvation Army, non-profit organizations, and church or charity groups are usually on the scene during or right after a flood. These groups provide for immediate needs such as clothing, groceries, shelter, medical aid, and counseling.


Your local TV, radio and newspapers will usually publicize how businesses are contributing to the recovery process. Some businesses may offer reduced prices, but be wary of “flood sales” that are selling flood damaged items.

, If the flooding was widespread and caused a lot of damage, your community might be eligible for state, provincial, or federal aid. If the flood is severe enough for your area to be declared a disaster area by the federal or national government, funds will often be freed up to assist victims. Each country has different processes in place, so look online for the relevant government department, or contact your local representative.


In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency may open “tele-registration”, which provides a toll-free number for you to call to request assistance. Or, it may open one or more Disaster Application Centers. This program may provide a safe place to live until repairs to damaged homes are completed. Home and business owners, farmers, and others with real or personal property losses may be eligible for low interest loans. This program may provide funds for necessary expenses and serious needs. If a federal disaster declaration was made, you might quality to file an amended tax return for the past year and get a partial refund for your uninsured casualty losses.
Note that many programs now encourage “flood proofing,” that is, modifying the structure to help it withstand damage from the next flood.
A variety of programs give advice on recovering from a disaster. These include help with unemployment, food stamps, income taxes, insurance claims, legal issues, veterans benefits, and crisis counseling.

Reduce the humidity in your home.,
Sort contents and discard debris.,
Get the water out of the ceilings and walls next.,
Drain the ceilings and walls.,
Remove water trapped within your walls.",How to Cope Following a Flood4," Everything will dry more quickly and clean more easily if you can reduce the humidity in the home. If the humidity outside is lower than indoors, and if the weather permits, open all the doors and windows.


Open closet and cabinet doors, and remove drawers to allow air circulation.
Use fans to help move the air and dry out your home. Do not use central air conditioning or the furnace blower if the ducts were under water. If there is a way to run the fan in reverse, run it venting to the outside to dry out the ducts.
Run dehumidifiers to draw out moisture. Dehumidifiers and window air conditioners will reduce the humidity, especially in closed up areas.
Desiccants (materials that absorb moisture) are very useful in drying closets or other enclosed areas where air cannot move through.

, You have three types of contents that should go to three different places:


Move items you want to save to a safe, dry place, such as the second story, or outside.
Put things you don’t want to save outside to dry until the adjuster comes to confirm your losses.
Get rid of food and anything else that could spoil or go bad immediately.

, How you drain and dry your ceilings and walls depends on what they are made of.


Gypsum wallboard becomes very soft when wet. It will be fragile, and will lose any shape or strength when it dries. Gypsum, drywall, and sheetrock will have to be ripped out.
Plaster will survive a flood better than wallboard. It should not have to be replaced but it will take a very long time to dry.
There are three main types of insulation and each reacts differently to flood waters. Styrofoam survives best; it may only need to be hosed off. Fiberglass batts should be discarded if they're muddy. Cellulose (loose or blown-in treated paper) insulation will hold water for a long time. It can also lose its anti-fungal and fire retardant abilities. Therefore, flooded cellulose insulation should be replaced.
If wood is allowed to dry naturally, it will generally regain its original shape, with some exceptions such as laminated wood.

, Check for sagging ceilings. Drain them carefully; start by making a hole near the edge of the sag a and work in toward the center.

, To check for water, take off the baseboard. Stick an awl or knife into the wall about 2 inches (5cm) above the floor (just above the 2 X 4 wood sill plate). If water drips out, cut or drill a hole large enough to allow water to drain freely. Depending on the spacing between studs in your walls, make a hole every 16"" (40.6cm) or every 24"" (60.9cm). That wall will have to be ripped out.
"
"
Remove soaked items immediately.,
Brush mold and mildew off furniture.,
Soak up extra moisture using desiccants.,
Hand clean appliances.,
Throw out mattresses.",How to Clean Up Water Damage2," Any furniture that has been soaked in water should be immediately removed from a room. Furniture is likely to get more wet sitting in a water damaged room. Move furniture to a dry area with good ventilation, such as the attic, until you're ready to clean it., In the events of things like floods and leaks, mold, mildew, and debris can build up on furniture. In the event you notice these issues, use a cleaning brush to surface clean your furniture. Brush off any obvious mold and mildew., Desiccants are materials that absorb moisture. They include things like clay, calcium oxide, and silica gel. After brushing off any obvious mold and debris, sprinkle a desiccant over your furniture. These will help soak up water that's stuck in the fabric.It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to soak up the excess water.
You may need to periodically replace your desiccants if your furniture is very wet. Desiccants change color when they become saturated.

, Appliances also get wet and dirty from water damage. You can surface clean appliances with an all-purpose cleaner to rub away any debris built up on their surfaces. However, do not attempt to clean electronics like televisions and stereos on your own. This can cause serious damage. Electronics should be cleaned by a professional., Unfortunately, mattresses cannot usually be salvaged after water damage. If a mattress gets wet, it's best to dispose of it at a local dump."
"
Make a photographic record of the damage.,
Talk to your insurance company.,
Consult professionals to clean valuables.,
Have upholstered furniture professionally cleaned.",How to Clean Up Water Damage3," You should always take pictures of damage after a flood or other natural disaster causes water damage. Photograph each room thoroughly, as well as any appliances that were damaged. This will be important to show to the insurance company when making a claim., Call your insurance company after water damage occurs. Explain the extent of the damage to them, and show them evidence like photographs you took. Most homeowners insurance policies should pay for at least some of the costs of cleaning and repair., Things like books, photographs, and paintings usually require professional cleaning. Rare or valuable objects especially should only be treated by professionals to prevent damage. Contact professional cleaners in your area that specialize in water damage to clean such objects.If there is built up dirt on the objects, cleaners may advice you to rinse them with water before bringing them in to prevent stains from becoming set.

, Upholstered furniture is difficult to clean on your own in the event of water damage. Hire professional furniture cleaners to deal with upholstered furniture that has been soaked in water."
"
Have a professional restore the gas.,
Make sure your main oil valve is turned off.,
Check with your building or electrical inspector to see how much work you can do on your wiring.,
Wait for the water to be restored.",How to Cope Following a Flood5," If the gas has been turned off at the main valve serving your home, you need to have a professional restore gas service to your home, relight pilot lights, and do a final check of the system.

, Check your oil pump. If it got wet, have the pump professionally checked and cleaned. After you've turned the electricity back on, open the main valve and turn the pump on. Look carefully for any signs of leaking oil; if you see any, call a professional.


Propane, LP gas, and butane systems are kept in pressurized tanks, so there is no electric pump to turn on, but there are check valves and emergency shut-off valves. Check the tanks for signs of movement or floating. Then follow the instructions above for gas systems.

, Many local codes require that a licensed electrician do the work, or that a municipal inspector check the system before you can turn the power back on.

, Public water suppliers usually provide water soon after the flood. If you're unsure of your water supply, only use it to hose your home or for sanitation purposes (such as flushing the toilet).


Private wells should be pumped until the water is clear. You can decide whether water is clear enough to hose your home and do other cleaning work. Check with the local health department for instructions before you drink or cook with your well water.
Check your water heater. If flood waters got into the gas burner, electrical parts, or insulation, it should be replaced. If you want to save it, have it cleaned and restarted by a professional.
Public sewers should work soon after a flood, but mud and debris might clog them. Flush the toilet before you use it. If it's clogged, check with your local sewer department. Septic systems won't work until the ground water level is below the distribution lines. So be careful about flushing the toilet and pouring things down the drain; they may not have anywhere to go.

"
"
Get hold of cleaning equipment.,
Tackle one room at a time.,
Take care with appliances.,
Throw any food out that has been touched by flood waters.,
Try to restore valuables.,
Keep the house clean.",How to Cope Following a Flood6," The Red Cross or similar organizations will often distribute cleanup kits after a disaster. These contain many useful items such as a broom, mop, bucket, and cleaning supplies. In most cases, household cleaning products will do the job if you use them correctly. Check the label on the products to see how much to use. After cleaning a room or item, go over it again with a disinfectant to kill the germs and smell left by the flood waters.

, A two bucket approach is most efficient: use one bucket for rinse water and the other for the cleaner. Rinse out your sponge, mop, or cleaning cloth in the rinse bucket.


Start cleaning a wall at the bottom or where the worst damage was. If you have removed the wallboard or plaster, wash the studs and sills and disinfect them.
If you taped your windows before the storm, clean the tape off as soon as possible. The sun will bake the adhesive into the glass. Use orange or eucalyptus oil to help remove the sticky leftovers.
Don’t try to force open swollen wooden doors and drawers. Take off the back of the piece of furniture to let the air circulate. You'll probably be able to open the drawers after they dry.

, There’s an unexpected danger of shock with some electrical appliances such as TV sets and radios. Certain internal parts store electricity even when the appliance is unplugged. Check the back for a warning label.


Even if your washing machine did not get wet, do not use it until you know that the water is safe enough to drink and that your sewer line works.
Throw out soft plastic and porous items that probably absorbed whatever the flood waters carried in. Like the washing machine, the dishwasher should also be used only after you know your water is safe to drink and your sewer line works.

, Even food in tin cans should be discarded if the cans got wet during the flood because there is no way to be absolutely certain the food inside is safe. Do not keep food in bottles or jars with bottle caps or screw on lids—they do not keep out flood waters.

, Valuable papers such as books, photographs, and stamp collections can be restored with a great deal of effort. They can be rinsed and frozen (in a frost-free freezer or commercial meat locker) until you have time to work on them.

, As you get rid of things from your home, don’t turn your yard into a dump. Food and garbage must be hauled away as soon as possible.


Mosquitoes can carry many diseases, and a flood can create ideal conditions for them to breed. Drain or remove standing water that can become a breeding ground. Dump water out of barrels, old tires, and cans. Check that your gutters are clean and can drain.
Ditches and drains also need to be cleaned so they can carry storm water away from your home.
Lawns usually survive being underwater for up to four days. Salt water should be hosed off the lawn and shrubs.

"
"
Flood proof your house.,
Get the appropriate permits.,
Give your house plenty of time to dry.,
Move the main breaker or fuse box and the utility meters above the flood protection level for your home.,
Repair the walls.,
Repair the floors.,
Hire a contractor to help you rebuild.",How to Cope Following a Flood7," Flood proofing means to remodel or rebuild using materials and methods that will prevent or minimize damage from future floods. There are five types of flood proofing:


Most buildings can be raised so that the lowest floor is above the possible flood level.
Moving a building out of the flood-prone area is the surest way to protect it from flood damage.
Flood walls, berms, and levees all work to keep flood waters from reaching your house.
Dry floodproofing means sealing a building to keep flood waters out.
Wet floodproofing means modifying a building so that flood waters will cause only minimal damage to the building and contents.

, Once you’ve determined the repairs and flood proofing measures you are going to take, local codes generally require that you get a building permit. Before you make repairs or alterations to your home or property, make sure your plans are reviewed and approved by your building department.

, Many problems result from rebuilding too quickly after a flood, before everything dries.

, If you're going to replace a flooded furnace, water heater, or air conditioner, install the new one on a higher floor. If your new air conditioner or heat pump will be outside, install it on a platform above the flood protection level.

, Wash and disinfect the studs and sills if the wallboard and insulation had to be removed. If you are going to rebuild the walls, remember that metal studs and sills are not damaged by water as much as wooden ones.


Think horizontal rather than vertical. Install the wallboard panels sideways so they are only four feet high. If the next flood is less than four feet deep, you only have to replace half the wall.
Do not paint until the surface is completely dry. If the surface still contains moisture, the paint will peel. Things look dry on the surface long before they are dry on the inside, and this can lead to costly mistakes.

, Some floors are made with particle board or plywood, materials that fall apart when wet for long. Do not lay new flooring or carpet until the sub flooring is completely dry. Floor joists and some wood floors will regain their shapes if allowed to dry naturally.

, This is especially valuable to enable you to handle the difficult jobs such as foundation repair and electrical work. If you've been satisfied with work done by licensed local contractors, try them first.

"
Develop a flood response plan.,
Develop a checklist of what to do in the event of a flood.",How to Cope Following a Flood8," Preparing a flood response plan will help you think through all the details that demand attention as the flood waters approach. This is a project for the whole family. As you write down the plan, make sure everyone understands it. Having the plan in writing will help you remember what to do when everyone is in a hurry and excited because a flood is coming.


Develop a flood response plan based on the flood protection level, local warning procedures, and the time you will have to respond. In flash flood areas, you may only have enough time to evacuate. But if you live in areas in the path of a hurricane or cyclone or on large rivers, you may have 12-24 hours of warning time.
If you live in a mountainous area, or if your flooding comes from a small stream or ditch, your home may be subject to flash flooding. Flash floods can occur before the local emergency managers have time to issue a warning. In these cases, listen for warnings. For example, in the United States, you can listen to the National Weather Service, which may issue a flash flood watch advising people that conditions are favorable for a flash flood. You may not be notified of a flash flood warning before flooding actually begins.
If you live near the coast, you'll be asked to evacuate when a hurricane or cyclone threatens your community. It's important to evacuate when you're asked to.
Prepare your flood response plan to take into account all of the time that you'll need to protect your home before you evacuate. You'll need time to board your windows and to clear your yard so your belongings won't blow or float away.

, Your flood response plan should be a checklist of steps to take before flood waters reach your home. The following are examples of things to include:


Listen to local radio or TV stations for flood information and evacuation instructions.
Read safety precautions at the top of this document.
Get into the habit of keeping a full tank of gas in your car, especially at times of the year when flooding can be expected in your area.
Pack the car with supplies you need while away from home.
Put supplies needed for clean up and recovery in a safe place. If your flood protection level is over your top floor, you may have to store supplies at a friend’s home away from the flood-prone area or take them with you in your car.
Take pets to a kennel or friend’s place on high ground. Health codes do not allow animals in public shelters.
If you have enough warning time, move your contents above the flood protection level or to another safe place. In the United States, some of the cost of doing this can be covered under an NFIP flood insurance policy.
Install flood shields and other flood proofing measures you may have prepared.
In hurricane or cyclone prone areas, protect against wind damage. Install hurricane shutters or plywood covers over windows and doors, take down TV antennas, and securely tie down boats, garbage cans, and everything else left outdoors.
Tape plastic around the cap to your well. This will prevent most, but not all, flood water from entering your water supply. You will still have to disinfect your water.
Turn off the electricity, gas, oil, and water.
Lock your home.
Follow your designated evacuation route to a place of shelter.

Read all gardening supply packaging to determine if the product is organic.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies1,"


Check for the USDA organic seal. In 2002, the USDA began the National Organic Program (NOP), which is a certification program for organic products. All products labeled with the USDA organic seal have been grown or processed using NOP-approved methods. Synthetic fertilizers, toxic pesticides, genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation are not used in the production of NOP-approved products.
Evaluate the product for the Organic Material Review Institute (OMRI) approval. The OMRI provides independent product reviews for organic growers, suppliers, manufacturers and certifiers. The OMRI publishes an approved list of products produced, processed and handled with organic guidelines.
Look for the Organically Grown (OG) label. Gardening supplies labeled with an ""OG"" are organically grown but not necessarily certified by a national program or institute. OG products are typically locally grown or produced using organic methods.;
"
"
Select tools that are made with environmentally sensitive materials.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies2," While most basic gardening tools are not labeled as ""organic,"" some gardening tools are made from natural materials using low-impact production practices.


Look for gardening tools made with wood materials, rather than plastic.
Consider bamboo brooms, rather than commercially produced brooms.
Select gardening materials that do not require gas or electricity. Choose manual pruning saws, trimmers and shears, rather than electric or gas versions.
Use wood baskets for collecting produce, rather than plastic bins.

"
"
Choose growing containers made of natural materials.,
Reuse containers for growing seeds.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies3," Start seedlings in organic containers that break down naturally, such as wood, clay, peat or paper. Organic containers can be planted directly in the garden, so the plant's roots aren't disturbed when transplanting.

, Grow seedlings in recycled containers like yogurt cups, egg cartons or milk cartons. Be sure to poke drainage holes in the bottom of recycled containers. Recycled containers can't be transplanted directly into the garden because they do not break down naturally.

"
"
Purchase organic soil.,
Amend your existing soil.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies4," Organic soil is generally made up of natural decayed plant matter, black humus and sterilized manure. It usually does not contain peat, which is a nonrenewable resource. It also should not contain any pesticides or fertilizers. Because of its rich content, organic soil can be reused in gardens or containers each year.

, Rather than purchase an organic soil, add necessary nutrients to your existing soil.


Test your soil. Using a shovel or garden spade, dig to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in your soil. Place the soil in a zipper-sealed plastic bag, and bring the bag to a local agricultural laboratory, extension office or garden center for testing. The testing center will provide a report on what nutrients your soil needs to support healthy plant growth.
Add organic matter to amend the soil. Use your own resources to create compost for the soil. Save decaying plant waste, leaves, grass clippings and vegetable scraps from the kitchen to create organic matter.

"
"
Choose seeds that are certified organic.,
Choose organic plants.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies5," In order to be considered organic, seeds must come from organic plants that have not been exposed to chemicals. Organic seeds should be labeled as Certified Organic.

, Organic plants have been grown using organic production principles. They will not have been exposed to chemicals in the forms of fertilizers or insecticides. Organic plants should be labeled as Certified Organic.


Select local plants. A key principle in organic gardening is choosing local plants that thrive naturally in your environment. Native plants are naturally hardier because they are accustomed to the climate and pests in your region.

"

Determine the treatment based on the specific pest.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies6," Not all insects are harmful to plants, and some are actually beneficial. Determine what type of pest is harming your plants before selecting a pest control solution.


Move the pest. Often times, you can determine where the pest is coming from and then relocate the pest's home base.
Determine what will repel the specific pest. Organic baits, traps and nontoxic repellents can be used to safely remove pests. Some examples of nontoxic repellents include mineral oil, liquid soap, clove oil herbicide and hot pepper sprays.
Purchase organic pest control products at your local garden center. Seek advice from local garden experts before using any pest control products. When choosing an organic pest control product, make sure it is labeled as Certified Organic.
Build barriers to keep pests away from plants. Use row cover, which is a woven fabric, to keep pests away. The row cover allows air, light and water to reach plants without letting pests access the plants.

Select organic fertilizers from your local garden center.,
Choose fertilizers based on your specific soil needs.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies7," Organic fertilizers do not include harsh chemicals or pollutants, and they should be labeled as Certified Organic. Look for organic formulas rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK), with a higher phosphorus (P) number for root and flower growth.

, Amend the soil, based on a soil test from your garden. A soil test will indicate what nutrients your soil is lacking and also will keep you from adding unnecessary nutrients to the soil.


Use bone meal if your soil lacks phosphorus. Bone meal is a natural material rich in phosphorus. It is ideal for container plants but also can be added to the garden to help build strong root systems in plants.
Use blood meal if your soil lacks nitrogen. Blood meal is ideal for flowers. It is high in nitrogen, so should be used sparingly.
Consider fish meal, seaweed, bat guano, alfalfa meal, earthworm castings and manure as organic fertilizers ideal for boosting nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

Mulch gardens to minimize weeds.,
Use the solarization method to kill weeds prior to planting beds.,
Use vinegar as a natural weed killer.,
Select organic weed killers from your local garden center.",How to Choose Organic Gardening Supplies8," Use organic materials in your yard, such as grass clippings, dried leaves and wood chips to mulch gardens. The mulch serves as an effective ground cover that smothers weeds and keeps them from spreading.

, Cover the garden bed with clear plastic. The sun naturally heats the plastic, killing off weeds in the upper layer of soil. Remove the plastic before planting.

, Spray full-strength vinegar directly on weeds as they emerge.

, Organic weed killers do not include harsh chemicals or pollutants, and should be labeled as Certified Organic.

Check the plant's shade needs on the label or in a reputable book or article about the plant.,
If the plant needs dappled light, then plant it under trees and plants that have large, open canopies.,
If the plant needs part-sun, then it can be planted on the side of a house, building, wall, fence or other area where the sun falls for only part of the day.,
If the plant needs damp shade, then it should be planted in a shady spot and the soil should always be kept moist.,
If the plant needs dry shade, then choose a shady position that is sheltered.,
If the plant needs deep shade, then it's the part of a garden that never gets the shade, like the bottom of the hill next to a stream.,
When selecting plants for shade, it can be a good idea to try to get a ground cover, a shrub and a taller plant at the minimum in order to make the most of the space.

",How to Assess Shade Levels for Gardening," The shade needs will determine where you can keep the plant and expect it to thrive.;
, Quite a lot of plants can tolerate this type of shade and some need it to grow their best.

, Unless the label states otherwise, this sun can be direct or filtered.

, Ferns are especially fond of this type of environment.

, For example, a spot under a roof, under eaves, under a very heavy, vigorous area of plant growth, etc., where the soil is going to remain dry most of the time.


For this type of shade, be sure to add compost and mulch to help increase the range of plants that can cope with this type of environment.

, This is suitable for rainforest plant types. Naturally, this range will be far more limited but these plants are usually worth the effort for their special beauty.

Pay close attention to the local weather in your area. Also, it is helpful to know what the newscasters are talking about. Some common terms you may hear are:Flood or Flash Flood Watch. This means that a flood could occur in your area, but has not happened in your area or surrounding areas yet.Flood or Flash Flood Warning. This means that a flood has already occurred around you and may occur in your area very soon.;
, You will want to have supplies ready in case a flood traps you in your house. Make sure you have 3 days' worth of food and clean drinking water prepared and ready to go. Make sure that the food supplies you pick will not go bad and do not require any preparation.Canned foods are good because they do not spoil and are generally ready to eat.

, There may be some items that you will want to bring into the shelter with you, but you may not know where your parents keep these items. You should ask your parents before a flood where all the important documents for your family are kept. If they show you where they are, you can retrieve them and bring them into the shelter in the event of a flood.


Many parents aren't comfortable showing children where these documents might be. If your parents feel this way, then make sure to talk to them about storing these documents in a safe place that will remain free of flood waters.
You will want to know where documents like the deed to your house, social security cards, state IDs or drivers licenses, and medical records or documents, are kept in the event of an emergency.

, There are a number of items you will want to have prepared in case a flood hits your area. These basic supplies will help you deal with emergency situations and keep you informed in the event of a disaster like a flood. Some things to have ready are:


A first aid kit. This will help you be ready to deal with minor injuries that may occur during a flood, like scrapes, cuts or minor burns.A flashlight. When floods hit, the power often goes out. You will want to have a flashlight, and replacement batteries, ready in case of a flood.A battery-powered or hand-crank radio. You need to stay connected to the outside world to listen for information or warnings about the flood. If the power goes out, you will need a radio that does not rely on electrical current.Medical supplies. Make sure you collect all of your medical supplies in the shelter with you. If you or anyone in your family takes prescription pills, uses a hearing aid, glasses, a cane, etc. bring these items to the shelter with you.Hygiene products. It is important to have toilet paper, paper towel, antibacterial soap, and towels ready for everyone in the shelter.
Family heirlooms and keepsakes. Anything of sentimental value (like your favorite baseball cards, a stuffed animal, birthday cards, etc.) should also be sealed in a plastic bag and stored in the shelter to prevent damage.Animals and all of their supplies. If you have pets, you need to make sure you have enough food and water for them as well. Also bring leashes, cages, and any other tools you may need to move your animal with you into the shelter.Cell phones and cell phone chargers. Make sure you bring cell phones and chargers to the shelter so you can call for help if you need to., The best place to build a flood shelter is any room that is high up and off the ground floor, like second story bedrooms or attics. Ideally, you should use your own room to build the shelter, if it is not on the ground floor. Also, you will need to clean the room you select. Pick up your books, toys, and clothes and put them away. You will need all the space you can get if you have to turn your room into a flood shelter, so make sure your room is free of clutter and trash.


If there is any unimportant furniture in your room, ask your parents if you can move it elsewhere.

, If you have a big closet, clean it up so that you can put supplies in it. Anything that won’t be needed when the flood hits should be move out of the closet and into a different room in the house.

, If you're not allowed to have a TV in your room, get a radio to listen for flood warnings and weather updates while you are in the shelter., Your room will become like a command center. You need to be able to listen to information and news reports about the storm and the flooding. Set up a portable T.V. or radio in a high place that you can easily access., You will need this space to put supplies on, so make sure your desk is clear of debris and clutter. Also, if you have a laptop or computer, it is probably best to unplug and store it away in a plastic bag to avoid damage.

, You will want to make sure there is a place for everyone in your family to rest while waiting out the flood. Lay down as many sleeping bags as necessary to make sure your family can rest comfortably on the floor of your room.You will also want to bring some extra pillows in there for everyone too.

, You will want to bring board games, a deck of cards, or something you can all do together. You will need to pass the time in your shelter and may not have any electricity, so board games and card games are a good way to do that., Now that you have everything set up and your shelter is ready to go, get your family and pets into the shelter you have built. Make sure everyone stays calm and listens frequently for updates about the weather., You’ve done an excellent job setting up the shelter for your family. However, floods can change directions and rise quickly. So, during your time in the shelter listen to news and weather reports often and be ready to evacuate your house immediately if you need to.Be ready to help elderly family members and pets evacuate with you.

, There is really nothing special about flood shelters, other than the fact that they are high off the ground. With this in mind, ask your parents about turning the entire second floor of your house, or your attic space, into a flood shelter. This will give you more room when taking shelter from the storm.


If they say yes, then move all the supplies you gathered around the wider area you are now working with.

Pick stake lights for pathways.,
Add lights to your deck.,
Place lights on stairs.",How to Choose Garden Lighting1," These lights are brighter than ambient lights, so they're meant to go along pathways. They're also easy to install because they have stakes built in, so you can just push or hammer them into the ground as needed.Lighted paths make it easier to get around outside at night. Solar-powered lights work well to illuminate pathways because you don't need a cord that could trip people up. A good option is solar-powered stake lights, which have a solar panel on each light.You should use more solar-powered lights than you would use if you were using electric lights, as they aren't quite as bright.;
, Deck lights provide ambient lighting and are easy to attach to what you already have in place. They make it easier for people to get around without tripping, much like pathway lights, plus they help people see any obstacles in the way. Just make sure you choose lights that are bright enough to illuminate the area.You could use something decorative and practical, such as a string of lantern lights.

, It's also good to include lights on stairs for safety. It's especially important to illuminate stairs that aren't obvious, such as steps down into your garden. However, adding lights to all stairs is a good idea, to help keep people from tripping and falling.Try using stake lights, mini spotlights, or even rope lights over stairs."
"
Use wall-lights and mini floodlights for security.,
Install lights on timers or motion sensors.,
Try electric lights for more reliability.",How to Choose Garden Lighting2," To light up areas like your front and back doors, choose a brighter light that illuminates the whole area. Wall lights are a good option, as are mini floodlights. These lights can be both decorative and practical, as they help to keep crime at bay.Make sure to think about your neighbors when placing your lights. You don't want a floodlight that shines directly into someone's bedroom.

, When lighting up your porch or back door for security purposes, it's a good idea to set up lights that will turn on by themselves. You can choose ones that are motion-activated, so they light up when anyone walks by. You can also install ones that are set to come on at dusk and turn off in the morning, thereby automatically lighting up the area through the night.To keep your energy bill low, use LED or other low-energy lights.

, High-quality solar-powered lights can provide steady light, but they are less reliable overall than wired lights because they need sunlight to charge. Plus, they tend to wear out quicker. Electric lights, on the other hand, tend to be more reliable. They will provide lighting as long as they have working light bulbs and you have power."
"
Highlight areas you love with spotlights.,
Add other ambient lights.,
Pick solar lights where you don't need as much light.",How to Choose Garden Lighting3," Spotlights are great to use judiciously around your yard and house. They can be used to point to things you'd like your guests to see, even at night, such as sculptures and architectural highlights. Of course, these should never be pointed so they'd shine in someone's eyes. Rather, these lights should be pointed upward or downward at an angle, away from where people will be.Try using mini spotlights so you don't overwhelm your yard with lights.
You can even use colorful spotlights on plain walls for a bit of extra pizzazz., Ambient lights can be placed around your yard to provide a soft glow. They are often decorative, such as lights surrounded by colorful glass or small lanterns with LEDs. Keep in mind, these lights will likely not be enough on their own for people to walk around., Solar-powered lights have come a long way as far as brightness goes because of the use of LED bulbs, but they're not as bright as electrical. That makes them a better choice for decorative purposes rather than security purposes."
"
Pick solar-powered lights if you want something easy-to-install.,
Use solar lights to keep your electricity bill low.,
Choose electric lights in darker cities.,
Pick electric lighting if you're able to call in a professional.",How to Choose Garden Lighting4," Most solar power lights just require you to stake the light into the ground or hang it up if it's a wire. You don't need to do anything fancy, as you would if you wire in electrical lights. Plus, these lights are easy to replace or fix if something goes wrong., Solar-powered lights, as the name implies, are powered by the sun. They have a battery inside that is charged during the day while the sun is out. That means they won't add cost to your electricity bill. The downside is they need to be placed where they get sunlight during the day.If you want solar-powered lights in the shade, you can have a landscaper hook them up to a solar panel that's in full sunlight.

, Solar-powered lights are great in places that receive a good deal of sunshine everyday. However, if you live somewhere that is cloudy most of the time, your lights won't be as bright. Choosing electrically powered lights may be a better option for you., While you can study up to wire your yard with electrical lights, this job is generally best left to a professional. They know how to wire your garden so the wires are hidden and the lights are laid out well."

Pick your flowers.,
Prepare the flowers in bunches.,
Tie the end of each bunch with a rubber band.,
Hang the bunches upside-down.,
Wait for 2–4 weeks.,
Preserve them with hairspray (optional).",How to Dry Flowers1," Most flowers air-dry best when they are just beginning to open. They will continue to open slightly as they dry, and a fully open flower may lose its petals.This method works best for small, sturdy blossoms, such as lavender or larkspur.Wilting and pest damage becomes more obvious after drying. Choose only the best flowers, and pick extra in case of problems.;
, Strip each flower stem of all leaves. Separate the flowers by species, then make bunches with up to 10 flowers of a single type. Large flowers such as hydrangeas, roses, and peonies should be dried individually instead.








Strawflower and some other species have weak stems that break apart when dried. Cut the stem off instead and thread florist's wire through the base of the flower., Wrap a large rubber band around two or three stems, wrap it several times around the whole bunch, then finish by wrapping it around another two or three stems.The stems will shrink as they dry, but the rubber band will stay tight around them.









The rubber band shouldn't press so hard that it creases the stem; this can cause damp pockets and lead to rot. If you're concerned about this, tie the bunch with twine or raffia instead. You may need to re-tie the twine halfway through drying.

, Keep them in a warm, dark, dry location to prevent rot and minimize fading.Air circulation helps the flowers dry and prevents mold, so keep the bunches spaced out in an area with a good cross-breeze, at least 6 inches (15cm) below the ceiling.








You can hang the flowers from hooks, nails, or coat hangers. One easy way to do it is a paper clip bent into an S-shape. Poke one end underneath the rubber band, and the other end over the hook., The flower is ready when the petals are crisp to the touch. Occasionally a bunch will take longer than four weeks, usually because the room isn't ideal or the flower petals are unusually thick.


The stems usually dry completely straight. If you want a more natural, curved look, submerge the stems in warm water until soft. Bend them however you like, and hold them in position with weights until they dry again., A light mist of aerosol hairspray or floral sealer will set the flowers' shape. This will make them less susceptible to breaking or dropping petals.

Choose your flowers.,
Wire the flowers (optional).,
Pour desiccant into a microwave-safe container.,
Bury the flowers under the desiccant.,
Put a cup of water in the microwave.,
Microwave.,
Let cool for one day.,
Brush off the desiccant.",How to Dry Flowers2," Microwaving works best for flowers with many petals, and no hairy or sticky surface. Roses, zinnias, and marigolds are good options, although varieties with thick petals might not work out.Pick the flowers when half-open and firm, before petals start dropping.Cut the stems pretty short for this method — about 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm)

, The stems won't be flexible after microwaving. If you want to bend the flowers for an arrangement, stick a 20–24 gauge wire through the base of the flower, then wrap it in a helix around the stem. Though it is best not to use metal in a microwave oven If the flower doesn't have a thick base, stick the wire through the center of the flower and into the stem. Push it down as far as you can to hide the wire from view.

, A desiccant is any substance that absorbs moisture. Silica gel is the best option for delicate and colorful petals, but you can use clay cat litter instead, or a 50







, Carefully position the flowers right-side up, with at least ¾ inch (2cm) of space between them. Pour more desiccant slowly over the flowers, burying them.








Use a toothpick to rearrange the petals if they get bent out of shape.
Start with just one or two flowers in case they end up burnt. It will get easier as you learn how much drying each flower will take.

, A separate, shallow cup of water absorbs some of the microwave's energy. This makes accidental burning or over-drying less likely., Add the container to the microwave and heat for 2 minutes. Poke through the desiccant with a toothpick to see if the flowers were dry. If not, heat them for 1-minute intervals, checking after each one.









This step can take a lot of trial and error, since there's so much variation between flowers and microwaves. Some thin flowers like daisies do best at low microwave settings, just above defrost.Others with many, thick petals can take as long as 8 minutes on medium or high temperatures.

, Remove the container from the microwave. Cover the container, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and leave it alone for 24 hours.The desiccant (especially silica gel) can take a long time to cool to a safe temperature.


Leave dahlias, pansies, and peonies for 36 hours instead.Larger, thicker flowers such as roses and carnations may be ready in as few as 10 hours.
Keep this out of reach of children and animals.

, Now that the container is cool, tip it gently to expose the flowers. Gently pull out the flowers, supporting them from below. Brush them off with a fine brush.









Optionally, preserve them with hairspray or floral sealer.

Choose your flowers.,
Place the flowers on dry paper.,
Press the flowers.,
Wait for 1–3 weeks.,
Remove the weights.",How to Dry Flowers3," Pressing flowers is done best with small, flat flowers, such as pansies and lilacs. Stay away from flowers with fleshy stems or extra-thin petals, which can end up damaged., Place your flowers on a matte, non-glossy paper such as newspaper, cardboard, or tissue paper. Arrange your flowers in a single layer, then place another sheet of dry paper over the top.


The more absorbent materials you use, the better your flowers will turn out. Try placing the flowers between newspaper, the newspaper between blotter paper, and the blotter paper between corrugated cardboard. Tape the whole pile shut., Place them under something that has a large, evenly dispersed weight. Typically, dictionaries or encyclopedias are a good option for this, but you could also use heavy boxes or pieces of wood.


Keep the stack in a warm, dry place.

, After the first week, remove the flowers and replace the paper with fresh, dry sheets. Then put the flowers back under the weights to continue pressing them.

, After the flowers have been left for a few weeks, take off the weights and papers and pull out your flowers. They should be crisp and paper-thin, and transparent to light.

"
"
Prepare your flowers.,
Heat at low temperature for several hours.,
Remove the flowers.",How to Dry Flowers4," Cut a piece of chicken-wire or fine-mesh wire in a big enough size for all your flowers to fit. Then, slide the stems through the holes in the wire, so that the bud holds the body of the flower up while the stem dangles below.


The best flowers to be oven-dried are compact, with many-petals. These include cornflowers and chrysanthemums.

, With your convection oven heated to 100ºF (38ºC), put the wire with the flowers onto the rack. The low heat will dry the flowers slowly; leave them in the oven for several hours.The total drying time will vary based on the type and number of flowers you used.


A well-ventilated convection oven will do the best job. Do not try this with a normal oven. Normal ovens contain too much moisture and usually have a minimum temperature much higher than 100ºF (38ºC).

, Once the flowers have dried completely, you can remove them from the oven and set them on a drying rack to cool down. Wait until they are back to room temperature before handling.


Apply hairspray or floral sealant for sturdier, longer-lasting dried flowers.

"
Choose your flowers.,
Choose your desiccant.,
Add non-iodized salt (optional).,
Choose a container.,
Bury the flowers in the desiccant.,
Wait until dry.,
Remove carefully.",How to Dry Flowers5," This is the best way to dry large, delicate flowers such as lilies, as long as the flower doesn't drop its petals too easily.Ideally, pick the flowers when they're about half open, and dry immediately.

, A desiccant is an extra-absorbent material, that will slowly pull out water from your flowers. Whichever desiccant you choose must be completely dry to be effective. Here are the most common options:Silica gel: the fastest option, available at garden supply stores. Although more expensive, it can be reused many times (see Tips below).
Borax and white cornmeal: a cheap and lightweight option. Mix in equal quantities, or with as little as 1 part borax to 6 parts cornmeal — it shouldn't make much difference.Fine sand: this just supports the shape of the flower, allowing the air to dry it. The slowest option, but sometimes the cheapest.

, Some people suggest that salt helps the petals keep their color, although not everyone agrees.Try it with 3 tbsp salt per quart of other materials (15mL per L).

, If you have plenty of material, pick a container that can fit the entire upright stem. Most people save on materials and just cut off the flower stem, leaving a blossom that can fit in a shallow container. Different materials require slightly different setups:For silica gel, use a container that can be sealed airtight. A coffee can is a good option for a single flower.
For borax or sand, use an open container. A strong cardboard box is ideal, but check the base for holes first.

, Pour your material into the container, to a depth of 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm). Place the flowers upright in the material, making sure they're stable. Sift or slowly pour more desiccant on top of them, until they are buried.


If using sand, you don't need to bury the flowers completely. The sand is mostly for support, and air exposure can help dry the petals.
Flowers from the daisy family dry best upside-down instead.Some flowers, such as snapdragons and delphiniums, dry best when laid horizontal.If the stems are still attached, fill the container as deep as necessary to hold them.

, Store the container in a warm, dry location. If using an open container, keep it in a room with good air flow. Check after a few days, using a toothpick to probe the petals and test for dryness.


Silica gel is the fastest means of drying flowers; most take only 2-4 days to dry completely, while thick flowers can take up to a week.When silica gel turns pink, it's absorbed as much moisture as it can.
Borax mixtures can take 5–14 days to dry the flowers.
Sand takes longest of all, usually about 14–21 days., Tip the container sideways and tap the sides until the flower is exposed. Gently remove the dry flower, supporting it from underneath. Brush away the packing material with a small brush.


If the material is clinging to the flower, pour a thin stream of sand from about 12 inch (30cm) above the flower. This should dislodge the stuck particles.Removing the flowers too soon can cause drooping. Test the edge first for a crisp, papery feel before you pick it up.
Floral sealer or hairspray will postpone breakage.

Warm up before gardening.,
Work in the garden regularly.,
Vary your movements.,
Do controlled bending and lifting.,
Put in some effort.",How to Improve Your Health by Gardening1," Like you would with other types of exercise, it's important to warm up before you start exerting yourself in the garden. Stretch your legs, arms, and hands before you start so that they will be prepared for the work ahead.You should spend at least 5 to 10 minutes warming up before gardening.;
, In order to improve your health by getting exercise in the garden, you should do it regularly. Working in your garden for several hours over the course of the week, for instance, 30 minutes daily, can give you some much needed regular exercise.Getting 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day can lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. It can also help prevent diabetes and heart disease, as well as slow the development of osteoporosis.

, As with other types of exercise, it's a good idea to vary the types of movements you do while getting exercise in the garden. If you have a variety of tasks to do in the garden, set a specific amount of time you will do each and then rotate between them, even if you don't complete a task in your set amount of time.This variation in tasks can be especially helpful if you have one that is hard on the body, such as kneeling to weed garden beds. Weeding for 15 to 20 minutes at a time and then taking a break to do another activity will help to avoid pain or overexertion.

, When working in the garden you need to be careful and intentional about how you lift and stretch. For example, use proper lifting technique when moving heavy bags of soil or fertilizer. This entails using the strength of your legs instead of depending on your back muscles.Additionally, you should squat instead of kneeling when possible, maintain the natural curve of your back, and avoid twisting while lifting heavy loads.

, In order for gardening to count as exercise, you need to raise your heart rate and put out some physical effort while doing it. This means that just standing around watering doesn't really count as exercise.Some things to do in the garden to raise your heart rate include digging, raking leaves, weeding, mowing, and turning a compost pile.
If you want to increase your effort while mowing, try using a push mower instead of a gas or electric one."

Pick a variety of plants to grow.,
Plan for different growing seasons.,
Cook home-grown food in a healthy way.",How to Improve Your Health by Gardening2," When planning out your garden, you should pick out a variety of plants that will increase your health and vary your diet. Having a lot of different fruits and vegetables to choose from will allow you to have a varied healthy diet throughout the year.


Some vegetables that are relatively easy to grow, depending on your climate, include tomatoes, lettuce, peas, beans, squash, and cucumbers.Begin with a few of these if you are new to gardening.
Growing some herbs, such as chives and thyme, can be very easy as well. These herbs can really enhance the flavor of the vegetables that you grow.
When planning out your garden, you also need to take your soil, the sun exposure of your garden, and your climate into consideration.

, In addition to growing a variety of plants, you need to plan out when certain plants should be planted and grown. There are specific times when fruits and vegetables need to be put in the ground so that they grow most effectively. This means that you will have several cycles of planting every year, usually in the early spring and the early fall.


For instance, many plants need to be planted after the last frost in the spring, such as tomatoes, squash, and corn. However, some plants can withstand those late winter and early spring frosts, such as spinach, lettuce, radishes, and beets.If you plan out your growing season correctly, you can have fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the year.
When to plant certain plants depends greatly on what climate you live in. Do some research about your specific climate zone, what grows best there, and when certain plants should be put in the ground.

, Once you have grown your fruits and vegetables, it's important to cook them in the right way. Cooking them correctly will both retain the nutrients inside of them and will help you avoid adding unhealthy ingredients into the meal. In general, cooking vegetables lightly and avoiding adding a lot of fat to them will help you to get the most out of your vegetables.Avoid adding a lot of fat to your vegetables when cooking them. Instead of frying or sauteing them with added oil, try steaming them to bring out their wonderful flavor without incorporating a lot of unhealthy fat.
Some vegetables provide more nutrients when raw and some provide more nutrients when cooked. For instance, cooking asparagus lightly releases more nutrients into your body. However, beets give you more nutrition when served raw. Do some research to figure out how your vegetables are best served."

Working in the garden can be a deeply satisfying project that gives you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. In fact, gardening has been shown to improve your overall outlook and life satisfaction.Working in the garden can even cause your body to release specific hormones that increase happiness and contentment.

, Spending time working in the garden allows you to clear your mind and let go of stress. It can be especially helpful for those that need time to recover from mental fatigue and those that find satisfaction from the nurturing and care that gardening requires.Because gardening helps to relieve your stress, it can actually lower your blood pressure.
In fact, just looking at plants has been shown to reduce anger and muscle tension., Not only does gardening help your mental health right when you are doing it, it can help your brain health in the long run. For example, gardening has been shown to prevent dementia in seniors, as it exercises the parts of the brain that are connected to learning and creativity.Even for those that have dementia, gardening can improve mental health. It has been shown to reduce problems with aggression associated with dementia."

Take out your pruning tools in the dormant season.,
Make a cut on the underside of the branch.,
Cut off the branch several inches from the trunk.,
Make a precise cut to remove the stub.,
Clean your pruning equipment.",How to Prune a Tree," Are you trying to shape a tree for shade or height? Has the tree been pruned recently? Before you begin, you want to consider what you are trying to achieve and set your goals.Your reasons for pruning will influence when you prune as well. You can do light pruning or remove dead wood at any time, but if you have larger goals, you'll want to plan your pruning around the seasons.
For instance, pruning in the winter will result in an explosion of growth during the spring. Pruning during the summer will slow the growth of the cut branch, so it's a good strategy if you're trying to shape your tree or slow the growth of of branches you don't want.;
, Spend a few moments looking at the tree's size and shape and imagining how it should look when you are finished.

, Avoid removal of these branches.

, Whether they were damaged by a storm or some other event, broken branches should be pruned so that the water and nutrients they're still taking from the tree get redistributed to healthy branches.

, Remove branches that cross, then open the plant so that air might circulate and light reach all parts of the plant. In order for trees to grow healthy, they need good air circulation through and around the branches. Branches that are close together foster the growth of fungus and attract more insects.


Eliminate branches that are growing inward, toward the center of the tree. These cause clutter and are not healthy.

, Whether they're low branches blocking your walkway or higher branches threatening your telephone wires, rubbing your roof, or overhang your house. It's fine to prune the branches that are causing some type of annoyance.

, If you'd like your tree to have a more rounded or neat looking shape, prune a few branches that seem to stick out at odd angles; a few cuts will make a big difference.

, Each cut you make compromises the tree protection system and opens the tree to potential fungus and insect infestation. Prune only as much as you absolutely need to prune, and never remove more than 25 percent of a tree's branches.


For most deciduous trees, make sure that there are living branches on at least 2/3 of the of the tree, though this varies by species. Be aware that the trunk alone is not enough to ensure that the tree will survive.Removing all the branches is highly stressful for the plant.
Don't prune heavily more than once per season. Unless a storm breaks more branches, you shouldn't prune more than once, since the tree needs time to recover.

, Pruning during the late fall or early winter puts less stress on the tree, since it minimizes sap loss. Pruning during this time of year is also better for the tree because it's less likely the ""wound"" you make will get infected by insects or fungus, which are also relatively active in the late fall and early winter.


A good time marker is to prune after the leaves have fallen off the tree. This means the tree is dormant until early spring.
If a storm during a different part of the year causes a branch to break, it's OK to prune it immediately instead of waiting for winter.

, This initial cut shouldn't go all the way through the branch. It is made to prevent the branch from cracking too close to the trunk of the tree when the weight of the branch is ready to fall.


The cut should be made on the branch side of what is called the stem collar. This is the small lip of bark that each branch protrudes from. You want to leave the collar intact, so don't cut flush with the trunk.

, Your second cut will saw through the branch, on the outside (further from the trunk) of the first cut you made. Remove the branch from the area; what you have left is a stub., Now you can make another cut almost right against the stem collar. This gives the tree the best chance of healing in a quick, healthy way.


Be sure you don't actually cut off the branch collar. This must remain intact.

, Although it is probably not necessary to disinfect your pruning equipment if you avoid cutting into cankers and obviously diseased portions of trees, it probably is better to be safe and disinfect your pruning tools with rubbing alcohol (or any household cleaner)after each cut of a diseased tree. You should also dip or rub the blades with a disinfectant impregnated cloth after the pruning of a healthy tree is complete, and before you move to the next tree or bush. Diseases are sometimes spread through dirty pruning equipment and pruning tools.

Choose a design to carve before you go shopping for pumpkins.,
Check for a smooth, uniformly colored skin.,
Keep an eye out for smaller, ""sugar"" pumpkins for eating.,
Knock on the shell.,
Set the pumpkin up to make sure it sits level.,
Leave as much of the stem on as possible.",How to Pick Pumpkins," Think about which shape would best suit your design--tall and narrow? Fat and round? If you're going to use stencils, look for a pumpkin with a shape similar to the pattern you're going to carve.;
, The flesh should be firm, not elastic in any way. Inspect the entire pumpkin. Stay away from pumpkins with bruises, cuts, scratches or any signs of mold. If you'll be using stencils, steer clear of dents as well.

, Not all pumpkins will taste good in a pie. Sugar pumpkins are 200-250 millimeters (8-10"") in diameter and will have smoother, less stringy flesh than a decorative pumpkin.

, Ripe pumpkins will make a ""hollow"" sound. If the pumpkin is on the vine, the vine should be dry and the stem should be hard and brown. The ripeness of the pumpkin might not matter as much if you're only interested in carving (in which case an unripened pumpkin might last longer).

, You don't want to choose a pumpkin for carving only to find that it won't sit up straight for you. If the pumpkin grew on its side and has a flat spot there, you might be able to incorporate it into your design or turn that side against a wall so it isn't seen.

, You can cut the vine on both sides of the stem and then later cut the stem carefully at home. This will help it keep longer. Obviously, this only applies if you're actually harvesting pumpkins.

Grow, or locate, a U-pick produce grower that allows customers to pick peas in their field.,
Prepare yourself for your outing in the pea patch.,
Enter the field and select a row of peas to pick.,

Step carefully to avoid damaging the pea vines, which often overlap the rows and can be entangled, making travel difficult.,



 Here you can see a mature pea compared to two that are not yet filled out.,

Hold the stem of the plant and pull the peas free of the plant.,

Watch for peas which have obvious insect damage.,

Pick the desired amount of peas and carry them home.,
Rinse the peas under lots of fresh water, then transfer them into a clean container for shelling.",How to Pick Field Peas," You will want to learn a little bit about the different varieties and their characteristics:


Black-eyed peas - these are usually harvested and used dry, rather than fresh and succulent from the garden. A cousin of the black-eyes are pink-eyes, a popular, easy-to-grow field pea common in the south, where they are often called ""purple hull peas.""
Crowder peas - these are usually a green pea that is tightly packed in the shell.
Cream peas - these are a lighter colored pea, with a milder flavor than the above mentioned varieties.
Zipper peas - these have a fibrous vein along the length of the shell, which, when pulled, makes splitting the shell much easier.;
, You may find the weather very warm during the field pea season, so consider wearing light colored clothing and a broad rimmed hat. Other things you might take along to wear or carry once at the farm include:

Sturdy boots
Long pants
Sunscreen
Sunglasses
Hampers, bags, buckets, or other containers for your peas.

, Peas are usually planted in rows about 3 feet (91.5 cm) apart. Look for rows that have lots of mature peas, and remember that it is more efficient to pick peas by row, rather than randomly wandering around, so that you can keep track of which pea vines have been harvested. Staying between rows also reduces damage to the plants., Keep your container close by. Use a container that you can set on the ground and that won't overturn easily.,

Choose the peas which are fully matured and pull them from the stems. Most field peas have a series of bulges visible through the shell, indicating fully formed individual peas inside., You can gather several in the plucking hand, then toss them into the bucket to make your efforts more efficient., If you have a choice, choose clean, well-tended fields for your pea-picking expedition., Keep them in a cool, shaded place until you are ready to shell them., A large, shallow bowl works well for this step. Find a comfortable place, have a seat, and shell away; you will soon learn that picking the peas is only half the work!"

Set up an easy-to-clean workspace.,
Start with the outer leaves.,
Uncover the ear’s tip.,
Gather the tops and tassel in one hand.,
Pull them down in one move.,
Remove the leaves.,
Peel off any remaining silk.",How to Husk Corn1," Expect shucking corn to get a little messy. At the very least, have a bag handy to throw away the husk’s leaves and silken strands as you work. To make life even easier, line a trashcan or similar container with a bag so you can work over that, or even inside of it.Alternatively, you can also line your kitchen counter with paper or other compostable material if you want to compost the leaves and silk. This way you can easily ball up the whole bundle when you’re done.;
, Give the husk a quick look-over and find whichever leaf seems to be the outermost. Strip that off and continue peeling away the outer leaves as you work your way inward. Stop once the ear seems to be covered by only one layer of remaining leaves.The last layer should be a little translucent, so once you can see the kernels through the leaves, you should be there.

, Pull the tops of the remaining leaves away from the ear’s top. Stop peeling once you’ve exposed three or four rows of kernels. However, as you peel the leaves back, remember:The aim is to rip off all the leaves at once, in one move. So don’t peel the tops away from the ear in a way that would make it difficult to hold them all in one hand.

, The “tassel” is the bunched-up ends of all the silken strands inside. Gather this as well as the tops of the inner leaves in your dominant hand. Use your other hand to clutch the ear by its bottom.If you’re unable to grab them all in one hand, don’t worry. As long as you have most of the leaves and tassel in hand, the other leaf or leaves may still come off with them.

, Hold the ear vertically with its tip at the top. Then, with the leaves’ tops and the silk tassel in one hand, give them a hard yank down the length of the ear to where your other hand is. This should strip the whole ear, but if you weren’t able to get all the leaves’ tops in one hand, just repeat with any leaf that didn’t come off with the others.Your corn should now resemble a rocketship, with the ear as the rocket pointing in one direction, and the leaves and silk as its flames pointing the opposite way.

, Reorient your grip on the ear so you’re holding it by its exposed kernels. Gather the stripped leaves and silk in your dominant hand. Give them another hard yank to rip them free of the ear’s bottom.Or, if you find it easier to rip the leaves off one by one, go ahead and do that.

, Expect most of the silk to have been stripped away with their tassel. At the same time, don’t count on this to remove all of them. Inspect the ear for any stragglers and peel them off one by one."
"
Microwave the whole thing.,
Cut off the ear’s bottom.,
Squeeze the ear out of its husk.",How to Husk Corn2," Put your corn (husk and all) inside your microwave. Set the power to “high” and cook for two minutes. When the timer ends, turn the ear of corn over and repeat.The kernels inside should be steaming through the husk by the end. If they aren’t, keep cooking for shorter intervals until the kernels are sufficiently heated.

, Remember: the ear should be pretty hot at this point, so use a pot holder, kitchen towel, or other safe means to remove it from the microwave. Set it on a cutting board. Slice off the bottom of the ear.You want about a ¼- to a ½-inch (0.6 to 1.2 cm) of the ear’s kernels exposed after slicing off the bottom. If slicing the bottom off didn’t accomplish that on its own, use a knife to pry the leaves loose along your cut.

, Hold the ear over the cutting board (or, if you’re worried about it rolling off that, use a large bowl instead). Grip it by its top. Start squeezing the ear inside down along the husk so that it comes out of the opened bottom.The corn’s silk should stay inside the husk as the ear itself comes out, but give the kernels a check anyway and peel away any strands that might have stuck.

"
"
Check inside.,
Look for evidence of worms.,
Judge its freshness by sight.,
Judge by feel, too.",How to Husk Corn3," Peel the tops of the leaves away from the ear’s tip. Stop once you can see the first couple rows of kernels. If they look nice and plump, you’re good to go. However, with this method, bear in mind that:Once you expose the kernels, their sugars will start turning to starch much sooner, which means they’ll lose their freshness that much quicker.
For that very reason, this practice is frowned upon in farmers’ market, since any ears that you discard can’t be re-husked to retain freshness.

, Inspect the husk’s leaves. Pay particular attention towards the ear’s top. Check for any holes that have been created by worms.Holes may be tiny and hard to spot, but the leaves should have begun turning brown around them, which makes spotting them easier.

, Look over both the husk’s outer leaves and the silken tassel poking out from its tip. Favor husks with bright green leaves. Go for tassels that are still brownish in color, as opposed to black.The leaves’ and tassel’s coloring both indicate how moist the corn is. The more moisture it has, the fresher it is.

, If you’re not sure about coloring, feel each ear in your hand. Avoid husks with leaves that feel loose. Favor tassels that still feel sticky, which indicates moisture.Depending on how thick the husk is, you may also be able to feel the shape of the kernels through the leaves. If you can, also feel for any gaps that may indicate missing or shrivelled kernels.

Determine when the berries will begin bearing in your region .,
Find a location where you can pick .,
Watch for signs of ripening berries .,
Dress yourself appropriately for an outdoor experience .,
Find a suitable picking container for your effort.,
Take along a walking stick or some other implement to probe the thick briar vines for snakes or other hazards if you are going to pick in an area of thick growth where you cannot see the area where you are walking clearly.

,
Locate an area to pick where there are clean areas to stand, to avoid an unexpected confrontation with snakes or fire ants, or other unwelcome creatures.,
Examine the area around the dewberry vines for hazards, which may include wasp nests, poison oak or ivy, fire ants, or even venomous snakes.,
Learn to distinguish the prime berries, those that are completely ripe, but haven't begun to wilt.,
Pick the berries along the perimeter of the patch of vines you are searching, choosing the ones on vertical stems that can be reached without placing your hands too far into the tangle.,
Grasp individual berries carefully to keep from crushing or bruising them.,
Pull the berry into the cup of the palm of your hand, so you can use your thumb and fingers to continue picking until your palm is full, rather than taking individual berries to the bucket every time you pick one.

,
Drop the berries into your container carefully, keeping them from being crushed or bruised.,
Wash your berries when you get them home by placing them in a large bowl, and slowly filling the bowl with water until the berries have sufficient water and room to float freely.,
Enjoy your berries in a fresh pie, cobbler, or covered with fresh cream and sugar.

",How to Pick Dewberries," Normally, dewberries begin to ripen about 6 weeks after the last freezing temperatures in an area, and continue to bear several weeks, unless drought or extreme heat causes them to become dormant.;
, Make sure you are on public property, or have permission to enter private property to forage for your berries. Highway and railroad rights-of-way, forestry fire lanes, and country roads are good places to look. Be aware that some highway departments spray herbicides on the right-of-way, so you may have to do a little research to make sure the berries you find are safe to eat.

, You will notice dark green clumps of bushy vines with reddish purple stems in open areas with full sun and good drainage. Soon after the last frost, these clumps will be covered with bright white, five-petaled blooms, and soon after, the berries will appear. Watch as they progress from green, to red, then deep purple or glossy black, at which point they are ready to pick.

, The dewberry vines are covered with sharp stickers, so long pants and sturdy boots are recommended. Long sleeves are a very good idea. Dab on some mosquito repellent if you are sensitive to insect bites, and apply some sunscreen or wear a wide brimmed hat to protect your skin.

, Plastic grocery bags, small pails like one gallon ice cream buckets, or plastic mixing bowls will work for this step. Handles will make carrying these containers easier if they have them. A one or two quart bucket with a handle fastened onto your belt will free both hands for picking, or a hand for picking and one to hold your stick.

,, Ideally, you will pick in a place where there is minimal dust from traffic or other sources, since the berry's tiny lobes make cleaning dust from them difficult.

, Look for traffic dangers also, if you are picking along a roadway.

, Look for bug sting marks where stinkbugs or other pests have already dined on your fruit. The ideal berries will be glossy black, with a firm feel, and little red appearing on any of the lobes.

, Dewberry vines have tiny, razor-sharp thorns that can easily prick an unsuspecting picker painfully.

, Pull the berry at an angle from the stem, breaking it away rather than tugging it. This will leave the bud on the vine stems, rather than the berry, saving time later when you are cleaning them.

,, These berries have very tender skins, and abusing them will make it impossible to clean them thoroughly for eating later.

, Stir them gently with your hand to dislodge any dirt or debris that was collected with them.

Find a large area inhabited by wild rice and with shallow water that is relatively easy to pole through.,
Have one person pole the canoe slowly through the wild rice.

,
Have another person knock the stems after bending them over into the canoe so the loose spikelets will drop into the canoe bottom.,
Collect the wild rice on a tarp.,
Let the rice dry out (takes about 2-3 days of dry weather).

,
Place the rice in a very large iron pan and parch it over the coals.,
Once parched, put the rice in a pit lined with a hide.

,
The point now is to do the twist.,
After the rice has been thoroughly trodden on (it took about 10 minutes for this small batch), it is taken out and placed in a large container for winnowing.

,
The winnowing is done with a downward motion of the container, which moves all the chaff to the front of the bowl (away from the person winnowing), where it can be rather easily removed.,
Here is the completed, winnowed rice.",How to Harvest Wild Rice,";
,, You can use two wooden sticks called knockers; see the video below for the motion needed.

, The arrays of spikelets at the top of the plant harbor caterpillars (called rice worms), small rice hoppers, several species of spiders, ladybird beetles, and other insects. The carpet of rice on the bottom of the canoe will probably be teeming with life.

,, The trick here is to dry the rice and make the ""husks"" brittle, but not burn the rice. It takes a moment to work out the temperature. It's useful to remove the pan every now and again, along with lots of moving and flipping of the rice.


Here are the parched rice grains, which turn a golden brown after being heated (they were very light tan).

,, Use the balls of your feet and move your heels left and right, twisting the ""hulls"" off the grains. For this process, you need something that grips the rice, like braintan (or rubber soles are used a lot today). You do not stamp up and down on the rice (this doesn't accomplish the prying and twisting that is needed to rip the ""hulls"" off).

,, Much of it flies away within the ""vacuum"" that is created by the downward motion of the bowl, and other, larger material can be cleared by the hand or blown away with a light breath.

, Notice that there are lots of long grains (some broken ones too), but no chaff to get in the way of enjoying the rice.

Choose the right time to harvest.,
Harvest according to the age of the rhubarb.,
Know when a stalk is ready for harvesting.,
Harvest the stalks by twisting.,
Tidy the rhubarb plant.,
Pull or cut the leaves from the stalk.,
Finish harvesting before exhausting the rhubarb plant.,
Store the rhubarb properly.",How to Harvest Rhubarb," The harvesting period for rhubarb is late spring through to the end of summer.;
, It is important not to pull any stalks in the plant's first year of growth, as doing that will seriously weaken the establishing rhubarb plant. Allow each rhubarb plant to establish a strong root system the first year and leave the stalks intact (they'll come and go of their own accord).


In the second season, only harvest in the first two weeks and only select the stalks that are large enough, always leaving plenty on the plant.
In subsequent years, you can harvest rhubarb throughout the harvest period. From the third year on, you should find that the rhubarb can be harvested for a period of around 8 to 10 weeks., Rhubarb stalks are ready when they are between 1.5cm/0.5"" and 2.5cm/1"" wide. They should be quite firm, and show an even dark pinkish or maroon colour.

, Pull a stalk as close as possible to the base of the plant.


Pull gently, whilst twisting to ensure it comes away neatly. Rhubarb stalks should always be twisted clean from the crown, as twisting or pulling removes the most plant and invigorates the roots to produce more. Never dig or cut the plant as these don't produce the same vigorous growth.
If it is the rhubarb plant's second season, only pull two stalks per plant, leaving at least five healthy stalks to continue growing.
In following seasons, it's fine to remove three or four stalks per plant, as long as you leave a similar amount of stems still growing. It's recommended that you only harvest a third of the plant's harvest every season to avoid over-stressing the rhubarb plant., Never leave any broken stalks on the rhubarb plant as these can cause infections to grow. Remove any broken pieces from the base of the plant and either eat or discard them.


Leave three to four mature leaves on the plant; these will help the rhubarb to grow vigorously.Remove any flowering stalks when you notice them.

, The leaves contain oxalic acid, which is poisonous and should not be eaten. Discard of these or add to the compost. Or make a rhubarb spray from the leaves to keep the pests off your broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts.


Do not feed to animals either!

, Harvesting of rhubarb should cease once all of the stalks become thin again or when you've already harvested a third of the plant.

, While freshly picked rhubarb is best used as soon as possible after harvesting, it can be kept in a polyethylene bag in the fridge for up to three weeks.The stalks can be frozen or bottled for longer term storage once they have been prepared.


To stew rhubarb, remove and discard leaves if not already done, chop the stalks into 1 inch (2.5cm) pieces and stew in enough water to cover. Stewing doesn't take long, so keep an eye on them.

Dig a small hole in or near your garden.,
Cover the sides of your cup or other container.,
Camouflage the top of the small trap.,
Check back the next morning.",How to Make a Pitfall for Catching Insects," If you have noticed signs of tiny animal or insect activity in a certain place, that might be the best spot to place your pitfall.;
, Use cling film or vegetable oil to coat the container before setting it into the hole. This makes it slippery, so that the quarry cannot escape once trapped.

, Cover it with something like long blades of grass, leaves or very tiny twigs.

, See what you've caught trying to sneak into your flowers or vegetables. After careful examination, set the beastie free to go about its business unharmed.


If you're curious of what you caught and have a digital camera handy, take a few snaps of the insect and upload them onto a forum for gardeners or bug collectors. Be sure to note specifically where and how you caught what you're showing them, and what kind of mayhem you suspect it of wreaking on your landscape. As always, be gracious and polite, especially if users are going out of their way to help figure out what kind of insect you've caught.

Choose the right herbicide for your needs.,
Use protective gear when applying herbicides.,
Spot spray small outbreaks.,
Spray open patterns in a crosshatch pattern.,
Do follow up treatments.,
Do not use herbicides on kudzu invading trees or other plants.",How to Kill Kudzu1," There are a variety of different herbicides on the market. Make sure you select one specifically designed to get rid of kudzu plants. You want something with the active ingredients glyphosate and triclopyr, as these chemicals are effective at killing kudzu. The following commercial products have been proven effective for the treatment of kudzu:Bayer Advanced Brush Killer Plus Concentrate
Ortho Max Poison Ivy and Tough Brush Killer Concentrate
Roundup Concentrate Poison Ivy Plus Tough Brush Killer
Roundup Pro
Roundup Pro Concentrate;
, Herbicides can be dangerous to the bare skin. Make sure to wear protective gear, like safety goggles and gloves, before treating kudzu with herbicide.


You should also read the instruction manual on any herbicide you purchase. Some herbicides must be diluted in water before use. The instruction manual will also provide you with useful information on how to safely apply your chosen herbicide.

, You may have a small kudzu outbreak. A tiny amount of kudzu may be creeping up on a fence, for example. As you want to limit the use of herbicide as much as you can, do not aggressively treat small outbreaks. Instead, spot spray with a backpack sprayer. Spray towards the ground from which the kudzu spreads.Spot treatment is also sometimes used as a follow up treatment after you've targeted large patches of kudzu.

, In the event you have large patches of kudzu growing on the ground, you'll want to spray in a crosshatch pattern. A crosshatch pattern is marked by a series of intersecting parallel lines.Spray roughly half the solution in one direction in straight lines. Then, spray and half the solution in the other direction in lines perpendicular to the first.

, Kudzu is rarely eradicated with a single treatment. In order to completely destroy kudzu, you need to do several treatments. There is no herbicide available that will successfully remove kudzu in a single treatment. For younger, smaller roots, a few rounds of treatment may be enough to eliminate kudzu. For larger, older plants, you may need to treat kudzu several times a year for a few years to eliminate the plant., Kudzu often creeps up trees or individual plants. You should limit herbicide treatments to kudzu growing on level ground, or creeping up a manmade object like a fence. If you spray herbicide on a plant like a tree, the herbicide will end up harming this plant as well as the kudzu."
"
Mow down kudzu.,
Dig up and remove the roots.,
Cut kudzu vines off of small trees.,
Allow cattle or goats to graze on kudzu.",How to Kill Kudzu2," In some cases, kudzu can be controlled by continual mowing. Mowing kudzu can be time consuming, but it is sometimes more effective than pesticides for eradicating the plants. You can use mowers or mechanical clippers to cut kudzu vines down to ground level. During growing season, you should cut down kudzu vines once every month. Eventually, the plant will become exhausted and cease to grow.Once you're done mowing down kudzu, it's important to remove all plant material after it's trimmed down. Kudzu plants can reroot and begin growing again if not removed. You can burn kudzu materials or place them in plastic bags and dispose of them at a local dump.
Be consistent if you choose to cut kudzu root. One or two cuttings will do little to stop kudzu. You must exhaust the plants over a series of months for this method to be effective.

, It's also a good idea to dig up kudzu at the root. This is another time consuming, but effective, means of preventing kudzu from regrowing. You do not need to remove the entire root. You just need to remove the root crown, which is the portion of the root that kudzu grows out of.A shovel or pick axe are the best tools to use when removing the root crown. If you notice there are several smaller root crowns at the base of a kudzu vine, pruning shears may work well.
To find the root crown, follow a kudzu vine until you find where it roots into the soil. If you dig slightly, you should see new buds stemming. This is the root crown. Cut into the soil just below this area to remove the crown.

, If you notice kudzu growing on a tree, manually cut the kudzu off using pruning shears. Then, apply herbicide near the kudzu roots, at a safe distance from the sapling. If you're uncomfortable using herbicide, you can also dig up the roots of the kudzu., If you have cattle or goats, you can allow your livestock to control kudzu plants. Cattle and goats should graze on kudzu and it is not harmful for these animals. Much like mowing, continual grazing will wear down kudzu to the point it stops growing."
"
Remove kudzu during the correct times of year.,
Use herbicide conservatively.,
Make sure to use mild herbicides in residential or environmentally sensitive areas.",How to Kill Kudzu3," Regardless of the method you use, you want to make sure you remove kudzu at the right times of the year. Kudzu should be treated several times throughout the year.In late spring or early summer, begin your kudzu treatment once the leaves have fully expanded.
New kudzu will usually emerge from the first kudzu plants. This should be treated again in later summer or early fall to prevent a reoccurrence.

, If you choose to use herbicide to treat kudzu, be careful. Only use herbicide in select areas and only apply the recommended amount. Read instruction manuals that come with your herbicides carefully, especially the safety instructions.Keep away from animals and children. Chemicals in herbicide can be toxic if ingested or touched.

, If you're working in residential areas, make sure you choose mild herbicides. You also want to make sure use of herbicides is permitted in any area you choose to spray. You can contact your local Department of Natural Resources for more information.

Observe the pecan trees for indications the nuts are ready to fall.,
Establish the fact that the nuts your target tree are bearing are worth the efforts you will put forth.,
Observe the tree itself for indications of the nut crop, both in quality and quantity.,
Watch for the husks to begin splitting.,
Mow around trees with lawn grasses beneath them, circling the tree so that the clippings discharge away from the trunk, while beginning to circle as near the trunk as possible.,
Pick up pecans when they begin to drop, since wet weather can be detrimental to the nuts, and foraging wildlife may beat you to them if they are left on the ground.,
Keep leaves raked up or blown away using a leaf blower if possible, since finding the pecans in a sea of similarly colored leaves will make the task even more difficult.

,
Harvest the pecans using a method that's appropriate for your scale.,
Sort out deformed or damaged nuts when you have finished harvesting them.,
Sack your pecans for storage.,
Shell your nuts.",How to Harvest Pecans," Pecans may begin falling from early September to November, and preparing for harvesting should be done prior to the nuts falling, but closely enough to the anticipated fall that your efforts will not have been undone by time and weather.;
, Some pecan trees will produce low-quality nuts, either because of a poor growing season, low quality soil and nutrients, or it is simply a product of a poor genetic background. Some examples of these contributions to the nut quality are these:


Non hybridized trees produce seedling nuts, often no larger than small oak acorns, with incredibly hard shells which makes obtaining the nutmeats almost impossible. Other poor genetics can be found even in hybrid trees whose gene pool has passed on poor quality.
Poor growing conditions may include a dry spring and summer that did not enable the trees to produce a good crop, especially when irrigation is not used, and in soils that have poor moisture retention to begin with.
Low levels of critical soil nutrients, especially nitrogen and trace minerals/elements like zinc, iron, and manganese can substantially reduce the quality of the nuts.
Insect infestations such as web worms, bud worms, and pecan weevils can also have a serious impact on the health of the tree and the nut itself.
Very late frosts or freezes can damage the blooms and buds of the pecan tree, reducing the set of the nuts during or after the blooming period.

, In late summer, the pecans will have reached their full size, including their husks, so you should have a good idea of how large the nut will be after the husk dries and falls off. Note that the husk represents between 25-30% of the total mass of the pecan, so a pecan that appears large while in its husk may still be disappointingly small when the husk is gone.

, When a substantial portion of the nut's husks have split and opened, it is time to clean beneath the tree. Raking any debris from bare earth beneath a tree, and possibly taking action to level out the ground may be all that is needed in this situation, but for trees with lawn or pasture grasses, or even weeds beneath the canopy, more work will be needed.

, This will allow the mower discharge to propel the trimmings and any other debris away from the tree. Continue mowing until at least 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) beyond the tree's canopy so that nuts that fall near the edge will be visible to gather. High winds can leave pecans a surprising distance from the tree when they are blown free.

, Crows and squirrels are particularly fond of pecans, as are deer and other wildlife.

Stoop and pick your pecans. If the first few pecans are not sufficient to justify using more technological means to harvest them, you can simply bend over and pick up individual pecans as you walk beneath the tree. Have a container, such as an empty five gallon plastic bucket, to keep your harvest in. For the strong and energetic, this is an efficient technique for harvesting pecans underneath one or two trees. Some find that crawling on their knees will also suffice for the purpose of gathering pecans.






Use a pecan picker if the challenge of crawling around or stooping (bending) over is too much for you. There are several varieties of pickers mounted on short handles, but most consist of a wire spring configuration with a small hopper to hold the nuts. The spring is pressed down on the nut, which spreads the wires allowing it to slip between them, and it is captured in the hopper. Empty the hopper often into a bucket or other container to avoid spilling the pecans. (See the first video below.)






Use a manually operated rolling picker. These are simple machines that operate like a reel-type lawnmower, catching the nuts between flexible rollers or fingers and depositing them in a hopper. Most of these contraptions will pick up a considerable amount of debris, so keeping the ground clean underneath the tree is critical in reducing the labor involved. (See the second video below.)






Hire a pecan harvester for large orchards. Pecan harvesters use tractor powered machines that sweep the orchard to harvest the nuts. When used in conjunction with tree shakers, this is the least labor intensive, and most efficient way of harvesting pecans, but is really beyond the focus of this article.







, Unless you choose to crack and shell the pecans yourself, you will end up paying to have these undesirable nuts processed. If you intend to sell your pecans, having substandard or worthless nuts will cause the buyer to offer a lower price than for consistent, high quality pecans. This is especially true if you sell to a wholesaler, who grades his purchases carefully to insure the quality of his product. Some things to look for to help determine the quality of your pecans are these:


Coloration. Good pecans should have a uniform color. Some varieties, like Stuarts and Donaldsons have stripes near the bud ends, and a good definition between the stripe color (usually black), and the shells (light tan) are indicative of a good nut.
Shell shape. Pecans form inside the husk as nutrients are passed through the veins in the husk, then through the still soft shell, filling out from the bud end to the tip. If dry weather, depletion of soil nutrients, or insect damage to the husk interrupts this feeding process, the nut will taper toward the tip end, meaning the nutmeat has not continued to grow completely.
Sound. This may seem unusual, but pecans, when they are rattled or dropped together, make a distinctive sound. Hollow sounding pecans are likely not filled out, whereas good, full pecans will sound solid, even if just rattled together in your hands. As you gather the pecans, shake them, and crack a few suspicious sounding ones, and you will soon develop an ear for the sound of a good, full pecan.
Weight. Although individual pecans weigh very little, an experienced picker, especially when picking or sorting by hand, will soon notice a distinct difference in weight of full pecans, compared to lesser quality ones.

, Generally, pecans can be stored in loose cloth sacks, in a cool, dry place for several weeks after harvest. The nuts will actually improve in quality, particularly those harvested early, as they cure. Do not skip the curing step. Uncured pecans will not crack properly, and are difficult to shell. Freezing stops the curing process, so make sure the nuts are cured before you freeze them. Freezing will allow you to store the nuts even longer, with almost no effect on their quality. Remember that nature has provided the nuts with hard shells, an almost perfect storage container.

, If you are fortunate enough to have a pecan processing facility nearby, you can take your pecans in and have them cracked by machine. You can also check with your local farm supply store, as many of them have cracking machines. Expect to pay 25 to 40 cents per pound for this service. If you want to crack them yourself, you can purchase a pecan cracker for this task.

Be persistent.",How to Kill Vines," Vines are often one of the hardest weeds to get rid of. They grow quickly and tend to root themselves into other areas as they grow, so they can quickly take over new areas and attach themselves to trees, buildings, and other plants.


You will almost never get rid of vines in one shot. Once you start the fight, you need to be prepared for a long, drawn out battle against these weeds.
You might have more success if you use multiple methods of control. For instance, the combination of physical removal plus chemical control often sees more results than the use of only one of these options.;
, Most vines behave in similar ways, so the same basic techniques can be used no matter which vine species you are dealing with. If you are having exceptional difficulty, though, take the time to find out which vine species you are dealing with. Doing so may provide you with additional insight on how to kill them off.


You could ask a landscape professional for an opinion or post pictures online, via social media or yard and garden forums, for the opinion of others who may have dealt with similar issues in the past.
Wisteria vines are easily identified by the fragrant and small purple, pink, and white flowers that appear on the vine in the spring or mid to late summer. They are notably aggressive vines.
Kudzu vines are another aggressive type of vine. This species also has purple blooms, but its flowers smell sweeter than wisteria blooms if not quite as strong. The vine itself can grow as much as 1 foot (30.5 cm) in one day.
Trumpet vines are invasive and can be difficult, but they are not quite as persistent as kudzu and other more aggressive species. You can usually identify them by their trumpet-shaped blooms.
Blackberry vines are easy to identify by their fruit. Even these vines are considered noxious weeds, though, since wild blackberry vines can quickly spread into other areas and steal resources from other plants.

, If the vine is still fairly small, you should be able to track down the roots. Pull the roots out by hand or use a shovel or trowel to dig the root system out completely.


For best results, do this when the soil is moist and soft. You will be able to move more of the dirt around this way, giving you better access to the root system.
Dig out the entire root system, including any below-ground roots, bulbs, tubers, or rhizomes. If you do not get everything, some of the leftover root system may take hold in the soil and start growing again.
Note that you might need to dig out vine seedlings regularly for a few months or years to keep the problem under control.

, Even though digging the roots out is an essential step if you want to kill a vine completely, you also need to cut off and remove any vines clinging to buildings, fences, trees, or other surfaces.


If you leave these above-surface elements alive, it is possible that the vine will establish new roots and continue to grow and spread.
Do not compost the vines after cutting them away. By adding them to an outdoor compost, you may end up mixing roots into the compost, and when that compost gets used in the future, it might end up causing a renewed vine problem.

, You might be tempted to think that cutting the vines at the base can solve your problem, but as long as the root remains, the vine will live. Moreover, cutting a vine back may actually stimulate faster, more active growth depending on the species.

, Many vine species require large amounts of light and oxygen. If you cover the vine with grass clippings or mulch, you might be able to deprive it of enough light and air to eventually kill it off. Make sure that the layer of mulch is thorough, though, and that none of the vine can be seen peeking through.Similarly, you could cover the vines with plastic sheeting. This will rob the plant of air but not light. Unlike other coverings, plastic sheeting can quickly build up intense heat, which could also kill off the vine.

, If you have a lot of land and the resources to care for animals, consider using goats or livestock to kill the vines. Goats are notably voracious eaters, so they are generally able to hold vines at bay and prevent them from expanding any further.


Make sure that the vines in your area will not be toxic to the animals before using this as an option.

, For vines that are not quite so invasive, you might be able to kill new shoots or cut vines by pouring boiling water onto them. This may not give you dramatic results, but it can be used as an alternative to chemical herbicides., If you want to use physical control but do not have the stamina to do so, you should think about hiring a professional crew to do that majority of the work at the start.


Note that you will still need to follow up periodically to remove any random seedlings trying to grow. This can be done by a professional crew, but it is fairly easy compared to the initial bulk of work, so you might be able to do it yourself without issue.

, The chemical herbicides most effective against vines are generally non-selective, so they can kill plants you want to keep if you are not careful enough. If there is literally no way for you to treat the vine without killing your other plants, you may want to stick with physical control measures alone.


If the vines are near other plants but not actually on them, you might be able to adequately protect those plants by covering them with plastic sheets or bags.

, Use about a quarter of a bottle a quart or smaller in size. Choose a systemic herbicide labeled for use against vines. You need to use enough herbicide to completely wet the foliage of the vine. Be careful, though, since applying too much herbicide can cause runoff into the ground and may damage the soil and nearby plants.


There are a couple schools of thought concerning the best time to spray. Some argue that you can do so immediately, with the current vine intact. Others argue that you need to cut the vine back, allow it to re-sprout, then spray the new, immature growth.
You only need to soak the foliage of the vines. The chemicals are absorbed by the leaves and enter into the plant's circulation. Once inside, the poison travels down to the roots and kills the vine completely.
If you have weedy vines, look for glyphosate or triclopyr. For woody vines, stick with triclopyr, but go for glyphosate when used against herbaceous vines.
You might also consider using a herbicide with some combination of Dicamba or 2,4-D. Note that these tend to be even more dangerous to use.
Note that even powerful herbicides may not be fully effective against some vines, like kudzu.

,, You are going to leave the bottle there, and you don't want it kicked over or broken.

, Sometimes you have to pull some of the vine down to give you some spare length in the shoot, because, in the next step, you are going to put the shoot of the vine into the bottle.

, You want it to stay in the bottle, so you can't be pulling a shoot that wants to spring back somewhere else.

, In a week or two or three, the vine will die. Leave the shoot in the bottle even after the shoot dies, as the vine will continue to soak up the herbicide, and you can continue to kill connected vine runners.

, If you have large, established vines that sprawl over trees, shrubs, buildings, or fences, you will be unable to spray chemical herbicides in the usual manner without affecting the surrounding landscape.


There is, however, a way that you can use chemicals to kill vines like these. It is commonly referred to as the ""cut vine"" method.This method tends to be most successful if done in the fall.

, Use sharp pruning shears to cut the vine off near the base, leaving about 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of vine coming out of the ground.


The stump you leave behind should be fairly short, but there needs to be enough for you to access without much difficulty.
Some vines can be cut using pruning shears, while others may require you to use a pruning saw.

, Treat the cut portion of the stump with undiluted triclopyr. Apply enough to coat the entire cut.


Work quickly. You need to apply the herbicide while the cut is still fresh.
Treating the stump with herbicide prevents it from re-sprouting. The vine will also absorb the chemical through the cut, and once this chemical is absorbed, it will travel into the root system and kill the vine at its base.
For especially persistent vines, like wisteria, you can use a drilling technique. After revealing a stump, drill a 1-inch (2.5-cm) hole into the stump and any remaining vines using a 1/8-inch (3-mm) drill bit. The holes should be about 1/4-inch (6-mm) apart. Apply the herbicide to both the cut stump and the holes., Usually, the portion of the vine that is intertwined in your fence, tree, or bushes will die off since it has been disconnected from the root system. Once this portion of the vine begins to wither, you can easily clear it out by hand.

, This technique is usually highly successful, but you may still need to treat the area multiple times of the vine has taken root in multiple locations.


There is also some risk that the vines can grow back even after you treat them the first time. You are fighting an ongoing battle, so you should be prepared to treat any reappearing vines as soon as you spot the first new growth.

Use human hair as a deterrent.,
Spread hair on your flower garden.,
Put some of the remaining hair in a sock or stocking.",How to Keep Deer Out of Your Yard1," Human hair can repel deer, so get some from your local barber or hairdresser (it should be free of charge).;
, The scent of multiple humans from the hair will deter the deer.

, Hang the sock or stocking in your vegetable garden with the same effect. Make it thickest at row ends and around outside rows of the vegetable patch or garden bed.


Make sure the sock or stocking has an attractive and pleasant appearance; not only do you want to keep the deer away, but you also want to make your garden appear classy and beautiful! A ratty, old sock or a stocking with a disgusting color will bring down your garden's appearance and possibly make your neighbors believe you have a bad taste in style.

Cut the bamboo down to soil level and wait for new shoots to grow back.,
Sever any underground rhizomes when new shoots start to grow back.,
Apply glyphosate herbicide to the leaves, stalks, and shoots of the bamboo.,
Alternately, use a stump and root killer on the bamboo.,
Repeat treatment.",How to Kill Bamboo1," Before you spray new bamboo leaves, make sure that you either cut or mow it down and then allow it to regrow. It sounds weird, but you need to let new bamboo grow. Bamboo herbicide won't be effective if the canes of the bamboo are well-developed.


Bamboo is stringy but not very hard. A ""lopper"", which looks like a scissors with huge handles and a little jaw, cuts it much better than a saw.
Cut the bamboo down in late winter so that you can be applying to herbicide on the new growth in late spring or early summer.;
, Use a sharp spade (or other sharp garden implement) to cut down the bamboo and sever the rhizomes of the bamboo.Break up as many clumps of rhizomes as possible.


Rhizomes are masses of roots that grow underground. These root-stalks grow horizontally underground in clumps and then send new shoots up beyond the surface when the plant is ready to grow.
You probably recognize rhizomes if you've ever eaten ginger and galangal, or have seen raw turmeric. These roots with many offshoots are what the underground rhizomes of the bamboo plant should look like.

, Glyphosate herbicide only kills the plants that it comes into direct contact with. This means that you'll need to be careful about applying it only to the bamboo.Most glyphosate herbicides need to be sprayed onto the leaves, stalks, and shoots of the plant and allowed enough time to penetrate before any water dilutes it. Unless instructed to do so, do not apply glyphosate herbicide to the soil surrounding the bamboo, as it will be ineffective.


To reduce the risk of killing the wrong plant or over-spraying, you can paint the herbicide onto leaves and stalks with a brush instead of spraying the plant.
If you're near a water supply (river, lake, ocean, etc.) make sure that you're using an herbicide that's meant for eradicating plants near water. You don't want to contaminate nearby bodies of water.

, Another way to mow down bamboo in its tracks is to cut down the canes and then apply a stump and root killer containing glyphosate or triclopyr to the foliage of any regrowth and to the cut stump.

, One application won't eradicate the infestation; bamboo is tough and has a tendency to spread like wildfire. (Unfortunately, even wildfire can't completely get rid of this pest!) As the bamboo continues to send up shoots, you'll need to continually apply the herbicide treatment to the leaves, stalks, and shoots of the plant in order to properly exterminate it.


When using any kind of herbicide, remember to consult instructions that come with packaging. Some herbicide instructions may differ significantly from the advice offered in this tutorial. When push comes to shove, defer to instructions that come with the herbicide product.
You should also use this herbicide method in conjunction with rooting out the rhizomes of the bamboo, so that it doesn't keep sending up shoots.

Grow plants that deer dislike.",How to Keep Deer Out of Your Yard3," This comes with a big caveat – deer, if hungry or curious enough, will eat almost anything.As such, none of the plants that might deter them are a sure thing but you can at least try. Some of the plants that deer seem to not like include ornamental grasses, iris, foxgloves, yucca, herbs and plants with a strong fragrance, such as sage, chives, lemon balm, bee balm, etc. They also dislike plants with thorns, such as purple coneflower but delicious roses seem to be a marked exception to that!


Equally, be aware of which plants are likely to tempt deer to your yard. Plants such as tulips, chrysanthemum, hyacinths, roses, apples, beans, peas, raspberries, strawberries, sweetcorn, hosta, dogwood, fruit trees, Norway maple, yew, and azaleas positively radiate welcome signs to deer!Sometimes people plant these a long way from parts of the yard or garden to lure deer away; that's a risky strategy though as may just invite them to one end and encourage them to keep wandering through.

Find a deer repellent.,
Take your dog out to mark your yard.,
If you live in an isolated area, mark your own yard on a regular basis.,
Soap flakes used around the edges of garden beds can repel deer.

",How to Keep Deer Out of Your Yard4," There are a number of deer repellents that can be used. You could purchase some from the garden store or hardware department. If so, use these products according to their instructions. Alternatives to use at home include mothballs (hang in onion sacks from low branches at deer height), prickly branches (use as a fence or barrier), decaying fish heads, blood and bone meal, garlic, fabric softener, etc.Not all of these options are environmentally-friendly – mothballs are fairly chemically active and commercial options might contain unacceptable chemicals, depending on what is in them. And then there is the smell factor; if some things are too smelly, you're unlikely to want to sit in your garden and enjoy it!


Many commercially-available deer repellents include things like deodorized fox urine, coyote urine, or wolf urine. What these products have in common are that they are: (1) urine (2) of something that eats deer. This opens up a number of other possible ways to repel deer:

, This will need to be re-done every few days, or after it rains.

, If this is a little too exposed for you, consider catching your urine in a small bucket when using the toilet. Then, take an old spray bottle, fill it with your own urine, and spray a little near the garden. You should use a dedicated spray bottle for this, and never use it for anything else. Clearly label the bottle!

Use deer deterrents that involve noise or light.,
Use barriers.,
Add fencing.",How to Keep Deer Out of Your Yard5," There are numerous deterrents you can try, and in conjunction with other efforts, these might prove successful. Bright sensor lights that turn on with movement can scare off deer (and burglars) at night, while shiny objects such as CDs and strips of metallic sheets blowing in the wind can reflect light uncomfortably for deer during the day. For noise, you could consider using noisemakers, gas guns (these are not cheap and are usually used to guard vineyards and crops), radio noise (hook it up to trigger when deer trigger the motion lights), whistles, and firecrackers.

, These can include fences, invisible fishing line and sprinklers that suddenly turn on when tripped. Unfortunately for your wallet, the fence needs to be at least 8 feet (2.4 m) high or sprinkled with obstacles to prevent jumping such as branches or netting, otherwise some deer can jump this with no problems.To save money, fence off plants that matter rather than the perimeter of your property. An electric fence with a small charge tends to work well if you don't mind having and maintaining such a fence.


Keep some plants in a greenhouse to keep the deer from getting to them. Be sure to keep the door shut at all times though.
Ask your hardware store for a mesh product that can be placed over plants, such as Deer Guard.

, Fencing is the only truly effective way to keep deer out of areas you wish to protect.


Install an eight foot high fence. Deer can easily jump clear over anything lower than four feet high, and a six foot fence risks entangling the animal and injuring it (and an injured deer is eventually a dead deer).
Add a fence about 4 foot (1.2 m) high (simple lattice) with chicken wire (1"" size) (about 2' high) angled toward the outside. It can be angled to the inside; it seems to work either way. However, it must be angled like 45 degrees. Deer, raccoon, cats, squirrels, moose and bears do not even try to go over. Birds too are reluctant to come inside such a fenced area either. The size should not be too large and should be close to the house.

Make a natural tick repellent.",How to Get Rid of Ticks Around Your Home," Although ticks are found outdoors, indoor infestations of the brown dog tick are not uncommon. This kind of tick feeds on dogs and other animals and prefers warm, dry conditions.


The first step in removing these ticks is to de-clutter your home, because ticks hide almost anywhere. Pick up items from the floor, and don't leave dirty laundry lying around. Your tick infestation is an opportunity to do a little spring-cleaning.;
, Ticks attach to dirty clothing or bed linens. Wash clothes or linens you suspect may be tick-infected in the hottest water suitable for the fabric type.


Avoid leaving dirty laundry on the floor, and if you suspect any clothes or linens might have ticks, do not put them in the laundry hamper, because this will contaminate the other clothes. Put them straight into the washing machine., The next step is to clean your entire home thoroughly from top to bottom. Clean out shelves, dust forgotten corners and sweep, mop, and vacuum all floors.


Your vacuum cleaner will be your best friend during the tick-removal process, because you can suck up ticks from all over the house; in animal bedding, in cracks in the floor and wall, on baseboards and crown molding, and on and underneath furniture.
Be sure to dispose of the vacuum bag afterwards., Once your house is cleaned and decluttered, and you have physically removed as many ticks as possible, you will need to use pesticides to kill any remaining ticks and their eggs.


To kill tick eggs and larva, you need to lightly dust all areas of your home with a pesticide contain boric acid and botanical extracts. Sprinkle a little extra dust around your pet's bedding, which is a favorite laying spot.
To kill the adults, use a pyrethrin-based pesticide spray designed especially for getting rid of brown dog ticks. This is safe for humans and pets and works quickly.
Spray this pesticide all over the home. Don't forget carpets and curtains, and the underside of tables, chairs and sofas. Make sure to read the label for exact directions.

, Indoor pets, usually dogs, are the number one source of tick infestations. Dogs can carry ticks in from outdoors, or catch them from other animals in the kennel or the local neighborhood.


First you need to physically remove any ticks that are using your animal as a host, then treat the dog with a topical tick-killing product containing ingredients such as fipronil, amitraz or permethrin. Ask your veterinarian for suggestions.
You may also invest in a tick-repelling collar for your pet. These will keep ticks from latching onto your cat or dog for approximately three months. These collars can be difficult to find in stores, so ask your vet, or shop online., Severe tick infestations may require a professional exterminator. They have specialized equipment and pesticides, which kill ticks immediately on contact. They also have an in depth knowledge of ticks' habitats and behaviors, so they will be able to locate the ticks very quickly.


If your tick infestation remains a problem, despite your best efforts to get rid of them, you may want to consider this option.

, Outdoor ticks can usually be found in grassy, bushy areas sheltered by trees and shade. They like high humidity.


They can also be found in the same places favored by one of the tick's favorite meals––deer. So any time you're out in tall grasses, or hiking in the woods, you're in enemy territory.
The first thing to do is discourage ticks from taking up residence in your home territory, by targeting any favorable tick conditions in your own backyard.

, Start by getting rid of any tick-friendly foliage. The best way to do this is keep your yard trimmed regularly and to remove all dead, scraggly, overgrown vegetation.


Avoid grass to overgrow, and remove vines and other plants that tend to create bushy, clumped or grass-like environments.
Moreover, since ticks are like vampires—they drink blood––and they hate the sun. Use that as your guide when removing plants, so let the sun into as many parts of your yard as possible.

, Regular mowing deprives ticks of tall grass, and lets the sun in—–this not only keeps the bugs at bay, it also evaporates morning dew quickly, depriving ticks of water, too.


Clear tall grasses from around your house and lawn. Use an edger to create a barren zone that ticks loathe to cross on their own. They'll have to hitch a ride on a passing deer and hopefully you're keeping them out of your yard, too.

, If ticks cannot live in the grasses, they'll find shade elsewhere. Damp, dark brush and dead leaves—–especially dead leaves—–are tick heaven. Don't allow piles of vegetation to build anywhere in your yard.

, Use approved, known safe pesticides in late spring to early summer, to prevent ticks from populating your lawn. A single treatment of your yard in late May or early June can reduce tick population by over 50 percent.


Be sure to only use pesticides approved for use in your area against ticks, and use them according to the label.
Some good ones pesticides contain lambda-cyhalothrin and Esfenvalerate.

, Fencing your yard will prevent larger animals, such as deer or coyotes, from passing through your backyard. Ticks travel on mammals, so keeping larger animals out will help control the tick population in your yard. Besides, deer will chomp on your garden, and coyotes will chomp on your cats.

, Like brush and dead leaves, firewood holds darkness and moisture. Keeping it stacked in a dry location denies ticks of their safe haven, and it will keep your firewood nice and dry when it's time to use it next winter!

, Make sure they play in areas that are located well away from high grasses or trees. If the swing set has grass growing around the legs of the set, get that weed whacker over there and start trimming!

, Ticks can nest under feeders undisturbed––by cleaning regularly you make it undesirable for them.

, Regularly check yourself, your children and pets, especially after playing or hiking outdoors.


Look for ticks in the hairline, under arms, on legs—–all over. Remove them with a pair of tweezers.
Be careful not to squeeze the body of an embedded tick, you do not want the tick to regurgitate into the attach point as this aids in the passing of diseases such as Lyme disease.

, You can make a non-toxic tick repellent at home. Get a 16-ounce (475ml) spray bottle and start spraying!



Create a citrus based repellant. Ticks avoid citrus, which makes it an effective weapon. To make: Boil 2 cups of water, and add two chopped lemons, limes, oranges, or grapefruit—–alone or in combination. Let it boil for a minute or so, then simmer the concoction for an hour. Strain the fruit out, let it cool, pour into the sprayer, and squirt it on you, your kids, your pets and your yard—–anywhere ticks might like to go.

Other natural repellents use geranium, lavender, or peppermint essential oils. These are not safe for cats though, so avoid spraying the cat.

Cut the thistle down.,
Dig out the root.,
Introduce natural predators.,
Use a non-selective broadleaf herbicide.,
Try an herbicide with glyphosate.,
Hire a professional.,
Pack other plants close together.,
Remove any buds and flowers.,
Spread mulch.,
Create a shady cover.,
Beware of contaminated materials.",How to Get Rid of Thistles," Once the thistle reaches its full grown stage, cut it down at its base. The thistle will pop back up eventually, but after cutting it down often enough, the roots will eventually become too stressed and the entire plant will wither.


While cutting and mowing are important all throughout the season, it is especially important to keep up on it during the first three to four weeks.
Cutting thistle down also prevents the thistles from drying out and leaving seeds.
With Canada thistle, regularly mowing and cutting the thistle down causes the thistle to starve to death. The rhizomes in the top portion of soil spread quickly, making the thistle hard to pull, but continual attacks on the thistle can stress the roots and make it impossible for the rhizomes to replenish their food supply.With bull thistle, trimming the thistle down only works if you can dig out the rosette formation during the first year. During the second year of this biennial plant, you need to cut the stems down to the ground before the thistle ever has a chance to bloom. If you let bull thistle flower, it will likely go to seed before you have any chance to stop it.
For creeping thistle, cut it down when the thistles are 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.24 cm) long. Usually, this will be around early June. Cut it again when you next notice new shoots coming out.
If you want to improve the likelihood of stopping thistle in its tracks, wait until after the stalks are fully grown before you cut them back. Trimming the thistle early in the spring does not help much since the thistle will still be resilient enough to grow back. By waiting until just before they bud or immediately after unopened buds form, you stun the plant enough to severely inhibit later growth for the season.On the other hand, it is important that you trim thistle down before its buds open. Once the buds form and open, thistle can send out seeds. These seeds are carried on the wind very easily, which is one reason why thistle is such a stubborn weed.
When you cut thistle down, make sure that you throw away the clippings. Do not try to compost them since doing so can cause seeds and roots to spread, even if the plant has not officially gone to seed yet.
In addition to stressing the thistle, mowing your lawn also promotes healthy grass and makes the area less hospitable to new thistle plants. As such, thistle is less likely to spread through a trim, neat lawn.;
, If you only have a few thistle plants to worry about, you could dig out the entire root system by hand. This can be a time consuming practice since the root systems extend deep into the soil and spread wide, but if you are successfully able to get the entire root out, then you can get rid of the plant immediately.


Removing the thistle from the root is essential if you are dealing with bull thistle and not Canada thistle. While this process can help with Canada thistle, digging out the rosette of thistle during bull thistle's first year is a key part of keeping the weed under control.
Digging out the roots is especially helpful if you need to get rid of spear thistles or marsh thistles. These types of thistles have less extensive root systems in the early stages, so if you dig out the spud of the root at an early stage of growth, you might be able to remove enough of the roots to actually make a difference. The spud root will look like a rosette and lie just below the surface of the ground.
Always pull up as many of the roots as possible. Even broken roots can produce new plants, and since the broken roots are no longer connected to one another, they can actually cause even more thistle plants to pop up.

, Certain types of mammals and insects eat thistle, and if you introduce these animals to your yard or pasture, they can keep the thistle population under control for you. After a while, the thistle will be so stressed that it will stop growing.


Insects that naturally attach thistle include the adult thistle-head weevil, thistle rosette weevil, thistle-stem gall fly, flower weevil, stem-mining weevil, yellow starthistle bud weevil, and yellow starthistle hairy weevil.Cattle will eat most species of non-poisonous thistle. Sheep and ponies tend to eat young thistle shoots, and goats, donkeys, and llamas eat creeping thistle at nearly any stage of growth., One of the surest ways to get rid of thistle is to apply a non-selective broadleaf herbicide to the entire area. The disadvantage is that all vegetation in that location will die, so this method should only be used if you are dealing with more thistle than you are yard.


Apply herbicides during seasons of active growth. These include spring and fall.
The best time to apply weed killer is on a sunny day, when the temperature is between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 and 29.4 degrees Celsius).

, When targeting individual thistle plants, it would be better to do so with an herbicide formulated with an ingredient like glyphosate. Apply this plant poison directly to the individual thistle plant by either spraying it or applying it by hand.


Apply herbicides during seasons of active growth. These include spring and fall.
Other popular herbicides known to work against thistle include MSMA, dicamba, MCPA, bromoxynil, and 2,4,-D.
While glyphosate and many other herbicides are technically non-selective, they can be applied specifically to the thistle, so you may not kill off any other plants in the area if you are careful enough.
To apply the herbicide by hand:Put on a thick rubber glove that is free from leaks.
Put a cotton glove over the rubber one.
Mix the herbicide in a container according the the instructions on the label.
Dip your gloved hand into the herbicide, just long enough to soak the cotton glove.
Make a fist over the container to drain excess herbicide.
Gently grasp each thistle, working from the bottom to the top of the plant, to apply a good dose of herbicide.


Note that you might need to apply herbicide multiple times before it completely wipes out the thistle.

, Professional lawn care management companies have access to more powerful means of thistle extermination. They might use a stronger herbicide or try burning the thistle away.


If you want to try burning the thistle away, make sure that you hire professionals who are also licensed burn crews. Be aware that burning will probably kill the other plants in the area, as well, so it should only be used as a last resort.

, To prevent more thistle from popping up, any plants you want in your yard or garden should be planted closely together. Doing so limits the amount of free space thistle has to take root in, thereby discouraging its growth.


Setting other plants close together attacks the thistle from both above and below. The root systems of the other plants can compete for nutrients with the thistle, thereby leaving fewer nutrients for the weed to drain. Tall plants can also create shade in the area, and since thistle hates shade, it will be less apt to grow in these new shady spots.
An especially good competitor plant for thistle is alfalfa. Alfalfa sprouts earlier than thistle does, so it can establish itself before thistle has a chance to do likewise.
Amend the soil in your garden or yard so that it suits the needs of the plants you want to grow rather than the needs of the thistle. Thistle grows well in soil with low fertility, so improving your soil with organic materials can discourage thistle growth while encouraging the growth of most other plants., If you are unable to completely mow down the thistle, you should at least cut any unopened buds and new flowers as soon as you spot them. By cutting the flowers off early, you can prevent the thistle from going to seed. When thistle plants cannot go to seed, they cannot spread, and new plants will not develop.


Difficulty can still arise if there is thistle nearby that you cannot control. For instance, if a neighbor has thistle in his or her yard and refuses to keep it in check, the seeds from that yard can still spread into yours via the wind.

, If you have recently cut your thistle down or simply want to stop new thistle from growing, spreading a heavy layer of mulch over your garden or over bare spots in your yard can do the trick. Mulch makes it difficult for plants to access sunlight and blocks out many of the nutrients thistle needs to sprout and thrive.


Mulch can prevent new seeds from sprouting and may also keep any currently established root systems at bay as long as you have trimmed the growth back down to the ground before you apply mulch.
For mulch, consider using pine needles, shredded wood chips, or pecan hulls. Any standard mulch is fine, essentially, as long as you can apply a 2-inch (5-cm) covering of it., Thistle thrives in sunlight and dies in shade. For long-term management, consider planting a large, shady tree in the area generally afflicted with thistle. For a shorter-term solution, construct a temporary shelter that can provide shade to thistle-infected areas.


Easy temporary structures can be made with tar paper, sheet metal, or cardboard boxes.

, Organic materials you spread onto your lawn can contain thistle roots and clippings if you buy from an untrustworthy source. When you buy organic materials, make sure that the seller has a good reputation.<

Materials to watch out for include grass seeds, mulching material, and animal feed.

Use dish soap and water.,
Try white vinegar and water.,
Make a lemon juice solution.,
Sprinkle diatomaceous earth inside the house.,
Use boric acid.",How to Kill Ants without Pesticides1," Fill a water bottle with one part dish soap and two parts water, then shake it up to mix the solution thoroughly. When you see a line of ants (or just one ant, for that matter) spray the mixture over them. They'll immediately halt and suffocate. Wipe up the dead ants with a wet cloth, and keep the spray bottle around for next time.Setting out shallow dishes of soapy water is another good way to kill ants. Lure them in with a trail of something sugary.
This method is good for killing groups of ants, but it won't take out the entire nest. If ants keep coming back, you might have to address the source of the problem.
Soapy water is a natural insecticide that kills most insects, not just ants. Try it on roaches, too.;
, Ants really hate vinegar, and you can make a cheap, easy pesticide just using vinegar and water. Mix a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray it directly onto the ants to kill them, then wipe up the ants using a damp paper towel and discard them.


You can also use vinegar and water as a deterrent; spray it around your windowsills, doorways and other places where you see ants coming inside.
Some people have found that using this vinegar solution to clean the floors, windows and countertops makes ants less likely to crawl over these surfaces. White vinegar makes an excellent household cleaner, and you can't smell it once it dries.

, If you can't stand the smell of vinegar, spray the ants with a lemon juice solution. They're averse to the citric acid in lemon juice, so you can use this spray as a deterrent as well by spraying it around the perimeter of your house. Mix up a solution of 1 part lemon juice to 3 parts water and use it as an all-purpose spray., Food-grade diatomaceous earth is a very effective insecticide that doesn't harm humans or pets in the least. It's composed of fossilized diatoms that have been ground to a powder. When insects walk over the powder, the tiny fossil shards scratch the waxy outer coating on their exoskeletons, causing their bodies to dry out. Sprinkle the powder along your baseboards, windowsills, and around the perimeter of your house to kill ants. Use an applicator or a dusting bulb to do this.It's recommended that you wear a mask or cloth over your face when handling diatomaceous earth. While the powder isn't harmful when ingested, the tiny particles can be hard on your lungs when you breathe them in.
Diatomaceous earth becomes ineffective when it gets wet, or even when the air is damp and humid. It will regain its effectiveness when dry, so if your home's humidity is reducing the potency of your DE consider using a dehumidifier in the problem areas., It's completely natural and it really works against ants. When they ingest boric acid, it poisons their stomachs and they die. Boric acid also damages ants' exoskeletons the same way diatomaceous earth does. It comes in the form of a white or blue powder that you distribute with a dusting bulb in areas where you commonly see ants, like near your baseboards or in your windowsills.Boric acid is not a toxic pesticide, but it should not be consumed by humans or pets. Avoid using it in areas where your children and pets play. Don't use it near food sources or in your kitchen cabinets. While it should not cause harm to your pets, it may be toxic to smaller animals like birds, reptiles, and fish.Boric acid is toxic to beneficial insects as well.

Dig out the plant.,
Mow the area regularly.,
Deplete the plant's stored food.",How to Kill Bamboo2," This is one of the main, non-chemical ways to kill your bamboo. Use a sharp spade, mattock, or saw to cut the plant down and dig it out. Like all the other methods and ways, this will take some paying attention to the bamboo and continuing to root out its different culms (bamboo stalks) and rhizomes (bamboo's underground stems).You will want to cut down the clumps, but you'll also want to root out the rhizomes, otherwise the beast will keep growing. Rhizomes grow in the top foot of soil, so you'll want to dig down until you find them.
Sever the rhizomes as you go, especially if you want to keep some of the bamboo plant. This will keep it from sending out more shoots.
Keep cutting it down and digging it out. You will need to do this until the bamboo plant stops sending up shoots. This can take months, or even years to accomplish, but there isn't a faster way, because bamboo is so pervasive and resistant.
If you want to eradicate bamboo on your property, you must remove all rhizomes.

, Bamboo, like grass, is fine for the occasional mowing, but it does not like frequent mowing. This can help reduce the stalks, especially on a plant that hasn't grown too huge (you'll have less luck mowing bamboo stalks that have grown huge, unless you cut them down first).Mowing the bamboo frequently can reduce the rhizomes, because it takes away their way of collecting food (from the sun through their leaves).
You will have to mow whenever you see stalks arising, because this method can take awhile.

, Another way you can get rid of your bamboo is to basically starve it. You should start by cutting down the stalks below the soil line and then placing a dark tarp or thick piece of plastic over the top of the area. This will make it so the plant is cut off from rain, sun and air which will eventually kill it.Anchor the tarp or plastic down. People tend to use cinder blocks, but anything heavy enough to keep the tarp down will work fine. You have to make sure that the plastic or tarp does not move, because the point is to cut the bamboo off from the elements.
If you get new growth coming up beyond the perimeter of the tarp, you'll need to immediately either spray it with herbicide (containing triclopyr), or cut it down and put a cinder block or another tarp over the area.
Again, this can take awhile, so you have to be patient. Leave the tarp there for at least a month or so (but it can take up to a year to really eradicate the bamboo).

Set up an open-sided barrier.,
Set up a fully enclosed barrier.,
Consider hedging bamboo in on one side with a pond or stream.,
Periodically check for escaping rhizomes.",How to Kill Bamboo3," Dig a curved or half-circle trench around your bamboo. The barrier should be 28"" deep to be effective, which is deeper than most rhizomes can go. The benefits to an open sided barrier are that the bamboo doesn't get too root bound in its enclosed space, and makes sure that the bamboo has adequate drainage. You can also use it to set up a border along a fence line or property line, which can help keep your bamboo from escaping into your neighbor's yard or vice versa.If you're in a DIY sort of mood, you can make the barrier from concrete, metal, or plastic. Any of them are good. Be aware that rhizomes may be able to travel through wood. Its use is discouraged.
One really effective and highly-used material is a high-density polypropylene — 40 mil or heavier. This sort of specialized bamboo barrier usually costs between $3 and $4 per foot, depending on the material and thickness.
If setting up a barrier along a fence, place it directly alongside the fence, with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of barrier above ground.
An open-sided barrier will require annual root pruning to contain the bamboo.

, Like the open-sided barrier, enclosed barriers will need to be at least two to three feet deep. Unlike the open-sided barrier, it will enclose the bamboo all around, so that no rhizomes should escape. The biggest benefit to this one is the obvious one — it keeps the bamboo completely contained, although you may still have to check for rhizomes.Again, make sure that at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of barrier is visible above the ground, because this will allow you to detect any rhizomes trying to escape over the sides.

, If planned properly, a pond or stream coupled with a three-sided enclosure will act as a decorative but effective barrier against the bamboo. The stream itself serves as the fourth wall, since bamboo rhizomes cannot travel across water.

, If your enclosure is deep enough and well-constructed, your bamboo shouldn't have very many places to grow. Still, you'll have to keep vigilant watch on your bamboo to make sure it isn't creeping out of its designated area. If you do catch some unruly bamboo rhizomes, remove them entirely: Cut them up beneath the surface and consider using any of the steps mentioned above to fully kill the bamboo.

Make boric acid sugar traps.,
Set the traps where you tend to see ants.,
Wait for the traps to attract ants.,
Change out the traps when the syrup dries.,
Keep using the traps until ants no longer come to them.,
Use cornmeal borax traps to kill the larvae.",How to Kill Ants without Pesticides2," These are easy to put together, inexpensive, and best of all, extremely effective. All you need is a few pieces of cardboard or index cards (one for each trap), a bottle of corn syrup or any type of sticky sugar substance, and boric acid powder. Here's how to make the traps:


Mix 2 tablespoons of corn syrup and 2 tablespoons of boric acid in a small bowl.
Make sure the texture is paste-like and sticky, not runny. Add more boric acid if it's too wet.
Use a spoon to spread the mixture over the surface of your cardboard pieces. Each piece is its own trap.

, If they like to collect on your bathroom floor, put one there. Put one under the kitchen sink, and another on your front porch. Set the traps around wherever you see ants gathering.


Since the traps contain boric acid, don't put them in your kitchen cabinets or near food sources.
You can put the traps outside, too. Place them in your flower beds or near your trash cans.
The sugary smell might attract critters other than ants, like your child or dog. Make sure to put the traps out of reach of kids and pets.

, If you have an an infestation, it won't be long before the traps become full of ants who wander onto the cardboard in search of sugary food and feast on the boric acid-tainted syrup. They won't die just yet, but the poison will soon take action in their stomachs. In the meantime, they'll return to their nest to bring some food back for their fellow ants, which will in turn ingest the poison.


When you see ants entering and leaving the traps, let them move around freely. If you kill them, they won't get the chance to bring the poison back to the nest, killing dozens more ants.
This method won't necessarily kill the entire nest of ants, but it will significantly reduce the population of ants around your home.

, After a few days, you'll probably need to set out fresh traps. Mix up a fresh batch of the ant poison, spread it on pieces of cardboard, and set out the traps.

, After a week or two, you should see the number of ants coming to feed on the syrup decline dramatically. When you start to see dead ants around the vicinity of the traps, and you no longer witness hordes of ants marching into the house your work is done.

, Worker ants eat liquids, not solids, but they'll carry cornmeal pieces back to their nest. They'll feed the solid pieces to larvae, which then convert the food into liquid and feed it back to the worker ants.In this way, the boric acid cycles through several generations of ants.


Make sure the dishes of cornmeal and borax are low enough to ants to get in and out.
You can also make a dry paste with cornmeal, borax, and a few drops of water. Spread the paste in areas where you tend to see ants.

Follow ants to track down the nest.,
Prepare a pot of boiling water.,
Pour the water over the nest.,
Check for ants over the next few days.,
Plug the entrance holes if you can't get to the nest.",How to Kill Ants without Pesticides3," If ants keep swarming your house no matter what sprays and traps you employ, you'll need to attack them at their source: the nest. When you see a trail of ants marching inside, follow it as far as you can to find the anthill. Depending on the species of ant you're dealing with, the nest may be out in the open, hidden carefully in rocks or hedges, or inside your house.



Little black ants are one of the most common home invaders. These ants walk in long, slow lines, giving away their nest sites to anyone with the good sense to follow them outside. You'll find their nests in sheltered spots around the yard.

Odorous house ants (known for the rotten coconut smell they emit when you crush them) build nests inside the house in window frames or inside the walls. They also build nest outdoors in woodpiles, mulch piles, under rocks, and in other outdoor crevices.Pavement ants tend to nest in cracks in the sidewalk or driveway. You might not be able to see the nest itself, since it could be hidden under the pavement, but you should be able to find the ants' entryway.

Fire ants usually don't come inside the house, but you might have a nest on your property that's preventing you from walking around your yard in bare feet. Look for a large mound raised above the ground and composed of sand-like granules.

, Fill a large pot halfway to the top with water. Bring it to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as the water comes to a boil, and while it's still piping hot, you'll need to be able to get it from the kitchen to the nest you found.

, Try to pour it into the entry hole you found. The boiling water will kill hundreds of ants on contact, and it will also cause the nest to collapse. If the nest is quite large, you might want to pour more than one pot of water over it.


If the nest you're dealing with is indoors, the boiling water trick might damage your house. Instead of using water, douse the nest with a bowl of soapy water. You can also put on a pair of long rubber gloves and scrape the nest into a bucket, then drown the ants.
If you're dealing with fire ants, make sure you approach the nest wearing long pants tucked into socks and long sleeves. The ants are sure to get angry, and they may swarm out of the nest and attempt to climb into your clothes.

, If the boiling water effectively killed them, your ant-enduring days should be over. If you see a slow trickle coming back, give the nest another boiling water treatment. Sometimes it takes more than one application to effectively kill all of the ants.


If the boiling water doesn't seem to be doing the trick, take a stake and stab it down into the nest. Wiggle it around until you have a fair-sized crater. Fill the crater with baking soda about halfway up and pour vinegar over it.
If you're trying to kill red ants, you can also try what is known as ""bucketing."" Wearing pants tucked into long socks for protection, take a shovel and quickly shovel the fire ant mound into a large bucket that has been sprinkled with baking soda, which keeps the ants from climbing out. Keep going until the whole nest has been shoveled out. Drown the ants in vinegar and water or with boiling water., Sometimes it's difficult to access the entire nest, but you can usually find an entrance hole. You can pour boiling water into the entrance hole, but it's often just as effective to simply plug the hole. Fill it up with dirt or rocks, and sprinkle some boric acid around the site for good measure. The ants will likely relocate their nest.

Make a line that ants won't cross.,
Squirt lemon juice along outdoor edges.,
Use essential oils to keep ants away.,
Keep your surfaces clean so ants aren't interested in coming in.,
Seal your house to keep them out.",How to Kill Ants without Pesticides4," There are several natural substances that ants abhor so much, they won't go near them. If you use one of these substances to create lines around your windowsills, around the perimeter of your house, and in any spots where ants are getting inside, you can keep ants from coming inside. Freshen up the lines every few days, since ants will be able to get through once the lines are broken. Here are substances that work for this purpose:Cinnamon
Cayenne pepper
Ground orange or lemon peels
Coffee grounds

, This will keep the inside of your house from getting sticky, but the ants will be deterred by a strong citrus smell. You can also squirt a solution of half lemon juice, half water around the outside of your house.

, They hate the smell of a variety of essential oils, many of which smell very pleasant to humans. Add 10 drops of essential oil to 1 cup of water, then spray the solution both indoors and outdoors to keep ants away. Here are the oils you can try:


Lemon oil
Peppermint oil
Eucalyptus oil (don't use this near cats! It's toxic to them, but not to dogs)
Lavender oil
Cedar oil

, During the spring months, when ants are most likely to come inside the house, do your best to keep your floors, countertops, and cabinets spotless. This goes a long way toward keeping ants out. If they don't smell food, they won't be interested in invading your house.


Keep food containers tightly sealed, too. This is especially important for sugar, honey, syrup and other foods that ants like to eat.
Clean up spills right away, especially fruit juice or syrup spills.

, If you don't give ants a door inside, they'll be more likely to stick to outdoor areas. Find all the little cracks and crevices where they could be getting in, like under the door, around the windowsills, and in other little cracks in the foundation. Fill the holes with caulk or other sealants to keep your house airtight. Spritz the areas with lavender or lemon water for good measure.

Make beer traps.,
Try using copper.,
Sprinkle crushed egg shells.,
Use coffee.,
Encourage snail predators.,
Use diatomaceous earth.,
Use other deterrents.",How to Get Rid of Snails1," One of the most well-known and effective ways to get rid of snails is to make beer traps. To make:


Place saucers, bowls or buckets (depending on the size of your problem!) of cheap, flat beer in your garden and leave overnight.






The snails will be attracted to the smell of the beer and climb into the saucer/bucket, where they will become intoxicated by the alcohol, fall in and drown.
If you aren't keen on wasting perfectly good beer on your garden snails, you can also make similar traps using grape juice or water mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and a tablespoon of sugar.;
, Copper is used by many gardeners to repel snails and slugs. You can use copper in one of two ways:


You can buy copper tape at a plant nursery and wind it around the perimeter of your vegetable patch or flower bed, or you can simple sprinkle copper pennies around the base of the plants you are trying to protect.
Copper repels snails due to a reaction between the metal and the mucous (or slime) produced by the snail as it moves. This sends the snail an unpleasant electro-neural signal, which basically feels like an electric shock., Another effective method many gardeners use to repel snails and slugs is to sprinkle crushed egg shells on the earth surrounding the vulnerable plants.


The egg shells have sharp edges which feel unpleasant under the snails' soft bodies, so they will avoid climbing over them to get to the plants.






This is a particularly green way of repelling snails, as the egg shells contain plenty of calcium which nourishes your soil., Studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have shown that coffee is extremely effective at repelling and killing snails and slugs, It can be used in one of two ways:


You can place cooled coffee in a spray bottle and use it to spritz plants, leaves, soil and even the snails themselves.






Alternatively, you can sprinkle coffee grounds around the base of the plants you wish to protect from snails. This will also help to enrich the soil.







, One way to discourage snails is to encourage other garden creatures who snack on snails.


These include toads and frogs, who you can invite into your garden using ceramic toad houses. Turtles, garter snakes and salamanders are also believed to enjoy snails, in addition to most birds (especially robins).
Allow ducks and chickens to roam your garden. Ducks and chickens will also eat snails and slugs, and they are actually quite nutritious for them. However, ducks and chickens might trample or eat the plants as well, so be careful with this one!

, Diatomaceous earth is great solution for getting rid of snails. Just be sure to buy the non-toxic, food grade version.


Diatomaceous earth is a type of powdered rock made from the fossils of tiny sea organisms. It has very fine, sharp edges which is harmful to the snails' soft bodies.
Diatomaceous earth can be sprinkled on the soil surrounding plants and flower beds. However, it becomes much less effective when wet, so a fresh layer will need to be reapplied after watering your plants or following rainfall., The list of items people use to kill or deter snails goes on and on. Some other popular substances include:


Powdered ginger, talcum powder, ashes from burnt wood or lime. Lint from a clothes dryer can be used to deter snails, in addition to animal hair or fur.
Pick them up and move them. Moving snails just 20 feet (6.1 m) away from your garden has shown to be just as effective as termination .

Remove moisture indoors.,
Resort to pesticides only after trying other measures.,
Apply pesticide to the perimeter and to cracks and crevices.,
Treat outdoor hiding places.,

Raise chickens.,Consider buying a Millipede catcher for catching them, however you will need to dispose of them once you have caught them.",How to Get Rid of Millipedes," Dethatch and mow your lawn as often as necessary to keep the grass short and healthy. Long grass makes a good hiding place for millipedes.


Long grass and areas with dense thatch can become very moist, so trimming your lawn can help dry the area out. Millipedes cannot live long in dry areas, so they will naturally migrate away from a dry lawn.
When you water your lawn, do so in the morning instead of the evening. Millipedes become active at night, so the lawn has an opportunity to dry out before that time if you water it in the morning.;
, Piles of dead leaves or similar debris should be removed completely. Other hiding places that actually offer some benefit to your lawn, like mulch, should be arranged so that the organic matter does not rest too close to your home's foundation.


Common hiding places include trash piles, rocks, boards, leaves, mulch, and compost.As a general rule, if the debris serves no practical purpose, you are better off getting rid of it completely. If it does have some benefit, though, you should at least remove the material from around the perimeter of your home and further back in the yard.
Eliminating decaying organic matter can also eliminate food sources for these pests, which will further discourage them away from your home.
Make sure that any mulch you do lay is only 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) deep, at most, and at least 2 to 3 feet (60.96 to 91.44 cm) away from the foundation of your home.
All shrubbery should be pruned in the spring so that air can circulate in between the plants, thereby creating drier conditions.

, Check your rain gutters to make sure that they direct rain and other precipitation away from your home as much as possible.


If you have a big problem with moisture and millipedes, use extended gutters to divert the rainwater as far away from your house as possible.Check for conditions around your house that could be causing moisture to pour into a cellar or basement. For example, if your house sits at the bottom of a hill, rainwater may naturally flow back in. You will need to take extra steps to secure and waterproof your foundation if this is the case, and you may even need to call a basement professional to do the job right.
On a similar note, you should also cap off any sprinkler heads that spray water near your home's foundation.

, Apply weather stripping to your doors and windows. If you notice any cracks in the foundation or walls of your home, repair them. Taking these measures will make it nearly impossible for millipedes to find their way inside.


Doors and windows should fit tightly. If any do not, install weather stripping to fix the matter.
Inspect the perimeter of your home for cracks and crevices. Fill these gaps with caulk to block the millipedes' passageway into your home.
Check the weather stripping around your home at night. Use a flashlight and two people. One person should stand on the outside while the other stands inside. As one person shines a flashlight along the perimeter of the closed door and windows, the other looks for light leaks coming through to the other side. If you spot any light leaks, you need to redo your weather stripping.
Some millipedes can even crawl through vents. To prevent this from happening, install screens on the outside of each vent space.

, If you do spot millipedes inside your home, you can usually get rid of them by simply sweeping them away with a broom or vacuum cleaner.


For extremely large infestations, consider swapping out your standard vacuum cleaner for an industrial shop vac. Check with local hardware stores about renting a shop vac for temporary use so that you do not need to buy one.

, If millipedes are attracted to your house, you might have a problem with excess moisture. Use a dehumidifier to help draw this excess moisture out of the air and discourage the millipedes from staying as a result.


Pay special attention to the subfloor crawl space and basement, if your house has these areas.These spaces are usually among the most damp, so if millipedes are entering your home, it might be through these locations.
Note that millipedes will not survive long in a dry home, even if they do find their way inside. Usually, these insects will not breed and will die within 24 hours after getting trapped inside as long as the conditions are not excessively moist.
Both dehumidifiers and air conditioners can help draw moisture out of the air, but in really damp areas of the house, they may not be enough. In extremely wet conditions, even multiple dehumidifiers may not do the trick.
To check on whether or not moisture is a big problem in your living space, place hygrometers in the most moist areas of the house. These are tools that measure the humidity in a given area. If the hygrometer indicates that a space has a humidity at 50 percent or higher, the area is damp enough to invite millipedes and allow them to thrive.

, If you do not make your yard and home as unwelcoming to millipedes as possible, chemical control will not help you much and will only offer temporary relief. On the other hand, if you have done all you can in terms of physical removal and exclusion and the problem still persists, chemical control can help you put an end to the infestation.


Also note that many chemical pesticide powders do not work well when applied in moist areas, so removing moisture from the area is crucial to the effectiveness of the pesticide.

, Use a residual pesticide around areas you suspect millipedes to gather in. When the pests cross over these insecticides, the chemicals get onto their feet and gradually kills them.


If you have filled in all known cracks with caulk, then you only need to apply residual pesticides around the building's foundation and around all the doors and windows.
Make sure that the pesticide you choose is known to be effective against millipedes. Active ingredients worth looking for include propoxur, cyfluthrin, pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, amorphous silica gel, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, hexa-hydroxyl, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin.

, If you know where the millipedes gather outside, you can mix an outdoor pesticide into the soil or debris there. The chemicals will eventually get inside the millipedes and poison them that way.


Apply outdoor pesticides primarily to mulched flower beds and heavily thatched areas of turf.
When treating outdoor areas like mulch, make sure that you use enough water to help the poison penetrate the ground cover. Alternatively, rake the ground cover back before applying the spray so that the chemical gets deep enough into the soil to find its way to spot the millipedes are gathering in.
Make sure that the pesticide you choose is known to be effective against millipedes. Active ingredients worth looking for include propoxur, cyfluthrin, pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, amorphous silica gel, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, hexa-hydroxyl, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin.

, If you cannot sweep or vacuum the millipedes when you see them, you could spray them with a contact spray, instead. Contact sprays kill quickly.


Directly spray millipedes with contact spray on an on-sight basis.
Make sure that the pesticide you choose is known to be effective against millipedes. Active ingredients worth looking for include propoxur, cyfluthrin, pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, amorphous silica gel, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, hexa-hydroxyl, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin.

, If the problem is really out of your control, call a pest control professional to take care of the matter for you. Professionals have access to chemicals that are more potent and more effective.

When sold for pest control purposes, diatomaceous earth is often labeled as ""DE"" or ""roach powder.""
This natural pest control product is made of fossilized diatoms, which are very small, very sharp granules. When a millipede or any other insect crosses over the DE, the insect gets pierced and cut all over, and these cuts eventually cause the bug to die from dehydration.

, This product should be spread in the same manner as diatomaceous earth. Apply it to all problem areas, including cracks, crevices, and damp spots inside the home.


Boric acid is also made of tiny granules that can cut and dehydrate millipedes. In addition to that, however, it is also a stomach poison, so it will kill the millipedes from the inside if it does not first kill them from the outside.

, For an outdoor treatment, mix a few handfuls of dry wood ash into the soil around your home, especially if this soil is fairly damp. The wood ash should help dry out the rest of the soil.


Focus on soil and mulch around the foundation.
Millipedes live in, thrive in, and lay their eggs in moist soil. If you dry the soil out well enough using wood ash, the insects will naturally find the area unappealing and stay away.
You can make this treatment even more effective by disturbing the soil with a rake or hoe after applying the wood ash.

, If you have the space, energy, time, and resources, consider raising chickens on your property. Chickens are a rather unconventional method of getting rid of millipedes, but they are a natural predator and can keep your millipede population under control for the duration of their lives.


Chickens have a rather large appetite; a few chickens can take care of most moderate infestations.
Only consider this option if you are zoned to care for chickens and if you know that you are ready for the responsibility of caring for chickens.

Recognize poison ivy.,
Treat poison ivy as a native plant of great wildlife value.,
Consider pulling the plants out.,
Keep your distance when pulling out the plants.,
Be aware that the roots contain rash-causing oils too.,
Wear long pants, long sleeve shirt or get a slicker set that would be worn only for poison ivy work.,
Put down large pieces of cardboard.,
Overlap with plastic past the cardboard.,
Dump deep soils or light rocks to hold covers down.,
Wash all clothing, gloves and shoes isolated from other items three times.,
Wash up with Tecnu Extreme.,
Opt to use an herbicide to kill the plants.,
On a day that is not windy or about to rain, spray thoroughly, to coat all poison ivy leaves with the solution.,
Wearing gloves, as the roots can also produce poison ivy's characteristic effect, dig down into the soil at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) and remove all of the roots.,
Smother the area where the poison ivy was growing.,
Check the area several times a year and take steps to kill the poison ivy.,
Be absolutely vigilant as to which part of clothing the plant touches on you, such as your pants, gloves, etc.,
Wait to use soap and water until after cleansing with rubbing alcohol, vinegar, mineral spirits or commercial cleanser.",How to Get Rid of Poison Ivy Plants," Poison ivy can be recognized as:


A vine with groups of three pointy leaves. – Remember the saying, ""Leaves of three, let it be.'
The middle leaf has a slightly longer petiole (stem) than the two leaves on the side.
The leaflets are larger at the base.
There are no thorns on the stem.
Berries, if present, are a grey-ish white. – ""Berries white, take fright.""
It has three distinct forms:

a vine that climbs trees – ""Hairy rope, don't be a dope.""
ground cover up to 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m)
large shrub – This form is mostly found on sandy dunes.


Leaves are green during summer, red during fall.
It can grow just about anywhere.
If you have trouble recognizing poison ivy, practice by taking the photo quiz at the end of How to Prevent Getting Poison Ivy or Poison Oak.;
, Humans and perhaps some other primates are the only known creature allergic to poison ivy.If it is not growing in an area where people walk, let it be.

, If you are not particularly allergic or know someone who is not, pulling poison ivy works great. Repeated pulling will likely be needed as some roots will have been missed.

,


Wear long sleeved shirt, pants, boots, long, heavy duty rubber gloves.
Use long handled garden tools to handle the plant. Never touch any part of the plant with your gloved hands. The more distance between your skin and the plant, the better!
When up rooting, chop long roots and vines into short sections, lift with a ""reacher"" and deposit into a trash can lined with a plastic bag. (You can buy a ""reacher"" at some drug stores that carry medical supplies.)
Pull up roots only with long handled pliers, again in short sections. Long sections of vine will bounce around and eventually tap your face or other exposed skin.

, If you really need to remove or work in sites with ivy, follow these steps to cover.

, Eye protection and hand protection are required.

, The boxes appliances come in are ideal; use these to walk on, over the patch.Those may be free from a local store but you have to ask to get them before they do their recycling.

, Use U-shaped landscape anchor pins and a sheet of 4 ml black plastic. This is sold in small to large rolls. Have one piece to cover, if possible. The pins must be close together and plastic should be bigger than the area you are covering.

, Consider concrete edging or rocks to reduce the likelihood of vine escape. Put pots of flowers if you want some color in the spot.

, Tools also can be contaminated. Tecnu lotion or other remover should help. Oils last a year on most items.

, Shower. Repeat the Tecnu wash three times or more.

,


A natural herbicide that works is St Gabriel Labs' Poison Ivy Defoliant®, which is made from plant oils.
Another solution is to use a glyphosphate-based herbicide to kill the plants, such as Roundup™, Kleenup™, or a specific poison ivy killer.
Mix the concentrate herbicide with water, three times the normal strength. Don't use ready-mixed herbicide, as it's not strong enough to destroy poison ivy.
Put the herbicide concentrate (or other brand) in a sprayer, like an empty window cleaner sprayer. Read the instructions on the herbicide label. Label the sprayer and keep this sprayer for only this purpose, in a safe place.

,


Wear long pants, long-sleeve shirts, plastic gloves over cotton, socks, and fully enclosed shoes or boots.
Try not to get solution on any other plants, or they will die too. Plants take the herbicide in through their leaves, then the plant dies.
For poison ivy high in trees, cut the vine off 6 inches above the ground and treat the stump with the glyphosate after cutting. Spray any leaves that re-sprout.
If it keeps coming back on the ground, look for it up in some nearby trees. It will keep reseeding itself as long as you don't get the parent vine.
The poison ivy should turn yellow and die in a couple of weeks.

, This will help prevent future regrowth. Be sure to go right to the end where the roots are growing.Make sure you keep your gloves on when digging, or you will get a rash, as even dead stalks can give you the rash from urushiol. Wearing a mask and safety glasses is also a good idea.Pick up the roots wearing gloves and use plastic bags to stuff the roots into for removal by garbage collection.
Use a hoe for stubborn or difficult root removal.

, Use cardboard, black plastic, newspaper, mulch, etc., to cover up the area where the poison ivy grew to prevent its regrowth.,


Do this for several years, because where there is poison ivy, there is probably more you haven't seen yet.
Poison ivy is very persistent; it will come back from roots that are not killed or removed. It may be necessary to spray the vines two or more times to succeed in removing it completely. Watch for seedlings dispersed by birds carrying the seeds.

, When removing your clothes later, be sure to use clean gloves and drop it all right into your washing machine. Wash these clothes separately.

, The initial cleanser will remove the poison ivy irritant.

Gather your potting supplies.,
Pot your fern.,
Place your fern outdoors in a warm, humid environment.,
Put your Boston fern in an appropriate room indoors.,
Provide your fern with indirect sunlight.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Give your fern monthly feedings.,
Trim discolored or leafless fronds.,
Protect your fern from insects.",How to Care for Boston Ferns," Boston ferns will do best in a potting mixture of peat moss, sand, and garden soil. You can buy all of these at your local gardening store. Your final mixture should be even parts of each ingredient.The pot should be big enough for your fern to sit comfortably without it's roots being near the drainage holes, but without a lot of extra space that could accumulate ""root rot."", Put your mixture and plant into the clean pot with drainage holes in the bottom.The fern can be planted about half of the way to the top of the pot so that the roots have space in the soil. Fill in the rest of the pot with more potting mixture, leaving about 1 inch( 25.4 mm) of space from the top., In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors.You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well.


The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing.

, If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night.If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates.

, Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance., Just like sunlight, you want to provide your Boston fern with enough water, but not too much. Water it with lukewarm water so that the soil is completely damp but not soaked. During warm weather months, you’ll need to water it more frequently. Make sure that the soil is never completely dry.In the wintertime, the fern is not in “growing season.” You can be less vigilant about watering it, and it's actually good to let the soil become dry to the touch before watering again. As new growth appears, start watering the fern more often so that the soil is continuously damp.

, Boston ferns don’t require much, but it is helpful to feed them monthly during the warmer months. Purchase houseplant food at your local gardening supply store. Read the instructions on the packaging, and dilute it so that it is half as strong for your fern.


During the winter months, you can skip these feedings.

, Fronds are the branch-like pieces that extend from the plant, covered in leaves. Older leaves may become discolored or lose their leaves, which isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing. Use sharp, clean scissors to remove the fronds all the way at the base. This will allow new, healthy fronds to grow.The best time to prune your Boston fern is in the spring or summer, during growing season.

, Luckily, Boston ferns aren’t typically a target for insects, but they can occasionally attract bugs. Don’t use anything too harsh on your fern. Spray it with a mild insecticide or a natural insect repellant, and observe. Hopefully, this will be all you need to control any potential pests."

Change your watering schedule.,
Frequently till the soil.,
Clear any debris from under plants.,
Use landscaping materials like wood chips and gravel.,
Grow plants that repel snails.,
Hand pick the snails from your plants.",How to Get Rid of Snails2," Snails prefer moist earth, as it is easier for them to travel over and they can move faster.


Simply by watering your plants in the morning, instead of late afternoon or evening, you will ensure that the soil is slightly dried out by the time night falls.
This makes it much harder for the snails to get around, and can actually reduce their presence by up to 80%., Frequently tilling the soil around your plants and flower beds using a rake or cultivator fork is a good idea, as it will kill off any snail eggs in the soil. This can significantly reduce future snail populations.

, Snails like to hide in any nooks and crannies they can find, so clear away debris from underneath plants and flowers. This will leave the snails more exposed, and therefore less inclined to make a home there.

, Certain landscaping materials, such as wood chips, gravel and sand, are difficult for snails to climb over, and can deter them from making a home in your garden., Certain flowers, plants and herbs are believed to be unappealing to snails, so think about introducing them to your garden. These include flowers such as freesias, daylilies, azaleas, foxglove, tansy and hibiscus, and herbs such as mint, rosemary, fennel, parsley and basil., One time-consuming but surefire method of removing snails from your garden is to physically pick them off your plants by hand. The best time to do this is in the early morning or late evening, as this is when they will be most active.


There are two ways of dealing with snails once you've picked them. You can either crush them immediately, or you can place them in a bucket and transport them to another location - somewhere away from your plants!
A faster way of hand picking the snails is to place upside-down ceramic pots in your garden and leave them overnight. The snails will gather underneath it, so in the morning you'll be able to catch many of them in one go.

Use metaldehyde.,
Use iron phosphate.,
Make garlic spray.",How to Get Rid of Snails3," Metaldehyde is a natural compound which is used as a pesticide for killing snails, slugs and other gastropods. It is highly effective, however it is also toxic, so it should not be used in home gardens where pets such as cats or dogs are allowed to roam freely, or where it runs the risk of being consumed by small children., Iron phosphate is a molluscicide used for killing slugs and snails. It is the main ingredient in commercial slug repellents (such as Sluggo Plus) and as it is only harmful to slugs and snails, it is a much better option for people with children and pets., Crush garlic and mix with water. Leave for a few hours to allow the garlic to ""marinate"". Add to a water spray can and spray your flowers, plants and herbs for a natural slug and snail repellent."
"
Find an area with full sun to light shade to plant your gardenias.,
Test the pH levels of the soil to determine if the Gardenia will actually thrive when planted.,
Dig a hole in the soil the size of the gardenia's root ball.,
Set the gardenia's root ball in the hole.,
Fill the remainder of the hole with soil once the water has drained.",How to Care for Gardenias1," Unlike most plants, gardenias are delicate and picky about their environment.








Gardenias thrive in partial shade, high humidity, and an even supply of moisture and nutrients.Though they can be grown indoors, the hot, dry air and gloomy winter days can send the gardenia into a downward spiral.
Ideal seasons to plant gardenias are during Spring or Fall, when there is the perfect amount of sun without too high a heat.Flower buds will fail to form if day temperatures are higher than 70 °F (21 °C), if night temperatures exceed 65 °F (18 °C), or if they fall below 60 °F (16 °C) at night.Keep in mind that gardenias cannot stand to winter outdoors. You must bring them inside for the winter.;
, pH is a measurement of how acidic the soil is, and too high an acidity will not sustain a gardenia root.









Acidity is measured on a scale from 0-14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 being the most basic. Gardenias prefer acidic soil, so a pH level of 4.5 to 5.5 would be optimal since it is only moderately acidic.If necessary, add sulfur — a white powder that can be bought at most garden or home improvement stores — to help lower pH levels that are higher than 6.
The soil itself should also be rich and well-drained. Gardenias require plenty of nutrients but their roots may die if over-watered., Make sure the hole is 2-3 times wider, as you will pack it with dirt once the root ball is planted.









A root ball is the mass formed by the roots of a plant and the soil surrounding them.
If your soil is in poor condition, add a small amount of compost to the hole before laying the root ball down. Compost is organic fertilizer and will add nutrients that your soil may be deficient in.
Carefully choose where to plant the shrubs. By planting close to your house, you can enjoy the scent of the blooms from a deck or through an open window. But too close may mean that the soil pH may become too high for the plants to thrive.
Also keep in mind that gardenias need a lot of light, but can't tolerate heat. Perhaps opt to plant near a bedroom window rather than a kitchen window.

, Make sure the top of your gardenia’s root ball is above the surface. Fill the hole half full with soil and water it.









Doing this will help to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets. You want your gardenia's roots to fit snugly into the soil so that it can absorb plenty of water and nutrients.
If you intend on planting multiple gardenias, be sure that you leave 3–6 feet (0.9–1.8 m) between each root ball. The gardenia plant can grow anywhere from 2–8 feet (0.6–2.4 m) both tall and wide.Planting too closely can result in overcrowding or competition between roots for water and nutrients.

, Pack the soil gently around the root ball so that it is slightly loose. Water thoroughly.

Find a wide, squat pot.,
Consider a humidity tray.,
Fill with well-draining soil.,
Plant your bamboo at a shallow depth.,
Water your bamboo carefully.,
Keep it humid.,
Find the right light level for your species.,
Fertilize your bamboo plant.,
Prune regularly.,
Re-pot or divide when the bamboo outgrows its container.,
Find the cause of leaf drop.,
Fix curling or drooping leaves.,
Respond to yellow leaves.,
Respond to insects and disease.",How to Care for an Indoor Bamboo Plant," Choose a container with twice the diameter of the root ball, or with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space between the root ball and the sides. Good drainage is key to the survival of most bamboo species, so make sure there are sizeable holes in the base of the pot.Line the container with plastic root barrier if it is cement (which can damage bamboo) or wood (which lasts longer if protected from moisture).;
, Bamboo loves humidity, which can make indoor growing a challenge. Keeping water under the bamboo without letting it soak the roots is the easiest way to add moisture to the air. There are two ways to set this up:Pebble tray
1. Fill a tray with a layer of pebbles.
2. Add a shallow layer of water to the tray.
3. Place the pot on top of the pebbles, without touching the water.

Gravel
1. Put a layer of gravel in the bottom of the pot.
2. Place the pot in a shallow tray of water.

, Bamboo needs a soil with light to moderate density: fast-draining, but able to hold moisture. You can use a standard potting mix, or make your own from ⅓ loam, ⅓ perlite (or washed sand), and ⅓ peat moss (or well-rotted compost).Most bamboo can tolerate a wide range of well-draining soils, so the exact composition won't make or break your plants.You can use decent quality soil from your garden instead of potting soil. Avoid heavy clay soil, which drains poorly and is difficult to improve.
Bamboo tends to do best in slightly acidic soil, with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, but most species tolerate a pH up to 7.5.Most soil falls into this range.

, Keep the stem and the top of the root ball above the level of the soil to prevent rot.Press the soil down to get rid of air bubbles, and water in the plant with a good soak.If your bamboo came rootbound, cut it out at the edge of the pot with a clean knife. It's probably had trouble getting water, so soak the root ball (but not the stem) for 20 minutes before planting., This is the most difficult part of growing bamboo indoors, since bamboo is both thirsty and vulnerable to overwatering.To start out, water until a little water runs out the base. Let the top 2 or 3 inches (5–7.5 cm) of soil dry out before each watering session. If the soil stays moist for more than a day or two, reduce the amount of water.If the top of the soil is drying out quickly, dig down to 4 inches (10 cm) deep to check for moisture. This depth should stay lightly moist most of the time, especially during the first three months after planting., Most bamboo plants prefer humid air, especially in hot weather.As long as you avoid overwatering, any one of the following should keep your plant happy:


Place the pot over a humidity tray, as described in the planting section above.
Lightly mist the leaves with a spray bottle every couple days.Run a humidifier in the room.
Keep plants close together (but be aware this increases the risk of disease).

, If you know the species name of your bamboo, look it up to find specific recommendations. If your plant needs more light than your climate provides, install evening grow lights. If you don't know the species, start with these rules of thumb:Needs more light:
–plants with small leaves
–tropical species
–plants kept in warm rooms

Needs less light:
–plants with large leaves
–temperate species during dormant winter periods
–plants kept in cool rooms

, Bamboo grows quickly as long as it has room in the container, and needs extra nutrients to support this growth.A dose of slow-release fertilizer at the beginning of the growing season is a good way to provide a steady supply.You can use a balanced fertilizer such as 16-16-16, or a high nitrogen (N) fertilizer such as 30-10-10. The high nitrogen option discourages flowering, which weakens many bamboo species.Warning:
–Do not fertilize within 6 months of buying. Most plants get enough fertilizer from the nursery.–Avoid seaweed-based fertilizers due to excessive salt content., Most bamboo is very tolerant of pruning, so don't hesitate to shape it once it is established and healthy:Cut withered, stunted, or excess stems (culms) at soil level.
To prevent a stem from growing above a certain height, cut it just above a node (branching point).
Thin branches regularly if you want to encourage vertical growth.
Remove lower branches for aesthetics.

, Bamboo can grow in two different patterns depending on species. ""Runners"" send out long shoots to start new plants, and will spiral around a large container within three to five years. ""Clumpers"" grow steadily outward, and may last up to six years in the same pot. Any bamboo plant needs a transplant to a larger pot once it becomes rootbound.To restrict growth, instead dig up the plant, cut away about ⅓ of the roots, and replant in the same container with fresh potting mix.You can propagate most bamboo plants by cutting the stalks and replanting in separate containers. This does not work on bamboo with no hole in the center of the stalks, or only a very small hole., It is fairly common for a bamboo plant to lose a lot of leaves when moved indoors or transplanted. As long as the new leaves at the ends of branches look healthy, the plant should recover. If those leaves drop or look unhealthy, a couple months outdoors (if climate allows) can help recovery.If your plant has been in the same place for a while, look into other possible causes:


Temperate species often drop leaves during low-light conditions. A cool, low-light dormant period in winter is good for these plants, and reduces leaf drop. The fewer green leaves there are, the less water the plant needs.Many species drop leaves in spring (or less commonly, fall), gradually replacing them with new ones. If there's a mix of green leaves, yellow leaves, and new, unfurling leaves, the plant is probably fine., If the sides of the leaves roll inward, the plant needs watering. (Photosynthesis consumes water, so the plant is reducing it by avoiding sunlight.) If the leaves droop downward, the plant is overwatered, or the soil is not draining fast enough.Overwatering is more dangerous than under-watering. Waiting to water until the leaves curl slightly will usually not harm the plant.

, If your bamboo is turning yellow outside of the dormant season, this could mean several different things:


If they look dry and the tips are brown or curling upward, the plant needs more water. It may be rootbound and in need of a larger pot.Leaves that slowly become paler and more yellow usually have a nutrient deficiency. Add fertilizer with added minerals.A sudden color change after fertilizing points to over-fertilizing. Treat this problem by removing any remaining fertilizer and watering abundantly to leach out the excess minerals.

, Indoor bamboo plants are more vulnerable to these problems, especially if there is low air flow in the room. If there is a light insect infestation, wash the leaves with insecticidal soap, or spray it outdoors with an insecticide spray.If this doesn't work, or if you think the plant has a disease, try to identify it and respond:


A black ""sooty"" mold is usually caused by insects. Remove aphids and ants.Circular fungus rings or grey/brown scale usually do not harm the plant. An anti-fungus treatment from a garden store can remove it.Wet, rotting patches are a sign of overwatering, but may be helped along by infestations. Dry them out and treat with insecticide or fungicide.Sticky white webbing may hide bamboo mites or other insects. Spray it off and apply insecticide.
There are over 1,000 species of bamboo, so no one guide will cover all problems. If your plant has a disease that doesn't match the description above, consult a local garden center or university agricultural extension about disease in your area.

Repeat every few feet.,
Check daily and remove slugs and snails that have been attracted to the jar and dispose of them.,
Renew the mixture regularly.",How to Get Rid of Slugs and Snails With Yeast," The jar must be deep enough to keep the slugs and snails from crawling out. You can also buy containers (traps) designed specifically for this purpose at garden supply stores.A suggested mixture is two cups of warm water, a packet of dry yeast, and one teaspoonful each of salt and sugar. The salt will help ensure that the slugs and snails die before they have a chance to escape. If you're going to dump the slugs and/or mixture in your garden or compost pile, skip the salt; it'll make your soil too salty., This is best done in the vegetable patch or other garden space where the slugs and snails are patrolling.

, Put these traps throughout your garden at intervals of six to eight feet, since the yeast won't draw them in from any further than that.

, They will have crawled into the jar and drowned. You can leave them in the garden to decompose and contribute to the organic matter of the soil, or put them in a compost pile (either way, crushing them will hasten the process, if you are not squeamish about doing so).

, It doesn't need a lot of watering. Too much watering can bring about root rot but too dry and the leaves will shrivel and turn yellow.

, However, if you don't remember, it'll still thrive. A standard liquid fertiliser is appropriate.

, Otherwise, don't worry about it. It's really only an aesthetics issue.

, Rather than trying to keep the plant flourishing after flowering, it's recommended that you take cuttings from it and grow new ones for the next year. And so on, for as long as you like. Cuttings should be placed in a soil-based compost.

Set the air plant near an east-, west- or south-facing window if possible but not in direct sunlight.,
Use a fluorescent lamp to provide additional light.",How to Care for Air Plants1," Air plants have tiny silver discs or scales all over their leaves. If you look closely at an air plant in bright light, you will see the discs shimmering. These discs absorb moisture and nutrients for the plant.;
, Spray a fine mist until the water drips from the leaves. Use room-temperature water to avoid stress that would be caused by cold tap water. Cold stress could cause the leaves to turn brown and brittle.Mist them in the morning so they will be dry or nearly dry by the end of the day.
Water them less often in the winter during their dormant season.

, They can also be watered by soaking the entire air plant in a sink or bowl of water for 30 minutes once a week. With this method, the air plants should be shaken gently after soaking to remove excess water., If the air plant’s leaves curl or roll up, it is not being watered often enough and has become too dry. Soak it in a bowl of room-temperature water overnight. Take it out of the water the next morning, shake it off and put it back in its place.


Mist it or soak it more often to prevent it from drying out again.

, It can be set directly in front of the window if a sheer curtain is hung between the plant and window.The optimum amount of light will result in a vigorous air plant with healthy green or gray-green leaves. Inadequate light will cause slow growth and pale leaves. Excessive light will turn the leaves tan, dry and brittle.

, This is particularly helpful if there isn't a bright, sunny window in the house. Use a special fluorescent bulb designed for plants that provides full spectrum light. Set the light up so that the bulb is 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) above the air plant and leave it on for 12 to 18 hours each day, depending on how much natural light it receives.


The light should be turned on in the morning around sunrise and turned off 12 to 18 hours later.

Cover your gardenias with a blanket or cardboard box during winter cold snaps.",How to Care for Gardenias2," Gardenias typically require an inch of rain in order to thrive, so adhere to that standard whenever watering.









Monitor the soil frequently for moisture content, and water thoroughly as the top inch of the soil dries. Avoid over-watering the soil especially, because if it is kept too wet, the roots will be starved for air., Mulch is made of decayed organic matter, such as leaves, bark, or compost and can be purchased at most gardening stores.









Mulch not only enriches soil, it will keep your soil moist, reduce the growth of weeds, and maintain a constant soil temperature.
For the best outcome, select a mulch made of wood chips, sawdust, or ground bark.
Applying mulch is extremely important since gardenia roots are shallow, making them especially vulnerable to weeds., Biannual fertilizing will promote healthy flower growth in your gardenia.









Be sure that you feed with acid fertilizer. The nutrients in this particular fertilizer are formulated for plants which prefer acidic soil. Applying regular fertilizer may not be sufficient for sustaining your gardenia.
Beware of over-fertilizing, as this can lead to damaging salt accumulation.

, Now that you have taken steps to provide adequate sunlight, soil, and water, you will need to meet the gardenia's humidity requirements.









Spraying with water raises the humidity around the plant, but only temporarily. Therefore, it must be done daily in order to ensure that the gardenia survives.Other than spraying, you could plant gardenias in clusters without overcrowding them. This will create a pocket of humidity. To increase the humidity even further, you could place a dish of water in the middle of the cluster. As the water evaporates, it will cover the surrounding gardenias.

, Deadhead after flowering to encourage more flowering.









Pruning younger, dormant gardenias will cause more prolific blooming. The young plant is very resilient and will easily repair lost stems because it is not yet actively growing.Remove scraggly branches and faded flowers. Gardenias are woody shrubs, so remove older, woody stems to encourage the growth of new branches.
Prune the lowest branches which are in danger of touching the ground. This can lead to infections.Don't cut all the leaves off. Some leaves need to be left so the plant can still produce food for the root system., These insects are especially attracted to gardenias and can impair growth or cause the plant to die.









Mealybugs are grey, segmented pests. They feed on the sap of the gardenia and leave behind a waxy coating on the plant. This can result in twig death, impair plant growth, and cause leaves to drop prematurely.
White flies are tiny white insects which resemble small gnats. They produce honeydew and the black sooty mold which grows on it. This mold can cause gardenia leaves to turn yellow and drop prematurely., These solutions will kill both mealybugs and white flies and are available in most local gardening stores.









If you are facing a large mealybug infestation, smother the gardenia with a good dose of insecticidal soap or horticulture oil. Two days after the first pass of insecticidal soap, cover the soil judiciously with a helpful fungus called Beauveria bassiana to kill any mealybugs that feed on roots. Beauveria bassiana is also available in most gardening/home improvement stores.

, Since gardenias are extremely cold sensitive, they will require adequate insulation and protection from harsh winter winds.









Secure a cardboard box large enough to cover the shrub without bending the branches. Use old blankets, straw, or bubble wrap to insulate the plant while it is under the cardboard box.Despite your best efforts, the tips of the branches may die and turn black from frost or cold damage. When this happens, prune the branches a couple of inches below the damage with sharp pruning shears.
Alternatively, you could transplant your gardenia to a pot and bring it inside for the winter. Though your plant will face higher chances of bug infestation, there are steps you can take to better care for your gardenia indoors.

"
"
Place your gardenia in an area where it will receive half a day of direct sunlight.,
Water gardenias once per week and fertilize once in spring and again in summer.,
Use a humidifier to increase the humidity in the room.,
Prune gardenias in the spring to keep it a manageable size.,
Check for bug infestation frequently.",How to Care for Gardenias3," You could place it near a south-facing window.









This will be especially challenging if you brought the gardenia inside during winter, when sunlight is scarce. One option you could take would be to supplement what little sunlight the plant receives with a grow light.
The gardenia will also need to be in a room with a temperature of 55 °F (13 °C) during the day and 64 °F (18 °C) at night.Adjust your house's thermostat accordingly and monitor your Gardenias' growth.
Keep your plant free of drafts and never place a gardenia where it will receive direct force of hot hair from a furnace. The drying nature of the heat could cause your gardenia to literally fall to pieces.

, Remember to use acid fertilizer to promote healthier growth.


Also water your gardenia as needed. If you notice the top inch of the soil is dry to the touch, water until the soil is moderately moist.
Check the pH of the soil frequently to ensure it stays between 5 and 6. Use plant food specifically designed for blooming plants that prefer acidic soil. A formulation for azaleas will work well.

, This is especially crucial during the winter season.


As stated earlier, you could group your potted gardenias in a cluster around a dish of water to increase humidity. Be wary when misting your plants, however, since using direct water and a humidifier in tandem may cause fungus growth on your gardenias.
You could also place your gardenias roots directly onto a tray of pebbles and water. First, place a layer of pebbles across the tray and add water until the pebbles aren't quite covered. The pebbles will hold the plant above water so their roots don't become waterlogged. As the water evaporates, it will increase the moisture in the air around the plant., This will also encourage the flowers to bloom nicely.


It is best to prune after blooms have fallen. Cut away dead wood until you have reached your desired size.

, Now that your gardenias are indoors, they will attract many other bugs besides mealybugs and white flies.


Among the bugs to be on the lookout for are aphids, which are small, pear-shaped insects with long legs and antennae.These bugs can be treated with a solution of one-part liquid soap and one-part water. Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves. This treatment is also effective on mealybugs.Spider mites are small and often hard to see with the unaided eye. To check for spider mites, shake the gardenia gently over a white piece of paper. If you notice red, yellow, brown, or green specs, you may have spider mites.Treat these pests with neem oil, which is vegetable oil from the neem plant. It is available in most grocery or department stores.
Neem oil will also treat infestation of all the aforementioned bugs. If you find your gardenias have yellowing leaves despite these treatments, you may have root nematode infestation. Root nematodes are parasitic, microscopic worms which attack plants at the roots. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for this type of infestation."

Peat moss
Sand;
, These trees like soil that’s evenly moist, similar to the slight dampness of a wrung-out sponge, but not wet or soggy. Before watering, stick your finger into the soil. When the top inch (2.5 cm) of the soil is dry, water thoroughly with lukewarm water until the water drains through the holes in the bottom of the pot.


Allow all the excess water to drain through into the saucer below the pot. Empty the saucer when the water stops flowing.Even if it only happens once, severe drying can cause needles and branches to dry out, fall off, and never grow back.

, Norfolk Island pines need several hours of sunlight per day, but they do not like direct sunlight. A good location for this plant is in a room with lots of northeast- or northwest-facing windows.


You can also place these trees in rooms with south- or west-facing windows, but they must be shaded windows to protect the tree from direct sun.
Other great locations for a Norfolk Island pine include sunrooms and covered patios., In the spring, summer, and early fall, feed the Norfolk Island pine with a balanced fertilizer every two weeks. When the plant needs to be watered, add some liquid fertilizer to the water and feed the tree.


A balanced fertilizer is one with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium.
Norfolk Island pines do not need to be fed during dormant periods in late fall and winter.
To know when the growing phase starts up again, look for light green growth on the tips of the branches in spring., Like a sunflower that turns to face the light, a Norfolk Island pine will grow or lean toward light sources. To prevent the tree from growing irregularly and becoming lopsided, turn the pot a quarter turn every week.


Be careful not to jostle the tree too much when you turn the pot, as these trees don’t like to be moved., These trees do not like temperature extremes, and will not survive temperatures much below 35 F (2 C) or above 85 F (24 C). The ideal daytime temperature is about 65 F (16 C). The perfect nighttime temperature is slightly cooler, around 55 F (13 C).While these trees do like cooler nighttime temperatures, they do not like sudden changes. A shady corner in a sunroom is a good spot for this type of tree, since the nighttime temperature will naturally drop when the sun goes down.

, In their natural habitat, Norfolk Island pines grow in a tropical location by the ocean, so they like moist air. The ideal humidity for these trees is 50 percent. You can maintain that humidity by misting the tree daily with room-temperature water, or by installing a nearby humidifier.It’s especially important to provide additional humidity if you live in a cold or dry climate.

, This type of tree doesn’t require cosmetic pruning. The only pruning you should do is trimming to remove branches that die or tips that turn brown. Use sharp pruning shears to trim dead foliage.


When you prune a Norfolk Pine, you prevent the cut point from growing any more. So instead of encouraging new growth, pruning will force growth to occur elsewhere, and this will change the shape of the tree., Both cold and hot drafts can cause the needles to drop, so pick a location for your Norfolk Island pine that’s far from air intakes, fans, and heating and cooling vents.You should also keep the tree a safe distance from doors and windows that could let in drafts.

, The root system of the Norfolk Island pine is very fragile and can be easily damaged when the tree is moved. Do not move the tree unless you absolutely have to, and once you find an ideal location where the tree thrives, keep it there as long as possible.If you do have to move the tree, move it very carefully, and only short distances at a time.
Find a location for the tree where it won’t accidentally be moved, hit, knocked, or jostled.

, Repot the plant in spring every three or four years, when the roots become visible above the soil. Prepare the new pot by filling it halfway with your soil, sand, and peat moss mixture. Carefully dig the tree from the soil in its original pot, and place it into the new soil. Fill the pot the rest of the way and cover the root system with soil.


Each time you repot, pick a pot that’s one size larger than the current pot.
The pot should have good drainage holes in the bottom to allow excess water to escape.
While these trees don’t like being moved, it is necessary to repot them now and then to provide fresh soil and to accommodate the growing root system., Norfolk Island pines like moist soil, but they don’t do well with excessive watering. If the branches become limp or start turning yellow, water the tree less often.The tree only needs to be watered when the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil becomes dry.
The yellow needles may also drop if you're overwatering.

, Yellowing needles (not accompanied by limp branches) can be a sign that you aren't giving the tree enough water. Water the soil thoroughly when it dries out, and provide the tree with additional humidity.You can increase the humidity by misting the tree daily.

, Watch out for the lower branches turning brown and dropping off especially. This is a telltale sign that the tree isn't getting enough light.Move the tree closer to a northeast or northwest window, a shaded south or west window, or to a solarium.


Norfolk Island pines need lots of indirect sunlight.
If you cannot provide the tree with enough natural light, consider using a full-spectrum bulb that’s designed for plants.

, Dropping needles that don’t change color can be a sign of a few things, including too much or too little moisture. Often, it’s an indication of too little moisture. If the soil feels dry and you don’t water often, water the tree more frequently. If the soil is damp and you water often, cut back.


Dropping needles can also indicate that the tree is too close to a draft."

Pick a Pothos plant.,
Select a pot or container.,
Repot the plant, if needed.,
Choose a plant location.,
Keep the plant watered.,
Don't fertilize the plant.,
Prune the plant.,
Weather-proof the plant.",How to Care for a Pothos Plant," The easiest way to fail at houseplant care is to buy an already dying plant. When at the store, look for:


Broad, firm, green leaves
Firm but not rigid green stems
A firm root base
No leaves with white or yellow splotches - these may be disease marks
No mold anywhere, including the soil.;
, If you like the pot that the plant came in, skip this step. If you want a different pot, read on. When purchasing a new pot, think of where the pot will go. Consider weight, size, colour, breakability (will children be near it?), and so forth.

, See How to repot a plant for repotting details. Follow those instructions carefully.

, Where should a Pothos plant go? Pothos plants thrive in every light condition except total darkness and direct sunlight. Bathrooms, bedrooms, hallways, and so on, make excellent locations.

, Pothos plants need the soil to be just damp, not soaking. When you touch the soil with your finger, your finger should have dirt clinging to it but not have water on it. If there is no clinging - water it! If your finger is wet - hold off!

, Pothos plants do not require fertilization as they grow slowly and do not require much to do so.

, If your Pothos plant grows too big, use scissors to make a clean cut near a stem base, not below the soil line. Let the stub 'scab' over before you push it into the dirt to prevent disease.

, Pothos plants are usually kept indoors. If yours is an outdoor plant, bring it inside before the first frost and return it after you are certain that there will be no more.

Put your plant in a shallow container that has drain holes in the bottom.,
Place your plant in indirect sunlight.,
Hang your plant from the ceiling in a west or south facing room.,
Keep the room temperature between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit and a little humid.,
Water the prayer plant when the top of the potting soil is just starting to get dry.,
Use room-temperature water on the plant in the morning.,
Fertilize your prayer plant every two weeks from early spring through to the fall.,
Make your own potting mix for your plant.,
Only repot the prayer plant in the spring or summer if it becomes pot-bound.,
Divide the plant into smaller plants once it has been repotted.,
Trim your plants two to three times a year to help them grow more vigorously.",How to Care for a Prayer Plant," Prayer plants are shallow-rooted plants. So, if they are planted in a deep container with too much soil below its roots, the soil stays soggy for too long and they will develop root rot. If you are potting your plant, always use a container with drain holes so the water can drain from the roots and the soil.;
, You can hang or set your prayer plant near a window where it will get indirect sunlight. Never set your plant in direct sunlight as the sun will bleach the plant’s leaves.

, Find a corner where direct light cannot reach the plant and hang it so it gets proper light exposure and grows properly.


Proper light exposure results in a prayer plant with rich, green stems and colorful leaves.
If your plant does not get enough light, the stems will grow long and spindly as they will naturally reach for more light.

, As prayer plants are tropical plants, they do not thrive when temperatures dip too far below 70 °F (21 °C). Colder temperatures and dry air will cause the prayer plant’s leaves to shrivel and turn brown. Temperatures hotter than 75 °F (24 °C) can result in fewer leaves and long, spindly stems.


Increase the humidity in the room with a humidifier or set a pan or dish filled with pebbles and water below the plant to increase the room’s humidity.
Do not put the prayer plant near heating or cooling vents or doorways where it will be exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations and drafts.

, The soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. Not enough water and overwatering can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop from the plant.


If the leaves begin to turn yellow, water the plant less often if the soil is still wet or more often if the soil appears dry between waterings.

, This way, any water splashed on the leaves will be dry before evening. Cold tap water will chill your plant's roots and stress your plants, causing it to drop its leaves.


Wet leaves and cooler nighttime temperatures also provide a breeding ground for leaf spot. If your plant develops brown or black spots on its leaves, snip the damaged leaves off at the base and throw them away.

, Use water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted to half-strength. The half-strength dilution rate for most water-soluble fertilizers is about ½ teaspoon per gallon of water but it could be slightly higher or lower. Check the label for the manufacturer’s recommended dilution rate and reduce the amount by half.


Aim for a balanced houseplant fertilizer with a ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10.
Too little fertilizer will cause the prayer plant to grow slowly or not at all. Too much fertilizer will burn the roots and cause the leaves to develop dry brown edges. When given the correct amount of fertilizer, prayer plants will have healthy green stems and leaves and grow vigorously.

, Use a peat-based potting mix with a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 or mix two parts sphagnum peat moss, one part loamy soil, and one part perlite or coarse sand together.


Stir all of the ingredients together until they are thoroughly mixed. Sphagnum peat moss, loamy soil, perlite, and coarse sand can be purchased at local garden centers.
Purchase only clean, pre-packaged materials that have been commercially processed and are free of insects and weed seeds.

, When the container for the plant becomes full of roots, the potting mix dries out very quickly, causing the prayer plant to grow very slowly. This condition is called pot-bound.


The new container for your plant should be only 1 to 2 inches wider than the old one. Put 1 inch of potting mix in the bottom of the new container, remove the prayer plant from the old container, place it in the new container and finish filling it with the potting mix. Once it’s been repotted, water it generously to settle the soil around the roots.

, You can divide your prayer plant into several smaller plants by gently shaking the soil off the roots and working them apart. Each new plant should have a good mass of roots and several stems.


Pot these new smaller plants up separately in small, shallow pots.

, Use sharp scissors or hand pruners to snip a few of the stems back by a few inches. Make the cuts just above a leaf.


New stems and leaves will grow from the growth nodes located below the cut where the remaining leaf is growing, so you will have lots of prayer plants to enjoy in your home.

Feed air plants a dose of fertilizer every four weeks.,
Know when your plant needs more fertilizer.,
Make sure your plant gets plenty of air.,
Recognize rot.",How to Care for Air Plants2," Liquid, water-soluble fertilizer with a 10-5-5 ratio is fine.Dilute the fertilizer to one-fourth the recommended strength and mist the air plant with the solution in the morning.

, An air plant that is receiving adequate fertilizer will grow vigorously and have a healthy color, usually bright gray-green but this varies.


Inadequate fertilizer will result in slow growth, but excessive fertilizer will turn the leaves brown and brittle.

, Air plants require healthy air circulation. Although they need to get their leaves wet, if they do not dry quickly the air plant could develop crown rot. Do not place them too close to other plants, walls or furniture.


If air circulation is a problem in the house, set up a fan so that it blows away from the plant and turn it on for an hour or so once or twice a day. Make sure the fan doesn't blow directly on the plant. That would cause it to dry quickly before it has a chance to absorb any moisture.

, If the crown or roots develop rot, they will turn brown or gray and slimy. If the rot is only on the roots, trim off the rotten roots. Crown rot is usually fatal. The plant should be thrown away and replaced with a new air plant.

Tie the air plant to another object.,
Consider placing your air plant in a bowl.,
Do not cover the base of the plant with soil or moss, regardless of how you decide to display your air plant.",How to Care for Air Plants3," Air plants can be displayed by tying them to a piece of driftwood, cork or rock with nylon fishing line.


They can also be glued to the wood or rock with hot glue or construction glue.

, A decorative bowl filled with interesting rocks can be a fitting home for an air plant. Simply nestle the air plant on the rocks or glue it to a rock and set it in the center. They can be nestled in a decorative seashell for an interesting display.

, Covering the base of the plant will keep it too wet and can make it rot.

Water the plant when the soil becomes dry, using aged water.,
Fertilize your dwarf umbrella plant every two weeks (except during winter).,
Repot the dwarf umbrella plant when it seems to be growing slowly and the container is full of roots.,
Prune the dwarf umbrella plant only when necessary to control its size.,
Keep the leaves clean to prevent spider mites.",How to Care for a Dwarf Umbrella Plant," The ideal setting for a dwarf umbrella plant is directly in front of an east-, west- or south-facing window with a sheer curtain hanging between the plant and window to diffuse the direct sunlight.


Another good location is right next to the window where the plant will get very bright but indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight through a window without the curtain to diffuse it will scorch an umbrella plant’s leaves.
When the umbrella plant is not getting enough light, the leaves will turn yellow and drop.;
, Average room temperatures of 65 to 75 °F (18 to 24 °C) are ideal, although the dwarf umbrella plant will do fine with temperatures up to 85 °F (29 °C).


Do not allow the room temperature to drop below 60 °F (16 °C). The edges of the leaves will turn brown when the plant is exposed to temperatures that are too cold.Additionally, do not place dwarf umbrella plants near heating and cooling vents or a drafty door.

, Average room humidity is usually fine for this plant, but if the house tends to get dry from heating or cooling, mist it each morning with room temperature water.


The humidity can also be raised with a humidifier or a humidity tray, which is a shallow dish or pan filled with pebbles and water.
Set the humidity tray below the umbrella plant. As the water evaporates from the tray, the humidity around the plant is increased.

, Water the dwarf umbrella plant with “aged” water when the potting soil is nearly dry or when the leaves begin to wilt.


Fill the watering container a few days before watering the plant and leave it uncovered. This will allow the chlorine to dissipate and the water will be at room temperature when the plant is watered. This is a tropical plant that can be stressed by fresh, cold tap water.
If the leaves become wrinkled, the plant is not getting enough water. If it is being overwatered, the leaves will turn black and drop.

, Give the dwarf umbrella plant a balanced houseplant fertilizer that is designed for foliage plants during the spring, summer and fall. A fertilizer ratio of 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 is fine.


Use a liquid, water-soluble fertilizer mixed at half the rate recommended by the manufacturer. A common half-strength dilution rate is about ½ teaspoon of fertilizer per gallon of water, but this varies.Pour the fertilizer solution evenly over the potting soil every two weeks immediately following a regular watering. Do not give the umbrella plant fertilizer before watering it as this could burn the roots.
Fertilizer should not be given to the plant in the winter. The plant grows very slowly during the winter season and will not utilize the fertilizer.

, Repot it into a container with drains holes in the bottom that is only one size larger than its current pot. Pour 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of peat-based potting mix into the new container, turn the umbrella plant on its side and gently slide it out of its old container.


If the roots are sticking to the side of the container, run a butter knife around the inside of the container to loosen them. Set the umbrella plant into the container and finish filling it with potting mix.
Water it generously with aged water to help settle the soil around the roots.

, Use sharp scissors or bypass hand pruners to cut the stems right above a leaf. New leaves and stems will grow from just below the pruning cut.

, Wipe the leaves off with a damp sponge and clear, room-temperature water when they get dusty. Dirt and dust on the leaves block the light and provide a suitable environment for spider mites.

If the red edges leaves disappear, it's not in enough light. However, the resulting leaves are considered beautiful in themselves as they'll be thinner and prettier. So it's up to you which look you prefer.

, During winter, water much less. Don't over water it. If you under water it, you'll see brown leaf tips, which is easily remedied by watering a bit more. It may also be a sign of inadequate humidity, so keep the humidifier on or mist it regularly.

Repot the lipstick plant when it becomes pot-bound to encourage better growth.",How to Care for a Lipstick Plant," Lipstick plants originally grow in damp forest soil, so the best potting soil for them is one mixed with sphagnum that is kept moist, but not soggy. African violet potting mix combined with crushed charcoal is a good, commercially available mix for lipstick plants.;
, Choose a spot next to a south or west facing window to hang the plant, and place a sheer curtain between the plant and the window.

, As well, maintain a room humidity of between 25 and 49 percent.


In the winter, keep the room temperature closer to 65 °F (18 °C) to encourage the plant to produce new flower buds.
Do not hang the plant near a heating or air conditioning vent or near a doorway where it will be exposed to cold drafts in the winter.

, Aged water is tap water that has been left sitting in an open container for at least 24 hours. Letting it sit allows the chlorine to dissipate. Water the plant with aged water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry. Pour the water evenly over the soil until it begins to drain from the bottom of the container.


To make aged water, simply fill an empty milk jug or watering can a few days before the lipstick plant needs to be watered. Then fill the container again right away after watering the plant. This way, you will always have aged water ready for the plant.
Allow the top 1 to 2 inches of potting mix to dry before watering in the winter. Keeping the lipstick plant a little dryer during the winter will result in more profuse blooming in the spring and summer.

, Water should never be left in the saucer as it could soak back up into the potting mix and make the roots too wet.

, Pruning encourages new, healthy stems and leaves. Each stem should be trimmed back to a length of about 6 inches. Use sharp scissors or hand pruners and make a cut right above a leaf.


If the lipstick plant becomes straggly looking, which could be due to over- or under-watering or exposure to drafts, trim the longest vines back to as short as 2 inches.

, As the plant will be actively growing and blooming during these seasons, you want to add fertilizer to encourage the plant’s growth and development.


You can use water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 3-1-2 or 19-6-12 that contains micronutrients.
Dilute the fertilizer at one-fourth the dilution rate recommended by the manufacturer. A common recommended dilution rate is about 1 teaspoon per gallon of water but, for lipstick plants, it should be about ¼ teaspoon per gallon of water.

, Applying fertilizer to a thirsty or dry lipstick plant could burn its roots so always water it first before you add fertilizer.


You can also use slow-release houseplant fertilizer. Apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions, usually 1 to 2 tablespoons per plant, and sprinkle it evenly over the potting mix.

, A plant becomes pot-bound when the plant’s container is full of roots. The roots may also begin to grow out of the drain hole on the bottom of the pot or the plant may appear too large for its container.


Select a container that is only 1 to 2 inches larger than the old container and make sure it has drain holes on the bottom.
Pour 1 inch of African violet potting mix into the new container.
Gently grasp the lipstick plant’s stems with your fingers at the soil line, tilt the container sideways, and pull the plant out of the old container.
Use sharp scissors to snip off any excess roots growing out from the main root mass.
Set the lipstick plant in the new container and finish filling it with African violet potting mix.
Water it generously with aged water until the water drains from the bottom of the container.

Repot when necessary.",How to Water Indoor Plants," Not every type of houseplant has the same watering needs, so educate yourself on the plants you have or are thinking of buying. Don’t assume that every plant wants 1 quart of water every two days because all of your plants won’t thrive like that.Some may prefer to have their soil fairly dry most of the time, while others need it moist. Some may need the soil to dry out in between waterings.;
, Although it may be easiest to water on a set routine that you have decided, plants are not likely to thrive when watered this way. So rather than watering every two days, get a feel for how often your plant needs water. Check the soil consistently and learn how often it tends to dry out and water on that schedule.Even indoor plants tend to have a dormant stage during the winter, so it is likely they will not need to be watered as often during this time.
Morning tends to be a good time to water your plants. Watering at night can cause your plants to develop diseases more easily because the plant does not have time to dry before the temperature cools.

, Stick a finger in the soil up to your first knuckle and notice if the soil is moist enough. If you finger can’t even enter the soil, it definitely needs to be watered. If you reach an inch or so deep but your finger is completely dry, it probably needs water. If the top inch feels fairly moist, and some of the dirt sticks to your finger, it probably has enough water.Again, this is not a guarantee for every plant. But most of the time if the top portion of soil is dried out, the plant could use some more water.
You can buy a moisture meter that sticks in the soil and tells you when the plant needs water, which might be helpful and save guesswork.

, Leaves can be a good indication of both under and overwatering. If the leaves seem to be hanging limp, this often means the plant needs water. If they are brown, dry, or some have fallen out, this usually means the plant needs water.These signs mean that something is very wrong. Do not wait until your plant develops these signs before you water them.
If the plant is dried out, water it slowly. Giving it too much water all at once might kill it.
These same signs can sometimes mean the plant has been overwatered, so use this in conjunction with checking the soil. If you know you just watered it that day, give the plant time to absorb and use that water before watering it again.

, You can test if your plant has enough water by lifting it after you have just watered it and noticing how heavy it feels. Lift it periodically, and when it doesn’t feel heavy enough, you’ll know it needs some water. It’s more of an art than a science, but this can be good trick to master.This is only a good test for plants that are light enough to pick up and if you have the strength to do so. It’s not worth straining yourself just to check.

, You might assume that water from your faucet is just fine, but you may be wrong. City water can have chlorine and fluoride which not all plants can handle. Soft water may have too much salt. Tap water may be too alkaline. If you use a certain water for awhile and it doesn’t seem to be keeping your plants healthy, it’s probably time to switch.If you can store a container outside to catch rainwater, this is a great option since it’s what the plants would get naturally. If you happen to live somewhere that has acid rain, this won’t work. Melted snow is also a good option if you live in colder climates with little rain.
Bottled water can also be a good option, although this may be too costly.
For city water, you can fill an open container and let the water sit for a day or so, which allows the chemicals to evaporate before you use it on your plants.

, After each watering, refill your watering container and let it sit until the next time you water. This way, the water can warm up to a standard temperature rather than whatever temperature it would be from the tap or from rainwater. Most plants tend to prefer tepid water over cold water.If you have multiple plants and need a lot of water, consider keeping a few jugs, or watering cans, stored somewhere that you can keep filled and ready for when you need them.

, You want to err on the side of giving you plants less than enough water, because you can easily add a little more. Once you water plants too much, it is a lot of work to fix it. Keep track of how much water you use from one time to the next so you can get an idea how much is the right amount.


Some plants can also benefit from misting the leaves, since watering mainly affects the roots. It is important to know your plant, however. Some leaves actually won’t benefit from misting, and some plants may even be harmed from getting their leaves wet.

, If you do overwater your plant, and it isn’t draining, you can do a couple things to help stabilize it. Gently tip the pot on it’s side and allow the excess water to drain out for awhile. Or place paper towels on the surface of the soil and let them absorb some of the water. If it becomes a real problem, consider repotting in a new container that has better drainage.
Try moving the pot to a warmer location so that it will dry more quickly.
Avoid watering the plant for a while. Wait until the soil has dried out again.

, Plants should be matched to a container of the right size to ensure that water is distributed efficiently. Plants in containers that are too small can become “root bound,” meaning the roots take up all the space. Plants in containers that are too big may not hold water in the soil and so will become dried out.If you check the roots and you can tell there is more root than soil, this is a good indication that it’s time to get a bigger pot. You only want to move plants up one pot size at a time so you don’t end up with too much extra room.
If the leaves of the plant seem disproportionate in size to the bottom, you should move up a pot size. If the pot has ever tipped over because of being top heavy, this is a definite indication you need a bigger pot.
As with many aspects of tending indoor plants, there is no hard and fast rule that always applies. You need to occasionally take stock of your plant and judge if you feel a bigger pot would benefit it.

, Since overwatering is often what kills plants, pots that allow plants to drain are very important. These pots will either have a hole in the center of the bottom or may have some kind of thin slits on the bottom. Pots with a solid bottom can cause water to pool and the roots can rot if soaked for too long.If pots without drainage holes are your only option, it works well to put a layer of stones at the bottom of the pot. Extra water can pool there and won’t be in direct contact with the soil and roots. The stone layer should be an inch or so deep. Be extra careful not to overwater your plants.
If you can only find plastic pots without holes, you can drill your own holes into the bottom.

, If your pot is going to drain water, you most definitely don’t want it draining out onto your floors. You can purchase plastic pans specifically for this, or you can improvise and use a plate or saucer. You could even cut up a milk jug or 2 liter bottle if the pot is small enough and you aren’t overly concerned with the appearance of it.Always empty this drainage pan within a half hour or so after watering, rather than allowing the plant to sit in it. If you don’t drain the pan, it’s basically the same as having a pot with no holes, as the plant will still be soaking in too much water.

, If you have had a plant for a while and you can tell it is growing bigger, it may be best to replant it in a bigger pot. If the soil of the plant has shrunk away from the edges, it may need a smaller pot. To check if a plant has become root bound, you can carefully pull it out of the pot and check if there is still plenty of soil or if it seems to be mostly roots.

Make sure your croton gets a lot of humidity.,
Make your own humidity tray.,
Do not set crotons near doorways or heating vents.,
Use a fluorescent lamp if needed.",How to Care for a Croton Plant1," Crotons need high humidity which is difficult to provide in most homes. However, you can run a humidifier in the room or set a humidity tray below the croton plant.Placing multiple plants close together also increases the humidity in the immediate area. Misting the croton every morning with room-temperature water may help a little but the water usually evaporates too quickly to do much good.;
, It is fairly simple and inexpensive to create a humidity tray. Simply fill a shallow dish or pan with pebbles and water. Set the croton just above the humidity tray.


As the water evaporates naturally, it will increase the humidity around the plant.

, Keep the room temperature above 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


If the croton starts dropping its leaves after they become yellow and dry, the humidity is too low. #Make sure your croton is exposed to a few hours of direct sunlight each day. The easiest way to supply this light is to set the crotons in front of a south- west- or east-facing window.They will drop their leaves when they are not getting enough light.

, If a bright, sunny area is not available in the home or office, additional light can be provided with a fluorescent lamp. Set the lamp up so that the bulb is about 6 inches away from the croton. Install a special fluorescent grow light bulb in the lamp and leave the lamp on for 14 to 16 hours each day.The lamp should be turned on in the morning around sunrise. Plug the lamp into a timer that can be programmed to turn it on automatically each morning and shut it off 14 to 16 hours later to be sure the croton gets the light it needs every day.

Inspect the stem.,
Buy an anthurium plant with healthy leaves.,
Evaluate the spathe.,
Purchase fertile anthurium plants.,
Examine the plants for signs of insects.,
Inspect the plant for disease.",How to Buy Anthurium Plants," Anthurium plants are available in the tropical plant section of many local garden centers. Several commercial tropical plant distributors also offer anthurium plants for online ordering. For the best selection, look for a retailer that offers several different types of anthurium plants, rather than just 1 species.;
, If you are purchasing an anthurium plant locally, make sure the tropical plant area of the garden center has a daytime temperature of 78 to 90 degrees F (25.5 to 32.2 degrees C) and a nighttime temperature of 70 to 75 degrees F (21.2 to 23.8 degrees C). Anthuriums can not tolerate extreme heat or cold. Extreme heat, or temperatures above 90 degrees F (32.2 degrees C), may scorch the leaves, fade the flower color, and reduce the life of the foliage. Extreme cold, or temperatures below 45 degrees F (7.2 degrees C), may cause the leaves to yellow and stunt the plant's growth.


Ask online retailers about temperature conditions in the anthurium plant greenhouses before placing an order. Many online distributors provide information about the growing conditions on their websites.

, Carefully inspect the entire container, including the bottom. Look for tears or cracks in the container. Do not purchase anthurium plants potted in cracked containers because the plant may have root damage because of a faulty container.

, Anthurium plants thrive in coarse, well-drained potting media. Look for potting soil that is an equal mix of pine bark, peat moss and pearlite, which is a volcanic glass with a high water content.

, To support the bloom, the stem of the anthurium plant should be straight, long and of medium to heavy thickness. Anthurium plant stems may grow up to 20 inches (50.8 cm), so be sure the stem looks strong enough to hold blooms at that height.


Analyze where the stems are in the pot. The stems should be directly in the center of the pot. If the stems are located too close to the side of the container, the potted plant may become unstable.

, Mature anthurium leaves are large and grow from long stalks. The leaves should be bright green and feel waxy. Look for leaves that are smooth and without defects like blotches or tears. Do not purchase anthurium plants with yellow or brown leaves.


Look for anthurium with a minimum of four leaves on each plant, which is the number of leaves necessary for successful growth.

, What most people call the flower on an anthurium plant is actually a spathe, or a waxy protective cover for the plant's tiny flowers. Purchase a plant that has at least one bloom on it so you can analyze its appearance.


Determine what color spathe you prefer. Anthurium spathes come in various colors, including red, pink, orange, coral, yellow, and white. Look for anthurium spathes in bright, uniform colors.
Consider the shape of the spathe. Anthurium spathes come in three shapes: standard, obake and tulip. Standard spathes are heart-shaped, while tulip spathes resemble the shape of tulip blooms. Obake spathes are the largest, and often have a slightly twisted appearance.
Asses the texture of the spathe. The surface of the spathe should be glossy and waxy with a slightly crinkled appearance.

, Select an anthurium plant with both open and closed buds. The new buds are an indication of the plant's fertility.

, Mites, lice, thrips, white flies and nematodes are common anthurium plant pests. Because the insects are small and hard to spot, look for signs of insect damage, such as leaf discoloration or bite marks on the leaves or stems.

, Anthurium plants are subject to bacterial and fungal diseases. If possible, lift the plant out of its container to examine the roots for fungal disease. If the roots are wet and mushy, the plant may be suffering from root rot. Also, look for discolored or spotted leaves, which can be a sign of mold infestation.

Choose your miniature container carefully.,
Add in a layer of gravel at the bottom.,
Add an equal amount of potting soil over top.,
Choose your terrarium plants!,
Add water.",How to Build a Miniature Terrarium," Building a miniature terrarium is a bit more tricky than building a normal terrarium, so don't rush through your selection. You can choose containers made of glass, plastic, or acrylic, as long as the container material is transparent enough to let in the proper amount of light to keep your terrarium plants alive. The other important consideration is that it has an opening wide enough for you to fill it with all the materials you want to use.
, Most terrariums use at least an inch of gravel at the bottom, but this probably won't work with a miniature terrarium (depending on the size of your container, of course). Instead, stick to a centimeter or so, in order to keep your plant's roots drained properly. Sitting in a puddle of watery soil will cause them to rot, and kill the plant., Peat moss also works, as does a 50/50 mixture of peat moss and potting soil. Use a narrow tool to pat down the soil, but don't pack it too tightly or your plants will have trouble getting a good hold., There are a number of great options, but for miniature terrariums the plant called Baby's Tears are a great choice, as are any of the wide variety of mosses. On a tiny scale, even a few grass seeds can create interesting textural effects in your garden design. Use your creativity!, It's best to use distilled or purified water for this purpose, because it's probably going to be in the terrarium for a long time, and you don't want to accidentally kill your plants. Keep the miniature terrarium in sunlight, and soon you'll begin to see a miniature version of the water cycle taking place as your plants grow!"

Water croton plants with room-temperature water.,
Pour the water evenly over the potting soil until it begins to drain from the bottom.,
Keep the season in mind.,
Look for signs that your plant is not getting enough, or is getting too much water.",How to Care for a Croton Plant2," You should water them as soon as the top of the soil becomes dry during the spring, summer and early fall. These are tropical plants and cold, fresh tap water can stress them.


Use water that has been “aged” or left in an open container for at least 24 hours to let the chlorine dissipate.

, Empty the saucer beneath the container after it drains through or set the croton in a tub or large sink while watering and return it to its place after the water stops draining.


Water left in the saucer could be soaked back up into the potting soil, keeping the croton’s roots too wet and depriving them of oxygen. Croton plant roots require some oxygen exposure to keep them healthy.

, In late fall and winter, wait until the top 1 to 2 inches of soil becomes dry before watering. This will encourage the croton to slow down and rest for a few months before resuming vigorous growth in the spring.

, A croton plant’s leaves will turn yellow and drop if it is being watered too little and if it is being watered too much.


If this happens at any time during the year, adjust the watering frequency up or down, depending on the season and how much the soil has been allowed to dry before watering.

"
"
Fertilize croton plants every four weeks during the spring, summer and early fall.,
Pour the solution evenly over the potting soil immediately after watering with plain water.,
Repot crotons in the spring if they have outgrown their containers.,
Make sure the new container has drain holes in the bottom, then add soil.",How to Care for a Croton Plant3," Use water-soluble houseplant fertilizer with a balanced ratio of 5-10-5 or 7-7-7. Mix 1 teaspoon of fertilizer into 1 gallon (3.8 L) of aged water.


Do not give crotons fertilizer from mid-fall through winter. They will not use the fertilizer during this dormant time and it could damage the roots.

, Never give the croton fertilizer before watering as it could burn the roots.

, Indications that a croton needs to be repotted are slowed growth, an excessive mass of roots in the pot or simply looking too big for the container. Get a container that is only one size larger than the current container.


If the new container is much larger than the old one, it will hold too much potting soil which will retain too much moisture around the roots. This excessive moisture and lack of air circulation could cause the croton’s roots to rot which will kill the plant.

, Pour 1 to 2 inches of moistened peat-based potting soil into the bottom of the container. Turn the croton on its side and gently pull it out of its old container. Set it in the new container and fill in around the roots with potting soil.


Water it generously to help settle the potting soil. Add more soil, if necessary, to bring it up to an inch or so below the rim of the container.

It may be labeled one of the following ways: Lucky Bamboo, Ribbon Plant, or occasionally by its true name, Dracaena sanderiana.;
, Caring for a Lucky Bamboo plant isn’t very hard, but if you get one that isn’t healthy, it will be much harder to care for and it may die. The size of the plant doesn’t matter too much here, as most of them will be fairly small.


It should be an even green color all over with no blemishes, bruises, or yellowing.
The stalks should be a consistent color from the base to their tops.
There also shouldn’t be any browning on the tips of the leaves.

, Lucky Bamboo plants are very resilient, but if they have been planted incorrectly or have a sour odor, they could be sick, and won’t grow.Bamboo plants don’t have a fragrance like flowers do, but if they haven’t been watered properly, they can grow bacteria and develop a stink.
Check the current water levels, and check to see if it has soil or fertilization. Many bamboo plants are grown hydroponically, just in water with small rocks or pebbles to hold the stalks in place. Some may be in soil, however, check to make sure that it is at least half full of water, or the soil is moist, but not soaked.

, Too much soil or fertilization can actually harm your plant. However, if you are using tap water and it has fluoride and other chemicals, you may want to use soil and fertilizer to prevent yellow tips.If you are growing it in standing water, you will need some pebbles to hold it upright. If in soil, try mixing a third each of sand, peat moss, and regular soil to ensure excellent drainage.
For water only, make sure that your plant has at least enough to cover the base of the roots. You should also change the water at least once per week to prevent the plant from rotting. It is a good idea to rinse the vase, pebbles, and plant each time you do this.
If you are growing the plant in soil, water the plant just enough so that the soil is moist.

, Your pot should be about 2 inches larger in diameter than the plant. Most Lucky Bamboo plants already come in a pot, but you can use your own pot to make the plant more your own.


A clear container works well for water and will show off your plant and pebbles, but make sure that you keep it out of direct sunlight.
You can also use a ceramic pot and grow it in either pure water or in soil. If you use soil, plant the bamboo in a pot with a drain hole.

, Too much fertilizer is worse than none at all, so use it sparingly. This is especially true of potted plants because the fertilizer will not become diluted by rain and can’t run off like it will for plants in the ground.

, Your lucky Bamboo plant doesn’t need a lot of water. In fact, too much is bad for it.Water your plant about once a week and ensure that there’s a few inches at all times, enough to cover the roots.
If you have soil in your plant, make sure that it’s not too moist or dry. Your bamboo plant can live well in just water, so over soiling or fertilizing can actually harm it.

, Lucky Bamboo in the wild is usually shaded from direct sunlight by other, taller plants. You should keep your plant in an open, and bright area, but one that isn’t exposed to direct sunlight all day.To best care for your Lucky Bamboo, keep it away from windows that get a lot of light. Instead, place it in a part of your room not so exposed.
Your Lucky Bamboo plant will also grow best in temperatures between in 65°F and 90°F.

, If you wish to style the Lucky Bamboo plant, choose a few prime stalks to make a linked arrangement and put it on display. You can manipulate the stalks to grow around each other or curl with a bit of work; to do this you have to use younger stalks that haven’t grown a lot and hardened yet.You can simply plant your stalks in a line or rows if you want straight stalks.
To curl your Lucky Bamboo plant, get a cardboard box and cut off the bottom and one side. Place the box over your plant with the open end facing your light source. Your stalks will begin to curl towards the light as they grow. Once you see a bend, rotate your plant.
You can also wrap some wire around younger stalks crisscrossing them. As they grow you will add more wire to keep them stable as they intertwine.

, Sometimes the ends of your leaves might turn yellow. This could be caused by a few factors: you plant isn’t getting enough water, there’s too much soil or fertilizer, or too much direct sunlight. You can trim off the yellow parts, or remove the whole leaf.


To remove the yellowed tips of your leaves, sterilize a pair of pruning shears or sharp scissors and with light rubbing alcohol or vinegar, then cut the yellow part off following the natural shape of the leaf.
You can remove whole leaves by simply pulling them down off the stalk at the base of the leaf.

, When one or two of your stalks gets too tall you can cut them and replant them. This will help you care for your Lucky Bamboo plant by ensuring that it doesn’t get too crowded and can produce new plants.


Take your longest stalk and remove the smaller leaves at the base of the shoot.
With a sterile knife or scissors, cut the shoot about half an inch from where it connects to the stalk.
Place the shoot in a bowl of clean, distilled water. Keep it in a shady area for about one to two months until it begins to sprout roots. Once you see roots, you can replant it the same pot as your bamboo plant.

, People often tie a gold or red ribbon around the stalks of Lucky Bamboo plants to hold them together, and as an extra symbol of good fortune.


Add pebbles to finish off the look and hold the arrangement in place.
Place your Lucky Bamboo plant somewhere where you will it enjoy day and remind you to care for it.

Start small.,
Choose the ideal garden spot.,
Sketch a simple map of the location you have chosen.,
Research types of perennials and decide how much time you are willing to devote to the care and maintenance of any plants you are considering.,
Think about other elements you can incorporate into your garden.,
Consider spacing when you are researching the plants you’d like to put in your garden; many perennials multiply by themselves, so if you initially plant in every available space, your garden will soon be overcrowded.,
Plant groups of similar plants together.,
Note the growing heights of the plants you are considering.,
Choose perennials that have a mixture of colors, shapes and foliage.

,
Factor in the blooming times of each perennial you want; that way you will have a colorful garden from spring until fall.

,
Make sure your new perennial garden can be easily reached with a garden hose.

",How to Design a Perennial Garden," Design a garden that will fit in a space that is no larger than 15’ (4,572 mm) wide x 6’ (1828 mm) deep. That’s enough room to create a 3 season garden and it won’t be an overwhelming chore to maintain it. The initial planning and preparation of a perennial garden is labor intensive; if you attempt to design and plant a large garden, you might get discouraged, both with the planting and the maintenance.;
, Walk around your property and observe the places where you spend the most time, or would like to spend the most time when you are outdoors. You can also walk through your house and look out of all the windows and decide where you would like to improve the view.

, Note the locations of large trees or shrubs and the average amount of sun and shade the spot gets every day.

, Some perennials are virtually maintenance-free once established, but others require diligent, sometimes daily, attention. Still others require full sunlight or partial shade. Look online or find books at your local library or book store that have full color photographs of perennials.

, Don’t reject a favorite site because it has a large boulder or tree that can’t be moved; you can easily plant flowers that will complement natural elements.

, Fill in any gaps with annuals so that you allow your perennials room to expand over the years.

, A minimum of 3 similar plants or a group of a single variety of flowers gives the maximum eye appeal.

, Taller plants should be planted in the background and lower growing flowers should be in the foreground. Sketching out your choices on your design plan will help you visualize what your mature garden will eventually look like.

Grow plants that are sun or shade compatible with your planting area.,
Pay attention to the mature size of the plant.,
Choose the flowers to plant under your tree.,
Choose a shrub to plant under your tree.",How to Create Tree Flower Beds1," You first need to know how much sun exposure your bed receives. Observe your garden over the course of a day, and consider how your shade and sunlight levels will change in the different seasons. When buying plants, the descriptions will indicate how much sun they will need.


Full sun means that during the middle of the day in the growing season the area will get six or more hours of direct sunlight. If this is the case for your bed, you will have a wide range of plants you can choose from.
Partial sun means that the area receives direct sunlight from the sunrise until noon. The reason this is not full sun is because the sun in the morning is not as strong as sun in the middle of the day. Partial shade is when your spot receives sunlight from 3 p.m. until the end of the day. Partial shade also applies to areas that have dappled or filtered sunshine for the full day.
Full shade would mean that the area is on the north side of a building or that the tree coverage is very dense and that even dappled sunshine does not show through. Although your options will be fewer, you can still find suitable, attractive plants for your bed.;
, Make sure that when the plant is full size that it will fit well under the tree and in the space you have. Buy small and low growing plants for your bed. Plants that will get tall may start to block sunlight for any smaller plants in the bed or encroach on the lower branches of tree.

, Planting flowers under your tree can make for a very attractive bed. Consider planting in a cluster of 3-5 different kinds of flowers or shrubs to create a more textured or flourishing look. Consider the zone where you are planting as well. When you buy plants, make sure they are suited for your region. For example, if you live in the desert, there are many flowers that are difficult to successfully grow in the summer because of the heat.:

, These plants are easy to maintain and can add great variety to your bed. You will want to make sure that whatever shrub you buy is low growing. Once again, consider the sunlight and region where you live when you are selecting your plants. Shrubs are great for growing under trees because they can thrive with less light and/or moisture."

Know when to plant.,
Set a perimeter for your bed.,

Leave your plants room to grow, and weed your flower bed regularly.,
Water the area where you have planted your flowers thoroughly.,
Every year add another inch of organic matter to your garden.",How to Create Tree Flower Beds2," You should plant any flower other than a pansy after the last frost of the spring. Pansies are heartier and can withstand the cold. Other flowers will die if you plant them and a frost comes.Find the average last frost date from the previous year. Search online at plantmap.com for the last frost in your area. You can also use the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to obtain data on the last frost date in your location. Certain plants will thrive best if they are planted during a specific time or at certain temperatures, so pay attention to the care instructions for your plant. For example, irises grow best if you plant them in the late summer or early fall instead of in the spring. You can go to www.garden.org to read more about how to care for your specific plant. Note when you are buying your plants that annuals will grow just one season and perennials will last at least two seasons.

, You don’t need to create a border; however, you should know where the perimeter of your bed is to know where to plant. Take a shovel and mark off the diameter of the bed. Remember that you should start planting a foot out from the trunk of the tree, so 24 inches may be a good place to make a perimeter.

, Do not dig up the soil around your tree because you may end up digging up the roots with the soil. Instead, create a bed of soil around your tree. You can just dump soil around the tree to create the bed, or you can use bricks or logs as a border for the outer edges of the soil.

Make sure to make the soil bed around the tree deep enough for your plants to fit into.

, If it is a small pack with several flowers, push up from the bottom and lift the plant out from the roots. Untangle any roots that are stuck to the bottom of the container. If it is a potted plant, place your hand over the surface of the soil, and turn the plant over into the palm of your hand.

, Take the outside of the root ball, and gently untangle some of the roots at the edge of the root ball. You do not want the roots to remain a dense mass, and untangling them a bit will allow the roots to plant more easily into the new soil. , Gently put the plant into the new soil, and take your new topsoil and cover the flower roots. Then press down on the soil around the base of the flower with your hands. Now your plant is almost set- repeat the above steps to plant the rest of your shrubs and flowers before you water.


Hold the plant by the roots rather than by the stems at all times.

, When you are planting, do not plant the flowers or shrubs too close together. Find out how big the plants are going to grow, and consider how densely you want the area to be populated with plants. Leave at least 2-3 inches of space between each plant. In addition, you should maintain your flower bed by weeding regularly. Use your hands and pluck out any unwanted plants that are growing around your flowers and plants by the root. If weeds are left unattended they can choke your flowers and take their nutrients.


Make a schedule on your calendar for when you should be weeding your flower bed to help keep you on track with your weeding.

, Water consistently after you have planted your plants. When the plants roots have to compete with the roots of a tree they will need more water. Set a watering schedule for your plants to help you keep track of when you have watered them and when you will need to water them again.

, You can add organic matter or more topsoil to your garden that is suited for your kinds of flowers, perennial or annual. You need to add organic matter because the bacteria and fungi in organic matter is food for your plants. You can make your own organic matter for your garden by composting. Using your vegetable scraps, garden clippings, leaves or manure, you can provide the nutrients your plants need to thrive year after year.

Trim the low branches of your tree.,
Know what kind of tree you are planting under.",How to Create Tree Flower Beds3," Plant outwards from there. Make sure that where the trunk becomes wider and the roots are exposed that the bark remains uncovered. Do not create a raised flower bed around the tree base. The bark on the exposed roots of a tree needs oxygen, and if the roots are covered they will rot over time., You want to allow as much light as you can to reach the flowers and plants below your tree. So get out a pair of trimming shears and trim any low, thin branches. Remember, however, that living branches should be on at least ⅔ of the plant’s height, so never trim more than ⅓ of the living branches of your tree. You can get pruning shears at a hardware store.Only remove branches that are less than 5 cm in diameter.
Trim thin V-shaped branches. Avoid trimming healthy U-shaped branches.
If you are pruning a small branch, trim it about 1/4 inch out from a bud. If you are pruning a larger branch, then cut it just outside the raised collar area outside of the trunk., Depending on the kind of tree you are planting under, you should be more careful about how many plants you plant. You may want to plant under a tree that is better suited for gardening at its base. If you do have a tree that is more sensitive, consider starting small and choose a few small plants rather than creating a dense garden at the base of the tree. If you have a tree that is sensitive, create a plan for your garden that will span a few years, so your tree can gradually acclimate to the new planting. Be cautious when planting under these trees because they are sensitive about having their roots disturbed:

Beeches
Black oak
Buckeyes
Cherries and plums
Dogwoods
Hemlocks
Larches
Lindens
Magnolias
Pines
Red oaks
Scarlet oaks
Sugar maples

Plan for energy efficiency.",How to Design a Desert Garden," Before you get started, you should be able to walk through the space that will become your garden and imagine what goes where. Imagine, for instance, where your wash will be, where your trees will be, and where your cacti will be.It might help if you walk through the space with a friend or family member and explain the future desert garden to them. This will help solidify the plan in your mind and allow you to confront issues that you might not have thought of, but that your friend or partner might raise.
You could also sketch a 2D layout or map of the future garden to help you get a better grip on what your desert garden will look like. Include all the major elements of your desert garden on the map.
When visualizing your garden, you should imagine how large the final, mature plants will be. Plan your desert garden accordingly, with enough space for trees to grow to their full height.;
, Once you know what you want in your desert garden, you should investigate the price of the plants, rocks, and other elements you want. Depending on your financial resources, you might need to revisit your initial plans in order to determine if you need to scale back your vision for the garden.The amount of money you should budget toward your desert garden depends on your own income level and commitment to the project.

, Crabgrass and other non-native plant growth should be eliminated before introducing beginning your desert garden. Uproot plants and larger shrubs and discard them in garden waste bags. Grass will need to mowed short, then sprayed with herbicides and left to broil under the desert sun., In order to turn the earth over so as to ready it for desert plants, you’ll need to obtain a tractor or hand plow. In most mechanical tractors, you can use a front scoop or a rear blade to turn your future garden land over.Usually, the rear blade is the easier option when plowing your land.
With a small plot, you could probably use a rototiller or similar handheld plowing device.
Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to use your mechanical tractor or plowing device.
You can often rent small tractors from home and garden stores.

, A dry stream bed is a low depression that allows water to run straight through the desert garden. You should dig the basic outline of the wash when you are plowing your yard with the tiller or tractor by running a straight line through the future desert garden at a slightly greater depth than you tilled the rest of the yard.Once you’re done tilling the yard, go back over the rough outline of the wash and refine it somewhat with a shovel, tamping down the banks and deepening the trough of the wash.
The wash should be about eight inches (21 centimeters) deep.You might see the dry stream-bed referred to as a “wash” or “arroyo.”

, After digging the dry streambed, you’ll need to lay rocks about the size of a fist along the wash. Place them tightly together along the bottom. You can obtain these rocks from rock and gravel companies in your area.There’s no need to add water to the dry streambed. The dry streambed’s purpose is to secure the soil, direct precipitation during the rainy season, and beautify your desert garden., Shrubs are some of the most common and resilient of desert plants. Shrubs provide beautifying color for the garden, and cover for smaller plants that can thrive in their shade. Apache plumes, fern bushes, sages, succulents, and curl-leaf mountain mahogany are some of the most popular desert shrubs., Trees can serve as a visual anchor for your desert garden. Of all desert flora, trees have the largest requirements for water, so you should plant your desert trees close to the wash. Monitor your trees closely and look for signs that they are withering (for instance, dry leaves and loss of leaf cover). Water your trees if they show signs of drying out. Some trees that grow successfully in the desert include:guajillo
white thorn acacia
leather-leaf acacia
sweet acacia
palo blanco
anacacho orchid
Mexican blue palm

, Desert plants like Palo Verde trees, mesquite, chuparosa, and desert lavender thrive in a desert garden. Various species of cactus – including the saguaro cactus, barrel cactus, and vine cactus – are also appropriate in a desert garden. These plants will do well because they require little to no water, a resource which is in short supply in the desert.Do not incorporate plants that don’t thrive in the desert into your desert garden.
You can obtain plants for your desert garden from home and garden supply stores.

, A diverse family of plants fosters resilience within your garden’s plant community. Don’t limit yourself to just a few species of grasses or cacti. Instead, include a variety of plants in your desert garden. Other plants you could include in your desert garden include:aloes
globe mallows
brittle bushes
penstemons
poverty bushes

, Dig a series of holes in your yard to accommodate the incoming plants and bushes. For most plants, a hole 12 inches (30 cm) wide and 18 inches (45 cm) deep is sufficient.Once you’ve dug the holes, place your plants into the holes, then fill the soil you’ve removed back into the hole to keep the plants anchored in place.
It will probably take several weeks to obtain and install all your plants.
Each plant grows best under particular ecological conditions. For instance, baby penstemons, brittlebush, and globe mallow thrive when planted near the edges of the wash and in other areas of disturbed soil.
Space your plants out appropriately.
Consult a guide of desert botany to determine the best location and provide adequate space for each plant species you incorporate into your desert garden.

, Even though the plants of your desert garden should be hearty and capable of surviving in arid conditions, if there’s a serious drought, you’ll want to ensure your desert garden survives. Ensure your plants get watered at appropriate intervals.Each plant has different water needs. Consult a guide of desert botany for more information about how much and how often to water your desert plants.
Some plants can be watered too much. Brittle bushes and globe mallow, for instance, will quickly explode beyond a reasonable size if watered frequently.
When it comes to watering desert plants, err on the side of watering too little rather than watering too much. Providing too much water (and fertilizer) can cause your plants to grow too fast, leaving them vulnerable to wind breakage., When your trees start to grow significantly, you might want to add a patio beneath them. A patio beneath a tree is the best option because the tree’s branches provide excellent shade from the desert sun.Do not place a patio beneath trees that drop fruit or attract birds.

, With evergreens on the edge of the garden, your garden will be better protected from the wind. This arrangement will also provide a sort of visual enclosure to the garden as a whole., Edging is a low barrier in front of a row of plants or shrubs that encloses the space. Within the edging, you might add an extra layer of gravel or other topdressing in order to set the area apart visually from the rest of the garden space.You could use straight lines in front of a row of plants to give it a minimalist look, or use a curved line of edging in order to give the space a more organic flow.
Plastic or steel barriers of an inch or two (three or four centimeters) are your best options for a well-designed desert garden.

, There are several ways to design your desert garden so as to maximize your household’s energy efficiency. Planting smaller trees near windows, for instance, can help prevent sun from heating the home to an uncomfortable temperature. Deciduous trees planted to the east of the home will especially reduce the heat increase in the house during the summer, and will increase solar gain during the winter.
When planted close to the west and south of the home, deciduous trees can increase solar gain during the winter and reduce heat load during the summer.
Evergreen trees planted just north of the home can reduce heat loss during the winter.

Assess the lay of the land.,
Decide how you will use the garden.,
Choose a focal point.,
Plan your paths.",How to Design a Formal Garden1," The design you choose for your garden will be influenced by the contours of the land you are using. You should also take into account its placement relative to your house or other nearby buildings. Consider the following factors:


Is the land your are using hilly or flat? This will affect the final look of your formal garden. Formal gardens are easier to create on flatter land, so you may want to look into leavening some of the hills on your property if possible.
What is the shape of the plot of land? Are you working with a perfect square, or is it more oblong in shape? You'll have to decide whether the garden is going to extend to the edges of the land, or whether you want to create a more contained space within it.
Before you begin, you should test your soil to make sure that it is suitable for planting. Many plants require the soil to have a particular pH, and you should know if your soil is clay, sandy, loamy, peaty, silty, or chalky.
Assess how much sun and shade the area receives. You can plant a formal garden in both sunny and shady areas, but it will change the types of plants you can grow.;
, You may be designing the garden purely for visual appeal, or perhaps you want it to be more functional, a place for people to relax and play. This is an important decision to make, since it will determine how many open spaces you'll have in proportion to areas with plants and hedges.


If you want people to quietly stroll through the garden, observing all of its details, you probably want to install a lot of paths and intricate plantings.
If you like the formal look but want your garden to be less structured, plan for just one or two paths and more open spaces.

, Formal gardens are usually arranged around some type of impressive focal point - think of a palace garden with a giant fountain in the center. In many cases the focal point is located at the center of the garden, but it doesn't have to be. Consider these ideas:


Make a small version of those palatial gardens by creating a focal point out of a pretty fountain or even a bird bath.
Your focal point could be a beautiful tree that's already standing in your garden.
You could buy a wrought-iron bench and place it in a cleared area as a focal point.
Create an arch with a trellis in the center of the garden.
Use your patio or deck as a focal point instead of having one at the center of the garden.

, Now that you have a focal point in mind, it's time to plan out the paths that lead to it. A formal garden may have paved, brick or stone paths. You could also have paths that are naturally created among hedges that are carefully trimmed. Paths should be maintained carefully to create a sense of neatness and order, essential elements of a formal garden.Create a map that shows your focal point and the different paths that will lead to it.


Some formal gardens have maze-like paths, all leading to the focal point. This tends to take up a lot of space, so it's a good choice for larger gardens.
You could have two bisecting paths that make a cross shape, dividing your garden into four distinct parts.One symmetrical circular path with a path running straight through the middle is another good choice.
If you like simple symmetry, you might consider one straight path down the center with plantings along the edge.
If your focal point is a deck attached to your house, consider having a path that leads straight to it, with smaller paths leading off to the sides.

"
"
Consider your climate.,
Choose appropriate plants.,
Plant with an eye toward symmetry.,
Make sure you have good bones.,
Factor in open spaces.",How to Design a Formal Garden2," Perhaps you visited a garden in France, fell in love with its beauty, and seek to recreate it in your own backyard. The first thing you must do is find out whether your climate is conducive to growing plants you saw elsewhere. It's important to choose plants that will thrive where you live; otherwise, you'll be dealing with sick and dying plants instead of enjoying a healthy garden.


Figure out which planting zone you live in, so that when you start to research species you'll be able to tell right away whether they'll be a good fit. You can look up your zone by zip code on the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.
Don't be averse to using plants that are native to your area. Formal gardens can have many different themes that vary according to climate. There are formal alpine, desert, tropical, temperate and Mediterranean styles. Check around for gardens in your area that may inspire you with ideas.

, Balance and cohesion are key in formal gardens. Choose plants with shapes that go well together and work with the other elements in your garden. For example, if your garden design is primarily square, you might want to plant box hedges, which can be trimmed into a square shape. Hydrangea blossoms are a good choice as a complement to a circular design.


This is not to say that if you have a square garden design, all of your plants must be square. Get creative with your interpretation. Choose flowers that have four distinct and neat petals, or decide to plant tulips in the shape of a large square.
Pick plants with cohesive colors.One or two colors is enough for a formal garden; too many colors and it will have a wild look.Choose plants that are containable. You'll be doing a lot of trimming and weeding to keep your garden design looking neat. Help yourself out by choosing plants that won't spread over your brick path or get unwieldy after a few weeks. Bulb plants are a good choice for this purpose.

, Once you've chosen your plants, decide where to put them. Your garden is divided into several spaces by paths; assess each space both individually and as part of the whole garden when you're deciding what to plant where.


Consider lining the paths with one type of plant. This is a beautiful look that provides instant cohesion.
If you plant something in one area, plant the same thing on the opposite side. For example, if you have a group of tulips in the left corner of the garden, plant a similar group in the right corner, for balance and symmetry.
Plant en masse. A classic characteristic of formal gardens is the striking sight of a large group of plants. A box-shaped section planted wall to wall with hyacinths, for example, could give your garden the look you want to achieve.
Create patterns. Alternate plant shapes and colors by planting a row of one flower, a row of a different flower, and so on.

, The term ""good bones"" is used by landscape architects to describe the structure of the garden that is in place all year round, after the flowers are gone and the grass isn't quite as green.Choose hedges that will stay green all year round, and pick some winter-hardy plants. You can also employ fencing and other permanent features to make sure your garden has ""good bones.""


Consider lining your pathways as a part of this process. Formal gardens often use gravel, stone, brick, or concrete to line the pathways.

, Don't forget to leave some areas open. Open spaces provide a pleasing contrast with planted spaces, and they're also nice if you want people to be able to lounge in the garden. Plant the open spaces with grass, or cover them with gravel if you prefer.

"
"
Utilize water features.,
Add stone urns and statues.,
Add furniture.,
Keep your garden neat.",How to Design a Formal Garden3," Many formal gardens have fountains, koi ponds, small streams, and other water features to add interest to the layout. Consider installing a water feature in your garden, either as the focal point or a simple decoration.

, Concrete is often used in formal garden designs in the form of urns, other plant holders, and statues. Marble is another classic stone you could use, or faux-marble if you're looking for a more affordable option.


One beautiful statue used as the centerpiece of your garden can make a huge difference. Check out garden stores and nurseries for outdoor statue options.
If you decide to use urns, buy an even number and distribute them around the garden in a pattern. For example, if your garden is divided into four sections, each one should have an urn, and the urns should all contain the same kind of plant or flower.

, If your formal garden is in your backyard, chances are you'll want to spend a lot of time out there. You'll need outdoor furniture that matches the theme of your garden.


Wrought iron is often a good choice for this purpose. You could also choose a different material and spray paint it either dark green or black to match the garden.
Avoid plastic furniture, since a formal garden should look timeless.

, Formal gardens need more maintenance than other types of gardens, especially if you have hedges that need to be trimmed to keep a certain shape. Take care of your garden throughout the summer and give it touch-ups over the winter as you prepare for spring.


Use an edger to trim the grass away from your paths.
Weed your garden frequently to keep plants healthy and your garden looking neat.
After watering and working in the garden, put away the hose and gardening tools.
Sweep leaves and dirt off of the paths frequently.

"

Decide where to create a garden with wildflowers.,
Determine what types of wildflowers you want to plant.,
Obtain wildflower seeds.,
Prepare the soil.,
Till or rake the dirt about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.

,
Mix in some potting soil with a hoe, to enrich the garden dirt.,Plant your wildflower seeds in the spring when all danger of frost has passed.,
Sprinkle the seeds evenly in 1 direction.,
Press the seeds into the soil with a garden roller or gently walk on them with your feet, rather than burying the seeds.,
If needed, net off the place where you have sown the seeds.,
Water your wildflower seeds, being careful not to drown them.,
Mow the land area only after flowers have seeded.,
Start over the following spring.",How to Create a Wildflower Garden," Select a location that is similar to where the plants would grow in the wild. For instance, primrose grows along banks and rocky ridges, while Columbine prefers the shade of trees.


The size of the growing area is entirely up to you. It is best if you can set it aside to grow wild once the seeds have been sown, so perhaps consider placing it away from areas of the garden, yard or land that are frequently tended, such as lawns and vegetable plots.;
, When you grow a natural garden, it is best to select flowers that are local to your area.


Visit a local nature preserve to find out what types of wildflowers flourish in your area. Bring a notebook with you so you can write down names of flowers you enjoy, and note what flowers grow well together.
Find information about natural gardening online, at the library, or at your local nursery store.

, Purchasing wildflower seeds at a nursery, online or garden shop will ensure that you receive fertile and ready-to-grow seeds.

, When you grow a natural garden, you need to get the soil ready for the seeds. Clear out the vegetation where you want to create your garden. Use a hoe.

,, When you grow a natural garden, it needs to have nourishing soil.

,, Then plant them in the other direction to ensure adequate coverage when you create a natural garden.

, When you create a garden with wildflowers, you don't want the seeds planted too deep, because they may not develop.

, This will help to stop birds eating them. After a good amount of growth has happened (around 2 to 5 months), you can lift up the netting and let it grow., The seeds should start sprouting within two weeks, and then you may need to water them occasionally, especially during the driest months of summer.

, Mow the flower garden once after the flowers have seeded and just before spring. You should then have a patch full of color and habitat., Lift up a new area of turf next to the existing growing area and throw in additional wildflower seeds collected from the existing flowers. Doing this will ensure that the wildflowers spread and grow well.

Use a number of tall, striking plants.,
Plan on having a mixture of colors and textures.,
Add some mid-height and low growing plants.,
Consider including some interesting indigenous plants.,
Remember to include some evergreen plants to add interest year-round.,
Choose a sunny, sheltered, well-draining spot for your exotic plants.,
Think about how you intend to overwinter your plants.,
Wrap mature banana plants and certain species of palm over the winter.,
Move young banana plants and palm trees indoors over the winter.,
Plant a selection of hardier exotic plants to keep your garden interesting over the winter.,
Lift delicate tubers or bulbs and bring them indoors over the winter.,
Take precautions when planting poisonous exotic plants.,
Avoid planting prickly or spiky plants near benches or walkways.,
Don’t put shedding plants over decking or walkways.",How to Design an Exotic Garden," Exotic plants offer some really great architectural elements to the garden. When planning your garden, think about using some tall, striking plants such as Gunnera, Dicksonia Antarctica (which grows up to 3m in height) or Cordyline, that add both height and texture to the garden.;
, A mix of colors and textures is often particularly successful in an exotic garden. For example, try mixing green spiky plants such as Agave together with softer textured silver or blue grasses, and the striking red flowers of Bromeliad or Hibiscus.

, Add some mid-height plants such as Colocasia and Strelitzia (Bird of Paradise), as well as smaller lower-growing ones such as small Aloes. A few climbers such as Passionflower, Kiwi or Hedera will soften the look of the garden over time.

, Exotic plants will be complemented by plants that aren’t strictly exotic, but look as if they could be. Examples include Japanese Painted Ferns or Sweet Potato Vine.

, Remember to include evergreens for year-round interest, or your garden will look very bare over the winter months. Fatsia japonica or bamboo will provide year-round color and interest.

, Exotic plants will generally do better in a sunny, sheltered spot with rich well-drained soil. However, no matter how sheltered or sunny your garden is, it’s important to keep in mind that many varieties of exotic plants will need protection over the winter months.

, When you design your garden, it’s important to think about how you are going to overwinter your plants, or if you plan on overwintering them at all.


If you are growing Begonias, either treat them as annual plants (which live for one year only) or be prepared to bring them inside over the winter.
Plants such as Hibiscus or Bougainvillea will want to go into a greenhouse or conservatory for the coldest months of the year.
If you have limited space indoors, either be prepared to replace these plants every year or grow fewer of them.

, Mature banana plants and some species of palm can survive the winter outdoors in a sheltered position if wrapped up with something like rush screening or special plant wrapping fleece.


Design your garden so you can easily access these plants to wrap them when required. This means you should avoid planting underfoot so you don’t have to tread on other plants to access the plants that need wrapping.
You’ll also need access to all sides of the plant in order to wrap it up, so don’t plant it tight into a corner.
Once wrapped, the plant won’t be very attractive. Putting fairy lights inside the wrap can help raise the temperature inside on cold nights and also make it look more attractive.

, Young versions of palm and banana plants should be moved inside a greenhouse over the winter. If they are large and heavy, consider planting in large planters with trolley wheels attached. This makes it much easier to move them.

, Some exotic plants such as Bougainvilla and Passionflower will survive a mild winter outside from zones 8B and up. Consider making these hardier exotics the backbone of your garden.


This will minimize the work you need to do in the fall to prepare the garden for winter and help to keep your garden from looking completely desolate over the winter months.
The term ""zones"" refers the USDA plant hardiness scale, which divides the USA into 11 planting zones, according to their average annual minimum winter temperature. Find out which zone you live in by going to the National Gardening Association website and entering your zip code.

, Plants such as Caladium or Canna that grow from tubers or bulbs will benefit from being lifted and overwintered indoors. The bulbs or tubers can then be replanted outdoors again in spring.


Make sure you can easily access these plants to dig them up at the right time, or plant them in containers so you can locate them quickly and move them inside before winter.

, It’s important to remember that many tropical plants are poisonous and some, such as Caladium, can irritate the skin.


If you are concerned about children or animals eating or touching the plants, consider adding fencing to restrict their access, or choose plant varieties you know to be non-toxic.

, Avoid planting spiky plants close to seating areas or walkways, as these may catch in your clothing and cause a tear.


Additionally, children may cut or prick their fingers by grabbing onto sharp or prickly leaves.

, Plants that drop their leaves, flowers or fruit may be annoying if planted over decking or walkways as they can make the surface slippery and require regular cleaning up.

",How to Create a Vintage Style Garden Getaway," Try to think of your vintage style garden as an extra room in your house. What do you want to use it for? A quiet spot for a coffee in the sunshine? A shady spot out of the heat of the sun? Or a place to eat with friends or family?


Have a think about seating areas and plan your garden around these places so that you make best use of this outdoor space.
You might like to start with a bench, deckchairs, outdoor table and chairs, gazebo, or even a hammock, then plan the rest your garden in harmony with the position of these items of furniture.;
, The best approach to garden design is always to consider where the focal points are and how the eye moves around the space. Most gardens are square but the vintage garden should defy a ‘boxy’ look and be less rigid.


Soften the symmetry by putting any seating to one side and planting towards it so that the garden is focused around this visual point.
Consider where the eye will be facing when you are seated in the garden and arrange the planting scheme to best effect.

, If you have a large garden, try to have more than one point of focus. A table seating area, a bench in a different spot, and a small sculpture, pond or fountain are some ideas.


Think about how you use the ground surface to draw the eye to these focal points. A garden path can lead the eye to a seating area. Vary your ground surfaces to create a sense of there being different areas to the garden.
For example, a seating area may have paving but the rest of the garden could have a small lawn area and a different area covered in shale. This will add interest and create the impression different areas of the garden are for different activities, such as relaxing.

, It’s always better if the eye can’t perceive the entire garden at once. Consider making some areas hidden from view, making it necessary to move through the garden in order to take it all in.


If you can, make a hidden seating area invisible from the house or the outside street, this increases the sense of a calm space to get away from the world.
Consider using trellis screens, large planters with tall plants or use hedging to create a private, hidden space away from the world.

, Vintage style planting tends to be informal and romantic. You’ll see fewer spiky architectural or tropical plants in the vintage garden and more natural, softer looking displays.


You’ll sometimes hear garden designers refer to collections of plants as ‘cottage garden plants’. This isn't a precisely defined category of plants, but plants that are sometimes included in this style of garden include:
Bellflower, Columbine, Daisy, Delphiniums, Roses, Foxgloves, Lupins, Forget-me-not and Violets. You should void using plants that look too robust as this isn't the gentle effect you are creating.

, Cottage garden style planting tends to pack lots of plants into small spaces. Soften any hard edges in your garden (such as the sides of beds) by letting plants grow over the edging to soften and conceal it.


Soften corners by letting plants such as moss or Mexican Fleabane Daisy (Erigeron) invade cracks or by putting planters in. The idea is to prevent the eye being able to see the edges of the space.
Although the effect is crowded it has the curious result of distorting the sense of space so a tiny area can appear bigger because it isn't as easy to identify the shape and size of it.

, You shouldn't be able to see bare earth or hard surfaces such as paving slabs in the garden. Therefore, you should plant fast-growing plants and flowers that spread easily in order to cover these surfaces up.


Use trailing plants such as ivy or long grasses to conceal edges and right angles and to soften flat surfaces.
Try planting masses of tiny flowers that grow in drifts such as Baby’s Breath (gypsophila) or Lobelia to create a soft, dreamy effect.
Also grow plants that spread out, such as Snow in Summer (Cerastium) and Aubretia.

, Vintage style can mean some quirky and unexpected container choices. You might consider making planters out of old ceramic kitchen sinks – this works well with a plant display of Sedums.


Try painting an old wooden stepladder with chalk paint and arranging terracotta plant pots on the steps to introduce height to the garden. Old metal buckets or wheelbarrows also make good choices to repurpose as planters.
Because the idea is to introduce as many plants into a small area as possible, try raising plants to eye level by nailing planters to fences. You might use old oilcans or tea pots as planters, positioned at eye level.
Hanging baskets work well too. Try using plants that cascade down, such as ivy, trailing sweetpea or geranium.

, A collection of several small planters can work just as well as one large one. Aim to mix and match styles and sizes rather than have several planters of the same type.


Having an odd number of containers tends to work better than having an even number, as it creates a more natural, informal effect.
Make sure that whatever type of container you use has good drainage. If you aren't able to drill holes in the base, consider adding an inch or two of gravel to the bottom of the container to improve drainage.

, The vintage garden is all about softness, texture and muted color. Dress your garden with floral cushions, crochet throws, lace shawls and patchwork items.


Dress a small outside table with a lace tablecloth, or a vintage-style oilcloth in a dotted or floral print. Some vintage crockery will also work well with this.
Don’t be shy about including a cut flower arrangement in your garden. An old earthenware jug, milk bottle or even a jam jar will make a good vase in the vintage garden.

, Vintage style is all about being quirky, so consider making old tea cups or jam jars into candle holders for evenings in the garden.


You could also consider hanging a string or two of fairy lights overhead, as long as you have a convenient power outlet to connect them to.
You’ll need to bring some of these accessories inside when it rains, so make sure they are portable.

, Style your vintage garden using quirky vintage accessories to really capture the old style look you are after. Specific accessories that really work well in the vintage garden include:


Wooden or wrought iron furniture
Furniture painted with chalk paint or using distressed painting techniques
Wire planters
Wooded bird houses and feeders
Bunting, especially using old fashioned floral and stripe prints
Slate signs
Rustic garden tools used for display
Wire hanging baskets
Bird cages with plants inside
Picket fencing
Old kitchenware or porcelain sanitary ware used as planters
Wooden crates repurposed as planters
Outdoor mirrors in gothic frames

Bring out a pattern or design fully and clearly by using plants that are capable of providing a solid color effect.,
Select good quality foliage plants for creating the carpet bedding.,
Choose the layout design.,
Choose the color combination.,
Plant the plants.,
Care for the carpet bedding.",How to Create Carpet Bedding for the Garden," Mostly this effect will be achieved from the use of foliage rather than flowers - few flowering plants have blooms prolific enough to provide the desired consistent result, although they can often be used in combination with the ornamental foliage plants as a contrast and highlight.;
, The plants chosen should be healthy, strong-growers with a profusion of consistent color. Here is a selection of good plant varieties for creating a carpet bedding:



Coleus - in various shades of red, maroon, and scarlet, light and dark yellow, green and white, and other varieties.







Achyranthes - low-growing plants in mixtures of red, pink, yellow and green.







Centaurea gymnocarpa, ""Dusty Miller,"" - with finely-cut foliage of a cool gray.







Alternatheras - similar to Achyranthes in habit, but with red as a predominating color. Both are excellent for working out the finer details of a design.







Pyrethrum, ""Golden Feather"" - with feathery foliage of a tawny yellow.







Geranium Madame Salleroi - with pale green and white foliage. This is an excellent plant for use in carpet-bedding because of its close, compact habit of growth, and its very symmetrical shape, which is retained throughout the entire season without shearing or pruning.







, There are many possible layout designs. This step provides some examples that you might like to follow. Some of them may seem rather complicated, but when you get down to the business of actually laying them out, any possible complications should vanish in the doing. In laying out all but the star-shaped and circular beds, begin with a square as the basis to work from. Decide on the size of bed you propose to have, and then stake out a square as shown by the dotted lines in design No. 1, and work inside this square in filling in the details. If this is done, creating the carpet bedding will be much easier to achieve. In designing your layout, here are some ideas to inspire you:



Layout design 1 - easy to make, with many possible combinations and modifications. It is best to arrange the colors to suit your individual taste.







Layout design 2 - a division showing different spaces; a plain center with a plain point as shown in (a), shows the bed in its simplest form. In g, c, and d, these points have three different arrangements and the dotted line in the central portion indicates a change that can be made that will add considerably to the effectiveness of the design.







Layout design 3







Layout design 4







Layout design 5







Layout design 6







Layout design 7 - the simplest possible form of bed. This is designed for plants to be set in rows. In a bed of this kind, flowering plants can be used more effectively than in any of the others. Pink, white, and pale yellow Phlox would be very pretty in such a combination.







Layout design 8 - another very simple design. This design would be quite effective if each of the five sections were of a different color of Coleus. Or, the whole star might be of a solid color, with a border of contrasting color. Red Coleus with Madame Salleroi Geranium as a border would look well. So would yellow Coleus edged with Centaurea.







, Before deciding on any color combinations, make a rough diagram of whatever bed layout you select and color this to correspond with the material you have to work with. Seeing these colors side by side on paper will give you a better idea of the general effect that will result from any of your proposed combinations than you can get in any other way, and will allow you to test them, helping to avoid making some serious mistakes. If you have a computer design program that you can use easily, this may be another helpful alternative. Here are some interesting combinations to consider:


Ageratum, with its delicate lavender-blue flowers, is very attractive in combination with yellow Coleus






A pink Geranium surrounded with gray Centaurea makes a harmonious combination






Scarlet Salvia is very effective with yellow Coleus






A Canna of rich, dark green makes a fine center plant for a bed in which red Coleus served as a background. One of the dark copper-colored varieties has a good effect if surrounded with either yellow Pyrethrum or gray Centaurea.







, In setting these plants in the bed, be governed by the habit of each plant. Achyranthes and Alternathera, being the smallest, should be put about four inches apart. Give the Coleus about six inches of leeway, also the Centaurea. Allow eight inches for Madame Salleroi Geranium and Pyrethrum. These will soon meet in the row and form a solid line or mass of foliage.

, Caring for the carpet bedding is a key element to its success.



Tend the bedding weekly - it is recommended to tend the bedding at least weekly to remove any straggling branches and leaves that are impacting the lines and colors of the design. Run your pruning shears along this line and ruthlessly cut away everything that is not where it belongs. If this is not done on a regular basis, your ""pattern"" will soon become blurred and indistinct. If any intermingling of colors ""from across the line"" is allowed, all sharpness of outline will be destroyed.







Keep plants clipped - clip frequently to keep the plants dwarf and compact. Make it a point to keep larger-growing plants, such as Coleus, Pyrethrum and Centaurea, under six inches in height rather than over it. Alternatheras and Achyranthes will need very little shearing, as to top, because of their habit of low growth.







Remove dead or dying leaves and branches - pick these up regularly to keep the design in good shape.

Add some beach chairs or a hammock.For a more traditional look, use unpainted, wooden Adirondack chairs.For something more relaxed and tropical, consider a macramé hammock.

,
Consider adding a fire pit.,
Add some shade with an umbrella.,
Don't forget the lighting!",How to Design a Beach‐Themed Garden," There are lots of ways to interpret a beach theme, including nautical, rustic, and tropical. Each one will have its own set of colors, plants, and decorative elements. Choose one that appeals the most to you.;
, Most beach themes will be bright and colorful, but if you are going with a nautical theme, you might want to use a limited color palette instead. A tropical theme might include lots of bright colors, while a rustic theme might use softer ones.

, You can create a beach-themed garden just about anywhere—including in containers on a balcony and patio. The larger garden you have, the more options you will have. If you don't have a lot of space, however, you may not be able to plant some of the larger plants, such as palms.

, Not all types of plants work for a beach-themed garden. At the same time, not all plants will be well-suited to the area that you live in. You will need to find a balance between the two by first finding beachy plants, and then selecting the ones that will flourish in your area.

, Like all living things, plants require care. They need water, fertilizer, and pruning. Some plants, such as succulents, require a lot less care than others. If you don't have a lot of time to spare, consider selecting some low-maintenance plants for your garden.

, This will help reign in some of your ideas, and may help you decide between two different plants, pebbles, and decor. If you live close to a beach, you might even be able to scavenge some rocks, shells, and driftwood, saving yourself some material costs.


Instead of buying expensive decorations, consider making your own!

, Plants found along beaches have to survive harsh conditions, with varying temperatures, strong winds, and salty air. They have to be drought-tolerant as well.Great beachy plants include:Beach strawberry
Common thrift
Gold coin
Saffron buckwheat
Seaside daisy

, Great coastal trees include coast banksia and eucalyptus. They act as natural buffers for smaller plants on real beaches, and can make your beach garden look more beach-like.Small palm trees, such as Mexican fan palms, are a great option for tropical beach-themed gardens and side gardens., Examples of bushy shrubs include: coastal rosemary, diosma, and woolly bush.Plant taller bushes towards the back of your plant bed. Use smaller bushes near the front as groundcovers and borders.

, Not only are they beach-like, but they are also very hardy and don't require a lot of care. Great succulents include: agave, blue chalk sticks, and pigface (also called ""ice plant"").Plant different types of succulents together in batches for a variety of color and texture.

, Skip the green, bushy lawns, and pick out some scruffy, drought-tolerant grasses instead.Great coastal grasses include: coast tussock grass, fountain grass, and orange sedge., Not only will this be more aesthetically pleasing, but it will also look more natural. Many coastal plants like to grow close together for protection against the coast's harsh winds and climate., After you have planted your flowers in their preferred soil, top it off with a layer of sand. You could also consider a crushed seashell blend or granitic sand instead., You can scatter these about randomly, or use them as borders for your garden.You could even use large shells (real or cement) as planters for small to medium-sized plants. Sea urchins make great planters for succulents and air plants.

, Beautiful and organic, no two pieces are alike. You can make these special features in plant beds, or you can display them on your patio table instead.If you have any driftwood planks, you can use these as stepping stones to mimic paths found in beaches.

, Add a hint of rustic by using twine to hang up baskets and planters. Wrap twine around mason jars or candle votives. Add a rustic touch to wooden furniture by winding twine around the joints to make them look as through they are handmade.


If you have a lot of sea shells at home, drill some holes into them, then string them onto a piece of twine to make a garland. Hang the garland on a wall or in a window., Brainstorm some items that might be found at a beach, and incorporate them into your garden. Things like surfboards, life savers, wooden oars, and ship wheels are all good bets. Clear, glass gazing orbs (not the mirrored king) would also work well because they mimic sea glass.

, Another option is to use a synthetic wood made from recycled materials.Not only is this more environmentally friendly, but it also lasts longer.

, You can also use white or unpainted wood furniture, and then add color with bright tablecloths, pillows, and cushions.

,, These do especially well in front yards.You can also put one in your backyard instead, however. When filling it, consider white pebbles, or glass—be sure to use the type meant for fire pits, however!

, If you want something more tropical, consider getting an awning made from straw or palm leaves instead. This would work great paired with a hammock and some tiki torches.

, Candles are a great option for just about any garden, but you can also install other lighting features as well. For example:


If your have a tropical beach garden, consider getting some tiki torches.
If you have a rustic garden, consider getting some mason jar lanterns instead.

Pick a location for your garden.,
Sketch out a plan for your garden.,
Determine your plant hardiness zone.,
Make sure you have nutrient-rich, well-drained soil.,
Select flowers for your garden.,
Pick flowers with a rustic vibe.,
Decide on a color scheme.",How to Create a Rustic Flower Garden1," Look at your yard, and decide where you would like to put the garden. Your garden should be somewhere where you can easily see it and appreciate its beauty, preferably from both inside and outside your home.Also think about some of the following:

Does the area you have in mind get enough sunlight for the type of flowers you want?
Does the area have good soil drainage, or does it tend to accumulate a lot of standing water after rainstorms and snow thaws?
Is your potential gardening area on relatively flat or gently sloping ground? It is much more difficult to plant on steep slopes.;
, It’s easier to plan if you can visualize what you want. Make a quick sketch of your property, indicating any buildings, decks and patios, the driveway, fences, or any other major features. Also mark in any pre-existing gardens, shrubs, or trees.Once you’ve made your starting sketch, you can start roughing in your ideas for flower beds.
In addition to flowers, try sketching in other elements you’d like to add to your garden, like stone walkways and borders, fences, trellises, or garden sculptures.

, Once you’ve come up with a basic design for your garden, it’s time to decide on your flowers. The first step is to find out what kinds of flowers can thrive in your area.

If you live in the US, determine your plant hardiness zone by looking at the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map: http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/homegardening/scene74a6.html

You can find information about plant hardiness zones in areas outside the US here: https://www.gardenia.net/guides/climate-zones

Once you know your hardiness zone, keep it on hand when you are researching potential plants for your garden. If you select plants that are outside your hardiness zone, they may not survive the temperature extremes of winter and summer.

, You will need to know what kind of soil you have before you start selecting and planting flowers. Good soil should be fluffy, dark, and rich in nutrients for your plants. It should also have good drainage, since most plants don’t thrive well in overly damp or boggy soil.Take a sample of your soil to a garden store in your area to have its pH and nutrient levels evaluated.
If necessary, you can modify the composition of your soil by adding fertilizer, pH-altering substances like lime or sulfur, or other components.

, After you’ve evaluated your space and the type of planting environment you have, it’s time for the fun part – choosing your flowers. First, narrow down your selection to plants that work with your hardiness zone, soil type, and the amount of available sunlight in your garden. Then, consider some of the following:

What sorts of colors do you want in your garden? Depending on your personal style, you might want a rainbow of colors, or a more limited palette (e.g., different shades of blue and yellow).
Are you interested in flowers that attract pollinating insects, like honey bees and butterflies?
Do you want tall, short, or medium-height flowers, or a mixture?

, While the types of flowers you select will be largely determined by your zone, some varieties may give your garden a more casual, rustic feel than others. A few good choices include:Hollyhocks. These tall, brightly-colored flowers are an excellent choice for planting along walls and fences. They are hardy in zones 3-9.
Hydrangeas. These are low, broad shrubs that produce massive, spherical clusters of delicate flowers, typically ranging in color from white to pastel blue, pink, or purple. They are hardy in zones 4-9.
Roses. These classic flowers make a gorgeous and fragrant addition to any garden. They come in a wide variety of colors and sizes, from big red “El Toro” roses to tiny pastel tea roses. Depending on the variety, they can thrive in a number of hardiness zones.
Coneflowers. These sturdy, daisy-like flowers come in a variety of colors, including white, pale purple, and crimson. They are also attractive to birds and butterflies. They are hardy in zones 3-9.
Catmint. This fragrant herb is easy to grow, produces delicate sprays of purple flowers with attractive silvery foliage, and has the added benefit of repelling mosquitoes. It is hardy in zones 4-8.

, While the term “rustic” tends to conjure up warm, muted, earthy tones, you need not feel limited to these kinds of colors in your garden. Think about how the colors of the flowers you pick might look together, and how they will complement the colors that already exist around your home and yard.

Cool, pale pastels can give your garden a dreamy, fairy-tale look.
Warm reds, oranges, and gold tones give a garden a homey, comforting feel, especially in the summer and autumn.
Bright, gem-like colors, like vibrant reds, yellows, blues, and purples, can create an attractive complement to dark or muted colors on your property.

"
Mark out your flower beds.,
Prepare your soil.,
Arrange flowers by height.,
Plant flowers in natural-looking groups.,
Install a trellis for climbing flowers.,
Mix in planters with ground-planted flowers.",How to Create a Rustic Flower Garden2," Before you start planting, mark out the edges of your planned flower beds. You can do this with a garden hose, or even with a little flour or lime. Plan to make your beds at least 2-3 feet (.6-.9 meters) wide, so there is plenty of room for your flowers.Flower beds can be laid out along fences, walls, or the edges of walkways. You can also build circular flower beds around the bases of trees.
You can also build an “island” flower bed in the middle of your lawn.

, Once you have marked out where your beds will be, prepare the areas for planting. This will involve clearing out any plants that are already growing in the area, and making sure the soil is aerated and full of nutrients.

Dig up the top 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of sod, making sure to dig out all grass and weeds by the roots.
Break up and turn over the soil with a shovel or rotary tiller. Remove any rocks or other large objects that you dig up.
If you need to, add fertilizer, compost, or other components to the soil.
Turn the soil again, and lightly water it.

, In general, your garden will look best if you place the tallest flowers at the back of the bed, and the shortest at the front. This way, your view of (and access to) the shorter flowers will not be blocked by the taller ones.For flowers planted in an “island” bed, taller flowers can be placed in the center, with shorter flowers around the edges.

, For a rustic, spontaneous look, try not to plant your flowers in rigid formations or patterns. Avoid extremely straight rows and groups of alternating colors. Instead, plant your flowers in loose clusters (small, circular groups) or drifts (long, loose rows) of intermingling colors., A wood or wrought-iron trellis can add an attractive rustic touch to your garden. Dress up a plain wall or fence in your yard by setting up a trellis and planting it with climbing roses or morning glories.

If you don’t want to buy or build an elaborate trellis, you can try making trellises from repurposed objects, like vintage wagon wheels or old gardening tools., You can add interest to your garden by putting a few planters in among the flowers in your beds. Try planting some trailing flowers or vines in a wooden keg barrel."
"
Give your flower beds a decorative border.,
Decorate with repurposed objects.,
Add a stone or gravel path.,
Install birdhouses.",How to Create a Rustic Flower Garden3," After your beds are planted, you can give them an attractive edge using stones, logs, or bricks.

For a uniquely beautiful rustic garden border, try making a woven wood garden border.This can be done by weaving pruned raspberry canes along bamboo supports, using a basic basket-weaving technique.

, Giving your garden a rustic touch can be as simple as adding a few repurposed tools and objects.You might try:

Putting a planter in a wheelbarrow.
Lining up some flower pots on an old wooden bench.
Leaning some vintage garden or farm tools (like rakes or pitchforks) against a wall and allowing vines to creep up them.
Placing flower pots on the rungs of a wooden step-ladder.

, A winding path is a beautiful and welcoming addition to a garden. While garden paths can be made with pavers or concrete, a more informal and truly rustic effect can be achieved with one of the following:Stepping stones. This will look most natural if you use unfinished, irregular slabs of stone. Ideally, your stones should be 12-18 inches (30.5-45.7 cm) across, and about 2 inches (5 cm) thick. You can get stones like these from a landscape supplier.
Gravel or mulch. For this kind of path, all you need is some landscape fabric to put underneath your material, and metal or plastic edging to keep it in place.

, Birdhouses are beautiful in themselves, and will also attract birds to your garden. Birdhouses can be installed on fences or walls in your garden, or set on a post or upright log installed in one of your flower beds.You might encourage vines or other climbing plants to grow up around your birdhouse.
Don’t forget to install a couple of bird feeders, as well.

"
"
Consider environmental factors as well as convenience and visibility when selecting a garden site.,
Select a site that is easy to reach for maintenance.",How to Create a Perennial Garden1,"
The majority of perennial plants need about 10 hours of sun every day during the summer, but some need partial or full shade. If you don't choose a sunny location for your garden, you'll have fewer options about which plants you can grow.



 


Check for good soil drainage. You want soil to drain water at the rate of about a foot an hour to prevent root rot.






Choose a location that has plenty of air circulation. This limits diseases in perennial plants.





;
, You want to be able to reach your plants from a minimum of 2 sides.

"
"
Measure the site you've chosen for your garden.

,
Draw the garden site to scale on graph paper.,
Choose your perennial plants and decide where to put them.,
Specify the locations where clusters of the same plant will be planted.,
Leave enough space between plants to accommodate growth.",How to Create a Perennial Garden2,", Include the shape of the garden bed plus landmarks like trees, bushes, fences, and walls.

,


Vary the color of the flowers and foliage. Plan to put the same kind of plant in several places so the colors will repeat. This creates more visual appeal.
Place plants according to height. The tallest plants should go in the back or center of the garden and the shortest in the front or around the edges.
Plant perennials with varied blooming schedules so your garden will display colorful flowers throughout the year.
Consider the light requirements of the plants. You may be able to arrange your plants so the tallest receive full sun while the shortest plants are shaded. Generally, however, you will have to limit your choices according to how much sun the garden gets.

, Show each plant in the cluster.


Clusters consisting of odd numbers of plants arranged in triangular patterns are the most visually appealing.

,


Small plants need 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) between them
Medium-sized plants need 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) between them.
Tall plants need 18 to 36 inches (45 to 90 cm) between them.

"
"
Strip grass and plants from the spot you've selected for the garden bed.

,
Put edging around the bed.,
Amend the soil with organic materials.,
Blend a phosphorus fertilizer into the soil.",How to Create a Perennial Garden3,", This adds visual appeal and keeps the grass from invading the garden.

, Incorporate compost, aged manure or sphagnum peat to a depth of 1 foot (30 cm). Buy 3 cubic yards (2.75 cubic meters) of organic material per 1,000 square feet (93 square meters) of garden.

, Use a superphosphate fertilizer if the soil tests low in phosphorus.

"
"
Plant perennials early enough in the year so they can get established before winter.,
Leave perennials in their containers until planting time.,
Take care with the planting level.,
Water the perennial plants thoroughly and water often for the first two weeks afterward.",How to Create a Perennial Garden4," They will not bloom in the year that you plant them, but they may bloom the next year.

, This keeps the roots from drying out.

, Plant perennials in the ground at a level matching the level they had in the pot. Planting at the same level, and not deeper, allows the roots to breathe.

, You may need to add more soil after the first watering.

Plan your memory garden depending upon available space.,
Select a spot that is visible from your home.,
Create boundaries for your space.,
Decide on an ideal atmosphere for your garden.,
Select colors for your garden.,
Encourage wildlife to visit.,
Provide a place to sit.,
Personalize the garden to honor someone's memory.,
Incorporate personal effects into the garden.,
Plant your loved one's favorite flowers.,
Consider using seasonal plants.,
Choose plants based on location.",How to Create a Memory Garden," Use a place connected to your memory of your loved one, if possible. A corner of your deck or patio could serve as a small memory garden if you don't have a lot of space. Consider how much privacy you would like to have and select a location that fulfills these needs.


The commemorative garden can be large or small, depending upon the size of your yard or designated space and the amount of work you want to put into it.;
, Place the garden where it can be seen from a window or covered porch, if such space is available. That way, you can enjoy the view of it even during bad weather.If you are fortunate to have a decent view of mountains, a beach, or a river, think about locating your memory garden there.

, Set boundary markers for the garden, such as a ring of small stones or a fence. You can even use personal items of the loved one, such as hiking poles, to denote boundaries. This will make the garden feel more secluded and special.

, Add a soothing water feature and wind chimes to your memorial garden for an even more relaxing atmosphere. Set up outdoor speakers if you would like to listen to music while you are in your garden., If you want a quiet place where you can meditate or find peace, use soft colors, such as light blues, yellows, and pinks. You might instead want your memory garden to be a place of inspiration and hope, incorporating brighter colors, such as red and orange, and adding playful statuary.

, Provide bird or squirrel feeders or bird baths to enhance the flora and fauna. If you hope to attract butterflies, set up sugar water and fruit while you’re in the garden.

, Whether you want to invite others into your garden, or simply want to spend time there alone, use chairs or benches to increase comfort and allow for moments of reflection. Seating will invite people to stay awhile.

, Dedicate your garden to your loved one by considering their personality traits, special interests and accomplishments, using these to inspire decorations. Add statuary and features that represent your loved one's interests.


Use a statue of a dog, for instance, to honor a dog lover. Use stepping stones with paw prints and perhaps include a water source that dogs would be able to drink from.
A small putting green could be used as a memorial garden for an avid golfer. Use dwarf mondo grass to represent a green and make a pea gravel sand trap.

, To make the space symbolic, you can inscribe your loved one's favorite quote on a stone or plaque. Either a photograph sealed in a weather-proofed frame or an original piece of art could also be meaningful additions to your memory garden.

, If you do not know their favorite plant, use flowers that bloom in the person's favorite colors. You can also choose to plant flowers that have symbolic meanings, such a forget-me-nots for 'memory' and lilies for 'purity.'Use delicate flowers in a small memory garden for a baby or child. Daisies represent innocence, so plant those if you want your garden to be symbolic.
Honor a veteran by planting flowers in patriotic colors around a commemorative plaque or stone.

, If your loved one enjoyed a certain season of the year more than the others, plant flowers or trees that bloom during that time of year. Plant tulip bulbs and a spring-flowering shrub if the person loved springtime, for instance., Be sure that the location you choose will support the types of plants you want to grow. Sun-loving plants need 6-8 hours of sun per day, while shade-lovers need protection from the sun. Research to learn which types of plants grow best in your climate.

"
"
Decide what the purpose of your garden will be.,
Think about where your garden will be.,
Make a map of your garden.,
Do more research.,
Buy the seeds and pots.,
Care for the young plants.,
When they are too big for the pot, transfer the plants into their designated spots outside.,
If you are growing food, wait until the plants are at their peak of perfection, then harvest them.,
Care for your garden until the end of the season.",How to Create a Dream Garden," Are you going to plant vegetables to eat, or will you plant flowers? Maybe you want to plant both. Make sure that you have this in order before you start anything.;
, Now that you know what you want to plant, you need to decide where your garden will reside. Think about how much sunlight the certain area of your yard will get, and if it fills up with water when it rains, like a basin. Depending on the contents of your garden, you will need to conduct some research to find out exactly how much sunlight and water a specific plant needs. Remember, all plants are different. Some require certain amounts of sunlight and water, and it is vital that you are aware of this.

, Now that you know what you are planting and you have a rough idea of where each of your plants are going to live, you need to get it straight in your head for less confusion later. Take the size of your available space and the size of the plot of land that should be devoted to a certain plant into consideration.

, Find out exactly how much water a plant needs. You may need to water plants at different times of the day in order to give each plant the attention it needs and deserves. Make sure you record this for future knowledge.

, Carefully plant each seed in a terra cotta pot with potting soil, and the correct amount of water if the plant’s growth calls for it.

, Make sure they are exposed to enough sunlight and water. It may take a while for the plants to sprout, but you can’t rush it.

, Transferring a plant can be dangerous for the plant’s life, but if you do it right, then the plant will grow to be healthy and strong in your garden.

, Use them as ingredients for salads and sauces, give them as gifts to neighbors and family, or steam them and coat them in butter. If you followed these steps correctly, you will have delicious vegetables for your table.

, Hopefully, they will grow back the next year for another spring and summer.

Decide if a minimalist garden is right for you.,
Gain space and use artificial highlights.,
Make the plants a bold feature but allow the hard landscape features tie the whole design together.,
Use similar materials in sculpture and furniture.,
Use lighting to great effect.,
Use water to create serenity.,
Get professional assistance.,
Use industrial elements to create a minimalist tidiness.,
Use horizontal juniper.,
Keep the symmetry front and back.",How to Create a Minimalist Garden," A minimalist garden design suits a a person who is looking for a clean, smart, low maintenance garden. Young urban professionals, minimalist house enthusiasts, people who travel frequently, the weeding-phobic etc. are likely to find this type of garden ideal. It should feature sculptures, architectural planting, and great vistas. All this adds up to an area you can both entertain and relax in.;
, A well designed minimalist garden can effectively provide you with an extra room. The need for plants is minimal as you are aiming to create a structure as much as a garden, so use artificial materials to create a bold, crisp landscape.

, Plants are indeed key to a minimalist design, but it should be the hard landscape features which tie it together.

, Allow these to be echoed in the paving.

, Perhaps set lighting into the patio, to alter the garden's mood as you enter the twilight hours. This enables the garden to serve as both a day and evening garden.

, Water can be used, but it should be calm and sedate which helps to create great reflective qualities. This photo shows a design based on the unfurling frond of a tree fern; it bisects the garden.

, It is important to work with a good professional gardener and landscaper in order to realise your are ideas. Do not be afraid to provide any professional with your own input and inspiration.

, Steel, glass, and concrete are all materials heavily featured in many minimalist gardens. This ""industrial"" basis does not mean it has to be stark and unwelcoming, though a good knowledge of how to utilise these materials is essential. For example, use:


Wood for functionality






Corrugated iron swirls for drama






Mirrored panels for an ever-changing play of light and space enhancement in the garden







, A coarse and sharp plant, it is really low-maintenance and has a great fragrance when the sun heats it. It is not only a great feature bush in a minimalist garden but it also acts as a living mulch. It keeps the water in the ground and it suppresses weeds. This means that it is acting as a barrier. It makes a good foil against a tree, such as a Eucalyptus tree.

, The front garden should always mimic the back, perhaps carrying on any features such as sculpture or water. This photo shows the use of box (buxus) balls that have been planted very tightly together at the front of the house. They are very low maintenance plants and easy to look after.


The water design is also carried on in the front garden; minimalist water feature on shale and slate. This is a very effective, subtle water feature with no fish or running water, just very simple.

Choose boronia.,
Grow the native frangipani (hymenosporum flavum).,
Grow the mint bush.,
Choose other fragrant plants.",How to Create a Garden of Fragrant Australian Plants," Without a doubt, this is one of the best known Australian fragrant plants. The best choice with the strongest fragrance is the brown variety. The pink variety (Boronia floribunda) has a slight fragrance that is hard to detect. The Sydney native rose (Boronia serrulata) is another choice but also of faint fragrance.;
, It grows into a tree with very fragrant flowers.

, It has a mint-like fragrance coming from the foliage. It has lovely flowers (blue or white).

, Visit the local nursery to ask for their advice about other fragrant natives suitable for your region. Some additional ideas include: P. ovalifolia; P. rotundifolia; P. incisa; and P. teretifolia. These plants all have varying shades of pink, purple and mauve and like to grow in a sunny or slightly-shaded position.

These types of gardens are informal and composed of a wide variety of plants and herbs. Herbs such as basil, thyme, oregano, and rosemary are often components of cottage along with flowers. Traditionally, cottage or country gardens were kept close to the house or cottage for easy access.



 


Shrubs and small flowering trees are often included in the country or cottage garden.






Plants include a widely diverse mixture of annual and perennial flowers which are suitable for the climate and native to the area.






Plants are grouped closely together and spill out onto walkways and other areas. This type of garden is a bit ""messy"" and gives a feeling of wildness and abundance.





;
, Of course, any plants can be used as long as they are not too exotic or hard to grow.

Cone flowers, black-eyed Susans, cosmos, lavender, hollyhock, iris, daisies, roses, sunflowers, Dianthus, zinnias, and snapdragons are among the many traditional varieties of flowers grown in a cottage garden.






Roses and other flowering shrubs add vibrant color to your cottage garden. Rose of Sharon (perennial hibiscus) or crape myrtle are hardy shrubs you might include as they require little care once established.






Small fruit trees evoke a country garden feel, provide blossoms in the spring and fruit at harvest.







,,,, Use a variety of types and styles for both visual appeal and variety of birds and other wildlife.

, With your cottage garden close to the house, you can easily step outside to pick a tomato or cucumber for lunch.

, Usually, cottage gardens include plants which are easy to propagate. Divide lilies and iris. Gather seeds and cuttings and start more plants to pass along to neighbors and friends so they can start their own cottage gardens.

,

Park an antique bicycle in your garden and put a flower pot in the basket. Use wrought iron chairs and tables to hold tubs or pots of flowers or herbs. You might even use a pair of old rain boots as planters to add charm and personality.






An old bathtub or canoe can be used as planters. Be sure you allow for drainage.

Prepare a fertilizer plan.,Catch the drain water for a water analysis.,
Fill the slabs.,Fill the slabs with the fertilizer plan.,Drip with an EC from 1.8 till 2.0 and pH from 5.6.,Drip till the slabs are saturated, or even a little bit overflowing out of the plant holes.,Drain the slabs after 12 to 24 hours.,Make sure that there are enough drain holes in the slabs, 1 between every plant, 1 at begin and end of the slab.,Drip after that, 1 liter (0.3 US gal) a plant / dripper, with an EC value (fertilizer plan), which you like to start off in the crop.,
After the planting, bring 35% from the potassium back in the fertilizer plan (based on a regular fertilizer plan).,
Drip during the season with longer drip rounds.,Drip the double concentration of a pesticide on coco then rock wool, when you have to use it, because the organic structure of the slab, coco binds pesticide.,Stop on the average a little bit earlier with dripping at the end of the day then by rock wool.",How to Use Cocopeat Grow Slabs for Hydroponics Growing1," Fill a couple of slabs with clean water. Let them stand for 24-hours. Drain the slabs. Some hours after draining, add some clean water on the slabs.
,, Based on the numbers, you make a fertilizer plan, without potassium and 15% extra iron and manganese. Keep in mind the need for more calcium.,,,,,,,

Start off with a 0.2 higher drip EC.

Make a new fertilizer plan based on the results.
Begin frequent water (short shots), so you prevent drying out of the blocks through the coco slabs.
When necessary to control the plant, you can stop with dripping water for a couple of days, when the plants are fully rooted in.

, Always put extra (15%) iron and manganese in. Keep an eye on the first drain of the day, coco start draining when it is 100% saturated, this means coco drains average later (rock wool drains a little gradually). Coco has over the average a higher pH (don't worry). The plants grow on the average more vegetative on coco; adjust the temperature to it.,,"

Charge the Soilteck cocopeat slabs.,
Fill the bags until they are full of water, and leave for approx.,
Fix the nutrient levels.,
Perfect the watering strategy.",How to Use Cocopeat Grow Slabs for Hydroponics Growing2," Cocopeat is very high in Potassium, but low in Calcium. It is therefore necessary to charge the bag with high levels of Calcium to bring these levels in proper balance. To do this, charge solution is changed so that the amount of Potassium used is replaced by the same amount of Calcium Nitrate. For example, if your solution required 200kg of Potassium Nitrate and 250kg of Calcium Nitrate, you would replace the 200kg of Potassium Nitrate with Calcium Nitrate. This would give you a total of 450kg of Calcium Nitrate and no Potassium Nitrate., 48 hours or longer, if possible. Cut at the bottom of the bag as per your drain holes., Once planted, the feed solution will return to normal, however, it is recommended that the calcium level of the solution is increased by 20% for the first three weeks.

The recommended levels for pH and E.C. are as follows:
pH = 5.8 as the coconut has a tendency to be more acidic
E.C. = 3.5 – 4.0
Recommended Nutrient Levels for Cucumbers in Coconut (in ppm):

Chloride: 20 – 40
Nitrate: 250 – 350
Ammonium: 0.1 – 3
Sulfate: 300 – 500
Phosphorus: 50 – 75
Calcium: 350 – 450
Potassium: 350 – 450
Sodium: 10 – 40
Boron: 0.8
Iron: 1.2
Manganese: 0.5
Magnesium: 50 – 80
Copper: 0.05
Zinc: 0.4
Molybdenum: 0.05


These levels may vary based on your level of conductivity particularly in the major elements. Initially, the pH in the bags may fall to levels below 5.0. This occurs as the organic matter in the bag begins to break down. Low pH has shown no adverse effects on the crop, but it is recommended that the feed pH be held on the higher side just below 6.0. as watering amounts increase the pH in the bag will also increase.

, The watering strategy for cocopeat growbag differs from that of rockwool growing medium. Due to the nature of Coconut Coir and its capillary action the bags should be watered at low frequency and higher duration times. Total water volumes will remain the same or slightly lower but delivery of the solution will be in larger volumes per watering.

In early crop plantings it is recommended that moisture levels in the Cocopeat Growbags be kept low as root development in Coconut Coir can be quite rapid and large. This may result in Odeima if water levels are allowed to remain high in low light conditions. After the plant is put on the bag it is recommended that watering should occur only until the roots are established in the Growbag. Watering should then stop until the roots are thoroughly established in the Growbag, reaching the bottom of the bag.
Once this has occurred, normal watering may commence but with little leachate, about 10% maximum. When fruit development begins, water can then be increased to a 20% leachate. Water quantities per Growbag will depend on environment and plant development.

Flowers and vegetable plants look very nice in a mixed container garden. Don't think you have to choose 1 or the other.







, Visit a garden supply store for traditional pots and containers, or use your imagination to convert any box that can hold water into a potential plant holder.


Hanging planters are great for cucumbers and other trailing vines.






Untreated wood boxes can also be used. Keep them narrow enough that you can reach the middle of the box from any side. You can also add a platform to the box to sit on as you work.







, Cut out the various shapes of your boxes, keeping them to the same scale as your garden area. Move the boxes around the garden to decide what to plant where.

, The seeds will usually be shipped immediately, and the plants will arrive at the optimum time for planting in your region.

Add the proper elements to your garden.",How to Build a Japanese Garden," Zen gardens, also known as Japanese rock gardens, are designed to be dry. They are typically comprised of different sized boulders, gravel, sand, and rocks. Boulders and rocks represent islands and the sand and gravel are meant to represent water, which is why wave designs are typically drawn in the sand and gravel., Zen gardens are typically made on flat and leveled landscapes, so it's important that you choose the flattest possible piece of land. You may need to level the land yourself with a bit of digging and dirt packing. These gardens are typically made in the shape of a square.


Zen gardens can vary in size, so how big you make it is completely up to you. Zen gardens are often used for meditation, so make the garden big enough for you to meditate in.
Since Zen gardens are dry gardens, you should remove existing grass or flowers from the area in which you are building your garden. Natural moss, small trees, and shrubbery are the types of plants typically found in Zen gardens. If you have these types of plants, do not remove them.
If you need to level your own land, use a carpenter's level to make sure that you've made your ground as even as possible., Start by creating a border around your Zen garden with rocks and boulders. This will help keep your gravel and sand inside of your designated Zen garden, and stop it from spreading all over the rest of your yard. After you've lined your Zen garden with rocks, spread a layer of gravel or sand over the bottom of your garden (it should be 3-4 inches thick). Then, place different sized rocks and boulders throughout the rest of the garden.Rocks are typically placed in small groupings throughout the garden, as this creates a simple and polished look. Your rocks and boulders should vary in size from very large to small.

, Zen gardens are simplistic and typically include limited plant life – mostly moss, small trees, and shrubbery. Besides this limited addition of plants, the main focus of Zen gardens is the raked gravel symbolizing streaming water. Don't add too many elements, as Zen gardens are meant to be simple and relaxing.


If you do not have natural trees or moss in the area of your Zen garden, add a few small potted plants to the garden. Small shrubs and bamboo plants make for good additions to your Zen garden., It is important to rake your gravel or sand so that it replicates flowing water, as this is a key element to a proper Zen garden. You can use a regular garden rake to pull designs through your sand or gravel. It's best to use a rake that has larger, wider set teeth, as this will create a better, more legible design.


Use a broom, or a broom handle, to perfect the grooves created by the rake. Once the grooves are created with a rake, use a broom or broom handle to press down into the grooves. This will make the grooves deeper and easier to see. The bristle end of a broom is typically thicker and makes wider, softer indentations than the handle of a broom would. The handle end of a broom is normally thinner and is easier to use when making smaller, tighter designs.
The water designs are meant to be calming and relaxing, so creating them should also be a relaxed process. Slowly and carefully pull your rake through the gravel to create beautiful designs.
You can create circular designs, straight designs, or flowing designs. This is your garden, so create whichever designs are the most beautiful to you.
Raking should be a part of the regular maintenance of the garden, done as a form of meditation rather than a chore. Touch up your water designs every week., Traditional Japanese tea gardens are divided into two areas that are separated by a simple barrier, such as a small gate or a wall of rocks. This barrier should also have an opening to walk through. The outer garden is meant to be a pathway into the tea ceremony, and the inner garden is where the tea ceremony takes place. Often, the inner garden contains a tea house. The purpose of a tea garden is to get into a peaceful state of mind before beginning a tea ceremony.The inner garden is the main focus of a tea garden, as this is where the tea ceremony takes place. The outer garden can be as large or small as you'd like it to be. It should, at the very least, be a walkway into the tea house.
These gardens can be on flat or hilly pieces of land. However, you should create a flat surface to build your tea house on.

, The outer garden of a tea garden serves as a pathway to the inner garden. Outer gardens generally include a pathway to the inner garden, a few simple shrubs and plants, and some type of water element (such as a waterfall, small pond, or fountain). Traditionally, tea gardens were kept deliberately natural and woodsy to provide a calming transition between the outer world to a tranquil tea ceremony.


The pathways are typically made out of flat stones or wooden planks. This pathway can be as long or short as your space allows, and can be set up in a straight or winding path.
Plants in the outer garden should be informal. Do not include bright plants or flowers. Instead, stick to mosses, shrubs, and trees that would be found in nature.
Include a few lanterns to light the pathway for nighttime tea ceremonies., Ritual cleansing is important in a tea garden, as it purifies a person before they begin their tea ceremony. A stone water basin (a tsukubai) should be placed in an area between the outer and inner gardens where visitors can wash their mouth and hands. These basins are typically built low to the ground so that visitors must crouch or kneel to cleanse themselves. Crouching or kneeling is also viewed as a sign of respect.


The cleansing area should be right before one enters into the inner garden. You must cleanse yourself before entering the inner garden., A small gate or wall of rocks is usually built to separate the outer garden from the inner garden. The wall represents official entry into the tea garden, a place of relaxation and peace from the outside world. You can purchase a small wooden or metal gate to install, or you can make a small wall out of rocks and boulders.


Build a simple fence out of bamboo. Insert bamboo poles into the ground, and pack dirt or cement around the base of each one to hole it in place. Once you have your posts in place, attach bamboo support poles between each post. Look at Build a Wood Fence for detailed instructions on how to build a bamboo fence.

, Tea gardens are meant to be simple and serene, so only use natural plants and materials to build the inner garden.The plants used in inner gardens should be ferns, mosses and shrubs. It's acceptable to place one flowering plant inside the actual teahouse., The inner garden's focal point should be a tea house. Your tea house doesn't have to be a completely built house; it can simply be a wooden structure with beams and some type of roof. Use natural woods to build your tea house so that it flows with nature. Your tea house should include a sitting area with a low table for you and your visitors to enjoy your tea.


If you'd like, you can place pillows or cushions on the ground of your teahouse for you and your guests to sit on.

, During the Edo Period, the wealthier class of Japan enjoyed a great deal of extravagance and recreation. Strolling gardens with ponds, islands and hills were built on large pieces of land. These gardens usually included a circular trail that allowed people to enjoy the garden from many different perspectives. Many strolling gardens served as extravagant entrances (or the outer gardens) of tea gardens., Strolling gardens require more space than other types of Japanese gardens, making them the least practical type of Japanese garden for most people. However, if you happen to have a huge backyard or a giant piece of land, a strolling garden may be perfect for you. These gardens usually feature a large variety of features – from ponds and rivers to pathways and hills (sometimes artificial hills) – which also makes them one of the most expensive types of Japanese gardens to build., Many strolling gardens rely on artificial landscape to make them extremely beautiful and surreal. You should create a pond or river if your property doesn't already have one, as these gardens always have some type of water element. You should also add some hills to your strolling garden if your property is naturally flat. You'll also need to plan a strolling path for your garden. This will help your garden to look like a traditional Japanese strolling garden.


Plan your garden on paper before actually creating it. This will help you map out all of the work that needs to be done, and help you determine whether or not you need to hire contractors to help you.

, If you plan on adding artificial landscapes, such as small bodies of water or hills, you may need to hire professionals to help you. Artificial hills are usually created by adding mounds of packed dirt to your land, and planting grass on top of these mounds. The goal is to make these new hills a natural part of your existing landscape. Creating a river or pond may be a bit more challenging, as you'll need to dig out chunks of land and transform them into bodies of water. These are big landscaping tasks, and getting professional help is recommended., After you've built your hills and water elements, you should build a strolling path into your garden. You can use gravel, pebbles, wooden planks, or large stepping stones to make your walkway. Your path should flow nicely through your garden.

, Whereas the other types of Japanese gardens are usually more natural, strolling gardens can be a bit more extravagant. Decorate your garden with benches, large statues or sculptures, incorporate bright, flowering plants, line your pathway with beautiful lanterns, add a few fountains throughout your garden, etc., Courtyard gardens typically incorporate simple non-flowering plants, a dry stream (made with sand or gravel), and small water elements (such as a fountain). They are usually easy to make and easy to maintain. These gardens are typically meant to be viewed, but not entered., Despite their name, you don't need an actual courtyard to create a courtyard garden. Traditional courtyard gardens are designed for smaller, confined spaces, which makes areas like rooftops, porches, or terraces perfect for them. It's also recommended to incorporate plants that don't require much sunlight, as this will give you more options when choosing a location for your garden.

, Using a combination of rocks and plants, create a border for your courtyard garden. This will help you and your visitors distinguish where your garden begins. Once you've created the border for your garden, you can begin decorating it with sand, additional rocks and plants, as well as a simple tree or fountain.

, It's easiest to use potted plants in courtyard gardens, as this will allow you to build your garden almost anywhere. Choose plants that require little to no sunlight, such as ferns and palm plants. Pour sand or gravel onto the ground of your courtyard garden, and create a dry stream by raking a water design into it. Incorporate a few rocks, a small tree, or a fountain for additional scenery."

The size of the pan you use depends on how many plants you think you will grow, but should be at least 6 to 8 inches deep to offer a growing medium for your plants. You can always use more than one pan if you run out of room in the first pan.For a good leak-proof pan, you might try a kitty litter pan. Make sure the pan is set out in natural daylight, outside, or in a greenhouse, or you will need to use a grow light
You can find a leak-proof pan at a supermarket, pet store, or gardening store.;
, Locate or purchase several small pots to be placed inside of the pan. The seeds will be planted into these pots. Empty K-cups are good to use for their size and because they already have holes at the bottom of the cups. Any type of small pot will do as long as you are able to poke a few holes at the bottom and sides of it.You can poke holes in the pots with a nail, depending on the material the pot is made of. If the pot is made of a harder material, you will need to drill a few holes.

, Once you have lined the pots inside of the pan, fill them with a growing medium. Growing media include dozens of choices such as gravel, clay pellets, vermiculite, rockwool/stonewool, sand, or cotton and are used to support the plant’s root system as it grows. Ebb and flow systems need substrates with good drainage.You can try gravel or cotton batting as the medium. If you choose cotton batting, make sure to use an organic brand because cotton is often heavily sprayed with chemicals.Expanded clay pellets also work well in ebb and flow systems. They have good drainage and, while a bit expensive, can be reused., Ebb and flow systems work on a simple flood and drain model. The plants are flooded regularly each day for twenty to thirty minutes a time – the flood cycle. Then, the tray is drained. Usually, people with ebb and flood systems use a submersible pump to do this, working from a nutrient reservoir.If you’re using a pump, set up your flood and drain system. Most people place the growing pan above the nutrient reservoir in a larger container, say, a bucket. You’ll then need to connect the pan and reservoir with the submersible pump and tubing, so the pump can deliver nutrient solution into the tray. You’ll also need to install an overflow pipe to drain the solution back into the reservoir.
If you’re flooding manually, use at least one cup of water (depending on how many pots there are) and pour it over the pan. Make sure the water gets into each pot. Allow some time for the water to soak into the pots—at least five minutes should be enough. Drain the excess water into the pan by tipping it and allowing the water to drain into a bucket.

, The flood cycle is followed by the drain cycle. With a pump, this is done more or less automatically. You can even program the pump to work on a timer. If you’re doing things manually, just remove the pots from the pan after the seeds have soaked for fifteen minutes. Drain whatever water is left in the pain into a bucket and repeat the process several times a day., Wick systems are probably the easiest kind of hydroponic system to build, as it usually doesn’t have any moving parts, pumps, or electricity. The wick system “wicks” up nutrient solution from a reservoir to plants in a tray above through capillary action – in other words, it sort of sucks up the liquid to the plants like a sponge. Your basic components will be the reservoir and growing tray.Find a leak-proof container to hold the plants as they grow. This can be bucket, tray, or other type of container.
For your reservoir, you’ll need another leak-proof container such as a bucket. This container will hold your nutrient solution and should be large enough to also support the growing tray, which usually sits above it.

, The wick is the delivery mechanism in a wick system – it’s what moves the nutrients from the reservoir below to the plants above, rather than a pump or your own hands as in an ebb and flow system. So, the wick is probably the most important part. Without a good absorbent wick, your plants won’t get the nutrients they need.Common materials that work as wicks include fibrous rope, wool, cotton, or rayon rope, tiki torch wicks, wool felt, and strips from old clothing or blankets.
You’ll want to test materials to see what works best. Be sure that your wick is absorbent but resists rotting. Washing the wick before you use it often helps to improve wicking ability, as well.
Have enough wicking material on hand, too. You’ll probably need at least two to four wicks, unless your system is extremely small.

, Since there are no pumps or moving parts, it’s fairly easy to set up a wick system. Most often, people place the growing tray directly above the reservoir and connect the two with the wicks. In fact, it’s best to have these parts as close as you can – the shorter the wick, the more water it can transport to your plants’ growing medium.You’ll next need to punch holes in the top of your reservoir and the bottom of your tray. Then, thread in your wicks and put the containers in place.
Try to spread out the wicks evenly on the bottom of the growing tray.
Finally, add your growing medium to the bottom of the tray so that it covers the wicks. Wick systems need an absorbent medium like vermiculite, coco coir, or perlite. Also, be sure to flush out the medium with fresh water about every two weeks, as this will reduce the risk of nutrients and salts building up to toxic levels.

, Once the system is set up, you are ready to plant the seeds. The type of seeds you choose to plant is your choice. You can grow a large number of flowers, herbs (like basil and thyme), and vegetables (like spinach, lettuce, and kale). Put one seed into each pot. Allow the seeds to soak in the water that you poured into the pots for about fifteen minutes.Beans also grow well in a hydroponic system. The seeds typically germinate within eight to ten days.

, Plants need a full spectrum of nutrients to grow and thrive. Once the seeds start to produce plants, you’ll need to choose a nutrient to make sure that yours are getting everything they need. This is crucial to a thriving hydroponic garden.


Plants need 16 elements in adequate concentrations to grow. Having too much or too little of any nutrient can cause poor crop performance. That said, it’s best to look for a commercial hydroponic solution that offers a full nutrient profile.Hydroponic nutrient solutions come in two basic forms: powered and liquid. As a beginner, you may want to start with something a bit more error-proof in the liquid solution. These are more expensive but don’t require mixing., You can wait until the plants are fully grown to remove them. The time for the plants to grow depends on what you have planted. Plants growing in gravel or other hydroponic media aren’t easy to transplant, so many growers wait until they are fully mature and harvest them all at once.Wait until the bed is dry to remove the plant and shake off any particles that may still be attached.

, You may need a grow light during the winter, or if your plants are not placed outside in a garden or greenhouse. A grow light mimics natural daylight. They can be purchased at gardening stores or online. Some plants require more light than others, so research the amount of light required for growth for each plant you’re planting.You can control the amount of light your plants get with a simple timer that controls the on/off setting of your grow light. An analogue timer will work just fine. A digital timer is not necessary.

, You should test the pH level of your garden regularly. You can do this easily by picking up Nitrazine paper, which is available at many drugstores. To use, simply dip one of the strips into the nutrient solution you’re using and compare it to the chart that comes with the paper.You can maintain a pH level of between six and seven by adding soluble potash or phosphoric acid to the nutrient solution, depending on the result of the test.

, Even hydroponic gardens are susceptible to pests. To get rid of pests, you can use an insecticidal soap or pyrethrin based spray. You can purchase both of these pesticides from most gardening stores or online.Make sure to follow the directions on the label of the type of pesticide you choose to use.

, Some symptoms of diseases in plants are spotting, blighting, rotting, and tumors. If you notice any of these symptoms, sterilize your garden, or use a diluted copper spray. To sterilize your garden, remove the pots, temporarily move them to another container, and flood the original container with diluted bleach solution. Allow the bleach to sit for twenty-four hours and drain the container. Then, wash thoroughly with water multiple times."

These notes are for a wide range of vegetables used for human consumption..;
,
A wide range of vegetable types need a wide range of nutrient and pH levels.,
Check the water quality with your TDS/PPM EC meter from a sample before putting it in your reservoir.,
Use a digital probe to measure the strength and pH of the nutrient solution every day and do this close to the same time every day.,
With nutrients in your reservoir, you can't get a proper reading with paper strips or test tube drop kits.,
Adjust the pH of your nutrient solution using propriety solutions such as pH Up or pH Down accordingly.,
Use a TDS/PPM or EC meter to check the strength of your nutrient solution.,
Change/top-up the solution in your reservoir when the TDS/PPM meter shows it to be at or below that which the plants require.

,
A proper top-up nutrient should not be used more than 3 to 4 times between full nutrient changes.,
It is good practice to have a nutrient reservoir as large or larger than the empty volume of the tub(s)/container(s).,
Know that nutrient life is dependent on is volume and the requirements of the plants as well as the plant's transpiration rate, all of which vary greatly.,
When the nutrient is considered past its useful life it can poured on dirt grown plants.

,
Hydroponic gardens grow better outside, but local weather conditions may affect it and should be taken into account.,
When growing inside provision of suitable lighting may be required.

",How to Maintain a Hydroponic Nutrient Reservoir,", Guides are available from the internet and some nutrient suppliers.

, Tap water measuring 300 ppm or greater indicates that you may need to run either a reverse osmosis system or distill your water. You want to be sure of the total PPM of the water you are putting to your plants before adding nutrients, is between 0-50ppm, anything over 100 is acceptable just be wary of some of the micro nutrients that might be in your test water. See the ""Tips"" section for ideas on tap water usage.

, Make notes in a diary to keep track of events and changes.

, For more accurate readings of your test equipment, test after the nutrient has been run through your system at least once (twice is good).

, Note: An adjustment in your solution's pH will affect its strength. The most affective is a pH of 5.5-6.2 never go higher than 6.5 or lower than 5.5 no matter what vegetables you are growing.

, If it is too strong, add water. If it is too weak, add a little fertilizer. Make sure you re-test the pH after making changes.

,, Do not use full nutrient for top-ups.

, For example if a 20L tub is used then at least 20L of nutrient should be used, preferably more, twice as much is a good minimum. The volume of the growing medium not with standing in the volume calculations. The largest size nutrient reservoir (within reason) that can be implemented is better.

, However, ideally you should nutrient the water everyday, when you are starting out.

,, When growing outside all forms of falling water should be prevented from falling on the garden and so diluting the nutrient solution.,"

Place your fountain in the shade.,
Use distilled water.,
Use a preventative product.,
Change your fountain water monthly.,
Clean your water pump.,
Submerge the pump.,
Deep clean your fountain.,
Scrub your fountain.,
Use an algaecide.,
Replace your pump.",How to Keep Algae out of Water Fountains," Direct sunlight enables more rapid algae growth. Help minimize algae proliferation by keeping your fountain in a shady or covered area.If a completely shaded area is not available, a partially shaded area may still help slow algae growth.
Also consider placing a cover such as an umbrella or awning in the area near your fountain to help provide shade if no natural shade is available.;
, Tap water and even filtered water still have natural impurities present in them. Distilled water has all of the impurities removed, which can help slow algae formation and prevent algae growth.For larger fountains, distilled water is likely impractical. However, adding a good filter where your fountain draws or recycles water may still help remove some impurities.

, The best time to start using algae prevention products is right after you have set up or deep cleaned your fountain. Commercial products are available online as well as at home improvement and maintenance stores.If you are concerned about the health and safety of wildlife using your fountain, look for animal-safe products. Most products found in pet stores and hardware stores will be animal-safe, but it is important to check the labels.
Common products include Algae Shield and SeaKlear. If wildlife is not a concern, such as with indoor fountains, a cap of bleach may also work as a preventative measure.
Before applying an anti-algae agent to your fountain, check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure that the product you purchased will not damage your current fountain setup.
Product instructions will vary by product, but often all you need to do is add product to the water on a regular basis to the running fountain.

, Changing the water helps eliminate current living algae and prevents buildup in your fountain’s pump system. Completely empty your fountain of old water and allow it air dry before filling the fountain.If possible, rinse down your fountain and wipe away any buildup or residue from the fountain surface as well as any decorative features such as stones before refilling it.

, The pump is responsible for cycling water through the fountain, reducing algae's ability to grow. Scrub the pump's parts with a sponge or a firm-bristled toothbrush and distilled water.If you need to open the pump in order to get at interior parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions. All pumps are different, and what works for one pump may not work for another.

, The pump cannot function unless it is entirely underwater. Keep the pump submerged to keep water cycling through and prevent algae from building and growing on the surface.It is common to have to add water to your fountain for the first several days after setting it up in order to ensure the pump stays submerged.

, Your fountain should receive a deep cleaning every two months. Turn off and drain the fountain and wipe it down with a fountain cleaning solution, which may be available from a speciality retailer or online, or dish soap.Opt for dish soap if you are looking for a product that is friendly for animals such as birds and small mammals that may make use of your fountain.
Go over the fountain with a toothbrush to scrape off algae and other organic matter.
Be sure to thoroughly rinse the fountain after using soap, as it may damage the fountain if left on its surface.
Clean the fountain's tubes using pipe cleaners, such as can be found at any hardware or craft store, to scrub out the pipe interiors.

, If you find that your fountain has developed noticeable algae, the first thing you need to do is thoroughly scrub the individual components of your fountain. Take your fountain apart and clean each surface using soap and hot water and allow to air dry before reassembling.Wipe down the fountain with distilled white vinegar or a solution of 1 cap of bleach per gallon of water before soaping and rinsing the fountain. Rinse bleach thoroughly.

, Unlike preventative treatments, algaecides are meant to kill off existing algae growths within a fountain. Algaecides are available in home improvement stores as well as online and specialty retailers.Check the algaecide bottle to see how to properly use the product. Check the bottle to see how much product should be added to the water and at what frequency.
Non-metallic algaecides work better in fountains as they are less likely to stain.

, If heavy algae growth continues for extended periods in your fountain, consider replacing the pump to get better water movement and circulation. You may be able to do this yourself, or you may want to call in an expert depending upon the size of your fountain and your level of experience.Fountain pump systems can differ greatly. Check with your manufacturer to see what components your fountain requires.

Follow it across the table to the enthalpy columns.,
Now locate the Superheated Steam table.

,Identify the values relative to our final pressure (0.3 MPa)

,Locate our final temperature (190o C)

,
Recognize that 190 is not listed in the temperature column, therefore we must interpolate.,
Locate the temperature values just above and below 190o C, Thi and Tlow.,
Now find the corresponding enthalpy values for 150o C and 200o C, Hhi and Hlow.

,
Follow the equation above to find the interpolated enthalpy value at 190o C. +2761.2 H190 = 2844.96 kJ/kg

,
Subtract our initial enthalpy value at 40o C ( 167.53 kJ/kg) from our final enthalpy value at 190o C (2844.96 kJ/kg), to find the change in enthalpy needed to heat water from its liquid phase to superheated steam.",How to Look up and Interpolate Enthalpy Values for Water Using Steam Tables," Enthalpy change is described as ∆H = Hfinal - Hinitial. Tinitial = 40o C , Tfinal = 190o C , Pinitial = .1 MPa , Pfinal = .3 MPa;
, Usually labeled Saturation Temperature and Saturation Pressure. (First page may look like the image below)

,, Labeled HL, HVap or HV. We just know that our fluid is initially a liquid, so we will use the liquid enthalpy value, HL, as our initial enthalpy value. HL = 167.53 kJ/kg

,,,, Interpolating values gives us a best guess, when the desired temperature or pressure is between two available values. Interpolating follows the formula, HD (desired enthalpy) = +H_low For our example problem, Tfinal = 190o C

Many of the items you need for hydroponics can already be found around your house so you can save money before you go full tilt into this hobby or found all together in a hydroponic garden.;
, Most newbie gardeners can either purchase an easy to install grow room or build a greenhouse outside of their home. Small grow rooms for the beginning hydroponic gardener are usually slightly larger than a closet and can be completely installed in under an hour. The cost ranges from several hundred dollars to over $500, depending on the add-ons that you think you will need.

, A small greenhouse can cost considerably more because you will need to either include a cement floor and drainage system or lay other types of flooring such as gravel before you build the greenhouse itself. Many small greenhouses cost anywhere from $500 to over several thousand dollars, depending on the add-ons you choose.


The basic items you need after you decide on either a grow room or greenhouse include a temperature control unit, exhaust fan, heating mats, light fixtures for your blue and red spectrum lights, an aeration system (an aquarium system works well for small gardens), pearlite, marble and Styrofoam work well as a beginning medium and rockwool, oasis or Rapid Rooters. Typical beginning tables for your plants include plastic tubs, a child’s swimming pool or fish tank. A gardener can also buy any of the items they need for their grow room from stores specializing in hydroponic supplies.

, Make sure that it can be grown where you live (don't choose a citrus plant if you're living in Alaska, for instance) and that it isn't a plant that is grown underground.

, Fold it over, and place it gently in a clear, sealable bag.

, Germination is triggered when a seed is wet, so keep the paper towels moist. Don't forget that some seeds take longer than others.

, What you do next depends on the type of plant.


If the seed has a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through.
If the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves.

, This is a very fragile time in their life, so be extremely gentle.

,, You can choose between having one plant per container, or doing a larger container with many plants. If you choose the second option, make sure that all the plants have good support.

, If you are growing a plant that gets much taller, you should probably tape a support to the side of the container.

, Also, plants need nutrients to grow, so buy a pack of liquid fertilizer to add to the water every week. Follow the package instructions, and don't overfeed the plants.

, They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable.


If the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates.

, Normally, plants can anchor themselves into the dirt for extra support. Check your plant's stem daily for any cracks or bending points.

, Enjoy your hydroponic garden!

, Once the base is leveled out, it is time to line the bottom of the bog garden with a cushion to stop stones rising up and making holes in the liner.

,, The lining cushion is laid out in sheets and comes right up the side of the bog garden. It has to protect the liner, This is the same liner as would be used in a garden pond.

, The liner is laid out and pushed all the way to the side of the hole.

, Once the liner is in place it too is lined with cushion in order to protect it from the alfagrog that we will be putting on the top. The solid oak sleepers are put in the tank to separate off the aeration pond and the final settlement pond from the actual bog garden itself.

, Realize that since the Oak sleepers and the green untreated oak, have small holes routed in the bottom it allows the water to flow through and into the bog garden from the aeration chamber.

, Having completed the basic design , fill the actual bog garden part with alfagrog. This is a ceramic filter media used in Koi fish ponds to filter the water. It contains a huge amount of surface area in which our bacteria will live and clean up the water.

, Completely filled, the centre section of the hydroponic bog garden starts filling it with water and adding the rest of the sleepers around the outside of the system. This size of tank takes around 6 cubic metres of water to fill it to a level just above the Alfagrog. Filling it with water allows it to level the Alfagrog and ensure that when gravel is added to it that it is all immersed in water.

, Full of water and Alfagrog and awaiting the gravel to fill the middle. The cross section wood is to stop the centre section moving when the gravel is added.

, Once filled with gravel the finished bog garden looks like this. The water level is raised so that at least an inch of the gravel is under water to provide the plants with moisture.

, The section of the tank that will receive the water from the Biotank needs to be aerated. A small compressor provides this aeration via a rubber aerator. The dissolved oxygen level needs to be as high as possible if the bacteria in the Alfagrog are going to survive.

, Once finished the final touch is to add plants. All of these are moisture loving plants provided by our local nursery.

, The water from the Bog Garden is used to feed ponds and to water the lawns.

Turn off the outside water spigot your garden hose is connected to.,
Remove any kinks in the garden hose.,
Depress the remaining water from inside of your garden hose.,
Disconnect your garden hose completely from the outside water spigot.,
Drain the hose entirely of water.,
Wind the garden hose into a circular shape.,
Store your looped garden hose in a warm location.",How to Keep a Garden Hose from Freezing," This will prevent any additional water from entering the hose from the water pipe.;
, This procedure will remove any blockage of water in the garden hose and allow the water to flow freely. Kinks can also cause holes in the lining of your garden hose if they are not straightened out.


Walk along the length of your garden hose starting from the water spigot and straighten out every kink along the way until you reach the opposite end.

, This will prevent any leftover water inside the garden hose from freezing and damaging the lining.


If you have a spray nozzle with a handle attached to your hose, depress the handle to spray out any remaining water from the inside of the hose.






Remove any attachments from the head of your garden hose, such as a sprinkler head of spray nozzle, and allow any remaining water to drain from the open mouth of the hose.







, This will prevent the end of the hose from freezing to the spigot and allow you to store the garden hose during cold weather.

, This procedure will help remove any water that has collected in the middle sections of your garden hose.


Grab the end of the garden hose you recently disconnected from the spigot, keeping the mouth of the hose elevated to allow any remaining water to drain down the length of the hose.
Keep each section of the garden hose elevated as you continue to walk down the length of the garden hose. This will allow the water to drain fully out of the other end of the hose when you reach the other side.
When you reach the end of the hose, keep the hose elevated until the water starts to drip slowly from the mouth of the hose or until it stops dripping completely.

, This will prevent the hose from becoming bent or kinked for the duration of storage.


Bend the end section of the hose into a loop that spans roughly 3 feet (0.91 meters) in diameter.
Continue to wind the remaining length of the hose in the same direction of the loop while maintaining the size of the loop.

, This will prevent it from cracking or freezing even without water remaining inside the hose.


If your garage or outside shed reaches freezing temperatures, place your garden hose in your basement or another warm room inside your home.
Place your garden hose in a large bucket or hang it on a garden hose hanger. You can use any storage method you prefer, as long as it prevents your hose from becoming kinked.

Although growing is easy if you have the right knowledge and information, it usually takes time to gather both of those things.


On the other hand, other constraints may force your hand and compel you to start off growing hydro. If you're a first-time grower and want to try hydro, know that you can be successful. Do your research but avoid telling your friends or acquaintances. Nothing can get you shut down quicker than blabbering about your hydro unit.
Consider growing other plants hydroponically in addition to marijuana. Growing hydro doesn't need to mean just growing weed. You can grow lettuce, tomatoes, or even mushrooms hydroponically. Experimenting with these crops first may teach you valuable lessons you can use when growing marijuana.;
, If you're careful to shop around, you should be able to get everything you need for five plants for $300-$500. You should expect to get 1-3 ounces off each plant at the end. You will need (see the Things You'll Need section below for further details):


Marijuana seeds or clones
White paint or mylar
Hydroponic nutrients
Pots
Potting medium such as coco coir
Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs)
A timer
pH soil test

, Plants grow with the aid of light. If you're growing indoors, this presents somewhat of a problem. Many grow rooms are housed in dark spaces where light is absorbed instead of reflected. To get the most bang for your buck — and to make the best possible weed — you'll want your walls to either be painted a glossy white or be covered with mylar.


Painting your walls a semi-gloss or flat white is probably the simplest solution. The flatter the white, the better, as glossy white reflects roughly 55% of the light coming from your source.Titanium white might be your best bet if you do decide to paint.
Mylar is highly reflective. It has a reflection rate of roughly 90%, making it a much more efficient coating material than something like aluminum foil. But because mylar reflects light and heat very efficiently, you'll need to be sure that you have proper ventilation in your grow room.

, They should start out a little higher than the height of your pots, and should have room to be raised to the final height of your plants. There are a million ways to set up or hang the lights and you will need to do what works for your grow area. The simplest method is to either hang them from the bar in your closet or you can also clamp the lights onto something nearby that is the right height.


Clamp reflectors are great for using CFLs. The socket is already attached, no wiring or electrical work is really needed, and the housing helps to reflect as much light as possible.Remember that any excess light that doesn't hit your plants is wasted light.

, Lumens is a unit for the total amount of visible light emitted by a source. Therefore, it's helpful to talk about how many lumens a source emits, as well as how many lumens your growing operation needs. On an average day, the sun emits about 5,000 to 10,000 lumens per square foot.The absolute minimum needed to grow average-sized plants is around 3,000 lumens per square foot. Note that the actual amount of lumens that reach the bottom of your plant will fluctuate depending on the distance of the light source and the reflectivity of the surroundings.
The ideal amount for a standard grow operation is somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 lumens per square foot.To figure out how many lumens per square foot you're working with, simply divide the total lumens by the total square feet. Say you're working with two 300-watt CFLs — each with 40,000 lumens — in a 3' x 3' x 2' area. Your total lumens is 80,000 and your total footage is 18'. 80,000 ÷ 18 ≈ 4,400 lumens per square foot.

, Having sufficient light will help your marijuana grow tall, healthy, and chronic. But what to do about overheating. The ideal temperature for your grow operation is somewhere between 80 °F (27 °C) and 85 °F (29 °C), with 90 °F (32 °C) being the max.If your temperature is anywhere below this, consider adding a small heater to generate additional heat. If your temperature is anywhere above this, a fan and additional ventilation may need to be added to help provide the perfect growing conditions.

, Proper ventilation is absolutely necessary for vibrant plants. If your grow room is in a closet, for example, there's not much more that you can do other than an oscillating fan. In a box, however, adding a duct system is efficient for many home growers.


To make a duct system, a simple squirrel cage fan (it looks like a hamster wheel) attached to 6"" ducts will help mitigate rising temperatures and pungent odors.
As with any operation, including an additional oscillating fan will help strengthen the stalks of the marijuana plants as they grow.

, To get your weed seed to sprout, simply wet a large paper towel and lightly wrap your seeds in between the paper towel. Place the paper towel and cover with another plate to make sure the paper towel doesn't dry out.Alternately, place the damp paper towel in a sealable plastic bag and rest somewhere dark and warm for at least 24 hours.

, Rock wool is a great medium to grow the early-stage marijuana plant in. Once the seedling has started sprouting a significant root system, you can transfer the plant into the coco coir.

, Adjust the water to have a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 for best results.


In the beginning, give your plants nutrients at quarter strength and work your way up to full strength nutrients over the course of a week or two. One of the biggest mistakes many new growers make is giving their plant too many nutrients which can hurt your plant. Most brands of nutrients will come with a hydroponic feeding schedule which can usually be followed exactly.
You can get Fox Farms Hydroponic Nutrient Trio and follow their included instructions exactly if you're not sure what to get for nutrients. The Fox Farms Hydroponic Nutrient Trio works great for growing marijuana. After you have added your nutrients to your water, you'll want to adjust the pH of the solution to around 5.5-6.0 to ensure proper nutrient absorption., This will start out with you watering the plants every couple of days when they’re small, and may end up with you watering them once a day towards the end of the plant's flowering cycle.


Ensure that at least a little extra run-off water comes out the bottom of the container whenever you water your plants to ensure that unused nutrients don’t build up in your medium. Coco coir and perlite are very forgiving if you accidentally over or under-water your plant, but make sure to adjust your watering schedule accordingly if you notice your plant’s leaves are wilting or drooping.

, You can keep your marijuana plants in the vegetative stage by giving them 18-24 hours of light a day.


Your marijuana has two major grow phases after it's a seedling, the vegetative and flowering stages. You will treat the plant differently depending on what stage it's in. During the vegetative stage, your marijuana plants are only worried about growing and getting big. In order to keep your plants in the vegetative stage, they will need to get at least 18 hours of light a day. This simulates ""summer,"" when the days are long. You can give your plants as much as 24 hours of light per day during the vegetative stage, but you'll find success as long as you stay within that 18-24 hours or light per day range.
The height of the plant is often the main factor when determining how long to keep your marijuana plants in the vegetative stage. Your plant can double its height in the flowering stage, so you will want to keep the plant in the vegetative stage until it's about half it's desired final height. If growing in a closet, it's a good idea to keep your plants in the vegetative stage until they're 6-18"" tall.

, Tell your cannabis plants to begin the flowering stage by changing to a 12 hours of light/12 hours of darkness schedule so that they start producing buds. This simulates the beginning of fall and winter.


In the flowering stage, your plants stop worrying about growing as much, and start putting their energy into growing flowers/buds. You will need to tell your plants when it’s time to start flowering. In the wild, marijuana plants start flowering when the days start getting shorter because that’s a sign that winter is coming. In order to simulate the same conditions, you will need to switch your light schedule so that your lights are on for 12 hours a day, and off for 12 hours a day.

, Determine the gender of your plants 1 to 2 weeks after first changing the lights for the flowering stage. Get rid of any males you happen to find in the bunch. Males will pollinate females, causing females to start diverting energy from THC production into seed growth.Pollinated weed isn't unsmokable, but it's a lot less potent than unpollinated weed.


After making the switch in light schedule, you will start noticing the first signs of your plant’s gender about 1-2 weeks. Female plants will grow white hairs and males will start growing grape-like balls that eventually become pollen sacs. In order to maximize on the amount of bud you get, you will want to make sure you remove any male plants so they don’t pollinate your females. If male and female plants stay together, than your females will end up making lots of seeds instead of buds. You also don’t get any usable bud off of a male plant, only pollen. , This is often the toughest part for beginning growers. The Flowering Stage can last from 6 weeks to 12 weeks or longer depending on the marijuana strain that you're growing with. , Otherwise you may actually be able to taste the nutrients in your final buds (your marijuana could have a chemical after-taste).


Towards the end of your plant’s flowering cycle, you may notice that some of the oldest leaves start turning yellow and falling off. This is totally normal and is a sign that your plant is taking nitrogen out of the leaves and putting them into the buds/flowers. This is a signal that it's getting close to harvest time, and you'll usually want to stop giving your plants nutrients with their water for the last 1-2 weeks to ensure the best possible taste of your final bud.

,


There are many methods to determine the right time to harvest your plant. Basically, you want to harvest when 50-75% of the white pistils/hairs have turned amber/brown.
Another way to tell is when the trichomes (also known as crystals or resin glands) are either all white/milky or half white and half amber.
Harvesting earlier will give a more thoughtful or in-your-head marijuana experience while harvesting later will give you a heavier or more relaxing marijuana experience. You will want to experiment to find what harvest time is the best for you.

, Leaves will make your final smoke a lot more harsh and don't contain much THC, so you don't want them in your final product. You can still use them to make hash, butter, or Green Dragon.

,, Open the jar once a day to get some air ventilation and make sure you release any moisture. Moisture is your enemy when curing and will cause mold, so make sure your buds are properly dried before curing them.

Know your plants.,
Make sure the container or pot you are using is big enough.,
Provide the right amount of sunlight.,
Water the plants only as often as needed.,
Fertilize.,
Check your plants often.,
Bury banana peels under rosebushes.,
Use crushed eggshells to feed plants.,
Keep pests away with soap.,
Use coins to keep slugs out.",How to Grow Healthy Plants," No matter how much care and attention you give to plants, they aren't going to thrive if you don't know their specific needs. This is true whether you're buying a houseplant or planning an outdoor vegetable or flower garden. Some plants are able to do well in a variety of climates, but others require a controlled environment or can only survive in a specific region.


Before planting a garden or adding a plant to your potted collection, search online or ask an expert at a nursery questions about what conditions the plants need.
Figure out in what region the plants do best. Just because a plant isn't native to your area doesn't mean you can't grow it, but it's usually much easier to grow plants that do well in your region's climate, temperature and soil.
For indoor plants, maintain a fairly steady temperature. If you're cold, your plant is cold, too. Avoid putting your green friends in drafty places. If you think it's chilly, so do they.;
, Plants need room to grow. A sure fire plant killer is allowing the roots to become crowded. If you're planting directly in the ground, be sure to allow enough space between plants.









If you have your plants in pots, then check the roots once per year to see if they look crowded. If they do, then break them up and repot your plant in a larger pot. This will promote new growth.If you don’t want to transfer to a larger container, then you can also trim the roots and then repot the plant.

, Plants generally need either full sunlight, partial sunlight, or partial shade. This relatively simple distinction has a big impact on how well plants do.









Take a look at your yard before purchasing plants. Note how much sun the different areas in the yard get before you figure out which plants to buy.
If you're plotting a garden, arrange it so that part of the garden is shaded and part of it is exposed, so that you'll have a place for the different types of plants you buy.
Most house plants do best in partial shade, which works out well since indoor areas don't usually get full sun. Keep this in mind before you decide to put a potted plant in a place where it will get hours of direct sunlight; you may end up exposing it for too long.
If you notice your plant becoming thin and reaching toward the light, it needs to be closer to the sunshine.

, Watering can cause perfectly lovely people to become serial plant killers. They either water too little or too much. Many first-time gardeners or potted plant owners water plants more than necessary, believing that the more water the plant gets, the better. This is true for certain plants, but too much water can kill other plants.









Aside from doing research to find out how much water your plants need, here's a trick to help you tell when and how much to water: stick your finger in the dirt about an inch or so. In most cases, you should water your plants when the soil is slightly dry. Pour in enough water so that a little comes out the hole in the bottom of the pot. Avoid flooding the plant with too much water.
Make sure that the pots you use have good drainage or the roots may get what is called “wet feet.” This can have a negative effect on your plant.
Succulents and other plants acclimated to dry regions usually need less water than plants from wetter regions. They need to dry out completely between waterings.
Seedlings generally need more water than adult plants. Keep seedlings constantly moist until they sprout several inches above the soil.
Finicky plants like orchids need higher quality water, since they're sensitive to chemicals found in tap water. Use distilled or spring water instead.

, Most avid plant growers use some sort of fertilizer, but that's a matter of preference. If you choose to use fertilizer, visit your local greenhouse and ask questions about what to use and how much.









Find out the optimal soil makeup for your plants. Get your soil tested before you plant anything in the ground. You can take soil samples to your local extension office for testing.
Consider using compost. Composted fruits and vegetables make for rich, nutritious soil that is great for growing most plants. Keep in mind that some plants, like many species of wildflowers, actually prefer poor soil conditions, so do research to figure out what your plants need before using compost. You can use blood meal, composted poultry litter, or fish emulsion to fertilize your soil.

, You should be checking your indoor plants weekly and outdoor plants at least every other day to see how they are doing. This will help you to detect any problems before they get out of hand. Make checking your plants a part of your routine.









For example, you could start your day every Saturday by checking all of your houseplants, or you could take a stroll through your garden every day or every other day before you head to work.

, Roses need a lot of potassium, which is readily available in bananas. Take out the banana and bury the peel in the soil just under the roots of the rosebush. The potassium will nourish the rosebush throughout its growing season.








, Eggshells leach valuable nutrients into the soil, helping plants like tomatoes thrive throughout the season. Crush up a few and sprinkle them into the holes you dig for each plant, or into the bottom of a pot you're using for an indoor potted plant.









Crushed eggshells nourish pepper and tomato plants, helping them bear delicious, flavorful fruit.
Eggshells also serve as a natural alternative to pesticides, since they prevent slugs and other pests from attacking plants., Outdoor plants are susceptible to getting nibbled on by rabbits, squirrels and other creatures. Keep them away by sprinkling flakes of soap around the garden. Some gardeners also swear by using human hair or predator urine to keep animals away.








, Shower a few pennies into your garden if you're having trouble keeping slugs away from your plants. They're repelled by the metal

",How to Make a Simple Home Hydroponic Garden," This will be used as the bottom of the hydroponic bed.;
, Cut a further two pieces of lumber 15x85cm, and 5cm thick. These will be used as the siding of the hydroponic bed.

, Screw the lumber border pieces together to create a frame, using two screws to attach each two lumber borders together. Then drill a 2cm hole in the centre 1cm from the bottom. This will later be used to drain excess water, preventing the plants from becoming swamped.

, Place the frame down and the plywood on top. Use enough screws to make it secure, about 1 every 20cm is enough.

, Cut the plastic giving the box an extra 30cm on each side. That would make the 6 millimetre plastic 1.3x1.8m. You also need to cut a hole in the plastic 44cm from the edge in the middle; this will also be used to drain water if it fills up too much, to prevent drowning the plants.

, It has to be a completely smooth bottom. Wrap the excess over the edges of the box and tape it for now. Be sure to make sure the hole in the plastic and the hole in the wood line up.

, Now that it is taped in place and smoothed, wrap wire around the edges to keep it into place.

, It should only be sticking into the box about 4 cm.

, The bed is complete and you can now start prepping it for planting. You can repeat as many times as you want until you get the amount of beds you want for your space.

, You will find quite a few since the majority of what's being burned is pallets, and you don't want nails in your hydroponic bed, for obvious reasons.

,,,, Take the 1L bottle and fill it halfway with the hard water. Add the nutrients (Zinc Sulphate: 2.2g, Manganese Sulphate: 15g, Copper Sulphate: 0.8g , Boric Acid: 28g, Sodium Molybdate: 0.25) one by one, letting them dissolve before adding the next one. Once finished, fill the bottle up to 1L. This will now be referred to as the Trace Mix Solution. It can be saved and used multiple times afterwards.

, Fill the second 1L bottle halfway with hard water. Add the 20g of Chelated Iron from item #7. Fill the bottle up to 1L. This too can be used multiple times afterwards.

, Add the Calcium Nitrate (item #2) and let it dissolve completely. Add the Potassium Nitrate (item #3) and let it dissolve completely. Add 100ml of the Iron Chelate solution. Fill the bucket up to 5L with water. This will be known as Mix 1.

, Individually add the Sulphate of Potash (#4) Monopotassium Phosphate(#5) and Magnesium Sulphate individually, allowing each to dissolve fully before adding the next. Add 10ml of Trace Mix Solution. Fill the bucket up to 5L with water. This will be known as Mix 2.

, You now have enough ingredients to supply 100L of nutrient solution for your plants.

, Create a mix of 90% water, 5% Mix 1, 5% Mix 2. So to create 1L of nutrient solution, use 900ml of hard water, 50ml of Mix 1 and 50ml of Mix 2.

, If they are already seedlings, plant them with a thin layer of charcoal between them and the bottom. If you're using seeds, then take out 1/4 of the charcoal and spread them and put the charcoal back on top.

,, After each time you harvest anything from these beds, you should wash them thoroughly, removing any unwanted growth and cleaning it. This should happen at least three times a year.

Choose the appropriate type of grow lights.,
Position the grow lights above your plants.,
Cycle the grow lights on and off appropriately.,
Adjust your grow light setup as needed.",How to Grow Houseplants With Grow Lights," There are 3 types of bulbs that work well as grow lights: metal halide, high pressure sodium (HPS), and fluorescent. Each type of light fixture has its own advantages and drawbacks.


Metal halide bulbs are compact and efficient, producing a very intense light from a small bulb. These bulbs are rich in blue wavelengths of light, which helps encourage leafy growth in plants.
High pressure sodium bulbs, on the other hand, are rich in reddish-orange light. This makes them great for germinating seedlings and encouraging flowering and fruiting. However, HPS lamps are not suited for general purpose plant lighting, as they do not encourage stem growth adequately.
Fluorescent lamps are the most economical and widely available choice for plant lighting. You must buy lamps labeled as ""full spectrum"" to use them as grow lights. T5 bulbs and high-wattage CFLs are the best choices for growing flowering or fruiting plants or any plant that requires intense, direct light.;
, Most nurseries and home improvement stores that sell grow lights will also stock several kinds of stands or mounting chains on which you can mount the lights. The height of the light above the plants is important, and as a general rule should be higher as the light gets more intense.


If you are attempting to start seedlings with your grow lights, or if you are using relatively low-output fluorescent lamps, position the grow lights only a few inches above the houseplants.
If using a high-intensity light source like metal halide bulbs, you should keep the bulb about a yard (1 m) away from the plants. Thin, spindly growth is a sign that the lamp is too high above the plants, while thick, curled leaves can indicate a lamp that is too close.

, You cannot maximize plant growth by simply leaving the grow lights on 24 hours each day. In fact, this is a good way to stress and kill your houseplants. Instead, aim to leave grow lights on continuously for about 14 to 16 hours each day, which simulates spring sunlight.


A good way to ensure that the grow lights are cycled on and off each day is to wire them to a timer. You can purchase a light timer at most home improvement stores.
You can experiment with different lighting durations to see which schedule your plants will respond to best. In general, houseplants should receive at least 12 hours of sunlight per day to encourage growth.

, Of course, there are no hard and fast rules on grow light location, intensity, and duration, and so you may need to adjust your own setup to accommodate the needs of your houseplants. Requirements may differ based on your ambient light conditions, temperature, houseplant varieties, and whether you intend to encourage flowering.

Harvest your strawberries.",How to Grow Hydroponic Strawberries," Though there are several ways to grow plants hydroponically, using the wicking system is the easiest method and requires the least amount of materials. It is also well-suited for small plants, such as strawberries.

Other hydroponic methods include a deep water culture system, a nutrient film technique system, an ebb and flow system, an aeroponics system, and a drip system.;
, You’ll want to select a temperate, well-lit location for your hydroponic system. Hydroponic strawberries need a temperature range of 57° F to 70° F (13.8° C to 21.1° C). If you don’t have an area with lots of natural light, you’ll need to install artificial growing lights., It is recommended that beginners purchase a nutrient solution rather than making their own. This will ensure the ratios of the nutrients are fit for the specific plant you intend to grow. Strawberries require nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, and magnesium to grow properly. You can find nutrient solutions at hydroponic and garden shops., Pick a large tub or bucket to act as your reservoir. Ensure it is deep enough to hold a lot of the nutrient solution, otherwise you will spend lots of time refilling it. You should also make sure your growing containers will fit on top of the reservoir., Mix your hydroponic nutrients with water according to the package directions. Be sure to use the amount of water directed; too much or too little and your strawberries will not grow correctly., You can use one large trough in which all your plants will sit, or individual pots for each plant. The growing container should rest sturdily on top of the reservoir; be sure to hang or anchor it if it does not., This is the most important part of the system, as the wicks deliver the nutrients to the plant. Choose something that is absorbent yet resistant to rotting. You may want to experiment and see which type of wick works best for your set-up. Fibrous rope, rayon rope, nylon rope, cotton rope, tiki torch wicks, polyurethane yarn, wool felt strips, or polyurethane felt strips are all commonly used for wicks.Be sure to clean and rinse all wicks before using to remove any chemicals that could damage your plants.

, The wicks need to deliver water from the reservoir to growing containers. If you use separate pots, you will also need to use a wick for each one. If you use a trough, add three or more wicks to ensure enough liquid will be able to reach your strawberry plants. Place each wick with one end in the reservoir and one end in the growing container., This medium will replace the soil that is typically used for growing plants. You’ll want to choose a growing medium like perlite or vermiculite for strawberries. Avoid using mediums that are too absorbent, like coconut coir or peat moss, as they may soak up too much of your nutrient solution and suffocate the plant., It is important to soak your growing medium in pH-balanced water prior to adding it to the growing container. Soak your medium for at least 30 minutes before filling the container to ensure the medium doesn’t act like a sponge and suck all the nutrients from the root of your plant. Fill the container only ⅔ full, as you need to leave room for your rootstock., Growing strawberries from seed can take two to three years to produce fruit, while rootstock will produce fruit within a month or two, depending on the variety.Ever-bearing or day-neutral varieties are recommended for indoor growers., Clean the soil from the roots by gently shaking. You can also lightly tap the dirt clinging to the roots with your fingers. Remove any dry, brittle, or dead leaves at this point as well., Carefully rinse the roots under cool, running water. Be extremely careful when you are rinsing the soil from the roots; if you break too many of the root hairs, your plant won’t produce as much fruit., Fill a bucket with cold water and soak the root system of your strawberry plant for at least 10 minutes. This will ensure all dirt has been removed as well as prevent the strawberries’ runner roots from dehydrating when they are transplanted., Carefully hold the crown of the plant and arrange the roots so that they are splayed over the growing medium., Add enough of your growing medium to fully cover the roots of your strawberry plant. Be sure you don’t cover the crown of the strawberry plant; it must have light and air., You’ll want to keep a close eye on the reservoir level to ensure your strawberries are getting enough of the nutrient solution. Keeping the reservoir full will ensure the solution has a shorter path to travel through the wick to reach the strawberries. If your level is low, be sure to pre-mix the nutrient solution according to the directions before adding it to the reservoir., Once per week you should flush your growing medium with water. This will remove excess nutrients, such as mineral salts, from the medium that your plant has not absorbed., Because there are no bees and birds indoors, you must hand-pollinate your strawberries once the petals are fully opened. Use a small, soft makeup brush or paintbrush to brush pollen from the stamen (male part, brownish in color) to the pistil (female part, yellow-greenish). Be sure to pollinate the entire pistil, or your strawberry plant may not produce fruit., Strawberries, unlike some other fruits, will not continue to ripen after they are picked. Don’t harvest your strawberries until they are completely ripe. When ripe, they will be red and somewhat firm to the touch. Once the berries have grown to a desirable size, carefully pluck them off the vine. Rinse them thoroughly before eating, and enjoy!"

Fertilize your plant.",How to Grow Henna," Don’t expect to find henna seeds at your local big-box garden center. Henna seeds are specialty items. You may have the best luck finding them online.;
, Store seeds in an airtight, opaque container until you’re ready to sow them. Keep the container in a cool, dark place. If seeds are exposed to moisture or sunlight, they might sprout prematurely and rot., Use high-quality paper towels so they don’t disintegrate when they become wet.

, Start new plants in small pots even if you plan to eventually plant them outside. Make sure pots have drain holes in the bottom.

, Layer several flat paper towels on top of each other. The goal is to create a thick, sturdy cushion that will serve as the seeds’ incubator., Sprinkle cold water onto the paper towels without saturating them. Paper towels should be moist, but solid enough that you can pick them up., Sprinkle a pinch of seeds down the middle of the moist paper towels. Add a generous number of seeds, but don’t overdo it! You should be able to see plenty of white space between the seeds and the paper towels. Fold the paper towels in half down the middle with the seeds inside.

, Place the folded paper towels into the Ziploc bag. If you need to fold the paper towels additional times to make them fit, that is fine. Seal the bag and place it in a refrigerator. The refrigerator replicates winter temperatures and prepares the seeds for “spring” and germination., After three or four days, remove the Ziploc from the refrigerator and place it in a warm spot like a sunny windowsill or porch. The heat and light should create condensation that triggers germination.Leave the Ziploc bag slightly open once you remove it from the refrigerator. This allows air circulation and reduces the odds that the seeds will become moldy. The goal is to encourage a warm, slightly moist environment inside the bag.

, After about a week, check on the seeds. Continue checking on the seeds until you discover they’ve become seedlings. If you see them turning white, you'll know you're making progress! The warmer the environment, the more quickly seeds will sprout. When seedlings reach about half an inch long, it’s time to plant them!, Henna thrives in soils with pH ranging from 4.3 to 8. Add organic matter, such as garden manure, to the soil to promote growth., You can plant multiple seedlings in one pot (the exact number will depend on the size of your pots.) Make sure to leave plenty of space between the seedlings so you’ll be able to dig them up and transfer them later.Even if you plan to plant your henna seedlings in the ground eventually, start them in pots. You can safely transfer plants into the ground, if desired, after about 5 months.
Keeping immature seedlings in a pot allows you to safeguard them from the elements. You'll be able to bring the pots inside as needed until they’re strong enough to withstand strong wind, rain, etc.

, Henna plants won’t survive outdoors if temperatures drop below 50ºF (11ºC). When your henna plant is inside, keep it in a sunny, warm spot such as a windowsill.Even if your plant is a potted houseplant, you can leave it outside in the sun in warm temperatures.
To protect your plant against an unexpected early-season cold front, bring it indoors in early fall.
Keep your plant indoors until spring, after the threat of cold fronts has subsided.

, If you take care of them, expect outdoor plants to reach about 8 feet (2.4 m) tall within 5 years.


Find out what garden zone you’re in by consulting the U.S. Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone Map.,, Passersby could be pricked by the spines. A mature henna plant can serve as a natural security barrier to discourage intruders.

, Henna plants thrive in the heat and are very drought-tolerant once established. Allow your henna plant’s soil to dry completely, then saturate it with water all at once., Henna plants prefer dry conditions. When the plant’s soil is constantly moist, root rot or scale can develop., After watering, excess water should drain from the pot. Place a saucer under the plant to collect extra water, and empty the saucer when after watering.

, Exposure to cold can damage or kill your plant., If your henna plant develops aphids, spray it with a water-soap solution to kill the insects. If your plant develops scale, visit a reputable garden center that can recommend a suitable insecticide that will kill the scale without damaging your henna plant.If your plant develops aphids or scale, trim the affected stems and leaves and discard them in right away., To maximize flower and leaf growth, fertilize your plant. Always use fertilizers at the recommended dilution strength or less. Never apply more fertilizer than is recommended, especially to seedlings and young plants. Look for a fertilizer with a 1-2-1 nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK) rating to encouraged balanced growth.Ideally, fertilize established perennials once, in spring, when you notice new growth beginning to emerge.Overfertilizing can burn or kill plants."

Find the seeds of the correct flax species.,
Try shopping online for Linum usitatissiumum and other rarer species of flax.",How to Grow Flax from Seed1," There are hundreds of species of Linum in the world. Only two blue species are commonly grown in gardens. These mainly look very similar in appearance and are only identifiable to a beginning botanist or gardener by the life cycle of the plant. One is annual meaning it germinates (sprouts from seed), grows and flowers then dies within a year. The other species is a perennial plant meaning it flowers and survives the remaining season as a dormant (sleeping) root and comes back for many years in appropriate climates. Both species look very similar with 2 to 4 feet tall arching stems with greyish-blue green needle-like leaves that look somewhat like a blue spruce sapling but soft and flexible. These plants have a deep taproot shaped like a skinny carrot and don't like being transplanted (moved) once established. Early summer to late summer the plant produces beautiful 5 petaled sky blue flowers that last only a day each but are produced in such large numbers from hanging tear shaped buds that the plant is literally covered in blooms for a 1 to 3 months.



Linum usitatissimum or Common Flax is the one that's used for making linen fabric and linseed oil used as food. Flax seed of this species is also used for food consumption as well. This plant is the annual.

Linum perenne or Perennial Flax is the almost exact twin. Linum lewisii native wildflower of North America is or is not depending to different experts, a subspecies (part of an isolated population) of Linum perenne. This one is the perennial.
There are other flax species that produce red (Linum grandiflorum) pink and yellow flowers (golden flax (Linum. flavum). as well.;
, Although it's commonly used in agriculture for food and fabric production, Linum usitatissimum is not readily available in many garden centers. Type the name of the species you want in a search engine like Google and you will find many online garden shops and seed shops that sell the seeds. Linum perenne is the one sold in seed packs in many garden centers. The same goes for more unusual and rarer Linum species.


If there's a flax species you want to try but have little information about it's growing conditions and/or seed germination requirements you can always ask the person in the shop via chat or email or talk to experts on many garden forums. With any plant group there's always possible exceptions to the rules and this article is very general.

Decide whether or not the plant is best raised as a seedling first.,
Grow from healthy seed.,
Use fresh seed-raising mix every time.,
Clean everything that is to be used for raising seedlings.",How to Grow Healthy Seedlings1," Most plants benefit from a seedling stage. It provides them with the opportunity to grow in optimal conditions.;
, If you are raising seedlings from seed, make sure that the seeds are fresh and healthy. This ensures that the seedlings get an excellent start in life.

, Don't reuse seed-raising mix; that risks transferring plant diseases that can decimate your seedlings.

, This means:


Wash and sterilise all pots, planters, trays, etc. to be used unless they are new biodegradable trays (these can be obtained at nursery stores for a very low cost)
Wash down benches where you are handling the seedlings
Wash your own hands!

"
"
Select the correct growing site.,
Prepare the soil.,
Test the soil.,
If the soil is ready place the seeds on the surface and cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil.,
Control the weeds.",How to Grow Flax from Seed2," Flax is a very adaptable and easily plant to grow. Hot and humid climate regions like the Southeast Coast of United States are not very good though for this plant of prairies and deserts. The site should receive full sun (6 hours or more of unshaded sunlight a day).


Rotate the crops of flax (Linum usitatissiumum and other annuals) every year. Don't plant it in the exact spot every year as this will put plants at greater risk for diseases and pests. Plant something different in the previous years spot where flax was grown like another vegetable or annual flowers.

, Flax grows best in loose rich soil like loam (like the topsoil sold in stores) and sand. Heavy soils like compacted clay will not work well unless you dig the soil very deep and replace the clay in the soil with topsoil and compost. Mix/rake in lots of organic matter into the soil like manure and compost into the site. Cultivate and till the soil deeply and remove as many weeds as possible. Flax seedlings don't compete well of fast growing weeds.


Blue Flax species are hardy and can be planted early and withstand heavy frost (temps below 40 degrees F)Other ones are from warmer even tropical regions and this cold can kill them.
Do not plant flax seeds where there are cold season weeds that will compete with the young seedlings. These are weeds that grow during the cool beginning periods of spring (March or April) or fall. Wild mustards, clovers, and burweeds are a few examples of these winter weeds as well as some grasses like winter rye. These weeds can also keep growing during an unusually warm winter.

, Flax seeds like to be planted in cool soil like peas and spinach. Starting in Early or Mid Spring take a sample of the soil from the planting site in your hand and make a ball. If the soil is muddy-feeling or soggy it's too early. If the soil is still frozen wait until later. If the soil feels like it does in a bag of potting soil or crumbles into crumbs it's ready. It it's dry and dusty it's too dry and you have to wait until the soil is rained on again or water it first and repeat the test.

, Less than an inch and not over. If the seed is covered more than an inch the seeds will drown and die in the soil and never raise. You can also just mash the seeds into the surface of the soil with a flat surface like a brick, back of the shovel or rolling pan. This pressing ensures the seeds make soil contact and helps in germination. Seeds will sprout in 1 to 3 weeks and you can notice them as skinny bluish green things popping out the soil.


You can also grow flax seeds inside a peat pot or other degradable (non plastic pot) following the above step. After that plant the young plants outside during spring when the soil warms up and weather settles. First before setting the plants directly in the garden place them in sheltered protected spot for a week than moving them to more exposed and sunny situations. Make sure you cover the entire peat pot and tear out the bottom and the peat pot apart so the peat pot doesn't take water from plant or prevent the plant from growing strong deep roots into the soil.
Don't disturb the flax seedlings or mature plants! They do not like to be moved and moving them can cause them to wilt.This can also break the taproot thus stunting very likely killing the plant. If you must move a flax plant do it in the fall when the plant is dormant to help ease the shock.

, When the seedlings are small cut the heads of the weeds off to the soil line and when the seedlings get big enough and gained strong roots you can begin pulling and destroying the weeds. Don't outroot the weeds when the flax plants are very small or you'll uproot and disturb the baby flax seedlings.

Flax Plants are low maintenance plants and need little after care.",How to Grow Flax from Seed3," These species develop long and deep taproots that make them quite tolerant of drought. The long flowering stems will produce flowers at around 30 to 60 days (annuals) and wait the second year after planting (perennial) and produce those lovely flowers. Heavy rains or hail may flatten your plants but you can always stake and support them.


After flowering stops cut the plant down to the ground for perennial types.Annual species at this time should be uprooted and thrown away to prevent diseases from affecting and killing next years flax crop as these diseases can live in the soil for years. If you want to you can collect seeds from the tiny little brown ""paper lanterns"" and store them for next year in a tightly sealed zip-lock bag.
The only disease flax can get frequently is fungal and mildew. Place flax in a well circulated breezy site and check for plants turning brown, black and mushy.Flax does not take well to high humidity at night. Water plants in morning to prevent water on the leaves from turning into a fungal rot problem.
Several species of moth caterpillars use this group of plants for food and are not major problems. One called cutworm can sometimes kill young plants by just chewing on the only stem straight through.

Follow the instructions provided with your plant species.,
Prepare the seed container.",How to Grow Healthy Seedlings2," If there are any special quirks and requirements that the plant in question has, be sure to meet these needs.

,


Fill the seed container to the top. Make it level (a float can be used to achieve this).
Sow large seeds directly onto the surface.
Sieve a fine layer of potting mix over the even surface and then add small seeds.
Sow evenly to give the growing seedlings space.
Except for seeds that need to remain at the surface (those needing light to germinate), cover the seeds with an even layer of the seed raising mix. A rule of green thumb is to cover to twice the length of the seed.

"
"
Water evenly.,
Keep seedlings warm.,
Thin out seedlings.,
Plant at the right time.",How to Grow Healthy Seedlings3," Keep the soil evenly moist. Avoid over watering and under watering, as both are fatal to seedlings. When watering, use a gentle sprayer or watering can rose to avoid disturbing the delicate soil and seedlings.

, Don't let them get cold or too hot; an ideal temperature range is 18ºc–25ºC. Place them in a warm but not completely sunny spot. Shift them in at night if there is any risk of a cold snap and/or frosts. As seedlings get stronger and older, a porch or veranda can be an ideal place to grow them prior to planting in the garden, as these structures are covered but still allow for the gradual familiarization with outdoor temperatures.

, Overcrowding is unhealthy for seedlings. Remove the seedlings by their first leaf growth (not the stem) and put into a tray that allows for wider spacing. Seedlings subjected to thinning out must be hardened if you are placing them in new growing conditions.

, Avoid planting seedlings in the garden too early or too late, as both will stunt good growth. Follow the instructions provided for the plant species being planted.

,

It should be noted that duckweed will survive with plain tap water, but it won't grow as well.

, A small amount of well decayed plant material can also be placed in the water to fertilize it, but it will be less effective., The surface of the water just needs to be broken/agitated in order to bring in oxygen., If you get the plant from outdoors, make sure you do not collect it from contaminated water. Rinse the duckweed in some warm water to clean it., Leave empty space on the water's surface so that when the duckweed grows, there will be room to fit new leaves."

Dig a deep and wide ditch in an area that is not low, muddy soil or that would receive excessive rainwater ponding.,
Using a waterproof plastic tarp, cover the ditch's bottom surface area.,
Cover the tarp with soil.,
Fill the ditch with dechlorinated water.,
Leave the water to settle for a day.,
After a day of letting it sit (remove and leave any top-cover off).,
Finish up.",How to Grow Duckweed2," Do not make the sides gently slope; otherwise it will flood more easily. Make steep slopes around it. The ditch should be at least three feet deep., Make sure there is at least a few feet extra of tarp extending around the ditch., Raise an edge/water-run-off barrier around it. Try adding some stones or such around the edges.

If you want to use manure (as fertilizer), soak about 1-5 (depending on your ditch size) pounds of it in buckets of water for a day. Spread the mixture on the bottom of your ditch after putting the tarp.

, Some online stores offer dechlorinating liquid in bulk. Leave about a foot of ditch height uncovered by water, to prevent flooding., You might want to cover the ditch with another tarp to prevent insects such as mosquitoes from getting in., Add your duckweed, a pound for every five-ten gallons. Make sure there is empty surface area on your water so the duckweed has room to grow., Perhaps add other compatible aquatic plants (the duckweed might block the sunlight getting to them or vice versa, so try to choose plants that do well without much direct sunlight). Do not add fish if you do not have an established pond; fish need more than just water! Manure in the water will also harm them."

To propagate: If you have the plant in your pond, or a friend or neighbor does, snip off a little piece. It grows readily once added to water.;
, Being a pond plant, it needs something that replicates a pond. A deep wide bowl is idea. A clear bowl is good, as it will help transfer more light to the plant and you can see the plant growth more easily.

, Let the water stand for a few hours to evaporate off any added chemicals, like chlorine.

, Keep the water level up; it mustn't run out of water or it will die.


The plant will keep the water clean itself, so you won't need to take care of that. Just make sure it gets enough water all the time––it's ideal for people who tend to overwater their plants!

, This plant will thrive provided it has access to plenty of bright light. This makes the windowsill an ideal place but any safe bench, shelf or other position in a brightly lit room will probably provide adequate growing conditions.

, The plant will rapidly spread across the bowl. If this causes a crowding problem, trim as needed and discard the trimmed pieces or return them to your pond outside.

Purchase either cacao seeds or a cacao tree seedling.",How to Grow Chocolate Indoors1," Ask your local nursery or garden center if they can get hold of one for you. If not, look for online stockists. Bear in mind the import conditions of your country of residence if you're buying the seeds from overseas. A reputable seller will likely inform you of any issues in relation to this.


A seedling is likely to work best unless you're an experienced gardener, as it will already be toughened for growing in a pot and is less likely to succumb to bacteria or fungi, which is a high possibility with the seeds. On the other hand, if you have access to a fresh cacao pod, by planting all of its seeds, you have 40-50 chances of getting at least one successful plant to grow!
Ask for a ""self-compatible"" cacao plant, so that it does not require pollination to produce cacao fruit-pods (which contain the seeds for making chocolate).
Cacao seedlings produced for home growing may be grafted onto other rootstock.
Cacao seeds must be fresh or germination will fail.Ask the retailer how fresh the seeds are.
Cacao farmers know which of their plants are the best bearers of cacao. They retain the seeds from the pods for replanting at harvest time.You're not going to be able to be so hands-on, so ask your supplier plenty of questions. Find out the length of time for the plant to bear cacao pods. This can vary anywhere from 2 to 5 years, depending on the variety.Pods can be sourced from a friend's garden or farmer's markets in tropical areas. There will be around 40-50 seeds inside each pod, so there are plenty of chances that one will germinate.;

Keep the pot in a warm, humid environment.,
Spritz the cacao tree regularly.,
Keep the chocolate tree away from direct sunlight and intense heat sources.,
Keep the cacao tree warm.,
Mist the plant regularly.,
Feed.,
Read the experiences of other indoor chocolate tree growers.,
Continue to actively care for your plant.",How to Grow Chocolate Indoors2," Start with a container that is large enough for the plant to grow in. For seeds, small containers are okay provided they are deep, as the roots need to burrow down.If growing from beans, the seedlings can be transplanted at about 4-5 months., Use a mixture of well-rotted compost and sand to recreate a rich and sandy soil environment. The soil needs to be fertile and rich. It needs to drain well but hold moisture.


Fine mulch works well., Cacao seeds will sprout quite easily.Seeds must be germinated before planting.
Seeds must be watered at least twice daily after planting.Use a fine, soft spray of water so as not to damage the seeds.

, Ideally, this should be a temperature-controlled greenhouse. If you are planning on keeping the plant indoors without such warmth and humidity, choose a spot with lots of regular warmth.


The preferred temperature level for cacao trees is 79ºF/21ºC, the lowest level being 60ºF/16ºC, without wild fluctuations.Place a bowl of water next to it to release humidity.

, Dry air will kill this plant quickly, so maintaining a humid environment is vital.


For young seedlings, only mist under the leaves, not on the top, as the pooling water can be too heavy for the leaves to withstand., The chocolate tree thrives under the shade of rainforest canopies in nature. It's not fond of the sun and will dry out quickly, and intense heat will do the same.


Do not keep it next to a heater; however, near a heater should be fine, especially if it has a bowl of water constantly near it. Filtered sunlight is optimal. Some people recommend placing the container in a bowl of water but be careful, as this plant doesn't like too much water, just moisture.

, Cold is another enemy of the chocolate tree. This is a tricky plant to grow, the environment must remain warm but neither too hot nor cold. As noted in the previous step, keeping it near gentle radiant heat should be sufficient.


Some people have success with growing on windowsills but it is probably best to keep any such window well shaded and not to use a window that gets direct sunlight blazing in.

, This will help to maintain the humidity levels and replicates the tropical forest environment that the cacao plant is used to.


To help keep a good level of water around, try a tray filled with gravel, pour water into it and keep the container sitting on this. Add water regularly to keep it topped up.

, Use a fertilizer such as liquid seaweed or fish emulsion to keep the nutrients flowing to the plant. A general purpose fertilizer is also fine.Many growers prefer the organic fertilizers.


Do not fertilize seeds until the second set of leaves have appeared., You'll find they have already experimented a lot with placement, humidity control and the like and you can benefit a great deal from their experiences. Many gardening sites will allow you to ask questions in their forums and someone experienced may spot your question and help you out.

, The chocolate tree is not a good plant for the indoor gardener who likes to leave plants to their own devices and expect them to survive. This plant cannot be left to dry out, get cold or overheated. Even when you go away on vacation. Treat it like a pet if you need to go away and get someone to plant-sit it.

Determine your hardiness zone.,
Locate an area with fertile and well-drained soil.,
Select an area that needs “ground cover.” English ivy is notorious for its ability to spread quickly.,
Look for a wall.,
Locate a container.",How to Grow English Ivy1," Hardiness zones are categories (based on temperature and location) that determine which plants while grow well in which areas. English ivy is unlikely to thrive outside of hardiness zones 4 to 9. You can determine your hardiness zone by looking in a farmer’s almanac or visiting the USDA website., English requires likes fertile and well-drained soil. Be sure that the area where you intend to place the plant can accommodate this, or consider using a container (where you can control the planting medium)., As such, you may want to plant your English ivy in a location that would benefit from extensive ground cover., Alternatively, you may want your English ivy to climb up a wall, tree, trellis, or other structure. If you live in a brick house, you may even want the ivy to grow and spread over your home. Select a location like this, and plan to plant your ivy nearby., English ivy can spread so quickly that in some places it is considered an invasive species. As such, you may want to start your English ivy in a container. Any planting container with a drainage hole will work fine. Fill this container with planting medium."

Sow the seeds once the ground begins to thaw.,
Pick a sunny spot in your garden.,
Turn the soil.,
Amend the soil with compost.Mix 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of compost into the garden soil using a trowel or shovel.,
Improve the soil's ability to drain.,
Sprinkle the seeds over the soil.,
Cover the seeds with a light coating of soil.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Space the plants about 12 inches (31 cm) apart.",How to Grow Coreopsis1," Coreopsis flowers can be sown directly in the plant bed during early to mid spring, after the frost has cleared but before the weather gets hot.;
, Coreopsis flowers are native to areas with prairies and dry plains, and as a result, the plant thrives in warm, sunny locations. A south-facing spot that receives full sun often works best, but an east- or west-facing spot that receives at least partial sun will work, as well.

, Use a garden fork or tiller to dig up and loosen the soil in your plant bed. The soil in the plant bed should be turned about 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 cm) deep.

, The compost enriches the quality of the soil, making it nutritional enough for new flowers to grow in.

, These plants do not do well if the roots are water-logged, and good draining soil is essential. If your soil is dense and heavy, you may want to mix in 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of garden sand or peat moss, or vermiculite along with the compost.

, Do so sparingly, preventing the flowers from growing too closely together to avoid crowding them out.

, The soil you use to cover the seeds should be sandy, or otherwise loose. The seeds should not be planted too deep, but a covering of soil is necessary to protect them against the elements and against birds and other predators.

, Water the area with a watering can or garden hose every day, except for rainy days, until the seeds germinate and seedlings start to form. This should only take one or two weeks. Do not allow the soil to dry out during this time.

, By early summer, the plants should have several sets of leaves. At this point, it is best to space them apart by at least 12 inches (31 cm) to prevent the roots from tangling and competing for resources. You can thin the plants out by either snipping the stem off at soil level or by gently yanking weaker plants out of the ground.


To yank out a weaker seedling, insert a garden trowel about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) into the ground, at a distance of about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) away from the visible stem. Gradually ease the trowel toward the plant until the tip is about even with the center of the stem. Then, slowly and carefully lift the plant out roots out. This method works best when you can guarantee that you will not harm the roots of nearby plants or if you plan to transplant the removed flowers to another location.

Take cuttings from an existing ivy plant.,
Moisten your soil.,
Poke holes.,
Use rooting hormone.,
Plant your ivy.",How to Grow English Ivy2," If you know someone who has an English ivy plant (or if you already have one), begin by taking several 4-5 inch clippings. Using a sharp knife (or garden pruners), snip the vines just below a node (the small bump where a leaf grows)., Using a water bottle, spray down your soil (or planting medium) until it is evenly moistened, but not very wet. Alternatively, (if you will be using a container) you can water it heavily and then set it aside to drain., Now you will want to poke several holes in your soil or planting medium. If you are planting in the ground, you will want to place your plants about 12 inches apart. If you are using a container, you can place your plants closer together (as they all may not survive)., Rooting hormone (available in most hardware or garden stores) is a substance that can encourage the growth of roots from plant clippings. Although English ivy can propagate without the use of rooting hormone, using this can help ensure your clippings take root. Simply dip the end of each clipping in liquid rooting hormone immediately before placing them in the ground., After your soil (or planting medium) is prepared, you have your clipping, and you have dipped them in rooting hormone, all that is left is to place each clipping into the holes you have created. Fill in soil around each clipping."

Water the ivy regularly.,
Fertilize the ivy plant sparingly.,
Prune the ivy.,
Cut back well established English ivy beds.,
Spray with soapy water.",How to Grow English Ivy3," English ivy needs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water every week after the initial planting. This can come from rain or from manual watering. After your ivy is firmly established, you can begin watering less regularly., You may choose to give your English ivy a small amount of fertilizer in the spring. You should not use more than 2 tbsp. (30 mL) per square foot (.09 square meters) of slow acting nitrogen fertilizer., You will want to groom your ivy now and then to maintain a clean and tidy appearance. Simply clip stray branches using garden pruners as necessary to keep the shape and appearance of the ivy that you desire., Every few years, you will need to do some more extensive trimming of your established ivy beds. This action will encourage new growth and help your English ivy stay healthy., If you notice your plant is less vibrant (drooping leaves or loss of color), take a close look for aphids or spider mites. (Although they are tiny, both types of insects are visible with the naked eye.) You can control (or even prevent) these insects by spraying the plant with mild soapy water.Combine a few squirts of a mild, chemical-free detergent with filtered water in a spray bottle.
Gently mist your plant with this soapy water once a day for three days to rid your plant of aphids and spider mites.
Then, to keep the insects away, spray you plant once every 1-2 weeks, or after a heavy rain.

Only water established plants during seasons of drought.,
Apply compost every spring.,
Fertilize the flowers once or twice a season.Use an all-purpose, granular, slow-release fertilizer to make the feeding last longer.,
Lay mulch over the flower bed each spring.,
Stake the flowers only as necessary.,
Deadhead the blooms to encourage further blooming.,
Cut back the stems in late fall to early winter.,
Divide the plants every two to three years.,
Watch out for pests and disease.",How to Grow Coreopsis2," If the average rainfall during the summer is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week, you will need to give the soil a good, thorough drenching once a week. Do so early in the morning or in the evening since watering plants in the middle of a hot afternoon can actually cause them to burn when sunlight reflects off the water.

, Use a thin layer, just enough to give the soil a little added boost of nutrition.

, The first feeding should be in the early spring, around the same time that you apply compost. The second should be about two months later.


Alternatively, you can skip the first feeding if you use compost and simply apply one coating several months later, after the initial benefits of the compost have worn off.

, After applying compost and/or an early spring dose of fertilizer, lay 2 inches (5 cm) of wood chips or another mulch over the flower bed and around the stems of the flower. This mulch helps the soil to retain moisture and also prevents weeds from popping up.

, Coreopsis flowers have thick, sturdy stems, and flowers of a moderate height will not need to be staked. If you have larger varieties and the heads begin to droop mid-season, insert a metal or wood pole into the ground about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from the flower and 4 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) deep. Carefully tie the step to the pole using twine or thick yarn.

, When the petals of the flower start to wither and drop, use clean shears to snip off the head of the flower. Doing so redirects the plant's energy and encourages it to sprout additional blooms before the end of the season.

, After the first major frost comes, you should trim the stem of the plant back, only leaving about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem above the soil line.

, Do so in the early spring, when growth is just beginning to develop, or in the mid to late fall, right before the frost comes. Carefully dig the plant up by lifting it out with a shovel. Divide the plant into clumps. Large clumps can be replanted immediately, but smaller clumps may need to be potted and kept indoors until the weaker roots develop more. Weaker clumps that are removed can usually be replanted during the late spring or early summer., Aphids are the most common insect to appear, and leaf spot, rust, and wilt are the most common diseases. If these problems occur, you can treat the plant with an insecticide or fungicide. Only use pesticides as necessary, though. Do not apply preventative pesticides.

Start the seeds in early spring.,
Prepare small containers of loose, rich potting soil.,
Sprinkle seeds over the soil.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Keep the seeds in warm, indirect sunlight.,
Transplant to a larger container.",How to Grow Coleus1," For best results, plant the seeds indoors, 8–10 weeks before the last frost is expected in your area.In a pinch, seeds can be started in late spring or summer, but may not grow as quickly or healthily., Keep a seed tray or small pots indoors, and fill them with seed starting soil or potting soil. Coleus thrives in rich, well-draining material, so mix in peat moss or a similar, loose gardening medium if the soil is dense.

, Spread the seeds onto the soil. Cover them with a thin, ⅛ inch (3 millimeter) layer of the same soil.Do not bury them in the soil, as they require light to germinate.

, Water the seeds lightly but frequently, so the soil remains moist without becoming soggy.If the plants are kept in an arid environment, cover the trays or pots with plastic wrap to prevent them drying out.To water seedlings in small pots, soak the pot in water. The water will work its way up into the soil. This is less disruptive to the young plants.
Remove the plastic wrap as soon as you see seedlings emerge.

, Keep the seed trays at 70º Fahrenheit (21.1º Celsius) at all times, in an area of bright, indirect sunlight., Remove the plastic wrap, if present, as soon as the seedlings emerge. After a seedling has grown its first, small ""seed leaf"" and two sets of adult leaves, it can be safely transplanted to its own pot, or directly into the soil.Refer to the instructions in the care section below to continue handling your coleus plant.

Take cuttings from adult plants, or purchase them.,
Remove the leaves.,
Dip the cut end in rooting hormone (optional).,
Grow them in water (optional).,
Plant the cuttings in moist soil.,
Cover young cuttings with a plastic bag.,
Keep in a warm room with indirect sun.",How to Grow Coleus2," To take a coleus cutting, choose a branch without a bloom or bud at the tip. Cut directly below a leaf node, so the cutting is 4–6 in. (10–15 cm) long.Cuttings are also available for purchase directly, and typically come with a small root ball already developed.


You may take cuttings 2–3 in. (5–7.5 cm) from smaller coleus species., Depending on the length of your cutting, one or two leaf nodes, or areas on the stem where leaves grow from, will be planted beneath the soil. Cut off the leaves growing from these lowest nodes, or they will rot when buried.

, Coleus usually roots quickly on its own, but rooting hormones from a gardening supply stores can be used to speed up their development. If you decide to go this route, follow the instructions on the label to prepare the hormone solution, then dip the cut end of the cutting into it briefly.

, Most coleus cuttings will grow in a glass of water. Change the water every other day, keep the plant in bright, indirect sunlight, and transplant the coleus to a pot once you notice root growth.The soil method below works just as well.

, Plant each cutting in its own, small, indoor pot. Use a rich, well-draining potting soil, and moisten it before planting. If the soil is not loose enough to push the cutting into directly, use a pencil to create a hole for it.Plant the coleus so the bare leaf nodes are under the soil.

, Because young cuttings have not yet grown roots, they are unable to make up for the water they lose from their leaves and stem. To counteract this, cover the entire pot and coleus cutting with a large plastic bag, to trap moisture in the air. Use sticks or toothpicks to prevent the plastic bag from touching the cutting directly.


Remove the bag once you notice new growth on the coleus, typically after 1–4 weeks.

, Keep your potted coleus in a room with temperatures at least 70ºF (21ºC) at all times. Expose it to plenty of indirect sunlight. Once the plant has developed roots and foliage, you can continue caring for it using the instructions below. You may keep it as an indoor plant, or transfer it to your garden if you live in a hot climate.


Cuttings purchased from a nursery are typically greenhouse-raised, and not used to full sun. Transfer them outside gradually, moving the pot from areas of heavy shade to sunnier areas."
"
Transplant the coleus outside.,
Decide on a sunlight level.,
Keep the soil moist, but not soggy.,
Fertilize (optional).,
Prune the coleus.,
Pinch off flowers.,
Stake the plant if necessary.",How to Grow Coleus3," To move the plant outside, choose an area in your garden that drains well with full sun or partial shade. Dig a hole that is twice the size of your root ball, and plant it at the same depth that it was planted in the pot. Replace the soil around the plant. You may want to spread an inch or two of mulch around the plant. Coleus plants can be planted about one foot apart from each other., The more sun coleus receives, the more vibrant its colors will be. If possible, expose your coleus to sun all morning and shade in the afternoon. Otherwise, keep your coleus in partial shade.If your coleus is dropping leaves, it probably needs more sun.
USDA Hardiness zones vary slightly by species and variety, but most coleus plants thrive in zones 9–10, if they are kept indoors in winter and outdoors the rest of the year., Coleus plants require constant moist soil, but will rot if left in puddles. In very hot or windy conditions, you may need to water daily or even twice daily to keep the soil moist. Increase the amount of watering if you notice wilting, dry brown spots, or fading color.Water the soil directly, since wet leaves are vulnerable to disease.

, If you want to speed up the plant's growth, use a general purpose fertilizer such as a 10-10-10 solution. Fertilizer can promote straggly or weak growth, so use one of the following options to keep it to beneficial levels:


Apply a timed-release fertilizer according to instructions, just once each growing season.Or dilute a liquid fertilizer to ½ or ¼ strength, and apply once every 2 weeks., Removing some of the plant's branches is recommended to prevent the coleus becoming top-heavy, and in order to shape it attractively. Here are the basic pruning strategies commonly used for coleus:


To encourage coleus to grow straight, pinch off the side branches, but not the leaves growing directly on the stem. Do this if you want a more ""treelike"" appearance, instead of a wide bush.Once the coleus has reached the desired height, pinch off the top center shoot on the plant, to encourage it to fill out and become bushy., Remove flowers from the plants as soon as they appear, so the plant focuses on growing strong roots and thick foliage instead of creating seeds.If you enjoy the flowers, consider removing most of them and leaving the ones in the most visible locations.

, If the plant becomes top-heavy or leans in one direction, tie it loosely to a gardening stake using twine or another soft material. Ideally, do this during repotting to minimize the number of times you handle the plant.You can also prevent indoor plants from leaning by regularly adjusting which side of the plant is exposed to the light."
"
Keep coleus indoor in cool weather.,
Kill mealy bugs.,
Control whitefly infestations.,
Deal with other pests.,
Prune or treat diseased leaves.",How to Grow Coleus4," Bring outdoor coleus plants inside whenever there is a risk of frost, as a single light frost is often enough to kill the plant.Some coleus plants may even suffer if night temperature are regularly below 60ºF (16ºC).While indoors, keep the plant away from drafts, and stop fertilizing the plant.


During winter, gradually increase the amount of shade the coleus receives, until it is in full shade. Sudden changes can cause leaf drop.When you bring the plants inside, they will drop a few leaves. This is because they are adapting to the new conditions. For the first few weeks, carefully monitor their moisture, temperature, and sunlight exposure.

, Mealy bugs are one of the most common pests found on coleus. These appear as tufts of white fuzz on the stem and leaves, and can be wiped off with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol., Whitefly infestations show up as clouds of small white insects, and/or many white eggs on the undersides of leaves. For outdoor plants, purchase ladybugs or Encarsia species to kill the whiteflies. for indoor plants, hang up whitefly traps or make your own.

, Most other insects, such as aphids, can be sprayed off with water or wiped off with a cloth. Some pests require more specialized methods of control:Tiny red ""spider mites"" can be driven away by increasing the humidity. Place pans of water nearby and mist the affected area lightly.
Tiny black dots hovering near the soil are ""fungus gnats,"" which can be dealt with by adding ¼ in (6 mm) fine gravel on top of the soil, or by reducing watering and increasing air flow.

Get rid of slugs by using a barrier of beer or diatomaceous earth, or purchasing a specialized slug control product.

, Fuzz, black or ringed spots, or other disfigurements are usually the result of fungal disease. Cut off affected leaves immediately, then sterilize the scissors or shears with boiling water or rubbing alcohol to avoid spreading the disease to other plants.Anti-fungal sprays are available at garden supply stores if the disease continues to spread.

Where to grow and how: Chlorella is usually grown in concrete circular ponds up to 45 m in diameter, with agitation by a rotating arm (resembling a clock dial with the second hand running around).,
The Tøeboò culture technology: This technology developed and optimized since 1960, is very different.,
Optimization of the cultivation technology and the use of high-performance algal strains: This makes it possible to achieve high yields of the Chlorella biomass under suitable climatic conditions.",How to Grow Chlorella for a Food Supplement1," or, in horizontal oblong basins (known as ""raceway ponds"") in which a 20–30 centimeter (7.9–11.8 in) thick layer of inorganic nutrient solution with algae, exposed to sunlight and bubbled by carbon dioxide, is continuously moved by means of paddlewheels.;
, It is based on a system of inclined areas on which the algal suspension continuously flows during the day in a very thin layer at an optimum velocity, being thus intensively mixed. The flow velocity and the roughness of the cultivation surface determine the turbulence. Intensive turbulence optimizes the changes of light and dark periods of individual algal cells, resulting in a high efficiency of light utilization. During the night, the algal suspension is stored in aerated collecting tanks. The one-sided inclined area of the first bioreactors was covered with closely spaced transverse baffles, which slowed down the suspension flow velocity and maintained the desired 5-cm layer of algae on the surface. The currently used bioreactors, on the other hand, are composed of two baffle-free flow areas inclined in opposite directions and arranged in a meandering way. Because the flowing algal layer is only 6 mm thick, the suspension volume per unit area is 50 times smaller and the algal concentration 50 times higher than in the basins. This configuration considerably reduces the energy demands for the circulation of the suspension during its cultivation and for the separation of the algae from the nutrient solution during its harvest.

, While in Tøeboò (located at 50o N latitude), the growing season lasts 150 days and the yield is 16 - 20 tones algal dry weight per 1 hectare unit area, in southern Europe or North Africa, where the annual growing season lasts up to 300 days, the yields are up to 3 times higher.

Choose a slow-growing variety.,
Select a large pot.,
Use a pot that offers plenty of drainage.,
Be mindful of the material your pot is made of.,
Plan on planting your clematis during the late summer or early autumn.",How to Grow Clematis in Pots1," Vigorous varieties, like the ""Montana,"" require too much room for their roots to grow, making container planting a disaster. Look for varieties including ""Bees Jubilee,"" ""Carnaby,"" ""Dawn,"" ""Fireworks,"" ""Lady Northcliffe,"" and ""Royalty,"" among several others.;
, Conventional wisdom states that clematis need a container with a minimum diameter of 18 inches (45.7 cm). Even small clematis can reach heights of 6 feet (1.8 m), and the roots that accompany such a tall plant need plenty of room to spread out.

, Clematis need to have cool, moist roots, but too much water can quickly turn into a problem, especially during cooler weather. If the pot you select does not have at least three drainage holes already, drill a few into the bottom.

, Each material has its own pluses and minuses.


Terra cotta pots keep the soil well drained, but they are also heavy and likely to crack during the winter until kept indoors.
Stone pots can last through a variety of temperatures, but they are often even heavier than clay pots.
Plastic pots do not drain water quite as well, but they are light and fairly durable.
Containers made of treated wood offer a good balance between durability, weight, and drainage, especially if they have an inner lining made of tin designed to preserve the wood longer.

, This will give the plant plenty of time to get comfortable before becoming dormant over the winter. By summer of the following year, it should produce a few flowers.

After the algae have grown sufficiently.,
Although the concentrated suspension contains up to ten billion cells per milliliter, the proportion of disrupted cells after two to three-minute disintegration reaches more than 90 %.,
the last step in the processing is the drying.",How to Grow Chlorella for a Food Supplement2," To attain a density of approximately 30 g dry weight per 1 l nutrient medium, the algae are harvested. The first step is the concentration of the suspension on disc centrifuges. The concentrated algae are repeatedly washed with water in order to remove remnants of the nutrient solution and other impurities. To achieve the maximum benefit of the valuable cell contents that are enclosed in a tough cellulose 'coat' (a fitting analogy might be the leather 'coat' of a football), we developed a procedure such that the algae pass through a device in which they are mechanically disrupted.

, The grinding of cells increases two to three-fold their digestibility - achieving values comparable with the digestibility of pure proteins.

, This takes place in spray driers - in which the algal biomass is distributed into micro-droplets whose surface temperature does not surpass 60 °C (140 °F) during the entire 50 seconds for which the drying period lasts. The whole processing procedure is a very gentle one and the dried algal biomass, with the consistency of dried milk powder, thus retains all the valuable components in their original state.

Drench the soil.",How to Grow Clematis in Pots2," Stones or gravel may also be used. These materials prevent the drainage holes from getting clogged with potting mix, creating better drainage conditions as a result.


You can find most of these materials at a garden supply store, but if you are unable to locate them, you can also collect stones from a nearby creek or use a hammer to break an old clay pot into pieces. If collecting these materials from nature, though, you should sterilize them by soaking them in hot soapy water, or in a solution made with one part bleach and four parts water.

, Rotted turf can be obtained by digging up a patch of grass and soil, dumping it into a spare pot, and soaking it for several days. Place the turf upside-down on top of the crocks. Alternatively, you can also use rotted farm manure or garden compost. These materials may be easier to find at garden or farming supply stores. Regardless of what you choose, these materials should all be kept away from the clematis root ball, however, since bacteria and insect eggs could be lurking inside the rot and could cause problems to the newly growing plant.

, Loam-based compost works best because it retains moisture more effectively than loam-free compost. Moreover, clematis need a rich soil filled with nutrients, making a compost-based potting mix essential.

, Clematis roots can grow in tightly packed soil, and the firmer you pack it in, the less it will sink upon being watered. Ideally, the top of your soil will only be 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the rim of the container.

, Fill a bucket with lukewarm water and allow the root ball to soak in the water for 10 to 20 minutes. You will need to fill the bucket with around one gallon of water for every inch in diameter of the root ball. This should be done before you plant it, since you want to make sure that the root ball is thoroughly drenched.

, When the hole seems just big enough for the root ball to fit, dig out an additional 2 inches (5.1 cm) of compost. The root ball needs these extra few inches of ""wiggle room"" in order to thrive.

, Verify that the top of the root ball is two inches below the surface.

, Tightly pack the compost around the root ball, making sure that it remains firmly fixed in place.

, The compost does not need to be saturated to the point of puddling, but it should feel notably damp upon being touched.

Check your clematis every day to determine whether or not the soil is moist enough.,
Place the pot in a location that receives partial sun.,
Fertilize your clematis in the spring with high quality compost or a granular fertilizer like 10–20–10.,
Provide the clematis with ample support.,
Prune your clematis accordingly.,
Watch out for signs of fungi.",How to Grow Clematis in Pots3," Stick your finger into the top inch of the soil. If it feels dry, give your plant another healthy dousing of water.

, Clematis only need about six hours of direct sun per day, and they prefer to have their roots in shade. Placing the clematis near an eastern or western window, or in a shady spot on your deck or patio, should provide sufficient light.

, The amount of fertilizer you add after that will vary based on the type you use. A rose fertilizer a month or two apart should provide enough nutrients, or you could give the plant a liquid fertilizer high in potash two to three times a month. Too much fertilizer can cause harmful salts to build up in the soil, however, so you must monitor your plant to determine if it is still healthy.


The label ""10-20-10"" refers to the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen produces leaves, phosphorus strengthens the roots, and potassium helps flower growth. The fertilizer you choose should be balanced in nitrogen and potassium with a slightly higher content of phosphorus.

, Once the vine starts growing, insert a bamboo cane or thick stake at a slight angle into the pot, getting it as close to the side of the pot as possible to avoid disrupting their roots. As the vines grow, gently tie them onto the cane using twine or yarn. Proper vertical support will allow your clematis to become bushier and taller, leading to more foliage and a greater amount of flowering.

, There are three types of clematis, and each has its own pruning requirements.


For clematis that bloom early on the previous year's growth, you should remove all the dead and weak stems as soon as the plant flowers.
For clematis that bloom between mid and late summer on old and new growth you should only remove dead growth once the plant gets crowded.
For clematis that bloom between mid and late summer on new growth alone, you should remove all growth from the previous year, only leaving the lowest pair of buds.

, Clematis wilt and leaf spot are the two most common diseases faced by this plant. Infected stems should be removed, and the remaining plant should be treated with fungicide.

Handle the chickpeas carefully.,
Manage pests as you see them.,
Keep an eye out for signs of disease.,

Store the chickpeas properly.",How to Grow Chickpeas," Start the seeds roughly four weeks before the date of your last expected frost. Since chickpea seeds are somewhat fragile, you should sow them indoors instead of planting them in the cold ground.


If you do intend to plant chickpea seeds outdoors, wait one to two weeks before your last expected frost and cover the area at night with a light mulch or old sheets to help insulate the seeds.
Chickpeas have a long growing season and may take 90 to 100 days until they are ready to harvest. Because of this, you will need to plant them as early as possible.;
, Chickpea seedlings do not transplant well, so you should use paper or peat seedling pots that can be planted directly into the ground instead of using plastic or ceramic containers.


Seedling pots can be purchased online and at most gardening centers.

, Fill the seedling pots with a little potting soil, then plant one seed in each pot, positioning it 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) deep.Planting one seed per pot is recommended, but you can plant up to two. When the seedlings sprout, though, you will need to thin them down to one per pot. If you do need to thin out the seedlings, cut the weaker seedling away at soil level using sharp scissors. Do not dig it out since doing so could disturb the roots.
Sprouting usually takes about two weeks.

, Water the soil gently every day. If it gets hot, water them twice a day. Place the seedling pots near a window that receives plenty of direct sunlight and keep the surface of the soil evenly moist until the seedlings sprout.


Do not soak the seed before sowing it. You should also avoid heavy waterings after sowing the seeds since they can cause the seeds to crack. The surface of the soil should be slightly moist, but do not drench the soil beyond that.

, Chickpeas thrive in ""full sun"" conditions, so you should choose an area that receives at least six hours of direct sunlight.Ideally, the soil bed should also have loose, well-drained soil already packed with organic material.


You can grow chickpeas in partial shade, but doing so will dramatically decrease the eventual yield.
Do not plant chickpeas in areas where green manures have grown or in soils that have a high nitrogen content. Nitrogen will cause the leaves to get large and bushy, but the overall yield of the plant will end up decreasing if nitrogen levels are too high.
Avoid heavy clay soils or areas that are especially shady.

, To improve the condition of the soil and ready it for your plants, chop in a few handfuls of aged compost a day to a week before transplanting.


Also consider mixing in a fertilizer rich in potassium and phosphorus to encourage a higher yield.
If the soil is too heavy, mix in agricultural sand, fine gravel, or a soil perfecter to make it less dense and to improve drainage. Avoid mixing in mosses, since these tend to trap too much water.

, Chickpea seedlings are considered “frost tolerant,” but they still thrive best when transplanted outdoors after the threat of frost passes. The seedlings should also be about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.7 cm) tall at the time of transplant.


The plants will grow best when daytime temperatures range between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 and 27 degrees Celsius) and when night temperature stay above 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius).

, Space the seedlings 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.25 cm) apart. The holes you dig should be as deep as the seedling pots.


As they grow, the plants will start crowding into each other. A little crowding can actually be a good thing, though, since the plants help support each other as they cross into each other.
If planting the chickpeas in rows, space the rows 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) apart., As noted, each hole you dig should be big enough to fit the entire seedling pot. Place the seedling pot in the hole and lightly cover the edges with additional soil.


Do not attempt to remove the seedlings from their pots. Doing so can shock the delicate root system and cause the plants to die.

, Regular rainfall is usually sufficient, but if the season is a dry one, water the chickpeas twice a week during the flowering and pod formation stages.


Avoid ""overhead"" watering. Water can get on the flowers and pods, causing them to break off prematurely. Pouring water over the plant can also invite mildew to develop. When you water the chickpeas, water them directly at the soil level.
Once the pods mature and the plant begins to die back on its own, cut back on watering the plant. Once every one to two weeks should suffice. Doing so encourages the drying process, which you'll want to the plant to go through before the harvest.

, Once the weather warms up, you should add a light coat of mulch around the stems. Doing so can retain an adequate amount of soil moisture, which is especially important if your plants are receiving full sun.


Mulch can also help prevent weeds from invading the plant bed.

, You can add a little aged compost or similar organic material to the soil around the chickpeas mid-season. As before, though, you should avoid adding nitrogen-rich fertilizers.


Chickpeas work with microorganisms in the soil to produce their own nitrogen, so they receive all the nitrogen they really need. Any excess nitrogen will cause the leaves to grow bushier and may dampen the eventual yield.

, When removing weeds or adding anything to the soil, you need to work carefully to avoid disturbing the plant's root system. The root system of a chickpea plant is quite shallow, so working too close to the base of the plant can cause damage to its roots.


You should also avoid handling the plants when they are wet since doing so can cause fungus spores to spread quickly.

, Chickpeas are vulnerable to attacks by a range of different pests. You should avoid pre-treating the plant for pests, though, and instead wait until you spot pests before taking action against them.


Adult aphids, leafhoppers, and mites can be controlled with a blast of water from the hose or insecticidal soap.
After noticing adult pests, look for eggs and crush them between your fingers. Alternatively, simply cut away any leaves with egg cases on them.
For notably bad infestations, try a natural and food-safe pesticide containing pyrethrins.
You should also keep the garden free of debris to reduce the number of pests.

, These plants are also vulnerable to a few different diseases, including blight, mosaic, and anthracnose. Plant disease-resistant varieties when possible.


To avoid the spread of disease, keep the planting bed free of debris and avoid handling the plants when they are wet.
Remove diseased plants and discard them to prevent the disease from spreading. Burn them or put them in the trash, but do not use them for compost.

, If you want to eat the chickpeas fresh, you can pluck off the pods while they are still green and immature. Eat fresh chickpeas like snap beans.


The pods only reach a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm), and each pod only contains one or three beans.

, The more popular way to harvest chickpeas is to harvest them as dried chickpeas. To do so, you will need to harvest the entire plant once the leaves wither and turn brown. Place the plant on a flat, warm surface and let the pods air dry naturally in a warm, well-ventilated location. Collect the seeds as the pods split open.


Mature seeds will be very hard. When bitten into, they should barely dent.
If the weather is getting damp, bring the harvested plant or pods indoors to finish drying them. Otherwise, mold could develop on the pods and ruin the chickpeas inside.
Also note that mice and other rodents may threaten your yield if you allow the plants to dry outdoors.

, Fresh, unshelled chickpeas can be kept in the refrigerator for one week. Dried, shelled chickpeas should be kept in a cool, dry location and can remain there for up to one year.


Keep dried chickpeas in an airtight container if you intend to store them for more than a few days.
Chickpeas can also be frozen, canned, or sprouted.

Buy or find a baby dracaena marginata.,
Fill appropriate size pot for the size plant with standard potting soil.,
Transplant the dracaena marginata into the new pot.

,
Place the pot in an area low in natural light.,
Water the dracaena approximately once a week.,
Maintain a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (or 18 to 24 degrees Celsius) around the plant.

,
Maintain a relative humidity of 30 to 40 percent around the plant.,
Regularly wipe the leaves with a damp cloth.,
Use liquid fertilizer on the dracaena once or twice a month.

",How to Grow Dracaena Marginata1,";
, Do not over-pot.

,,


Dracaenas flourish with constant, low-intensity light. Do not place them in an area where the sun strikes directly, especially in the afternoon, but keep them out of dark corners. Likewise, low-intensity fluorescent lighting is ideal for dracaenas; more intense, direct light can be damaging.

,


Because of their low water needs, it's important not to over-water dracaenas. Soak the soil about once a week; wait until the top of the soil is dry to the touch before watering again. If you are in a dry or warm area, you may need to water more regularly. Do not let dracaenas sit in water.

,,


Use a hygrometer to measure humidity. They can be purchased for around $15 at most hardware stores.

,


This helps both to remove dust and to keep the leaves fresh. If the plant is in a particularly dry area, spraying the leaves with water mist can also help.

Plant boxwoods in full sun.,
Do not plant them where they will be exposed to harsh winds.,
Make sure the soil drains well and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.0.Soil that drains too slowly will keep the roots too wet and could cause the boxwood to develop root rot.,
Take a pH reading of your soil.,
Adjust your soil’s pH if necessary.",How to Grow Boxwood Shrubs1," They should get at least six to eight hours of direct sunlight, or partial shade, with four to six hours of direct sunlight.


Keep in mind that when planted in full sun, especially in hotter climates, they must be watered more often than if they are planted in partial shade.If they are not watered sufficiently, the leaves may be scorched by the sun.;
, This is especially important during the winter. The wind will dry out the leaves and turn them bronze.

, Test the soil drainage capabilities by digging a 1- to 1 1/2-foot deep hole and filling it with water.


The water should soak into the surrounding soil within 24 hours. If the water is still standing after 24 hours, consider a different shrub or build a raised bed for the boxwood that is 1 to 1 ½ feet high.

, A soil pH test kit can be purchased at a local garden center or nursery.Take the soil sample from 4 inches deep right where the shrub will be planted. Be careful not to contaminate the sample by using your hands as human skin can alter the soil pH readings.


Let the sample dry, crush it until it has a fine texture, pour it into the test kit container and add distilled water and the chemical provided in the kit.
Shake the mixture and let it settle. Compare the color of the distilled water with the color chart provided with the test kit.

, Mix lime or elemental sulfur into the soil to adjust the pH, if necessary. How much must be added depends on the soil type and how much the pH needs to be adjusted.


It takes 5 pounds of lime to adjust the pH of 100 square feet of loamy soil from 6 to 6.5 or 1 to 1 1/4 pounds of aluminum sulfate to adjust it from 7.5 to 7.
It takes less to adjust sandy soil and more to adjust clay. Incorporate the lime or sulfur into the soil thoroughly with a tiller prior to planting the boxwood shrub.

"
"
Water the newly planted boxwood shrub as often as necessary to maintain uniformly moist soil for the first two years after planting.,
Look for signs that your tree is not getting the right amount of water.,
Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth or organic mulch over the soil around the boxwood.,
Do not push the mulch right up against the boxwood’s stems.,
Fertilize the boxwood in early spring or late winter just before it begins to grow again.,
Do not get fertilizer on the stems as it could burn them.,
Do not give the boxwood fertilizer after the middle of summer.,
Look for signs that your boxwood is not getting the right amount of fertilizer.",How to Grow Boxwood Shrubs2," The soil should never be allowed to dry out. After the first two years, water it when the top inch or two of soil becomes dry., If the boxwood it not getting enough water or if is getting too much water, it will appear drought-stressed with brown or yellow leaves.

, This will help the soil to retain moisture and keep the roots cooler in the summer.


Shredded bark mulch is ideal.

, Keep it back a few inches to reduce the likelihood of stem disease brought on by excessive moisture.

, Sprinkle fertilizer with a 10-10-10 ratio (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium or N-P-K) evergreen shrub fertilizer on the soil beginning 6 inches from the stems and extending to about 2 feet beyond the outer edge of the shrub branches., Water the fertilizer into the soil. If the soil is very sandy, give the boxwood a second dose of fertilizer towards the end of spring. Fertilizer is washed out of sandy soil more quickly than loamy or clay soil.

, Doing this could cause the boxwood to grow new leaves in the fall. These new leaves may not be mature enough to withstand winter weather without sustaining damage.

, Boxwoods that are not given enough fertilizer will grow very slowly. Too much fertilizer will cause brown, burned areas along the leaf edges.

"
"
Know when to prune your tree.,
Use sharp bypass pruners to trim off dead, injured or diseased branches.,
Prune out the oldest branches when the shrub is over five years old.",How to Grow Boxwood Shrubs3," Prune boxwood shrubs at any time between the last expected spring frost and six weeks prior to the first expected fall frost.If it is pruned before the last frost or too close to the first frost, new foliage will grow and likely be damaged by the frost.

, Prune them off all the way to the base of the branch. Use hedge shears to shape the shrub and neaten it up but do not shear off more than a few inches. Severe shearing will stress the shrub and cause it to grow more slowly.

, Prune them off all the way to the base. This will open up the center of the shrub to more sunlight and new foliage that will fill in bare spots at the center of the shrub.

Check your growing zone.In the USA, Caladiums can grow in USDA hardiness zones three to ten.The tubers begin growing at 70 °F (21 °C), and caladiums will die if the temperature falls any lower.,
Buy caladium tubers or potted plants.,
Choose a planting spot.,
Prepare the soil for planting.,
Plant the caladiums.,
Keep caladiums well watered.,
Fertilize caladiums periodically.,
Overwinter your caladiums.",How to Grow Caladiums," If you live in a place with plenty of heat and humidity through the summer, you'll be able to grow caladiums outdoors. Otherwise, you can grow caladiums as a gorgeous indoor plant.;
, You can order caladium tubers (often called bulbs) online or buy them from your local nursery. The larger the tubers, the larger your plants will be.To make planting even easier, purchase sprouted caladiums in small pots. That way you need only transfer the plants from the pot to the ground (or simply keep them in pots indoors) to enjoy their beauty.


Caladiums come in many different colors and varieties. Fancy-leaf caladiums have large, heart-shaped leaves.Strap-leaf caladiums are shorter plants with bunches of leaves.
Dwarf caladiums have small, heart-shaped leaves.

, Most caladium varieties do best in shady, moist spots. Plan to plant caladiums in a dark area that could use some bright foliage - under trees, along the house, or in another shady place. Caladiums grow well with ferns, mosses and impatiens.If you're keeping your caladiums indoors, plan to put them in a place out of direct sunlight. Choose a room that stays warm and humid but isn't completely flooded with sun.
Choose a spot that doesn't get strong winds. The leaves can be damaged easily.

, Caladiums need rich, well-drained soil. Till the soil to a depth of at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) and work in compost or chopped leaves to enrich it. If you're planting caladiums in pots, a standard rich potting soil will do.


Make sure the soil drains well by digging a hole and filling it with water. If the water stands, the soil doesn't drain well enough; you'll need to mix it with organic matter to loosen it up. If the water soaks in, the soil is well-draining.

, Plant the tubers 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) deep with pointed sides up. Space the holes 8 to 14 inches (20.3 to 35.6 cm) apart, with wider spacing for larger tubers.If you have small potted caladiums, dig holes twice as large as the root balls, set the plants into the holes, and pack the soil firmly around the stems.


If you are planting several tubers together in a large pot, space tubers 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) apart.

, Make sure the soil is kept moist, but not soggy. The tubers will rot in soggy soil. To help keep the right level of soil moisture, mulch around the plants after you have planted them., Use potash and phosphorus as well as a 5-10-10 fertilizer monthly to ensure optimum growth.

, If you live in a region where the temperature drops below 70 degrees in the winter, dig up the caladium tubers. Replant them when the soil is warm again. If your caladium is in a container, simply bring it inside for the winter. Caladiums do well as house plants. Be sure they get some sunlight during the day. Fertilize every few weeks with a liquid fertilizer.


When your plant begins to die back, but before the first frost, dig up the tuber and discard the wilted leaves.
Let the tubers dry out for a few days and then store them with dry peat moss in a box or paper bag in a dark cool place for the winter.Throw out any soft or empty feeling tubers.
Plant when the soil is warm and ready for your caladiums to grow well.

Brown boronia (Boronia megastigma) - heavenly scent and bell shaped flowers - you can't let its root zone dry out or it will die



 


Other varieties include Purple Jared, Lutea, Jack MacQuire's Red, Sunset Serenade, Harlequin, etc.






It is recommended for the best success that you select one that is native to your local area.;
, Boronias do best under dappled light. They also tend to grow best near the coast rather than in inland gardens.

, Most boronias need to grow where there will be plenty of moist soil that drains well. To help the plant stay moist, mulch the area really well.

,, Provide shade, if needed, during very hot spells.

, Do a light prune after the boronia has flowered.

Be aware that seed-grown Bacopa may grow smaller flowers.,
Start growing your seeds in late winter.,
Remove the cover after the seeds germinate.,
Encourage bushy growth.,
Consider growing Trailing Bacopa from a cutting.Trailing varieties of Bacopa can be easily propagated from a cutting.,
Help your cutting to grow.,
Harden off your cuttings before planting them outside in the spring.",How to Grow Bacopa Plants1," You can grow some varieties of Bacopa from seed. However, seed grown Bacopa plants generally offer smaller flowers than ones propagated by other methods.;
, Fill a container with moist compost. Sprinkle the seeds onto the compost; do not cover them with soil. Mist the seeds with a water spray. Put the container into a clear plastic bag and place it in a bright area out of direct sunlight, such as a window ledge that is not in full sun.


The seeds germinate quickly; you should see new growth within ten days.

, Consider removing the weaker seedlings at this point in order to thin the plants out and preserve the stronger seedlings. Once big enough to handle, you can transfer the seedlings to individual pots.


Wait until all danger of frost has passed before planting the Bacopa seedlings outside.

, Some gardeners advise pinching off the growing tip once the Bacopa plants get to about four inches in height. This encourages bushy growth.

, To do this, in late summer cut about three inches of fresh healthy stem from a Bacopa plant using a clean sharp blade. Dip the cut end in rooting powder or hormone after you have made the cut.


Remove the lower leaves on the stem, then insert an inch of cut stem into a pot containing cutting mix. You can buy special cutting compost, or make your own by mixing 50:50 vermiculite and sand.

, Water your cutting, then enclose it in a clear plastic bag. Keep the cutting out of direct sunlight but in a well-lit area, such as a window ledge that does not get direct sun. Make sure the cutting doesn’t dry out; mist the cutting with a spray bottle if necessary.


The cuttings should root after about five weeks. You can then transfer the cuttings to individual pots.

, Hardening off means gradually adjusting the plants to life outdoors.


To do this, put them outside during the day and bring them in at night over a period of about two or three weeks.

Pick out a planting site that has partial shade.,
Plant the Bacopa in soil that drains well.,
Dig a hole for your Bacopa.,
Encourage bushy growth by pinching back branches.,
Consider planting your Bacopa in a container.",How to Grow Bacopa Plants2," Bacopa favors partial shade although it will survive in full sun. The plant grows best if it can avoid the full heat of the day so consider planting in an area that only gets morning or late afternoon sun.


Some varieties, such as ‘Snowstorm’, can handle high temperatures better than other Bacopa varieties.
You can also plant Bacopa alongside taller plants to give them some shade during the hotter parts of the day.

, Bacopa plants do not like wet feet. Because of this, your plant needs good drainage and a rich soil. The ideal soil for growing Bacopa is slightly acidic.

, Once you have selected a site for your plant, dig a hole for each individual Bacopa plant. The plants should be spaced roughly seven or eight inches apart. Place the plant in the hole and fill the rest of the hole with soil. Pat the soil down gently and give it a good watering to remove any air pockets.

, Bacopa plants don’t need much attention once they are planted. However, you can pinch back the branches once they get to about four inches in length to encourage bushy growth. To do this:


Use your fingertips to remove the tips of the growing shoots by about a third of an inch.

, Trailing Bacopa grow well in hanging baskets. If you plant to cultivate Trailing Bacopa, consider planting it in a hanging basket or container. Add a peat-based potting mix to the container. Include some vermiculite or other water-retaining soil additive. Make sure the container has good drainage.


Plant your Bacopa in the center of the basket. Feed your plant a weak solution of water soluble fertilizer once every fortnight.

Do not allow your Bacopa plants to dry out.,
Feed your plant with a liquid fertilizer.,
Protect your Bacopa against aphids.,
Prune your Bacopa.",How to Grow Bacopa Plants3," Bacopa plants have a little quirk: they lose flowers and foliage if allowed to dry out. If your Bacopa plant gets very dry it will cease flowering for a few weeks. Try to prevent this from happening, keep the soil well-watered.


Avoid mulching as this may cause your low growing Bacopa to rot.
You may find it easier to grow the plants in containers so you can more easily control moisture levels. Make sure the container drains well.

, Try to feed your Bacopa once every three weeks during the growing season to promote flowering. You should see flowers appearing from mid to late spring, and lasting through until summer.


Avoid watering seedlings with a water-soluble fertilizer that you spray from above, as this can ‘burn’ them.

, You can combat aphids by spraying bug spray on your plants, or by hosing the aphids off with water. However, be careful not to damage your Bacopa by spraying them with a hose.

, If your Bacopa gets very woody in the lower branches by mid summer, or is producing fewer flowers, try cutting the plant back by about a third. Feed and water after doing this to help the plant to start thriving again. Old, woody growth will hold moisture and may rot.


If you are in zone 9 or above, cut your Bacopa plants back again in the fall. This encourages them to re-grow in the spring. In cooler zones, take cuttings in the fall then bring them inside the house to propagate over winter. Plant them outside again in the spring.

Use beer or milk traps for important plants.,
Kill slugs with a cornmeal trap.,
Lure slugs with humane traps.,
Protect traps from rain and pets.,
Go hunting for snails at night.",How to Get Rid of Garden Slugs1," Slugs will only notice these traps from a few feet (about a meter) away, so this is best used for small gardens or important areas.Set these up as follows:


Bury a tall cup with steep sides into the soil. Leave the rim ½ inch (1.25 cm) above the soil, to prevent the trap killing beetles that hunt slugs.Fill the cup halfway with beer or milk.
Replace every few days. If the slugs are climbing out, replace with a mix of honey, yeast, and a little water, boiled until gluey.;
, Cornmeal is cheaper, but may not attract as many slugs. Put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and lay it on its side. Keep the cornmeal dry, and it will kill slugs by expanding inside them., Slugs will gather in shady, moist areas, such as underneath wooden planks, flower pots, or cardboard boxes. Set these up and check them daily for living snails to gather and discard a long distance from your house. For best results, attract them with one of the following slug foods:Cabbage leaves
Citrus fruit rinds, moistened with water
Dry pet food

, Water will ruin cornmeal and liquid traps. Set up an overhead cover to keep rain out. If you have pets that may eat the bait themselves, use a sturdy cover such as an upside-down flowerpot with a small entrance.

, While not the most fun task, hunting individual slugs may be necessary to deal with large infestations. Use a flashlight and disposable gloves, skewering the snails with a stick or dropping them in a bucket of soapy water.If you have one, a headlamp will leave both your hands free, making hunting easier.


Check the undersides of leaves.
Follow any slime trails you notice.

Keep your garden dry.,
Create mulch or tea from certain plants.,
Make a copper strip barrier.,
Sprinkle salt on non-soil surfaces.,
Build folk remedy barriers.,
Grow plants that deter slugs.,
Consider using more powerful (but more hazardous) barriers.",How to Get Rid of Garden Slugs2," You won't see the result immediately, but keeping a dryer garden is the best method for long-term slug control. Here are some tactics for making your garden less friendly to the damp-loving pests:Water plants in the early to mid morning, so the soil dries before nightfall.

Install drip irrigation to minimize water use.
Keep the yard free of debris, and mow the lawn regularly.
Avoid organic mulches, such as straw or grass clippings.
Space plants far enough apart to allow air flow between them.

, The following plant preparations all deter slugs to some extent, if you can find them in your local gardening store:Oak leaf mulch or tobacco stem meal, spread as a barrier around plants
Wormwood tea, made from steeping artemisia cuttings in warm water for 24 hours. Strain and combine with soapy water, then spray onto soil or slugs., Purchase strips of copper foil wide enough that the slugs can’t bridge it with their bodies. Use them to form a barricade around your plants or planting beds.


Young children may cut themselves on the strips., Spread salt on the surface where the slugs are crawling around to kill them by drawing out moisture. Be aware that salt can easily kill plants and ruin soil. Use this around the base of potted plants on a porch, or place a barrier on the soil prior to spreading the salt in order to protect the integrity of the soil.


Avoid using salt in situations where it can come into the contact with water (like when rainy weather is likely or a sprinkler is running). Water can dissolve salt and wash it off of ""safe"" surfaces and into the soil, harming soil quality.

, Frustrated gardeners have thrown just about any substance in their garden to try to keep slugs away. The following are the best of these homemade solutions, but are unlikely to deter 100% of slugs:


Coffee grounds may have mild effects on the health of your garden.
Sharp, coarse sand scrapes against slugs, but may not deter them completely.
Seaweed is not as effective as plain salt, but perhaps a little safer for your soil. Calcified seaweed meal is better, if you can find it., Certain plants keep slugs away because of their taste, texture, or toxins. Plant these in a barrier around the entirety of your garden, or keep one near each other plant. These are not 100% immune, but they will deter many slugs for no effort besides the initial planting. Try the following species:Herbs: ginger, garlic, chives, mint, and chicory.
Vegetables: bitter greens are generally less appealing to slugs than sweet greens. Try planting kale, spring cabbage, or sprouting broccoli.
Hosta varieties with blue leaves are more resistant.
Flowers for full shade: Astilbe, Dicentra, Digitalis (foxglove), Lobelia, Viola (some pansies and violets). Also Ranunculus (buttercups) and Vinca, but these spread rapidly.
Flowers for partial shade: Phlox, Campanula, Hemerocallis. Also Mentha, but this spreads rapidly.

, There are several materials that can kill slugs on contact. These can be used to make effective barriers to prevent slug movement, but they must be used carefully and kept dry.Improper use can hurt your garden (and even the people or animals who use it). Be sure to apply these materials to non-soil surfaces except where noted:



Safety warnings: Do not inhale any of these substances or handle with bare hands. These may not be suitable in gardens where children or pets play.
Diatomaceous earth: May harm beneficial insects.Wood ash: Raises soil pH, which can affect plants.

Hydrated lime: Raises soil pH greatly. Can make soil uninhabitable for many plants.

1% Caffeine spray: Applied directly to the plants you want to protect; kills slugs when they feed. Can negatively affect many plants in unpredictable ways.

Introduce ground beetles.,
Use birds to your advantage.,
Bring in some toads.,
Commit to nematodes if necessary.",How to Get Rid of Garden Slugs3," Ground beetles are a natural predator of slugs. You can purchase ground beetle larvae from a gardening store and distribute them through your garden in early spring. The larvae will feed, enter their pupae, and emerge as adult beetles in the summer.. Alternatively, you can encourage wild beetles to stay near your plants by providing dry refuges under stones, grass, or straw. This allows the beetles to hide from predators, making your garden an attractive home. Luckily, ground beetles can live almost everywhere that slugs can also live., The biggest natural predators for slugs are birds; ducks, chickens, robins, jays, and other common species all enjoy a slug meal. If you’re not too squeamish, you can pick out slugs and toss them to the wild birds in the morning; they will become conditioned to look for slugs in your area over time, and you won’t have to ‘feed’ them for long. You can also let your chickens or ducks, if you have domesticated ones, eat the slugs from your garden on a daily basis.


Keep a close eye on your chickens, as they may eat plants as well.
Encourage birds to nest in your garden by providing hedges or dense shrubbery, bird feeders, and a bird bath., Toads love slugs, and will eat them and other pests from your plants if you give them a home in your garden. If you’re trying to attract wild toads, turn a pot or other container upside down against a rock to create a dark hiding place for the toads. Otherwise, you can look into purchasing wild toads to live in your garden and eat the slugs on a daily basis for you. You can also look into adding a small decorative pond for the toads and frogs to reside in.Do not keep fish in the pond, as these may eat the tadpoles.

, Nematodes are microscopic parasitic worms that live in soil. You can purchase nematode species specifically for killing slugs at your local gardening store. This can be extremely effective, but this is a double-edged sword. Once all the slugs are killed, their predators (and the nematodes) will leave the area or die out. If you do not reapply the nematodes every few weeks, a massive wave of slugs may invade and take over due to the lack of threats.The nematodes should come with directions. Typically, they are spread over the soil, then watered in.

Spray slugs with ammonia.,
Use iron phosphate pellets.,
Try metaldehyde.",How to Get Rid of Garden Slugs4," You can create a slug killing spray by making a solution of ammonia and water. Mix 1 part plain household ammonia with 6 parts water. Pour this into a spray bottle, and spritz it onto the slugs whenever you see them. Just be careful not to use it directly on the plants, as over time it might burn the leaves.

, These small slug-killing pellets can be found in garden centers, for spreading around your yard. The slugs are attracted to them, but once consumed will cause their deaths within a week. This treatment is safe for most pets and edible plants, but it may still be a good idea to minimize use.Commercial names include Sluggo, Slug Magic, and Escar-Go.

, Metaldehyde is a common anti-slug treatment, but it has its limitations.Notably, metaldehyde can be very poisonous to pets (especially dogs).Proper handling and placement of this bait is essential to avoid a dangerous situation for family pets.


Avoid ""pellet"" form metaldehyde, which can be mistaken for pet treats. Use ""granule"" form instead.
Store the metaldehyde somewhere dogs cannot get to it.
Do not apply the treatment near edible plants.
Spread the metaldehyde thinly, never in piles, which pets can mistake for food.
Metaldehyde works best on warm, dry days, but cannot be used in sunlight. Apply underneath leaves in the evening before a warm weather forecast.
Look for low-dose metaldehyde products with less environmental impact."

Divide clumps every few years.",How to Grow Astilbe," Astilbe are indigenous to North America and Europe, in the northern areas where weather is cool and wet. They grow best in these areas, although they can grow a bit nearer to the equator as long as they’re given plenty of shade and water. If you live in an area that has high temperatures year round or lacks frequent rain, you likely won’t be able to grow astilbe. Speak to an expert at a local nursery to get detailed information on your specific area’s growing conditions.

If you are in the US, Astilbes grow best in USDA hardiness zones 3-9.;
, Astilbe comes in three forms for planting: from seed, from bulbs, and from divisions (like cuttings). Although all three are viable options, gardeners tend to prefer using divisions for planting than the other two options. Astilbe seeds are difficult to grow and likely to rot before sprouting, and bulbs take much longer and don’t provide as much color as divisions. Astilbe grow in clumps that have separate root systems called ‘divisions’. These can (and should) be pulled apart and replanted to form new large plants.You can purchase divisions or full plants from a local gardening centre, or you can divide a pre-existing astilbe plant.

, Plant the Astilbe in spring or fall. Most Astilbe plants are planted directly in the garden during the mid spring, after the threat of severe frost has passed. The flower usually blooms in June to early July. Astilbe can also be planted in the early to mid fall, after the intense summer heat, and will usually bloom the following year.

, Astilbe plants thrive in partial to full shade; dry, hot soil in full sun is the worst possible condition for an Astilbe plant. Therefore, look for a spot in your garden that gets shade for at least part of the day, but don’t be afraid of an area that is in deep shade (such as under a tree canopy). Make sure the location has good drainage, for although astilbe like plenty of water, they don’t like soaking in puddles.


Consider conducting a drainage test. If your soil has poor drainage, you can amend it with peat moss or finished garden compost.

, These flowering plants prefer loamy, earthy soil that is loose but has the ability to retain moisture. Mix humus or peat moss into the plant bed by digging in several generous handfuls using a garden fork or trowel. If your selected plot has poor drainage, mix in sand and perlite to help encourage the drain-off of excess water. , Select an Astilbe that is several years old, since Astilbe plants develop large, clumpy roots after a few years. Astilbe come in multiple attractive colours including white, red, pink, peach, and purple. Extract the plant from the ground or container it sits in., Cut a large section of roots from the plant using clean gardening shears. Select a section with a “crown” or heart. The crown should appear somewhat dried out, but even a crown that is slightly immature should still survive.

, Sit the crown in a bucket of lukewarm water for several hours or overnight. Soaking the roots encourages them to thrive on their own., The hole should be wide enough to prevent accidental damage to the roots as you plant them. By having a wide hole, you also ensure that the soil directly surrounding the roots is not as compacted, making it easier for the roots to spread. In addition to being twice as wide as the clump of roots, the hole should also be about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) deep., The roots should be below ground level, and the crown should be around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below ground level, as well.

, Refill the hole with the soil you initially removed from the plot. The soil should be of the same loamy consistency as the surrounding soil. Make sure that the roots are completely covered and firmly pack the soil down in place to remove any gaps of air.

, If planting multiple Astilbe divisions at once, the holes should be spaced far enough apart to allow the roots room to spread.

, Immediately after planting the root clumps in the ground, you should thoroughly drench the soil with a garden hose or watering can. New plants absorb a great deal of water before they sprout and produce flowers, and if the roots are allowed to dry out during this time, the growing process may be disrupted.

, In rainy climates, additional watering may not be required. For climates that occasionally go without rain for several days to several weeks, additional watering is almost certainly needed. Check the condition of the soil on a regular basis. Once the surface feels dry, you should give the soil a thorough drenching. Never let the roots stay too dry for too long, even after the plant is established.


Rather than giving small watering every day, give a heavy watering every few days.

, Feed the plant with a slow-release fertilizer at the start of spring, and give them an additional dose six to eight weeks later. You can either use an all-purpose fertilizer that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or you can opt for a fertilizer that contains higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Phosphorus helps with root and flower development, while nitrogen aids in the establishment of full, vibrant foliage.


Note that you should only apply fertilizer when the soil is wet. Water the soil upon application so that the fertilizer washes down below the surface. Fertilizer should also be applied during the early morning or evening, when the temperatures have cooled. Following both of these measures will prevent the fertilizer from burning your plant.

, Use bark chips or any other type of mulch that retains moisture well. Scattering a solid layer of mulch around the plant base helps the soil stay moist and also acts as a type of weed control. Additionally, decomposing mulch can add more nutrients to the surrounding soil., The plants spread quickly, and as they spread, large clumps of root form. The crowns of these clumps tend to rise above the soil. You should cover the crowns with loamy soil to keep the roots from drying out.

, The most common insects and diseases to attack the Astilbe plant include the tarnished plant bug, powdery mildew, and bacterial leaf spots. Even so, the plant is not especially prone to pests. If any of these problems do emerge, you can apply an appropriate insecticide or fungicide then. Preventative pesticides are not recommended, however.

, Every spring, you should take divisions of the Astilbe plant's roots to prevent the roots from choking each other out. You can replant these divisions to create new plants, give them to gardening friends, or discard them.You can use your divided plants to form a solid bed of color, or line a shaded garden pathway with your beautiful flowers.

Understand how the spray works.,
Take one quart (950ml) of water and put it in a pot.

,
Take one-half cup of dried hot peppers (available at most Asian groceries), and put them in the pot.

,
Bring the pot of water and peppers to just barely boiling.,
Strain out the peppers and throw them away.

,
Put the liquid into a spray bottle.,
Spray it on the plants you want to protect.,
Re-spray every week for maximum benefit.",How to Get Rid of Animal Pests With Hot Pepper Spray," Hot peppers have a compound in them called capsaicin. Mammals are sensitive to capsaicin, and the compound registers on their taste buds as ""hot"" and serves as an irritant. This spray is considered to be effective for such garden animal pests as deer, rabbits, voles, squirrels, possums and insects.;
,,, Then turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature.

,, Label it so that anyone coming across it knows what the contents are; it's also a good idea to add the date to it.


For added sticking power, you might like to add a few drops of pure dish soap to the liquid as well.

, Always wear gloves and eye protection before using this spray––it can burn your skin and eyes if it touches them and it's painful. Be sure to spray the entire plant, for full protection.


Shake before using.
Use the spray early morning or in the evening––if sprayed in the heat of the day, it may burn the plants.If you're not sure how sensitive plants will cope, test a small area first. Wait four days and if the plant doesn't react, then using the spray on it should be okay.Do not spray this on windy days. The back spray may hit you or go anywhere but on the plants you're trying to protect.
As mentioned earlier, do not spray anywhere near waterways, lakes or ponds.

, It will also need to be reapplied after rain.

Use glyphosate or similar products.,
Apply several times.,
Combine chemical herbicides with organic weed-control methods.,
Turn the soil.,
Pull or dig out the weeds.,
Apply vinegar.,
Use urine.While the concept of pouring urine onto a lawn or other area of vegetation may make you cringe, it can be just as effective as vinegar when used as an herbicide.,
Smother the area with mulch.If the foxtail is still fairly young, kill the new growth as soon as possible by covering it with some form of mulch.,
Try a pre-emergence herbicide.,
Monitor the pH of the soil.,
Fill the area with other growth.,
Keep the area trimmed.",How to Get Rid of Foxtails," Broadleaf fertilizers will not work against foxtail since foxtail is a grass. If you want to use chemical control methods, you should look for an herbicide that can kill grasses. One of the most easily accessible types is a chemical called glyphosate.


Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, so it will kill just about everything in the area you apply it in. For best results, spray the entire area with the glyphosate. Even though the other vegetation there will likely die, this is the quickest and most effective way of getting rid of fox tail.;
, You will probably need to apply the herbicide two to three times, at minimum, before it wipes out the foxtail completely. Wait until after the foxtail reemerges before using another application.


You should wait until two weeks or so pass before re-applying the herbicide, especially if using a potent one like glyphosate.

, While chemical herbicides can take care of the majority of the problem, enlisting the help of certain organic control methods can help in between applications, making the extermination process go quicker overall.


Seven to ten days after you apply the herbicide, turn under the dead plant residue. If you plan to amend the soil, do so now.

, Dig under the foxtail and turn the plants under the soil, packing them down into the dark, hot conditions. Doing so can impede growth and help kill off this pesky grass.


Work by moonlight, at dawn, or at dusk. There is some speculation that turning the soil exposes the foxtail to a bright flash of light, thereby stimulating the plant and making it grow faster. If you turn the soil at night instead of during daylight hours, though, you can reduce this effect by as much as 78 percent.

, Alternatively, you could dig out the weeds one by one and dispose of them elsewhere, away from the contaminated area. Make sure that you remove the entire plant, including the roots, and not just the top portion.


Remove the seed heads first to prevent them from spreading and repopulating the area with additional foxtail.
After removing the seed heads, dig beneath the plants using a long, slender weeding tool to get at the long roots.
Note that weeds are easier to pull when the soil is wet and the weeds are young. Foxtail is no exception to the rule.
Pull the foxtail from its base if working by hand. Wear thick gardening gloves to protect your hands as you work.
You could try using a mower or weed-wacker to cut off the tops and flowering heads of the foxtail. You will need to continually re-trim the foxtail throughout the season, though, since the plant will send up another flowering head as the summer progresses.
If you do opt for the mower or weed-wacker option, make sure that you clean the blades afterward to prevent the accidental spread of foxtail seed. You should also rake the lawn to remove all the heads. Taking these additional steps will improve your chances of removing the foxtail with only a surface mowing.

, If you like the ease and effectiveness of herbicides but do not like to use harsh chemicals on your vegetation, you can use vinegar instead. Vinegar is a natural and fairly tame acid, but it has been known to be effective in the removal of weed-type grasses like foxtail.


A typical USDA-approved vinegar is five-percent acetic acid.
Pour the vinegar directly onto the foxtail at the ground level. The basic idea is to get it as close to the roots as possible.
Use enough vinegar to soak the soil beneath the foxtail. It does not need to be soggy, but it should be damp to the touch.
Wait a week or two after the first application and monitor the effects. Dead or dying foxtail should be pulled as soon as possible. Foxtail that is still growing even after you use the vinegar should be soaked with another round.
Reapply the vinegar as needed.
Note that vinegar tends to be more effective when used on fox tail at the seedling state. It might not help quite as much on mature plants., Urine is a strong, organic alkaline substance, so it can kill foxtail in the same way that a chemical herbicide might.


You can purchase ""predator urine"" products at garden stores. These products are usually used as deterrents or repellents against small garden pests, but they can also be used for herbicidal purposes.
A cheaper and even more effective solution would be to use human urine. Collect the urine in a bucket and pour it straight onto the base of the foxtail, aiming for direct contact with the roots.
As with many other control methods, you might need to use multiple applications of urine or use this organic herbicide in conjunction with physical removal methods. Remove the clumps of foxtail by hand or with a garden hoe once you notice them dying off.

, Mulch can prevent sunlight and air from reaching the foxtail, essentially depriving it of the nutrients and light necessary for growth.


The foxtail will need to be trimmed close to the ground before you can apply mulch and use it as a way to get rid of the weed.
If you have other plants and vegetation that you are trying to preserve, spread the mulch in between the plants and along the rows. Make sure that it covers the foxtail.
Organic mulches like wheat straw, shredded leaves, and wood chips work well.
Spread about 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch.
You could also layer damp black-ink-only newsprint beneath the mulch to improve its ability to inhibit growth.

, If you are fine with chemical treatments, then a pre-emergent herbicide should be applied to the area just before new growth would be expected to form. This is especially important if you have had problems with foxtail already.


A few standard chemical options include dacthal, balan, and pendimethalin.For an organic pre-emergent herbicide, try corn gluten meal. Sprinkle the product after your new lawn begins to grow to prevent foxtail and other weeds from taking root. Do not use it before growing your new lawn, though, since it could also prevent the desired grass from growing.
Apply a pre-emergent herbicide treatment in the spring. If you apply it too early, though, they can lose their effectiveness. For best results, apply the herbicide once the weather warms up and stays warm. Lay it down just before you would expect the fox tail to pop up.

, The soil conditions need to be ideal for other plants. If other plants can thrive in the soil, they will grow and absorb more nutrients, making it harder for the foxtail to find enough nutrients to survive.


The exact pH your soil should be will vary depending on the type of vegetation you have there.
The fertilizer and other soil amendments you use on the area will affect the pH. Note that such amendments generally have a greater impact on the pH if they are worked into the soil instead of spread on top.
Herbicides can affect the pH, as well. As a general rule, if you add an acidic herbicide, balance it out with an alkaline substance afterward, and vice versa.
Have a sample of your soil analyzed for pH at a lab.

, When an area of land is crowded by too much vegetation, some of the vegetation will inevitably die off once the roots begin to compete for nutrients and resources.


You could also replace the grass entirely with sod.
When choosing vegetation to plant in the area, opt for a solid-stand crop like legumes or grass hay. Row crops, like soybeans and corn, offer too much space in the soil and are not effective at stopping foxtail growth.
If you plant other forms of grass in the area, keep the grass as plush, thick, and healthy as possible. Thick grass can also be helpful for use against foxtail growth.

, Regular mowing can keep the yard healthy, and a healthy yard is less likely to foster the growth of weeds like foxtail.


While keeping the area trimmed is important, you should not keep it bare, either. Maintain a minimum grass height between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm).

There are some species of frogs that are considered invasive and are legal to kill. These include the following:


Bullfrogs outside of their native environment in eastern North America. They compete with native frogs, eat native frogs, and spread chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that has led to the extinction of 100 frog species. Cane toads outside of their native environment in Central and South America. While not a frog, many people reading this article will be dealing with these amphibians. They are especially rampant in Australia.






Cuban tree frogs outside of their native habitat in Cuba. These are a big nuisance in Florida, where they even cause power outages.Coqui frogs outside of their native environment in Puerto Rico.





;
, In many parts of the world, it's illegal to kill non-invasive species, but people are encouraged to manage invasive species. Some species are so invasive that it's illegal to release them back into the wild once you've caught them.


If you're not sure whether a frog is native or not, take its picture and submit it to the local Fish and Wildlife authorities for identification.
Before you take matters into your own hands, you might want to talk to local Fish and Wildlife authorities to discuss the best way to get rid of them in your area.

, If you find out that the frogs in your area are native species, you'd do best to leave them alone. Frogs that are native to a certain ecosystem should not be killed, even if they're poisonous. Frogs are vital members of their ecosystems, and in fact their presence is an indication that an ecosystem is healthy. They keep insect populations down and contribute to wetlands in other ways.

If you dislike the presence of native frogs, there are still ways to discourage them from coming onto your property. You can keep foliage cut back, for example, so they won't have an enticing place to live.
You can also discourage them from coming into the house by keeping it well sealed and screening your windows and doors.

, Frogs are attracted to moisture, so removing sources of water from your yard will cause most frogs to lose interest and find another place to lay their eggs and shelter at night. You can rent a pump to get rid of most water sources.


Birdbaths, swampy areas, bowls of water, and artificial ponds are just a few examples of water sources that attract frogs.






Removing sources of stagnant water will also drive away mosquitoes and other insects that frogs feed on, making the area even less appealing.
If the water source in your yard is something you want to keep, like a natural pond, try adding a filter or running fountain to your pond. This will cause the water to circulate, thereby eliminating most mosquitoes and other insects. The frogs will still be attracted to the water, but with a decrease in food supply, many may still end up moving on.

, Tall grass, shrubs, or other bushy plants make the perfect hiding place for frogs. Clearing these elements away forces the frogs to be exposed, which is a condition they generally try to avoid. Having tall plants around a water source is especially troublesome. If you want to maintain tall or bushy plants somewhere in your yard, position them as far away from any water source as possible.

, Like tall grass, clutter in your yard serves as an excellent hiding place for frogs. Removing it will chase many frogs away. Remove empty pots, old lumber, piles of wood chips, or any other structure that may create a damp, dark place for frogs to hide.

, Turning off your outdoor lights at night will reduce both insect and frog populations.


Shut off garden lights and porch lights.
Close the drapes and curtains in your house to reduce the amount of light filtering out from inside.

, While somewhat uncommon, frogs do occasionally steal dog food or cat food. Feed your pets inside or keep the dish inside when the dog or cat is not eating.

, Since flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are the primary food source for frogs, killing the bugs will deter frogs from coming to your yard. Here are a few ways to control them;


Use a bug zapper. Place the bug zapper on your porch to attract and kill all manner of flying insects.






Spray organic insecticides. Many chemical insecticides will also kill the frogs, but most organic insecticides do not have that effect.

, Surround your property or pond with mesh netting or plastic fencing. Do not use chicken wire or chain-link fencing, since frogs can easily slip through these types of fences.


Make sure that the fencing starts at ground level and stands tall. Frogs can leap a considerable height, so a standard-size fence will work better than a purposefully low one.
Take precautions to keep the fence stable. Bury the support posts 1 foot (30.5 cm) underground, at minimum, and bury a portion of the fencing material beneath the ground, too.







, Snakes and cats both love to eat some types of frogs, so if you introduce some to your property, you'll be able to keep the population down, and your yard will be a lot less attractive to frogs. Before you do this, conduct some research to make sure the type of frog you're dealing with will make a tasty meal for a cat or snake.

Remember that many types of frogs are poisonous. Don't try to introduce a predator that would be sensitive to the frogs' poison.
Research the predators of the specific frog you're dealing with. Cats and snakes are easiest to introduce, but you might also want to make your yard more hospitable to other predator animals, such as hawks or other birds.

, There are a few natural substances that effectively kill frogs or repel them from the area. Try using one of these substances before resorting to a chemical spray, since chemical sprays tend to kill the frogs slowly. Organic sprays tend to do the job more quickly and are more humane.

Spray the frogs with citric acid. Mix 1.3 lb (600 g) dry citric acid with 1 gallon (4 liters) of water in a large spray bottle.Spray the solution directly on the frogs. It should kill them almost immediately.
Spread salt. If you do not have any plants near your pond, spread a little salt around the perimeter. Salt will burn the toes of the frogs, deterring them from the area. Note that salt will destroy plants, however.
Spritz the frogs with caffeine. Concentrated caffeine will kill frogs by causing them to have heart attacks, but you can spread coffee grounds around the areas where frogs gather to deter them without killing them off. It will cause the frogs discomfort, but will not likely kill them.

, While there are chemical pest control measures you can take to get rid of the frogs in your yard, these options often torment or kill the frogs slowly and should be avoided unless no other option has proven effective. When possible, use repelling measures rather than lethal ones.


Try snake repellent.Spraying snake repellent around the perimeter of your yard is often an effective repellent against frogs. In fact, snake repellent is usually about as effective at getting rid of frogs as it is at getting rid of snakes.






Use herbicide. Studies suggest that certain weed killers chemically alter male frogs, stripping away their ability to reproduce. As a result, spraying these herbicides in areas where frogs gather can greatly reduce future frog populations.

, Use a butterfly net or another type of long-handled, thinly-meshed net to capture the frogs one by one. If you have an abundance of frogs, you may need to enlist the help of others to accomplish this task. Once you catch the frogs, you have two choices:


Relocate the frogs. After catching the frogs, consider relocating them to a nearby pond or stream. When relocating frogs, however, it is important to introduce the frogs to an area that the breed or species can be naturally found in. Otherwise, you can upset the ecological balance of that habitat.
Freeze the frogs to death.If it is impossible to relocate the frogs, you can kill them humanely by freezing them. Place the frogs in a sealable container with air holes punched through the lid. Store this container in the refrigerator overnight. The frogs will ease into a coma-like state. The following day, move the container to the freezer and store the frogs there for 48 to 72 hours. Temperatures this cold should kill them.

, Use a standard aquarium fishnet to scoop up any tadpoles in your pond or other water source. Lay the tadpoles out in the sun for a day or so. The dry heat should kill them.


You can lay the captured tadpoles out on the cement or lawn, but the drier to surface, the quicker the extermination should be.
Alternatively, you could also bury the captured tadpoles underground. This, too, should kill them.

, If the frogs have found their way indoors, set up standard mouse traps to kill them. Place these traps around any opening that leads from the outside to the inside, such as garage doors, basement windows and vents.

, If you are uncertain about how to remove the frogs or are unsuccessful in your efforts, hire a professional.

Choose a clear, lidded container, either glass or plastic, in which to grow your dinoflagellates. It's important that the container be clear to let in a maximum amount of light.
Consider buying a plant grow lamp so you'll be able to control the algal light exposure. These can be purchased at plant supply or hardware stores. A regular 40-watt light bulb in a household lamp will also work.

, A closet might be a good option since you'll be able to control the light, but choosing a dark place isn't absolutely necessary. It's fine for algae to get natural sunlight during the day.


Make sure the place you choose always remains at a moderate temperature. Cold or hot temperatures could prevent the algae from growing.
The optimal temperature range for growing algae is between 68 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (22 - 25 degrees Celsius).

, Make sure both the container and lid are completely clean and free of debris. If another substance remains in the container when you add the algae, it may affect the algae's growth.


If you're using a heavy glass container that you know to be heatproof, place it in the oven for a few minutes after washing to sterilize it.
Don't use excess soap when washing the container, since that could also affect the algae's growth.

, Place the lid on the container to prevent the water from evaporating and causing the solution to get over saline, and to keep contaminants out.


It is possible to grow algae in the container it was shipped in, which is usually a plastic beaker. Simply pour a few inches of the culture out, and add a few inches of growth solution.
Before you mix the nutrient solution and algae culture, allow the two containers to sit at room temperature for an hour or two. Making sure that they are both the same temperature will prevent the culture from getting shocked by a temperature change.
Don't allow the solution and culture to sit in the sun, as the heat may cause a lethal rise in temperature.

, Dinoflagellates photosynthesize during the day, and to do so effectively they need twelve solid hours of light.This can be achieved by allowing the algae to get natural sunlight or controlling the light carefully with a lamp inside a closet or dark room.


If you use a lamp, it should be placed about three feet from the container. Do not place the light directly over the container; this will heat it up and kill the organisms inside.
If you want the algae to luminescent predictably, it is necessary to keep them on a strict light schedule. Turn on the light at the same time in the morning and turn it off at the same time at night (you can use a light timer to help you). The algae's circadian rhythm will synchronize with the light schedule.
It is possible to arrange a light schedule so that luminescence occurs during the day. This is useful if you are using it to teach children in a classroom. Set up the grow lamp to shine on the algae overnight, and keep it in a dark closet during the day.

, Dinoflagellates flash when water or another substances stimulates them by pressing against their cell walls.To watch them luminesce, pick up the container and gently swirl the water inside. If they received enough light during the day, they will begin to light up and flash.


Don't shake the container too hard, as it will wear out the dinoflagellates and cause them to stop flashing more quickly.
Don't shake the container too often, since this also causes dinoflagellates to become exhausted. They need a period of recovery after luminescing.

, Over time, if the conditions are right, you will see the algae multiply. You can separate it into more containers and mix it with additional grow solution. The luminescence won't be as bright at first, since it will take a few weeks for the algae population to restore itself.

, Dinoflagellates usually expire after this period. Buy another culture, and consider experimenting with a different dinoflagellate this time.

Remove the Aloe vera plant from its current pot.,
Tend the roots.,
Chose a pot that is one-third larger than the root system.,
Use potting soil suitable for cactus or succulents.,
Replant your Aloe vera.,
Do not water immediately after repotting.",How to Revive a Dying Aloe Vera Plant1," One of the typical reasons for Aloe vera plant death is root rot. In order to determine if this is the case, you need to first take the plant out of its pot.Loosely hold the base of the plant and the bottom of your pot. Tip the pot upside down, and continue holding the plant with your other hand. Hit the bottom of the pot with your hand or knock it against a table ledge (or other hard surface).Depending on the size of your plant, you may need another person to help you. One person should hold the plant base with both hands, while the other person tips the pot upside down and hits the bottom.. You might also find it helpful to jostle the pot back and forth until the plant comes loose.
If you still have difficulties removing your plant with two sets of hands, you can run a trowel or knife around the interior of the pot and try releasing it again, or push some of the soil out through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. If your plant still does not come out of the pot, you may need to break your pot, but this is a last resort.While releasing the Aloe Vera plant from its pot, be sure that you are keeping the plant itself as steady as possible. All the movement should be centered on the pot, not the plant itself. In other words, hold, don’t pull, the plant. Hitting the bottom of the pot will keep your roots intact, and gravity will push the plant downward.;
, Examine the roots and determine how many of the roots are still healthy. Mushy roots are characteristic of root rot and need to be removed.Any roots that aren’t black or mushy are good and can be kept.


If you see a lot of healthy roots and only a section of dead or mushy roots, you can likely save your plant without too much trouble, but you’ll need to cut away the damaged roots.You can use a sharp, sterilized knife to cut away the dead roots,but make sure to get them all.
If you notice that the majority of your plant has damaged roots, it will take a little more effort to save the plant, and it may be beyond saving. In this case, you can try to save the plant by removing the largest leaves (with a knife). Cut away about half of the plant. This method is risky. However, with fewer leaves to nourish, the small amount of undamaged roots can better direct nutrients throughout the plant., Any excess soil will hold water and could cause root rot in the future, so a smaller pot is better than a larger one.The roots of Aloe vera plants grow horizontally, rather than vertically. Aloe vera plants can also become quite heavy, and the weight of the plant can cause a narrow pot to tip over. Thus, select a wide pot, rather than a deep or narrow pot.The pot you choose should also have plenty of drainage holes on the bottom so that excess water does not sit in the soil.A plastic pot is best if you live in a dryer climate, while a pot made from terra cotta or clay is best for cooler or humid areas., This type of soil has a higher sand content and produces a well-draining environment for your plant. You can find this type of soil easily at your local garden center.You can also create your own soil mix for your Aloe vera plant by mixing equal parts of sand, gravel or pumice, and soil.Be sure to use a coarse sand (like builder’s sand), rather than a fine sand. Fine sand can clump and hold water, rather than allowing it to drain down and through the pot.Although you can use potting soil for Aloe vera plants, they will thrive better in a mixed soil.Potting soil is more likely to hold moisture and could therefore cause root rot.

, Prepare the pot by filling it with the potting soil mixture, and shake your Aloe vera plant gently to remove about a third of the soil that has attached itself to the root ball.Place your plant in the newly prepared pot and cover the top with more of the potting soil mixture. Be sure that the entire root ball is covered with the soil mixture , but don't bury the plant deeper than it was in the first pot.You can also layer small rocks or gravel on the top of the soil, which helps reduce the evaporation of water., Your Aloe vera plant needs a few days to readjust to its new pot and to repair any broken roots."
"
Check the soil.,
Modify watering according to the season.,
Examine the leaves.,
Water until the soil is just moist.",How to Revive a Dying Aloe Vera Plant2," You can tell if your Aloe vera plant needs to be watered by pressing your index finger a few inches down into the soil. If the soil is dry, your plant needs water. Aloe vera plants are succulents and do not need to be watered often. Overwatering can kill your plant!If you keep your plant outside, watering every two weeks should be sufficient.If you keep your plant inside, water it every three to four weeks., Aloe vera plants need more water in the warmer months, but less in the cooler months. Water less often in Fall and Winter, especially if your plant lives in a cool space., As a succulent, Aloe vera plants store water in their leaves. If you notice the leaves are dropping or are becoming almost transparent, your plant likely needs water.However, the same qualities can be a sign of root rot, caused by overwatering. Ask yourself when you watered your plant last. If you watered it recently, you should remove the plant from the pot and check for root rot., Water should never sit on top of the surface of the soil, so water with a light hand. Continue to check your plant weekly or bi-weekly by testing the soil to see if it needs to be watered.

"
"
Check the leaves.,
Reposition your plant.,
Water your plant.,
Remove dead leaves.",How to Revive a Dying Aloe Vera Plant3," If the leaves of your Aloe vera plant are turning brown or red, your plant may be sunburned., Move your plant to a place where it receives indirect, rather than direct, sunlight.If your plant is typically in a position to receive artificial light rather than sunlight, reposition the plant so that there is a greater distance between it and the light source. You can also try moving it outside so that it is getting some indirect natural light, rather than artificial light., Check the soil and determine if your plant needs to be watered. The soil is likely dry if your plant has been getting too much sunlight, since the water would be evaporating more quickly., With a sharp, sterilized knife, cut the leaf away from the plant at the base. Any leaves that are dead take nutrients from other parts of the plant, so be sure to remove them so that the rest of your plant doesn’t suffer."
"
Provide adequate light.,
Select the proper soil.,
Correctly set up your containers.,
Know when to water.,
Start feeding your plants after 10 or so days.,
Give an additional boost to your herbs.,
Use your herbs when they're ready.",How to Grow an Herb Garden Indoors Year Round," The goal is a vegetative light cycle (18 hours of light at least), with eight or more hours of direct sun or bright artificial light. If you need lots of an herb, you will need to take care of the herb's lighting needs. For example, basil and coriander (cilantro) need just a bit more light than other herbs, and really prefer 8 hours or more of direct light each day. In addition to this, if you want fresh pesto, just a pinch here and there is not going to cut it. Here's what you can do about it:


Whenever the light levels are low, give them a boost. Two or three fluorescent lights above your plants will greatly increase growth and yield. You can grow enough basil for a few servings of pesto now and then and still have enough always at your fingertips.
With a small metal halide light, you would have a larger area with better lighting. You could produce an abundance of any herbs you choose for your culinary and aromatic delights. Basil would take well to the bright conditions under a metal halide, as it is a Mediterranean, sun-loving herb.;
, Some herbs grow better in poor soil, as they can develop a stronger flavour. The oils in herbs make them special. Very fast growing herbs often grow plain leaves and stems more quickly than they can produce tasty essential oils. Often you will hear, ""Basil grows better in poor soil,"" or, ""Your basil will taste better if you don't fertilize"". What is really meant here is, ""Don't grow your basil too fast."" (Basil is an example to which this applies).

, When growing in a container it is a little different. The plant still needs some food to grow, and when that food runs out you will need to fertilize. However, as you will see next, this is all taken into consideration together with the growth habits of your herbs:


To keep initial growth rates in control, use a soil mix with just enough nutrients. Mix 2 parts coir (coconut fibre) compost to 1 part perlite, and then add 20 percent worm castings. Test the pH of any mix, and if it is acidic, add one gram of hydrated lime for every litre of soil mix. Or, you can substitute with vermiculite, which does not need pH adjusting. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of kelp meal for each gallon of soil to add plant hormones and to give beneficial micro-organisms something to feed on. Use this mix whenever you transplant.

, If the surface of the soil feels dry, you need to water. Another way to tell is to pick up the container and check how heavy it is. Your herbs like their soil to drain fast. You need to have containers with holes in the bottoms, and you need to add a layer of broken roof tiles (slate is ideal) or other small flat stones, or a centimetre or so of perlite or gravel to the bottom of each container as you transplant. It is best to water thoroughly but less often. Water the container until some water comes out of the bottom, but don't over-water.

, When the herbs have been in any container for ten days or more, you need to begin feeding them. In a container, the roots are stuck in a small space and will quickly mine it free of any nutrients, especially if you have been going easy on the nutrients to begin with. Feed with half-strength nutrient such as Maxsea 16-16-16 every two weeks.

, If you really want to keep your plants healthy, it is recommended to use 10 ml/gallon B1 plant mix and liquid seaweed in every drop of water you give to your plants. The B1 consists of vitamins and root hormones, and the seaweed is trace nutrients and plant growth hormones. This will help with essential oil production. Finally, water basil from around the base; it does not like water on its leaves.

, As soon as the herbs have grown enough leaves to be pinched without affecting their growth, you can begin using some of the herbs. This usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the herbs. Herbs like basil are best when harvested before flowers open. You will get your highest essential oil levels when you harvest at the end of the dark period, assuming you do not leave the lights on 24 hours a day.

Scatter some of your pet's droppings.,
Use smells that gophers don't like.,
Plant gopher spurge.,
Create a noisy environment.,
Use vibrating stakes.,
Set a gopher trap.,
Use a sewage-based fertilizer.",How to Get Rid of Gophers1," Instead of tossing your cat litter or your dog's poop into the trash, put it into the gopher tunnels instead. You won't need a lot; one or two droppings will be enough. Cats and dogs are gopher predators. When gophers smell the poop, they'll think that a predator is nearby., Gophers have very sensitive noses. If they smell something they don't like, they may leave. Here are some scents that are bound to set gophers scurrying:Fish. The next time you go fishing, save some of the scraps (such as fins) and place them in or next to the tunnels.
Castor oil. Dilute castor oil with some water and spray it into the tunnels, You can also try dropping some castor oil capsules into the tunnels instead.
Coffee grounds. After you have finished brewing a cup of coffee, sprinkle the grounds into the tunnels and cover them with soil. You can also mix the coffee grounds into your soil. It will help repel the gophers while fertilizing your plants.
Dryer sheets. Take a few dryer sheets and tuck them into the holes. The strong smell will send the gophers away.
Mothballs. Drop a couple of mothballs into the tunnel, and cover the opening with plastic. Gophers don't like the smell of naphthalene, which is in mothballs.
Tabasco sauce. Mix together a few drops of peppermint essential oil, 1 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce, ½ cup (120 milliliters) of castor oil, and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Soak some cotton balls in the mixture, then drop them into the tunnels.

, This plant, also known as ""Euphorbia Lathyris,"" is a common gopher repellent. Buy a few from your local nursery and plant them in your yard. Focus on the gopher infested areas.


Other plants that gophers seem to dislike include: castor beans, daffodils, and marigolds.Some people find that the oleander plant is also an effective gopher repellent. Consider planting oleander around the perimeter of your garden., Like many animals, gophers dislike a lot of noise. If you find gophers in your yard, try using something that makes noise, such as:Portable radio. Find a cheap, battery-operated radio. Turn it on and stick it into a plastic, resealable bag. Tuck the bag into the gopher tunnel. The plastic bag will protect the radio from getting wet.
Wind chimes. They are pretty and create a soft, chiming noise that gophers seem to dislike.

, Most vibrating stakes are set deep into the ground, and are completely invisible above ground. They are usually battery-operated. You can buy some that are wind operated. These ones stick above ground and are ornamented with a windmill. You can buy them online, and in certain nurseries or home improvement stores. To insert the vibrating stake:Dig a hole into the ground. Make sure that it is deep enough to fit the stake.
Slip the stake into the hole.
Fill the hole with more dirt.
Avoid hammering or pushing the stake directly into the soil, as this can damage it.

, Cover all holes with soil, except for one or two. These should be the entrance and exit to the main tunnel. Wash the trap using unscented soap and warm water. Put on a pair of latex gloves, and insert the traps into the tunnel, with the open end facing inside the tunnel.Once you have placed the trap, cover the area with a sheet of black plastic or burlap so that no light shines into the hole.


The main tunnel is usually 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.48 centimeters) underground. You can find it by poking the ground around a mound, on the same side as you see freshly-dug-up earth.Use a weeder or wooden spoon handle. Keep poking until you feel the soil ""give.""
Some people find that rubbing the trap with fresh rosemary helps further disguise the smell of humans.
Once you have trapped the gopher, either call up animal control or release it into the wilderness.

, Whenever the soil gets wet, the chemicals in the fertilizer will leach into the soil, and repel the gophers. Avoid using this if you have pets, children, or plan on protecting fruits, vegetables, or herbs. Put on a pair of latex gloves, then follow the steps below:


Dig a trench about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide and 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) deep around the area you want to protect.
Consider digging a few extra trenches and have them meet in the center of the area you are protecting.
Fill the trench(s) with the fertilizer.
Cover the trench with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of soil.

Determine growing conditions.,
Choose an adequate pot for your plant.,
Pot your Wandering Jew plant.,
Give your plant enough sunlight.,
Water your plant often.,
Fertilize regularly.,
Prune your plant.,
Remove diseased, rotted, and dead leaves.,
Treat aphids.,
Refresh brown leaves.,
Restore faded leaves.,
Remove root rot.",How to Take Care of a Wandering Jew Plant," Wandering Jew plants are native to South America and prefer lots of sunlight and warm temperatures, around 55–75 °F (13–24 °C). This shouldn't be a problem if you're going to keep the plant inside; however, you'll need to make sure conditions are suitable if you plan on growing the plant outside. Refer to Part 2 about getting enough sunlight.


The U.S. Department of Agriculture has made a map of the U.S. divided into zones based on average minimum temperature. Plants are assigned a zone or several zones in which they thrive.For example, the Wandering Jew plant grows best in zones 9-11. According to the U.S.D.A. map, much of the South and a narrow strip of the West Coast make up these zones. Refer to this map to see if your area's temperatures are warm enough to support a Wandering Jew plant, if you're planning on keeping it outside.
If you do not live in USDA hardiness zones 9-11, keep in mind that you may not be able to keep your plant outside during the winter. You may want to grow it inside instead.;
, You can use a regular gardening pot with a saucer or a hanging basket. Regardless of what you choose, make sure there are holes for water drainage.


If you use a hanging basket, remember to turn it daily so it gets equal amounts of sunlight.
Be sure to choose a pot that's not too heavy, especially if you plan on hanging it. You might want to pick a plastic pot instead of a ceramic one for this reason. A lighter pot will also make it easier to move inside in case of frost.

, Fill the pot about two-thirds full of your potting soil, then place the plant in the center of the pot. Add soil to surround and fill in the sides. Gently press down on the soil around your plant and water it till the soil is completely moistened.


You can purchase a Wandering Jew plant at many gardening or home improvement centers. Cuttings are also a good way to start your own plant. You'll need to get a hold of a few cuttings from an already established Wandering Jew plant. You'll need to learn how to Grow Cuttings from Established Plants.

, If you can, give them a combination of direct and filtered sunlight.


An eastern facing windowsill is a good spot for Wandering Jew plants. They'll receive bright indirect light throughout the day, but watch to make sure the space doesn't become too hot in the afternoon. If so, move the pot a few feet away or use a curtain to filter the light.If the plant primarily remains outside, find a spot that receives indirect sunlight. This could be on a porch that gets morning sun for several hours. Just make sure that it's not sitting in direct sunlight without any shade for most of the day.

, Wandering Jews like the soil to be moist, but they don't want to drown! Every day, stick your finger inside the soil. If it feels dry, add enough water to completely moisten the soil. Excess water should run out of the bottom of your pot.


If you've set your pot on a saucer, be sure to empty the saucer when it fills.
Make sure not to water straight into the crown of the plant or it may rot.You can water the plant less during the winter months, when its growth slows.Simply let it remain a little dry for a bit longer before watering.
Some people find it convenient to put self-watering Aqua Globes in their plant pots; however, these glass globes require cleaning and regular filling. You'll still need to monitor your plant's moisture if you choose to use them.

, Every two weeks, give your plant some liquid 10-10-10 fertilizer that has been diluted with an equal part of water.Liquid 10-10-10 fertilizer is considered to be an all-purpose fertilizer made up of ten percent nitrogen, ten percent phosphorous, and ten percent potassium.Read the container's instructions carefully, as some liquid fertilizers may actually be powders requiring you to mix in water.
Fertilizing is only necessary during the heaviest growing season, from spring to early fall.

, To keep your plant from becoming leggy, pinch back or cut the stems above the leaf node. Don't be afraid of cutting too much! You can prune back about a quarter of the plant. This will encourage the plant to fill in rather than continue to grow out through tendrils.The best time to prune is during the spring and summer months, when the plant is putting on the most growth. After you've pruned, give the plant a chance to put on new shoots and fill in.
If you find your plant is too dense and bushy, you'll need to prune around the base so that the plant can get adequate circulation and sunlight.

, Eventually the plant will stop growing leaves at the base, but will keep growing tendrils, at which point you might want to revive and repot the plant.To do so, you can plant cuttings, root some of the shoots in water, or simply set cuttings on top of the soil., New growth on Wandering Jew plants often attracts tiny green insects called aphids. They're usually found near stems. One effective treatment is pinching off or pruning the affected stems and heavily misting the remaining plant with water.You can also use a hose or high-powered stream of water to blast them off of the leaves.

, Mist your plant often. When the humidity is low, your plant's leaves will turn brown, but periodic water misting will help the leaves stay vibrant. Keeping the leaves wet will also help with any aphid problems your plant may develop. Fill a spray bottle with water and just mist until the leaves are lightly moistened.


Brown leaves can also be a sign that your plant is getting too much sunlight. In this case, make sure your plant is not directly in the sun by moving the pot or placing a filter, such as a curtain, in between the plant and the window.
Try to use distilled or bottled water when misting the leaves for the best results.

, Leaves that lack their notable vibrancy and color are probably not getting enough sunlight.Gradually increase the amount of sun your plant receives so that you don't shock the plant. This might involve moving the pot closer to a window that receives more light or finding a sunnier spot in the yard for your plant.

, If the plant is fading in color, but the leaves are turning a faded yellow, the plant may be getting too much water and the roots are rotting.If this is happening, the plant is probably not putting on much new growth, if any. You'll need to cut out the portion of the plant that is rotting, make a cutting from a healthy part of the plant, and replant it.

Use gopher burrow blasters or detonators to smoke them out.,
Gas them using your car's exhaust.,
Use poisons with care, especially if you have pets.,
Try using a garden hose to flood the gopher tunnel with water.,
Try leaving some fruit-flavored gum or other soft, chewy candy in their tunnels.,
Release a predator.,
Hire a professional.",How to Get Rid of Gophers2," They may also be labeled as gopher flares. They fill the tunnels with a mixture of propane and oxygen. This kills the gophers. Buy a few, and read the instructions included, as each brand might be a little different. Insert the flare into the tunnel and wait.


Burrow blasters/detonators will also work on: badgers, ground hogs, ground squirrels, moles, pocket gophers, prairie dogs, voles, and other burrowing animals., Cover all of the holes up with soil except for one. Stick one end of a garden hose into the end of your car's exhaust pipe, and the other end of the hose into the remaining tunnel. Turn your car on for about 15 to 30 minutes. The hose will flood the tunnel with poisonous carbon monoxide., When a gopher eats the poison, its body will keep that poison. This means that if your cat or dog eats the dead gopher, he or she will get poisoned as well. Because of this, you might want to stay away from poisons containing strychnine. Instead, go for anticoagulants instead. They will cause internal bleeding in the gopher, but won't make the corpse toxic.Keep all poisons away from children and other animals.
Consider other methods if you have pets at home.
Always wash your hands after handling the poison.
To use a Warfarin type bait / pellet poison, you poke down about 1 foot (0.3 m) from a recent dirt mound to find a tunnel. Gently open a small hole, pour some pellets in, cover the hole without collapsing the tunnel.

, This may not work for your situation, but if you've tried other avenues without success, consider it. Keep in mind that, depending on how deep the tunnels are, your yard could get very muddy. Cover up most of the gopher holes, and stick the end of a garden hose into a tunnel. Let the water run for up to 30 minutes. Kill or trap any escaping gophers.


Make sure that you are indeed dealing with gophers. Ground moles love the damp. If you have ground moles and flood you are flooding the tunnel, you'll only make your yard more inviting., Many homeowners find that the Juicy Fruit brand works quite well, although there is no scientific research as to why. Put on a pair of latex gloves first, so that your scent doesn't get on the gum. Unwrap the gum and drop it into the gopher hole. The gopher will eat it and die in its burrow.

, This can be as simple as letting your cat or dog out into the yard. Keep in mind, however, that this also depends on the predator's hunting ability and willingness to hunt.


Not all cats and dogs will get gophers, and their smell alone won't always help. You need a dedicated and skilled cat or dog. If you have a cat who can catch and kill gophers, you are in luck. As for dogs, some dogs you'd never think were ratters can be very good. But if you want to be sure you're adopting a dog who'll hunt gophers, try to get two Jack Russell Terriers (both should be altered to prevent puppies). Two terriers will tag team a gopher. They'll wait on opposite sides of a hole, and when the gopher emerges one or the other will get it. If you have a friend with JRT's and your yard is fenced and dog-escape-proof, you can ask to borrow them, too.
Set up some owl boxes in trees to invite owls into your yard.The owls will prey upon the gophers. You might not want to do this, however, if you have small dogs or cats.
Buy some non-venomous snakes and set them loose in your yard. Keep in mind that it may take up to a month for the snake to clear our your yard. If you have a very big gopher problem, consider getting two snakes.Get a gopher snake with caution. While a gopher snakes are not considered to be venomous, they may still hurt a cat or smaller dog.

, A professional exterminator can use Aluminum Phosphide, which reacts with moisture in the air and soil to produce fast-acting highly toxic phosphine gas. There is no residual poison, and there is no secondary poisoning. If your pet digs up and eats the gopher carcass, there is not a chance that your pet will get poisoned. This is the most expensive option, but many exterminating companies offer guarantees.

Decrease the food supply or prevent the gophers from getting to it.,
Use gopher baskets to protect your plants.,
Use mulch as a buffer between the soil gophers burrow in and your plants.Gophers seem to dislike the smell and taste of mulch.

,
Limit the amount of plants in your garden.,
Build a fence, but make sure that part of it extends underground.,
Build some raised plant beds instead.This will involve building some planters and filling them with soil.",How to Get Rid of Gophers3," The less gophers have to eat in your garden, the sooner they will move on to other yards. This does not necessarily mean that you have to get rid of all your plants, vegetables, and flowers. If you can keep the gophers from getting to your tasty plants, they will move on. Here are some ideas to get you started:, Plant vegetable and other vulnerable plants in gopher baskets. These are baskets made of chicken wire that protect the young roots until they are well established.,, Instead, consider planting a rock garden or a water garden.Water gardens can be very beautiful, and you can place aquatic plants in them.

, While gophers are good at burrowing, they are bad at climbing. Buy some wire mesh from your local nursery or home improvement store. Place it around your garden. Make sure that it extends at least 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) underground. This will prevent the gophers from burrowing under it.Make sure that the fence is a few inches tall above the ground.
Try to make the underground part of the fence curve away from your plant bed in an ""L"" shape. This will confuse the gophers, and prevent them from digging deeper (below the bottom of your fence., You can then place everything into those planters. For ultimate security, consider lining the bottom of your planters with chicken wire to prevent the gophers from digging under the planter walls and into the planter itself."

It should also be away from drafts, heat vents, fireplaces or other sources of hot air.Move an indoors plant outdoors in summer to a shady location. It is best to keep in a normal house temperature range, about 65 to 75°F (18 to 20°C). That being said, cooler night temperatures can be used to initiate blooming. We'll discuss getting it to bloom in the final section.
If it's in a north or east-facing window, you won't have to worry about light. But if it's in a south or west-facing window, diffuse the light with semi-transparent curtains or some other light-diffusing device.;
, Put a tray of water next to the plant so that the water evaporates and provides humidity. Alternatively, you can make a humidity tray by placing the pot on a waterproof saucer that is filled with gravel and halfway filled with water.


50 to 60% humidity is the ultimate goal.If your environment is close to that, you should be fine.

, For the container, some of the cheap nursery planters will work well, and orchid planters (the plastic basket kind) work well also. Pair this planter with a planter that will hold water and allow the basket to fit down into it. Then, place a few medium sized rocks into the bottom so that the basket container will be held about an inch above the bottom. Use a combination of 3 parts potting soil to one part sand for the potting medium. An alternative is one part potting soil, two parts peat moss or compost, and one part sharp sand or perlite.Whichever way you go, pour about two inches of room temperature water into the outer container and set the basket container inside. After about twelve hours, pour out any remaining water. Repeat this as often as the plant needs water; it will vary based on your home's condition. Monitor its need with a moisture prod and adjust accordingly.

, Plants that are actively growing should be given a blooming houseplant-type fertilizer. This is best done for a plant that is 2-3 weeks old. Follow the label directions for how much and how often to feed.


Fertilizing is important to keep the plant in good condition; the joints are fragile and can break apart if the plant descends into poor health. Generally, it should be fertilized 2-4 times a year with a 20-20-20 feed, but stop feeding about a month before the buds appear (this usually means stopping by the end of October).

, Caring for this plant can be a bit tricky as you need to take care not to overwater or underwater it:


A Christmas cactus is a tropical cactus, not a desert cactus. Unlike most desert cacti, this variety cannot tolerate completely dry soil. If the soil gets too dry, the flowers buds will drop, and the plant will wilt. Feel the soil with your fingers; if it feels dry, it's time to water.
Too much watering will cause spots from white rot to appear on the leaves, and the leaves will likely fall off. The soil should be evenly moist for best growth. The rule of thumb is less water is better than too much water.

When watering, thoroughly water the plant. Before attempting to water the plant again, check to see that the top inch of soil has dried thoroughly first. Mist leaves as well as watering the soil.

, Water the cactus based on your environment and the time of year. A good method is to water a cactus as follows:Dry climate, outdoors: Water every two to three days when warm and sunny

Humid, cool or indoors: Water every week
During the fall and winter months, the plants should be watered less frequently in order to promote blooming.

, When October hits, your watering duties are over. You can carefully resume a light watering in November. If it's dry where you live, feel free to place the pot over a tray of moist pebbles. This is all to set up the bloom happening around Christmas.


The only other time you should cease watering is after the plant blooms. At this time, cease watering for about 6 weeks to allow the plant to rest. New growth will still appear – and that is when watering should be resumed.

, One of the most frustrating things that can happen to Christmas cactus is after the flower buds have developed they drop off the plant. Bud drop can be caused by several different conditions. Usually it's because of over-watering, but it can also be due to a lack of humidity or insufficient light.


If this starts happening, water the plant less and add some fertilizer to the pot. Move it to an area away from a hot radiator or vent and try a new spot where it can get a bit more sunlight.

, The key to getting Christmas cactus to flower during the holiday season is proper light exposure, correct temperatures and limited watering. If you manipulate these things yourself, you can time a bloom just how you'd like.


Because this plant is thermo-photoperiodic, it will set buds when day length is about equal to night length and when the temperature drops to 50 to 60 degrees F for several weeks. If the temperature drops further, the plant will not bloom.
From September and October, the Christmas Cactus should be kept in a cool room where temperatures will remain around 50-55°F (10-12°C), give or take a few degrees. Don't expose the plant to freezing temperatures. Plants should be blooming for the holidays if cool treatments are started by early November.

, During the fall months, the Christmas Cactus should be placed in a spot where it receives indirect, bright light during the daylight hours but total darkness at night – it requires long, uninterrupted dark periods of about 12 hours or more.Begin the dark treatments in about mid-October to have plants in full bloom by the holidays. Place the plants in a dark area from about 12 or more hours each night for 6-8 weeks or until you see buds forming. A closet or unused bathroom are ideal places.
Be especially careful with watering at this time. Reduce the watering slightly. Do not soak the soil after a dry period; only moisten the top few inches, since buds, flowers and even leaves can fall off if the roots are suddenly saturated.

, The ""dark ages"" are over when your plant starts budding. At this point, you should increase, humidity, light, water (not too much, of course), and the temperature. In other words, continue as you were a few months ago.


If the buds form too early, you can lower the temperature to stunt them. When you're ready, up the temperature and they should resume their progress., This will encourage the plant to branch out, especially after a period of ""rest"" has been granted. It will not look very pretty after the blossoms have faded. Some people wait until March or so, when new growth begins, to prune the cactus.


As mentioned before, cease watering for 30 days post-bloom. When you see new growth forming, you can begin watering again.

, Each section must consist of two or three joined segments. Allow each section to dry for a few hours before pushing them into a 3-inch pot that contains the same potting soil as the parent plant. Plant halfway down the first segment and water sparingly to prevent rot from developing.Treat the cuttings as mature plants. In about four to six weeks, the cuttings should have rooted and will begin to show some new growth. They grow quickly, and should take in about two or three weeks. You can fertilize after the cutting has grown one new segment.

, Your plant should be fine for a couple of years unless the root system gets diseased or harmed. Apart from this, a new pot is needed when the roots have filled it or when the soil has been officially depleted of nutrients. Most people do this in the spring.


When replanting or repotting, use new, fresh soil. It's worth the few extra dollars since it will probably be sitting in that soil for a long time. Your plant is a living thing like you, so it deserves the best.
The best time for repotting is between February and April, about once every three years.Just be sure not to give it a pot that's too big; the Christmas Cactus flowers best when it's pot-bound.

Decide what kind of rock garden you want to plant.,
Clear the site where you plan to put your rock garden.,
Plan the area’s drainage route.,
Lay weed-resistant fabric on the ground to prevent weed growth.,
Consider laying down newspaper to prevent weeds.",How to Build a Rock Garden with Weed Prevention1," Think about the specifics of your yard. Do you want your rock garden to be a small or large one, in sun or in shade? Most rock garden plants (such as Alpines) favor sun but you can adjust your planting scheme if you have a shady site. You may want to try sketching or drawing what you want your garden to look like. Rock gardens are fairly permanent structures, so avoid placing them in spots where there are manhole covers or underground pipes that may need to be accessed.





;
, Clear your site of plants, grass and anything else that might be there, like furniture or tree roots. It might help you to plan the area if you define the edges of your rock garden by digging a ‘map’ with your spade.

, You’ll need to have a think about drainage and how to improve it, if your soil does not drain well. A good way to increase soil drainage is to:


Remove a few inches of the topsoil. Mix in about six inches of gravel, rubble, broken bricks, pea shingle or coarse sand down. These materials will help your soil drain water more efficiently.

, If weeds are persistent in the area where you plan to have your rock garden, you can lay some horticultural weed-resistant fabric on the site.The fabric will allow water to penetrate but won’t allow weeds to grow through the fabric.

, If you don't want to use weed-resistant fabric, lay down several layers of old newspaper above the top layer of soil. The newspaper will eventually break down but will continue to keep the weeds at bay.


If you are worried about appearance, don’t worry—you will be laying a layer of topsoil and rocks down on top of the newspaper.

Estimate how much care you'll be able to devote to the plant.,
Determine the purpose of your plants.,
Set your plant budget.,
Research plants.,
Purchase your plant.,
Set up the plant.",How to Choose a Good Office Plant," Obviously, a plant that needs full sun doesn't have much of a chance in a windowless copy room, but figure out where you can put plants in your office and determine how much natural sunlight they'll get on average. However, when in doubt, low light (shade-loving) plants will do fine in most office settings (such as the top of a cubicle in the center of the floor or away from the windows). Some plants will do well if placed near the fluorescent lights in the office. If you have access to south-facing windows that offer a lot of sunlight, you'll have more flexibility in choosing plants.;
, Get an idea both of the floor or counter space and the vertical space available.

, Some plants require more maintenance than others, and sometimes it can be difficult to find time in the workday to water or prune them. Be honest with yourself in appraising how much attention you and your coworkers can give to the plant(s).

, Different plants can do different things for you. If you mainly want to brighten a space, you'll probably want a flowering plant or one with colorful, variegated leaves. If you're looking to remove as much carbon dioxide--or add as much oxygen--as possible, you should look for a green plant with a lot of leaf area. Certain plants, such as the Areca palm, Kentia palm or Dracaena 'Janet Craig' are exceptionally effective at removing airborne chemicals commonly found in offices.
, While some plants can be very expensive individually, the more plants you plan to own, the more important your budget will be. Figure out how much you want to spend purchasing the plants. Also figure out how much effort you can put into their long-term maintenance.

, Once you have your specifications, you can take them to your local garden store and ask a professional to suggest some plants that might work. You can also research plants on the internet to determine which will match your needs. Here's a short list of some commonly successful office plants to consider:


Ivy
Philodendron
Peace lilies
Spider plants
Aloe vera
Aroid palm
Wave petunias
Dragon trees
Crotons

, You can buy from your local garden store or farmers' market, or you can do your shopping online. Whichever you choose, make sure you get healthy-looking plants that are free of mold, rot and pests. This is easier to do if you can see the plants, of course, but many online stores will offer you a guarantee to offset the risk. If you have the budget you can try a company who sells plants, grown specifically for offices.

, Place a catch tray beneath the plant to collect excess water, and make sure that the base of the plant is stable. Additionally, if the plant will require frequent watering, put it somewhere that won't require you to use a ladder or chair to reach it.

Find out your local climate.,
Find out your soil type and build your soil up to suit.,
Plan your garden layout, as well as functionality and practicality.,
For hot, dry climates, ensure there is some established shade cover first.,
Once the shade cover is established, consider some understory species.,
In a windy climate, either hot and dry or temperate, install hedges, or other walls and screens to reduce the impact of strong wind.,
Engage strategies for a colder climate.,
Look at incorporating living sculpture in your garden, or using sculptural plants to make an impact.,
Invest in brightly coloured banners and flags, sculptures (such as Buddha images, Polynesian, Balinese or other types of statuary) and water features.,
Regular maintenance after the installation would be to ensure mulch levels are kept up and refreshed with new mulch (which can be done annually), as well as removing old palm fronds, flower heads and occasional pruning to ensure the new growth is prominent.",How to Make a Tropical Style Garden," Many hot climates, even dry and arid climates can grow tropical varieties, but you need to choose the right type as some are too thirsty to waste water on if you're in a drought-prone area.
Generally speaking, tropicals prefer hot (preferably 30C / 86F) and a humid climate, that for optimal growth is fairly consistent throughout the year. But they can thrive in any warm climate but less than ideal conditions will result in smaller or slower growth and fewer flowers. Some tropical and subtropical plants also survive in places with mild frosts and there are many tropical looking specimens species that can survive in order to create a tropical feeling. If you have severe frosts, or long but mild winters and short warm seasons, then growing them indoors is the recommended way to go.
Ideally, hardy tropicals like full sun, delicate tropicals such as ferns, orchids etc prefer filtered light, but can be more fussy about ambient temperature. A good solution is to plant delicates in pots and then the pot planted in the ground and concealed with mulch. Then when the cool season arrives, the whole pot can be lifted up and transferred indoors or to a more tolerant area.;
, Tropical plants like good rich soils that drain easily.
Sand and heavy clay can be improved with compost, heavy mulch layers (approx 15cm or 6 inches thick) and other soil improvers. Tropical gardens can look excellent or straggly, so the soil is a major starting ground to ensure your garden will thrive.
Ironically, a lot of rainforest natives survive on very weak soils with a shallow root layer, but this is often because the soil has been depleted by the larger species taking a lot of the nutrients. Ideally any soil used for tropicals and most subtropicals prefer free draining, many rainforest species do not like ""wet feet"" or their root zone saturated for a long period as it is the prime environment for growing mould and fungus pathogens to the plants. Some species prefer coarse mulch-like soil, such as orchids and bromeliads, but most will do well in any free draining soil, preferably with some organic matter.
Many species in rainforest environments therefore rely on insect and microbial activity to break down leaf and other waste, as well as animal droppings. This is also why rainforests struggle to regenerate after clearing and erosion.
As in dry areas, the amount of available water is low, or evaporates quickly. Thus, apply a nitrogen rich organic based fertiliser and then mulch heavily (a layer approx 15cm/6"" or half a foot thick) and water well. After 2 or 3 weeks with adequate watering (the mulch layer will reduce evaporation, but will benefit with extra heavy watering once a week), the fertiliser will start to break down into the soil improving microbial and soil ecology and it is ready for planting.
It is recommended to apply fresh mulch annually, or until the plants are big enough to create their own mulch layer.

, A nice grassed area is common in resort gardens, but in desert zones can be impossible to keep alive, or be an ethical headache using limited water resources on grass. Alternative options would be to shade the area and apply a red/ochre gravel area to put a chair and and table set on, or install artificial grass as the quality of artificial turf is vastly better since its early days.
Ideally you should reflect on your ambitions - is the garden simply for aesthetic enjoyment, or for relaxation, for children and family pets to play in or for style reasons?
Hunt around in books and online pictures, which online is a vast and rich resource of stunning examples that you can copy, or use as inspiration using local or similar plants that will cope in your climate.

, This is best achieved by planting drought-proof trees such as Australian native frangipani, tipuana, jacaranda, poinciana, carob, desert palms (such as date or canary island date palms - many of the best ones originate from North Africa or desert regions of the Americas; these can have thorns or spines though, so choose appropriately), and so forth.
Ensure you choose wisely however as some of the plants most tolerant of your conditions tend to be invasive species your home state or province has banned or would prefer you to avoid. Local government, as well as plant nurseries can often recommend suitable plants for you in your style.
Get the shade established before buying other plants as they typically won't live very well without protection, or will grow poorly for the first few years as harsh sun can bleach or scorch them.

, These tend to be the stars of the show. Some desert tropical plants suitable for use as shrubs are: cycads, agave, flax, cacti and succulents, frangipani, yucca, kangaroo paws and cabbage palms. Some cordyline, hibiscus, fern, orchid and bromeliad species are very drought proof as well. Strelitzia species, especially var. nicolai (which can grow quite large and tall) is quite drought tolerant. Vinca species can be a good low growing border that rivals the tropical impatiens.
Hanging gardens can work very well in a desert climate, providing they are adequate located with filled with moisture retaining materials like water gel crystals or organic matter. It is best to locate these out of full sun and winds which may dry them out.

, You could use living screens such as bamboo, lillipilli, hedging bougainvillea or hibiscus which will add to the garden.
Plants that can be wind damaged such as banana species are best avoided as even with protection they will never grow well or look optimal.
It is still important to ensure there is some air movement, as plants need air movement to grow hardwood (a common problem in greenhouses that the branches are structurally weaker and more prone to damage), as well as air movement is vital to reduce mildew, mould and pest infestations. Some epiphyte species, such as bromeliads, require air circulation to keep their ecologies healthy.

, Thick, dense plantings will protect species from chilling winds and frosts, much like penguins form dense groups to protect themselves from the cold. Many palms also stand light frosts and tree ferns and bamboo are another good choice.
Smaller understory options that are cold hardy with mild frosts are some of the ginger family, canna lilies, arum lilies, ferns, cordyline australis varieties and several palm species will also tolerate light frosts. Larger hibiscus varieties will easily survive light frost and are useful screens.
Mulch heavily, as thick mulch layers will reduce the likelihood of frost reaching the roots which will kill the plants. You can also wrap foam, bubblewrap or other plastic padding around delicate or sentimentally precious species to protect them overnight if you cannot move them.
In areas with heavy or prolonged frosts, a conservatory or hot-house is the only way to go for tropical plants, as few species will tolerate the cold for too long.For cold climates, go for leaf colour and texture, as most tropical plants require heat and humidity to flower so you might not get this added advantage. Hydrangea, magnolia and camellia can blend in very well; however, if you add dolomite lime to the soil for hydrangeas you can get them to flower in pink which will create a warmer feel.

, In the nineteenth century Victorian period gardens, ""stumperies"" were popular additions to cold regions and they're again making a revival. A stumpery is an assembly of tree stumps or logs installed in a dense mass in which ferns, orchids, bromeliads including tillandsia and other epiphytes can be planted for colour and sculptural pleasure.
Bromeliads are an amazing species for this application. They can grow in beds, in pots, or mounted in trees and wall panels if it does not freeze. The species offers a riot of colours, shapes, patterns and sizes.
Other species or ideas are to make bougainvillea hedges or topiary, which can flower incessantly and better with regular trimming. Hibiscus is another species with large, glamorous flowers that hedge well. Many palm species are excellent examples such as the strong silver Bismark palm or the smaller silver saw palmetto varieties. Some palms sport red, orange and purple coloured new growth which while stunning can be more difficult in most climates outside of the tropics, but palms also have striking stems that may be single or clumping, coloured such as lipstick palm (very cold sensitive) or golden cane, which is pretty hardy. Some small bush palms are attractive such as ladies fingers palm (rhapis palm) which can be variegated.

,
Rock features are desirable but you can also buy fibreglass artificial boulders which are low cost, lightweight and easy to install.
If you already have existing and large but uninteresting rocks, you can scrub them clean and when dry, coat lightly with glue and then cover them with red, brown, ochre or charcoal coloured sands that would make a good contrast. When the glue dries the rock looks like one that you would see in a tropical environment.
Candles, lanterns and torches are also good to add character and that jungle feel.

, It is ideal to keep garden border edged or clean lines maintained to create a formal holiday-resort feel.
Tropical plants that can be pruned should not be done just before, or during winter as this may prove fatal. It is best done when there is a long period of warm weather coming for the plants to grow back.
Palms should not be pruned at all, just dead fronds removed so it is often best to find species that will drop fronds naturally - species like the cocos palm from Argentina will not drop fronds until a long period so can look untidy.
Moss on pathways should be cleaned off regularly as it can be slippery, while cleanly marked pathways make the garden appear more attractive.
If you have a lawn area, if you cut old leaves and fronds, such as palm and fern, as well as old canna, ginger prunings (etc) and place them on the lawn you can cut them with a lawn mower while cutting the grass at the same time. With the grass catcher on, this collection is good to add to compost bins, or to bury under mulch to enrich the soil for the next season. Ensure there is no seed heads from plants you don't wish to regrow in the mulch.

Select your rocks to create your garden.,
Use rocks for both visual effect and to shape your plant bed.,
Place topsoil between your rocks.,
Tread down on your soil.",How to Build a Rock Garden with Weed Prevention2," A random scattering of large and smaller rocks works well. Try to select at least two or three very large rocks to highlight your rock garden. Depending on your tastes, you may want to try to pick rocks that are all the same color and variety, as this can look more natural.


Support larger rocks with bricks or smaller stones.

, As mentioned earlier, you can create a natural look by trying to replicate how the rocks you select would be spaced in nature. If you want something less natural and more formal looking, consider creating a frame of rocks around your plant bed. This will help to define the area you will be working in and can look quite striking.

, Once you have your rocks in place, put a layer of topsoil in between the rocks. For an even more natural look, try to submerge the rocks in the soil so that they don’t look like they are just floating in your yard.


Use weed-free topsoil. You may also want to use a topsoil that is 30% grit so that your soil drains well.
If you are using topsoil repurposed from another area of the garden, it may not be weed-free.

, Press the soil into the earth and water it with a garden hose to make sure air bulbs are removed. Wait a few days before planting your garden, as your rocks may shift and settle a bit.

Select your plants based on the characteristics of your site.,
Keep in mind that some plants also work well as weed suppressors.,
Know that rock gardens may be too dry for some plants.,
Don’t feel like you have to cover your rock garden completely with plants.,
Care for your rock garden.",How to Build a Rock Garden with Weed Prevention3," Keep soil type in mind, as well as whether or not the garden gets full sun, partial sun, or shade. You should also keep in mind that if you choose plants that die back during the winter, your rock garden may look rather desolate during that season. Because of this, you may want to select year-round evergreens to form the backbone of your garden.Lower growing, clump-forming, smaller plants work well in rock gardens, so consider Alpines and Sedums, as these plants display well against rocks. There are many evergreen Alpines to choose from. Examples include Celmisia ramulosa, Dianthus, some perennial Penstemons, and Picea.






It’s also common to incorporate small conifers; however an Acer (Japanese Maple) is a more attractive and elegant choice for providing some height and year-round visual interest.







, Some plants suitable for rock gardens, such as Leptinella potentillina or Creeping Sedums, tend to cover the ground so thoroughly that they also suppress weed growth.

, Large rocks have a habit of retaining heat well, so heat-loving plants will do well growing next to these rocks. Plants that need a lot of water or that don’t do well in high heat, however, may not fare as well in your rock garden.

, Many gardeners aim to conceal visible ground or soil when planting a bed. Rock gardens are different because the aim is to display the background rocks as well as the plants themselves. For this reason, you don’t need to cover the rock garden completely with plants.


Ideally your rock garden plants should spread slowly, so give your plants space to grow.

, While many rock garden plants tend to be very independent (which means they don’t require that much water) you may want to spend some time weeding your garden every few days. Weeds will be less of a problem if you chose to put down newspaper or organic fabric as described in Method 1.


You may also find that ants can be a bit of a pest as they may set up their home in between your rocks. If you are alright with this, leave them be. If you’d rather not have them around, ant killer can be purchased at your local garden store.

Attempt to identify your bromeliad.,
Learn which type of planting material to use.,
Look up year round temperature and humidity if planting your bromeliad outdoors.,
If planting indoors, use a plastic pot unless the area is unusually humid.,
Place in an area of indirect sunlight.,
Moisten around the base of plants in soil or potting mix.,
Fill the tank of the plant with distilled water if it has one.,
Fertilize only when necessary and do so carefully.,
Harvest young plants from your bromeliad once the bloom dies.",How to Care for a Bromeliad1," There are thousands of species of bromeliads, and different varieties grow best in different levels of sunlight, temperature, and humidity. If you purchased your bromeliad from a nursery, the employees there should be able to tell you the exact genus and which environment to put it in. A gardener, botanist, or bromeliad identification book could also help, especially if you know the region your plant is native to.


Visit an online photo gallery of bromeliads to see if you can narrow yours down to a specific genus. Searching for that genus name should be enough to provide the basic care information you need.
If you can get an exact species identification, search online for the name of that species to learn more specific information about temperature, soil, etc.
If you can get a genus identification but not a specific species name, which is common, follow the general guidelines on this chart. If multiple boxes are checked in one category, follow whichever one matches the guidelines below, as that should work for the largest number of bromeliad species.
If you can't identify your bromeliad at all, follow the advice below for the most common successful care methods. Monitor your plant closely and use the Troubleshooting Guide to alter your care if the plant appears unhealthy.;
, Most bromeliads suffer in ordinary soil or potting soil, since it collects too much water and rots the root system. It's better to use specific potting mixes designed for bromeliads, or to create your own to match the plant. Identify your bromeliad's needs using these simple methods:


If your plant is labeled ""air bromeliad"", ""air plant"", ""tillandsia"", ""epiphytic"", or ""non terrestrial"", it grows on other plants instead of in soil. These plants are sold attached to a piece of wood, by themselves, or in a pot containing only dry bark or rocks. Skip to the section Caring for Air BromeliadsIf your plant is a ""terrestrial"" variety, or if it looks similar to a pineapple, grass, or succulent, it requires a mix that can hold a little more moisture than other bromeliad varieties.The soil should still be on the fast-draining side as far as ordinary potting mixes go, so use a variety specially for bromeliads or mix 2 parts ordinary potting mix with 1 part perlite or sand. You can also use a mix designed for cacti and succulents.
If your plant's leaves from a central cup or cylinder for holding water, or if the plant has no clear identifying characteristics, use a coarsely packed, well draining potting mix. Purchase one specially made for bromeliads, or mix your own with equal parts pine bark nuggets (or mulch), perlite, and soil-less professional potting mix. The end result should moisten quickly but drain well., If you live in an area with 50–75% humidity and no frost, you should be able to keep your bromeliad outdoors year round. Most bromeliads originated in the tropics and are happiest in daytime temperatures between 75º and 90ºF (24–32ºC).Occasional, brief variations outside these temperatures and cooler nights shouldn't harm your plants.


If you can't find your area's humidity on the weather report, follow these linked instructions to calculate it yourself.
If your area's outdoor conditions fit the bill most of the year but not in winter, plant the bromeliad in a buried container. Before the frost hits, dig up the container for an easy move indoors.If you don't know the exact species and maximum size, use a bigger container than you think you need to be on the safe side.
If your plant was sold with an identification tag or care guide, it may specify different temperatures that better match the specific species.

, A plastic pot will hold moisture for longer periods, which is important in heated or dry homes. If your indoor environment is typically quite humid, use a ceramic pot instead.


Remember to place a high-lipped saucer beneath the pot, or something else that will catch the excess water when it drains.

, Almost all varieties of bromeliad are tropical, and thrive in warm but shaded areas. Even if you don't know the name of your species, your plant may contain clues to give you more detailed information:If the plant has thick, gray-green leaves, it grows best in bright, indirect sunlight. Plant it somewhere it will receive light without being directly exposed to the sun's rays, such as indoors near an east-facing window or outdoors in mottled or mild shade.
Thin, green leaves should be kept in low indirect sunlight. Plant this somewhere dim, such as beneath a tree that provides significant shading, or indoors near a north-facing window (south-facing if you live in the Southern Hemisphere).
Full, direct sunlight should only used on a minority of desert-dwelling species, and most of these are air bromeliads, not terrestrial ones. If you're not certain of your identification, stick with indirect sunlight.

, Do not water excessively; bromeliads can handle dry conditions much better than soaked roots. Only water once the top two inches (5 cm) are dry, and drain any excess water.



Never use a metal watering can to water bromeliads. Many varieties cannot handle the trace amounts of metal that enter the water.
If planted indoors, it may be a good idea to flush salt buildups from the soil by watering the plant until the water comes through the drainage holes. Only do this if your plant is in quick-draining soil that does not stay soaked for long.
Mist the bromeliad daily using a spray bottle filled with water.

, Many bromeliads have a cup or cylinder in the center of their leaves, intended for catching rainwater. If one is present, keep it filled with rainwater or distilled water rather than tap water, especially if your tap water is hard.


Every week, empty the tank of water and debris by gently turning the plant over the sink. Replace it with fresh water to reduce the risk of rot.
If your pipes, dishes, or sink regularly get crusted with a mineral deposit, usually white, your tap water is ""hard"" and should not be used for this purpose.
Never get water on the surface of a plant during periods of direct or high temperature sun, especially the late morning and early afternoon. The heated water can burn your plant.

, Bromeliads are slow growing plants, and cannot make use of fertilizers at the same rate many plants can. Overusing fertilizer can make extra-long, thin leaves without improving useful growth, or diminish the plant's color, so be careful and follow these steps to fertilize properly:Fertilizer should not be used on indoor plants, or during the winter months.
Fertilizer works best on grass-like bromeliads or on adult bromeliads you are trying to encourage to bloom.
Never apply fertilizer directly to the plant or into the central water tank between the leaves. This can burn the bromeliad.
Plants with central water tanks should have their tank emptied and refilled every couple months to reduce rot, but they do lose nutrients this way. Place a small amount of slow-acting, time-release fertilizer around the base of the plant after emptying the tank.

, Bromeliads typically only flower once in their lives, then die, but their lifespan may cover several years before this happens. Before it dies, it should produce the buds of new plants called ""pups"", usually within or under the base of the lowest leaves. Once the pup has had six months to grow, or the mother plant begins to die, cut them off near the base with a sharp, disinfected knife and plant one in its own pot.Disinfect the knife by rubbing the blade thoroughly with rubbing alcohol. This can also be used to remove unsightly dead flowers, or brightly colored flower-supporting structures. Try not to cut too close to the main plant.

Understand how air bromeliads work.,
Plant in dry bark or attach to any hard object.,
Place in bright indirect sunlight or full sun.,
Mist the plant every few days.,
Fertilize sparingly with diluted liquid fertilizer (optional).,
Move buds to their own area once the plant's flowers begin to fade.",How to Care for a Bromeliad2," If your plant is an air bromeliad, you probably purchased it attached to driftwood or another object, placed in a pot that contained pure bark or rocks instead of soil or potting mix, or by itself with no attachment at all.


These plants draw moisture and nutrients from the air around them. They are especially hardy compared to other bromeliads, but you should keep an eye out to deal with problems early.

, Most air bromeliads cannot draw moisture or nutrients through the roots at all, and only need to be placed in dry bark so it has crevices to attach to and hold itself upright. Smaller varieties can even be attached to driftwood, pebbles, or other objects.


Before placing on object under your bromeliad, if you suspect it has been exposed to saltwater, immerse the object in distilled water or rainwater for two weeks, changing the water frequently.
Some bromeliads sold as air bromeliads may have more extensive root systems, either because they are larger and require more support, or because they can draw moisture from both air and water. Plant these in a mix of 1 part perlite and 2 parts bromeliad potting mix, and occasionally moisten around the base of the plant if the leaves look dry.

, Air bromeliads tend to originate in desert environments and can take more sunlight than other varieties, but this is not true of every species. Keep it in front of an east- or north-facing window for indirect sunlight, or move it to a west- or south-facing window for full sun and keep a close eye out for dry leaves.


Most air bromeliads are small and thus make easy indoor plants, but they can be kept outside. They tend to be hardier than other varieties, but will do best in warm weather and should be brought inside before the frost hits.
If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, the south-facing window will get indirect sunlight, and the north-facing one receives direct sunlight. You may also need to adjust to a different window if there are hills or a mountain slope nearby.
See Troubleshooting for signs your plant has too little or too much sun exposure.

, Air bromeliads require extra moisture from the air. Use a spray bottle to mist the surface of the plant once every few days. It may require misting daily or every other day if kept in an arid indoor environment or during a dry season.


Do not water the base of the plant unless another step tells you to in specific situations. Air bromeliads do not primarily use its roots to draw up water, and standing water could cause them to rot.
Use distilled or bottled water in the sprayer for the best results.

, Bromeliads grow slowly and do not typically require fertilizer. If you want to encourage blooming or rapid growth, you can attempt to fertilize it infrequently, no more than once every two weeks at the very most.


Air plants can only be fertilized using liquid fertilizer, since they do not draw nutrients through their roots. Always dilute one part liquid fertilizer with one to three parts water before spraying.

, When your bromeliad eventually flowers, which can take years and last several months, it will produce ""pups"", or young buds. Use a disinfected knife to cut off dead flowers or spiky flower-supporting structures when they become unattractive, and to remove the buds when they have grown for several months or the plant begins to die.


Disinfect the blade with rubbing alcohol before cutting and take care not to injure the main plant body.

"
Move the plant to an area of more sunlight if the leaves become larger and greener.,
Move the plant out of sunlight if it withers or if colors fade.,
Increase the humidity if the soil won't stay moist or the leaf tips turn brown.,
Rehydrate dry or withered leaves of an air bromeliad.,
Change your caring methods if you notice white buildup near the base of the leaves.,
Treat round dots or white patches that result from pest attacks.",How to Care for a Bromeliad3," These are signs that the plant is trying to make up for insufficient sunlight.Don't move it straight to direct sunlight, since that damages most bromeliads. Move to an area of sunnier, mottled shade or nearer a window that receives indirect sunlight first. Move it again if the leaves don't correct themselves in a couple weeks.

, Move your bromeliad to a shader area of your yard, or place it further from windows that receive direct sunlight. Make a more drastic change in sunlight conditions if the sun is burning brown holes onto the leaves.


If your plant should be able to withstand more sunlight according to a label or expert, it may have been cared for improperly by the previous owners. Acclimate it to the correct conditions by periodically moving it to a slightly brighter area., If the leaf size and overall colors haven't changed, but you notice one of these problems, the sunlight is probably fine but the plant needs more water:Mist the bromeliad every day when it's not exposed to direct sunlight.
Keep the central cup of the plant full of water if one is present.
Plant other plants a short distance from your bromeliad. Each plant raises the humidity in its immediate area.
Run a humidifier in the same room as your plant, or create your own non-powered humidifier by placing pebbles in a tray and filling it with water to just below the surface of the rocks.

, If you have an ""air plant"" with no soil to draw water from, you should be misting it every few days. To repair the dried out leaves immediately, immerse the air plant in water for a few minutes, then hold upside and check to make sure all the water drains out from between the leaves.Trapped water pockets can cause rot.

, This is a sign of too much mineral buildup. Take these steps to remove the problem and deal with the immediate issue:


Use rainwater or distilled water instead of tap water to care for your bromeliad.
Pour water over the plant or into the central cup until the pot drains or the soil is good and moist. This flushes out the excess minerals, but should be done sparingly since it can cause the roots to rot. Turn small indoor plants upside down over the sink afterward to help them drain.
Stop using fertilizer, or at least dilute it to half the strength you're currently using.

, The most common pests are scale and mealybugs, which create the described appearance. Wipe a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol over the affected area every day or two until it subsides.For widespread or persistent outbreaks, mix baby shampoo or mild dishwashing detergent with water and spray onto the plants to suffocate the insects. Rinse the plant shortly afterward to maintain the leaves' access to air.
If you are forced to resort to insecticides, avoid thick or oil-based ones which can suffocate the plant. Bromeliads rely on their leaves to draw in some nutrients and water, so only use insecticides as a last resort.

Select a large container or a part of your existing herb garden.,
Prepare the soil or pot.,
Choose your herbs.,
Follow the growing instructions for each plant.",How to Grow an Herbal Tea Garden1," Either method for a tea garden is fine, as long as it is convenient for you.;
, Prepare the soil or pot as you would do normally for planting herbs or flowers.

, There are quite a few herbs and flowers that are suitable for making herbal teas. Your choice is dependent on what flavors you like the most and what will grow best for you. The following is a mere selection of good possibilities:



Peppermint - this is a perennial favorite for many people. Its refreshing taste is uplifting and cleansing, as well as wonderful for stomach troubles of all kinds. Peppermint is generally very easy to grow and enjoys sunny and semi-shaded spots. Grows very, very easily and unless you want it escaping across the garden, keep it pot-bound. The leaves are the part used for making tea.

Lavender - a delightful, softly fragrant tisane that is perfect for soothing, especially recommended for reducing tension and soothing headaches. Lavender grows well in full sun, well-drained soil. Lavender buds are the part of the plant used for tea.

Lemon Verbena - a refreshing and tangy lemony taste comes packed in these simple but easy-to-grow leaves. It needs full sun and will not tolerate harsh winters, so keep it pot-bound if that's a danger in your area. The leaves are the part used for tea.

Rose Hips - rose hips are the seed cases for roses. They are extremely high in vitamin C and are very good for you. Rose hips will form once the rose bush goes to seed. The rose hips should be deep orange-red before harvesting. Clean the rose hips gently before steeping.

Bergamot - Bergamot carries a touch of orange flavor. The plant produces gorgeous bright red, violet or pink flowers and is happy in full sun or semi-shade. The leaves and flowers are suitable for steeping.

Marjoram - this herb has a fruity, citrus flavor and an undertone of mint. It grows well in full sun to semi-shade. Leaves and flowers are suitable for steeping.

Chamomile (German) - A delightful apple scented herb, this one is traditionally used to induce calm and sleep. It makes a gorgeous but delicate lawn feature with small daisy-like flowers. It tolerates full sun to semi-shade. The flowers are the preferred part for making the tea.

Jasmine - with a fragrance reminiscent of summer time, jasmine provides a delicate and enticing flavor. It grows in full sun to semi-shade and although it can form a part of your tea garden, it needs a trellis or wall at the back of the garden to really thrive. It is not suitable for cold winter climates, however, so if you endure that sort of weather, you will need a potting arrangement that can be moved indoors. The flowers are the suitable part for making tea.

Coriander (aka cilantro) - used more frequently in cooking, coriander is also suitable for herbal tea and has a flavor similar to Lady Grey tea. With strong citrus undertones, this tea carries a spicy and acidic flavor. Accepts full sun to semi-shade and is an ideal container herb. The leaves are used for tea.

Thyme - thyme is considered to be a good tea for soothing stomach troubles and sore throats. It is spicy and may be an acquired taste - try it first before cutting too much herb! It is tolerant of full sun and semi-shade and is an ideal container herb. Use the leaves for tea - if flowers are present, these can also be added.

Violets - if you love the smell of violets, violet tea will probably be a favorite with you. Violets prefer shady growing areas and are easy potted plants if desired. An excellent source of vitamins A and C. Violets are considered to be soothing and refreshing and are a good tonic after winter. The dried leaves and flowers are suitable for steeping (fresh flowers can be used for effect - see photo).

Rosemary - Rosemary has long been used in infusions for easing emotional depression and blood circulation issues. This plant prefers strong full sun but will tolerate light shade, and requires well-drained soil.

Stevia - Stevia is a safe and natural herbal sweetener, used in place of sugar in an herbal infusion and safe for diabetics to use. Stevia does not handle colder weather well at all and should therefore be a potted herb that is brought indoors during cold snaps and wintertime. The leaves are naturally sweet and their sweetness can be concentrated by drying or dehydrating them

, Keep the tea garden weed-free and use a compost tea or other natural source of nutrients to nourish it.

Choose your perennials.,
Choose the size of your perennial beds.,
Place perennial beds around permanent structures.,
Use string to mark off garden areas.,
Look for sun.,
Include a rock garden.,
Plan your perennial beds.",How to Design a Garden2," Think of perennials as the basic building blocks of your garden. They will come back each year, and they also tend to be more of a financial investment. The colors and designs you choose now will have the longest lasting impact on your garden., Decide what size to make your perennial beds based off the size of your house. A smaller house or cottage generally looks better with several smaller beds. A large house will support several larger beds around the perimeter., Dig them around your garage and house. Perennial beds can be set back further, because they require less tending, unlike annual flowers and vegetables., Use wooden stakes to mark off the corners of your garden, the wind brightly colored string around your proposed beds. It will help you visualize the look of your garden, and allow you to fine-tune your placements.

, Select sun-loving plants for sunny beds and shade-loving plants for shady spots. Research each plant and make sure that they are compatible with your hardiness zone.


Plant shade-loving plants against existing trees or shrubs.

, Many perennials can grow on rocky terrain. Include a rock garden area as part of your perennial design. This can be a great option if you are unable to weed. Look for plants that do well in a “dry garden,” with less water., Decide in advance which perennials will go into each specific bed, as well as where each perennial will be located within that bed. You can return to your online garden-planning tool to accomplish this task. Place taller plants at the back of the bed. You don’t want them shading smaller plants.
Give wider plants more space. The beds may look too empty while the plant matures, but they will fill out each season.
Intersperse different colors of plants. You can try a design with every other plant being a different color, or diagonal rows of plants that are the same color.
Plant very small plants along the borders. Some small perennial plants will also do well against paths.
You may also consider using landscape fabric as a barrier for weeds. It can be covered with mulch or rocks to keep your garden looking consistent.

"
"
Look for space.,
Choose locations for “big annuals.” Big annuals—such as sunflowers—will work best along the outer borders of an annual bed.,
Choose locations for “mound formers.” These are flowers like marigolds, California poppies and geraniums.,
Choose locations for additional “spiky growers.” Spiky growers include plants like salvia, angelonia, and snapdragons.,
Choose locations for “leafy plants.” This will include your grasses, perilla, ornamental cabbage, and coleus.,
Fill in around the base.",How to Design a Garden3," Locate the spaces where you would like to plant some annuals. (Whereas perennial plants will regrow each year, annuals will only live for one season.) Annuals will be excellent additions to areas near walkways, fences or yards. This will allow your adequate space for replanting each year and for weeding.

, In additional to sunflowers, try zinnias and cleome., These flowers take up a bit more space, and as such, they will effectively fill out your garden. Plant several of these plants at once. The bright colors will create a pleasing pattern. , These plants “spike up” adding height, variety, and drama to your annual beds., These leafy green annuals will fill out your garden, while adding dimension to your design., You can fill in around the bases of your flowers with low growing plants. Good examples include portulaca, sweet alyssum, fan flower, and million bells."

Choose a sunny spot.,
Ensure there is water nearby.,
Evaluate your soil.,
Make the garden the proper size.,
Decide what you’ll grow.,
Figure out a timeline.,
Sketch out a plan.",How to Design a Garden4," Most vegetables need 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, so access to bright sunshine is the first thing to think about when planning your vegetable garden. Select a location where your veggies can soak up some rays..

, After sunlight, water is the next most crucial component to a vegetable garden. Whether you plan to water by hand or employ an irrigation system, you need to be sure you can regularly and effectively water your garden. Veggies are notoriously sensitive to drought., Test your soil to see what you have in your area. Plants like vegetables grow better in rich, well-drained soil. You can add mulch or compost to your soil to bring in more organic matter if necessary., When planning the size of your garden, you will want to be realistic. If this is your first vegetable garden, it may be wise to start small. A well-maintained 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m) garden will produce more food than a weed-filled, unkempt 25 feet (7.6 m) by 25 feet (7.6 m) bed.Choose an area that is flat. In some cases, you can tear up earth and level it out, but it may need extra leveling in the future as the dirt compresses.

, Select the vegetables you want to grow based on which plants are compatible with your region, and which vegetables you would like to eat! You will also need to decide how much of your garden will be “direct sow” (seeds planted right into the earth) versus “transplanted” (plants started somewhere else and then transferred).Some direct sow plants include beets, carrots, parsnips, peas, and radishes.
Some veggies you are more likely to transplant include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.
Transplants can be purchased (which is more expensive), or started yourself in an indoor location.

, Before you can plant, you’ll need to know the average date of the last spring frost in your region. You will want to start planting as soon as possible after the risk of frost has passed. This can be a gamble: you want to achieve the longest growing season possible, but a late frost can damage what you’ve planted. Based on the projected last frost, you can select a date to begin planting.


You can check with a local nursery or look into a farmer’s almanac to determine the date for your region.
If you are planning to start your own transplants, work backwards from your planting date, and decide when you’ll need to begin growing your transplants.

, Before you begin planting, take some time to plan the locations of your vegetables. You will want to place taller vegetables in the back and shorter vegetables near the front, so that they don’t compete for sunlight. Plant in rows, so that you can separate types of plants and create walkways between the rows.Start with four foot (1.2 meter) rows and two to three foot (60 to 90 cm) pathways between the rows.

Pick the leaves or flowers.,
Prepare the leaves.,
Make the tea.,
Allow to steep for 5 minutes.",How to Grow an Herbal Tea Garden2," The best time of day for this is just after the dew has dried but before the heat of the sun begins to draw the oils out of the plant.

, Leaves should be bruised to release their essential oils. Do this by rubbing them together.

, Add the herbs to a teapot or directly to a mug or cup. For each cup of tea, add approximately 2 to 3 teaspoons of fresh leaves and/or flowers. Slice rose hips in half before adding. The photo in this section shows direct infusion of chamomile flowers.

, This will ensure that the flavors are released and the full benefits of the herb's or flower's qualities are available.

Use a container version of the tea garden.,
Write a small card detailing the properties of the tea garden.,
Wrap in clear cellophane.",How to Grow an Herbal Tea Garden3," Plant herbs and flowers of choice and arrange well. If you know which teas your gift recipient will like the most, then choose those.

, List the herbs and flowers, their growing needs, their health benefits and how to make fresh tea. Attach this to the container.

, Provided that the container will not be sitting around in hot sun for too long, you can present your gift wrapped in clear cellophane with a large ribbon bow for a special touch. Make sure that the container has been well watered and is not leaking before wrapping.

Note the various uses of hedges over the centuries.,
Select appropriate hedge plants for large hedges that create barriers.,
Consider a small hedge to define areas rather than create barriers.,
Get the right hedge your your region.",How to Begin Hedging," Hedges have been used in all forms of landscaping for literally thousands of years. They are a single barrier of plants that can be evergreen or deciduous, and act as a boundary - they can hide your garden from your neighbor's and contain garden areas. They can even be used to pen in livestock, or make a maze!;
, A multitude of plants are available at all good garden centers and nurseries:

Beech - a traditional hedge plant. Easy to maintain and acts a perfect foil to show other plants against without endangering them. A beech hedge requires clipping 3 or 4 times a year with a set of good sharp shears, or petrol-driven (gas) trimmers or even electric trimmers.







Horn beam - another traditional hedge plant. Easy to maintain and acts a perfect foil to show other plants against without endangering them. A hornbeam hedge requires clipping 3 or 4 times a year with a set of good sharp shears, or petrol-driven (gas) trimmers or even electric trimmers.







Twisted hazel - something different. It is informal and doesn't need precise clipping and still provides an effective barrier. It will lose leaves, but it really comes into its own in the winter, showing off its twisted stems.







Holly plants - if you want something evergreen, then alternative holly plants are a good start, such as variegated holly. They come in an array of colors from greens, yellows, creams, and even whites. They might even fruit if you are lucky. These prefer to be clipped more frequently to keep a regular shape, perhaps pyramidal, to shed off any excess water and snow.







, Smaller plants that only grow to a maximum of two feet in height can create a border effect rather than a barrier, just containing a garden bed zone rather than the whole garden.

Box hedge - (buxom) a traditional box hedge can be used formally or informally.







Fuchsia - this is an option, but it must be cut down to nothing each year, ready to grow strongly again in the following season, meaning that you will not have a border hedge for a short part of the year.







Berbers - for something more permanent, a berber is dense, has prickles, retains its structure and provides attractive color.







, Whatever you use, make sure it suits your location, aspect, and soil. Consult your garden centre for more information. Have a really good look around your garden centre and your local parks and botanical gardens for inspiration.

Form a plan.,
Clean things up.,
Decide what you want to grow.,
Decide where your plants will live.,
Prepare your soil.,
Start planting.,
Create a composting area.,
Maintain your garden.,
Add some finishing touches.",How to Achieve an Impeccable Spring Garden," Choose a nice spring day and take a walk around your gardens. Bring a notebook to make notes of what needs to be done.


Take note of emerging plants and weeds, perennials that need to be divided, trees and shrubs that need to be pruned. Make a list of messes that need to be cleaned up, over-crowded plantings, and bare spots. Once you've taken inventory of the things needing attention you can prioritize them and get to work.;
, Rake up any debris, twigs, and leaves that may be on your lawn or in your gardens. Use a light touch with your rake in the spring, because plants are tender at this time of year and could be damaged.


If there are bare spots in the lawn, sprinkle them with grass seed.
Remove tree guards and winter protection so your plants have access good air circulation.
Cut back any dead parts of your plants. Trim your shrubs, and prune your trees.
Divide your perennials. When perennial flowers are left to grow too long they get crowded and put out fewer blossoms.
Dig these up before they grow too much and chop them into two or more pieces.
Replant one of them in the spot you dug from.
Choose places to plant the rest of your new plants. Now you have even more flowers.
Fix or install trellises wherever they're needed.
Take advantage of rainy days to clean and sharpen your garden tools, go over your notes, and plan where things will grow.

, You can grow your own herbs, vegetables, flowers, shrubbery, vines, fruit trees, or a combination of all of them.

, Some plants like lots of sun, some like shade, and some really don't care. If a plant likes dry conditions, it's a good idea to avoid planting it in that low part of your yard where water accumulates in heavy rain.


If you want to build a flower or vegetable garden, now is the time to do it. Make a garden plan that includes shrubs, perennial flowers, annual flowers, and even think about what kinds of bulbs you want to plant for next springs blooms.
Think outside the box. For example, it's perfectly okay to plant your chives in with the flowers, they'll look pretty and save room in your vegetable garden.

, Good soil is key to a healthy and vibrant garden. Identify the kind of soil you are working with, whether clay, sandy, silty, or hopefully loamy, which is a combination of all three.



Work your soil to a depth of about six inches 12 inches (30.5 cm) after applying any soil amendments such as compost, leaves, peat, sand, or rotted manure.
If you're gardening in hard clay soil, now is a good time to add some sand to help break it up so that roots can easily form. Good soil should crumble easily. The end of fall is the best time to start preparing your soil by digging in organic matter such as leaves, but it's okay to start now.

, Once your soil and seedbed are ready and your climate is past any danger of frost, you can start planting your garden. Some plants grow fast and some take years, some are more difficult to maintain, and some are downright easy. When planting, keep in mind the blooming times of plants so you always have some colorful flowers in all your gardens.

, If you don't already compost now is a good time to start. Compost is important to a healthy, vibrant garden. It provides nutrients to the plants and keeps improving the condition of your soil. Plus it's organic and good for the environment.

, The fun doesn’t stop with planting and blossoms. Maintaining your garden is a year round activity. You'll need to prune shrubs, dead head flowers, pull weeds, water, and keep on composting. You can reward yourself by bringing a nice fresh bouquet of flowers into your home.

, Use some attractive garden art for accents, place garden benches where you can enjoy them, and create inviting outdoor living spaces that will allow your family to really enjoy your garden. Maybe you'd even enjoy some type of water element.

Make sure that the lawn mower has both oil and gas.,
Press the primer button 3–5 times if the mower has been inactive.,
Pull the lever near the top of the handle toward you.,
Pull the starting cord several times.",How to Start a Lawn Mower1," This step is especially important if this is your first time using a new lawn mower: check the oil and gas tanks and make sure that both have been filled properly, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the owner’s manual.Lawn mowers run best off of fresh, clean unleaded gasoline. This can be the same as the type that you put in your vehicle. The gas should be at least 87 octane, and should not contain higher than 10% ethanol.Gasoline with higher ethanol levels is corrosive, attracts water, and can damage the interior of the lawn mower’s gas tank.;
, If you have never used this particular lawn mower before, or if the mower has been active for an extended period of time (for example, over the winter), you’ll need to press the primer button a few times. This will channel gasoline into the mower’s engine.If you’re not sure which is the primer button, check for a diagram or schematic in the owner’s manual. This will show the layout of the lawn mower, including the primer button.

, If you stand behind the mower (in the position from which you’ll push it to mow your lawn), you should see a bar or lever by the top of the handle. Grasp this lever and pull it towards you, holding it against the top bar of the mower. You should be able to hold the lever and bar together in one hand.This lever needs to be in “starting” position before you pull the starting cord. Also, in order for the lawn mower’s motor to keep running, you’ll need to keep holding this lever while you use the mower.

, The starting cord should be on the base of the lawn mower, and will have a plastic cord to grasp. Hold onto this firmly, and give the starting cord a single smooth, long pull upward. Do not jerk or yank on the cord. Pull quickly until the cord has fully extended. If the mower has not started, repeat the process several times.Some models of lawn mower will have more than one handle attached to the starting cord. If this is the case with your model, hold both handles in one hand and use them both to pull forcefully on the starting cord.

"
"
Add new gasoline.,
Adjust the throttle control.,
Push the primer button 5 times.,
Pull firmly on the starting rope.",How to Start a Lawn Mower2," Riding mower engines can be temperamental when filled with old gasoline. Refill the gas tank with new gasoline each time you start to lawn mower to make sure that old gas has not deposited gel, gum, or varnish inside of the gas tank. Newer gas will help the mower start more reliably and quickly.Old gas which has been sitting in the gas tank for more than a couple of months can attract moisture and potentially corrode the gas tank. To avoid this, try to use up nearly all of the gas each time you use the mower, and don’t let old gas remain in the tank for months.

, The throttle control—commonly called a “choke”—is a device on engines which adjusts the amount of air which can be pulled into the engine when starting. Blocking more air will result in a richer fuel blend being pulled into the engine and will help it start more readily. When starting the engine, adjust the choke to restrict air from entering the engine. If the choke is manual, this setting should be clearly marked. Refer to the mower manual if you need help locating or using the throttle control.After the lawn mower engine has started and is running, you can open the choke so that more air can enter the engine. This will keep the mower from dying while you’re using it.
On some riding lawn mower models, the throttle control is entirely automatic and inside the mower.

, For the comparatively large engine of a riding mower, you’ll need to use the primer button to direct gasoline into the engine. The primer button will pull gasoline into the carburetor, making it easier for the engine to start. This will also reduce the number of times you’ll have to pull the starting cord.If you’re unsure of the location of the primer button, check the riding lawn mower manual for a diagram showing the location of the lawn mower’s parts and buttons.

, Grasp the handle firmly and pull the cord rapidly outward until you feel resistance. It may take 4 or 5 pulls on the starting rope for the engine to catch and start running. While you’ll need to pull quickly and firmly on the starting rope, don’t jerk or yank it. Repeated yanking motions will break the cord or the plastic handle.If this doesn’t start the engine, press on the primer button another 3 or 4 times, and then begin pulling the starting rope again.

"
"
Replace the fuel.,
Check the spark plug.,
Check the air filter.",How to Start a Lawn Mower3," If your lawn mower has sat unused for more than a couple of months (and especially if it’s sat for an entire winter), the gasoline in the tank may have gone bad. Drain this gasoline and dispose of it safely. Then fill the lawn mower tank with fresh gasoline.If the mower’s gas tank doesn’t have a drain plug, you may need to use a length of hose and siphon the gas from the tank.

, If the spark plug in the lawn mower engine is wet with liquid or gasoline, the mower will not successfully start. Remove the spark plug, and clean it using carburetor cleaner and a damp rag. The solvent in the carburetor cleaner will cut through and remove any oil residue that may be stuck on the spark plug. Then let the spark plug dry before reinserting it into the lawn mower engine.If you need assistance opening the engine or finding the spark plug, you can refer to the lawn mower manual, which should contain a diagram of the engine.
You can purchase carburetor cleaner at a local auto supply store.

, The air filter keeps dust and grass bits from entering your mower’s engine. If the lawn mower’s air filter has become excessively dirty or flooded with gasoline, the machine won’t start properly. The air filter will either be a paper filter (housed in a small cylinder) or a foam-type filter (housed in a sardine-can sized metal rectangle). Remove their air filter and inspect it: if the filter is clogged or dirty, you may need to replace it. This will allow the engine to get enough air and start properly.If you’re unsure of the air filter’s location, refer to the lawn mower manual. This should provide a diagram with the location of the air filter and other engine components.
You can purchase a new lawn mower air filter at your local hardware store. Air filters may also be sold at an auto parts store, or at a large retailer like WalMart.

, Immerse the block in cold water and allow it to get thoroughly saturated before you place it in a dark, cool spot.

, The number of times you can reuse your block will depend on how much time it takes for the nutrients to become depleted.

, You can then start the process over with a new mushroom kit.

"
"
Start your mushrooms with fresh mushrooms or mushroom spores.,
Place small pieces of mushroom, spores or cultures on a sterile Petri dish, which allows the mycelium to grow.,
Allow the fungus to grow in the Petri dish.,
Transfer the fungus to a tightly packed, sterilized grain, such as wheat or rye.,
Start harvesting your mushrooms when they have begun to grow on the grain.,
Use your grain seeds to grow more grain.",How to Grow Hydroponic Mushrooms2," Both can be purchased online or at your local gardening center. These are needed to grow mycelium (fungus). If desired, you can simply purchase liquid mycelium to start the process.

, The mycelium has to grow until it is strong enough to support a mushroom reproductive cycle.

, This will most likely take several weeks.

, It will take up to 4 weeks for the mushrooms to colonize the grain.

, Check on their progress every few days once they have colonized the grain.

, You can then use that grain for your next batch of mushroom spores.

"
"
Decide what type of starter you are going to use.,
Before you begin, prep your cubes or pellets in clean, distilled water for at least a couple of hours.

,
Lightly shake out any excess water and place a couple of seeds in your cubes or pellets.,
Place your cubes or pellets in a shallow domed or covered tray with about an inch or two of distilled water and place in a dark area until you see sprouts (about 5-7 days).

,
See to it that the water in your tray stays about 1-2"" high.,
Invest in appropriate hydroponics system according your plants needs and your budget.",How to Germinate Seeds in Hydroponics," Most people either use peat pellets or rockwool cubes. Either is a fine choice as they are both neutral so won't harm your seeds or seedlings and they both allow enough moisture and air to allow your seeds to grow.;
,, You want to place a couple of seeds in case any don't sprout and you can always remove any extra sprouts if you want to.

,, At the initial stage use plain and distilled water and later add nutrient- solution to keep your growing system moist. And, once the plant is 2 inches (5.1 cm) tall provide more and more food. Once the plant reaches a height of 2 inches (5.1 cm), apply full strength plant food.

, You can choose either an active or a passive hydroponics system. Active hydroponic systems use artificial method for germination process while passive hydroponic systems carry out germination process naturally. Water culture system is also one reliable system where there is no need of a growing media but you can easily grow plants in water.

Get all of the necessary equipment for your Deep Water Culture setup to be a success.,
Attach the air-stone to the airline running from the air pump and insert air-stone into the bottom of the bucket.,
Fill the bucket with water to a level where the bubbles created by the air pump burst and keep a thin film of water on the bottom of the net pot.,
Mix a nutrient solution of 1/4 to 1/2 strength and fill the bucket to desired level.",How to Create Deep Water Culture in a Garden," You will need a light proof 3–5 gallon (11.4–18.9 L) bucket, a plastic net pot that fits the bucket, a fish tank air pump, some airline tubing, an air-stone, a PH test kit, hydroponic fertilizer and a thriving easy to grow plant like a sunflower.;
, Set the empty net pot on top of the bucket., <Very important. Otherwise the growing medium of the chosen plant will get soaked causing problems such as over-watering, fungus, etc.

, Until roots protrude through the bottom of the net pot the plant must be watered by hand but certainly not over-watered. The nutrient solution must be in the desired range for the type of plant being grown. Typically a PH of 5.5 to 6.1 is best and of utmost importance.


Other factors that are vitally important for the chosen plant to thrive are environmental ones such as Light, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, air circulation and growing medium moisture.

Then put in a room set at 65-74 degrees.

",How to Grow Houseplants in Water (Hydroculture),",,, Hold the plant at the base near the dirt and gently wiggle it out, dirt and all. Tapping the pot might help free the plant. Remove the dirt from the plant. Knock off loose dirt clumps. Hold under gently running tap water at room temperature to rinse off the remainder of the dirt. Trim off dead or extra roots.

, Cover the bottom of the inner pot with pebbles, about an inch. Place the plant on the pebbles, and spread out roots. Hold in place with one hand while pouring more pebbles around the plant roots up to the base. Tap the container to settle the pebbles, and then rinse under room temperature running tap water.

, Place the inner container in the outer container, and fill the pot with nutrient solution until the water level indicator shows its full enough.

Get a pH tester and a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) or EC (Electrical Conductivity) meter, if you are serious about growing a hydroponic garden.,
Feed them 600 ppm Maxsea 16-16-16, after the seedling stage.,
Feed your garden a rounded 1/2 tsp Maxsea 16-16-16 plus a rounded 1/2 tsp Maxsea 3-20-20 in each gallon of water.,
Feed your garden 800 ppm Maxsea 3-20-20 until you near the end of flowering, after the transitioning period.",How to Feed Plants in a Hydroponics System Using Maxsea," Until then, using a seaweed-based fertilizer called Maxsea will solve your problem. The first ten days your plants have roots, feed them 400 ppm Maxsea 3-20-20. This is about 1 level teaspoon/gallon of tap water. Add to this 1/4 teaspoon Epsom salts for magnesium.;
, This is about 1 rounded teaspoon. Add 1/4 teaspoon Epsom salts to each gallon. You can feed most plants in this way through the vegetative period.

, Be especially sure to add 1/4 tsp Epsom salts to each gallon through the flowering stage. You could switch to straight Maxsea 3-20-20 at this point, but most plants look a little nitrogen deficient by the end. Feed your garden in this way for two weeks, while the plants transition from vegetative growth to flowering.

, This is about 2 level teaspoons per gallon. Make sure to add 1/4 tsp Epsom salts to each gallon. The very last 10 to 14 days before you harvest, you will want to feed your garden only plain water. Flushing your garden will remove excess nutrient salts from the plant tissue and will improve the aroma and flavor of your garden produce.

Place the weed whacker on the ground, away from obstructions.,
Flip the kill switch on.,
Switch the choke to the “on” or “closed” position.,
Press the purge valve five to six times.,
Place your hand on the throttle lock and pull the cord.,
Stop pulling the cord once you hear the engine running.,
Switch the choke to the run position.,
Place your hand on the throttle lock and pull the cord again.",How to Start a Weed Whacker1," This will give you more leverage as you try to start the weed whacker. Additionally, you want to make sure any object that could get caught in the spinning line is kept well away.


Make sure the gas tank is sealed before starting your weed whacker.;
, The location of this switch will vary depending on the weed whacker you’re using. You can usually find it somewhere on the shaft.


The kill switch controls the flow of electricity to the motor. It’s also referred to as a the “on/off switch”; if it’s kept off, the engine cannot start., This is only something you need to do if cold starting your weed whacker. A cold start refers to any time you need to start an engine when its temperature is colder than the temperature it usually runs at.The choke will restrict the airflow into the engine, making it easier to start it.If you’ve used the weed whacker in the past five minutes, the engine should still be warm enough. You won’t need to switch on the choke or use the purge valve.

, The purge valve is a bulbous piece of rubber, similar in shape and size to the tip of a finger. It’s also sometimes referred to as a “primer bulb”. Pressing this bulb will allow fresh gas to enter the carburetor.This step is only needed when cold starting the weed whacker.

, The throttle lock is a small lever usually found on top of the weed whacker’s shaft. You should only have to pull the cord two or three times before the engine starts to run.


Be sure not to pull on the trigger below the shaft; you don’t need to give the weed whacker any gas for it to start., If done correctly, you’ll then hear the engine stop working; it’ll essentially “burp”, running only for a few seconds.Make sure not to pull the cord after you hear the engine die down.

, Now that you’ve been able to start the engine, you don’t need the assistance of the choke. Resuming proper air flow to the engine will keep it efficient. While the choke allows for a cold engine to be started more easily, it will lead to higher fuel consumption if kept on while you use the weed whacker., Be sure not to pull on the trigger below the shaft; you don’t need to give the weed whacker any gas for it to start.Keep pulling the cord until the engine starts. It should now keep running, rather than simply burping. The weed whacker is now ready to use!


For a warm start, you should only need to follow this step. There’s no need to fiddle with the purge valve, and you should make sure the choke is on the run position."
"
Plug the weed whacker into an outlet.,
Pull the trigger.,
Note the differences between electric and gas powered weed whackers.",How to Start a Weed Whacker2," Make sure to use an extension cord that’s long enough to cover the area you will be trimming. Some weed whackers have a clip on the handle where you can loop the extension cord. This prevents it from disconnecting if it gets caught as you use the weed whacker.


Some electric weed whackers are battery powered. If this is the case, you’ll need to make sure you’ve charged the weed whacker before trying to start it.Make sure the trigger isn’t held down when plugging in the weed whacker.

, The advantage of electric weed whackers is they’re ready to be used once they’ve been plugged in. The line will start spinning as soon as you pull the trigger. Make sure to keep the weed whacker away from you and any surface that could be damaged by it., While a gas powered weed whacker demands several steps before starting, electric weed whackers are much simpler. You won’t find a kill switch or a pull cord on an electric weed whacker. You should only need to pull the trigger to get it working.

Research pictures and plans of garden design examples to inspire you.,
Check the suitability of your own climate.,
Consider the common characteristics of a Persian or Islamic garden design.,
Decide on your plant additions.,
Install a central water feature, such as a pond, rill, or a reflection pond.,
Install a tile mosaic.,
Select the appropriate colours.,
Keep the garden well-maintained.","How to Create a Garden with Persian, Arabic or Islamic Influences"," The following research suggestions will help you to find good examples of Persian, Islamic, or Arabic style gardens:


Obtain books on the subject. Good gardening books will often contain many inspiring images of the layout, the styles, colours, etc., and will explain the principles at much greater length than this brief overview. Visit your local library, or your favorite bookstore.
Check online. The internet has a wide range of pictures, but you need to be aware that many of the images will often end up being those of the more commonly known gardens, namely, the Alhambra, the Taj Mahal, and the Generalife.Many of the more renowned gardens are later renovations, so they may not be as true to original forms as you'd wish - it's really up to you how far back you'd like to research. Good search terms include ""Islamic garden design"", ""Persian garden design"", and ""Arabic garden design"".
If you are lucky enough to be able to afford it, travel. Visit countries such as India, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, etc., to find suitable gardens. When visiting these gardens, photograph many different angles to help you to reproduce your favorite ideas in your own garden later.
If you have friends living in countries where Arabic, Islamic, or Persian inspired gardens are the usual style, ask them to send you photos and gardening books. Even if you cannot read the language, the photos should be very helpful in your planning.;
, If you live in a hot climate, then it is probably that this garden design is a good choice for your location, as the plants typically found in a Persian or Islamic garden are usually hot climate types, and the shade-producing design features and water-efficient elements are better suited to a hot climate.


While colder climates can work quite well, it is better to incorporate additional colour for the colder periods. See ""Tips"" also, for winter care.

, There are some key elements of this type of garden that should be taken into account when developing your garden design. On the whole, these characteristics reflect:


Shade for keeping cool: One of the central features is to create shade to keep cool, as a way to cope with hot climates;







Walls for shape and temperature regulation: These gardens are often walled and have private areas which have little association with external scenery beyond the walls. Being able to use walls as a feature piece of the garden design makes this a perfect option for fixing your existing courtyards in need of renovation;







Water features: This garden style will usually have a central water feature, or reflection ponds; indeed water is usually at the heart of a Persian or Islamic inspired garden. (see the step below on installing water features);







Clean lines, vibrant colour: These gardens often present clean alignments and crisp colours;







Mosaics: They occasionally make use of intricate mosaic tiles;







Parterre: These gardens have parterre style beds or long beds;







Formal or informal: This garden style can be both conservative and refined, or more relaxed. The choice is up to your preferences;







Archways: Arches make a good architectural theme when creating this style of garden. These can be made from wooden supports and rendered to make them appear as if made from stonework; and







Symmetrical: Symmetry is a frequent requirement for this style of garden. Matching or mirroring elements can be an enjoyable part of your planning process.







, Many modern gardens or Islamic inspired gardens (the Alhambra, for example, is not in its original condition) feature neat clipped hedges as another wall concept. Some plants to consider include:

Myrtle or other scented hedges, rows of date palms (for large gardens) or any other dwarf desert type palm can be used.






Standardised citrus trees can make a nice feature, both through their fruit and perfumed flowers.






Bay trees are an ideal addition, as well as pomegranate trees, but it is best to keep these trees in pots, as they can be invasive.






Terracotta potted flowering hardy plants such as roses, lavender, geranium (pelargoniums), rosemary are all suitable features that add fragrance, colour, and beauty to the garden.






Feature desert plants such as agave, or other formal upright plants such as yuccas, which can blend in well.

, While having fountains is fine, fountains tend to be a more modern invention because fountains were an extravagance in desert culture. Small fountains are probably the best compromise for both saving water and for being in keeping with the original styles.


Water channels with small fountains are common in gardens in India, Pakistan, and Iran.
Often there are four streams, or the pond points in four directions. This derives from the classical, ""Chahar Bagh"" layout, which has a fountain at the centre of the garden that flows into four water channels at right angles with one another. These four water channels are associated with the four rivers of Paradise. The four-quartered garden design is also very water efficient as it makes the most of water moving through a grid pattern.Round ponds are not as common as geometrically shaped ones in more formal gardens. It really depends on your space and your budget (the less usual shape and mosaics can be pricey) as to whether or not you can accommodate a geometrically shaped pond.
Turquoise or jade coloured tiles are used frequently with water features. If you can use this colour when laying tiles, it will reflect beautiful blues in your garden.

, Often you can mount the tile mosaic directly on existing blank walls. Bathroom tiling firms occasionally can do this service from their product range but it is fun to try making your own - see wikiHow's article on making a mosaic from broken tiles for an initial idea.

, The colours most frequently found in Islamic, Arabic, or Persian inspired garden design are whites, dusky pinks/terracotta, rich blues, golds (occasionally in small patterns), and rich reds. There is not a great deal of reliance on delicate, pastel colours.


Consider painting wall panels, arches, to match the colours just described, or install coloured pots to reflect the colour theme.

, The moment it appears forgotten, it's a fine balance between adding to its charm, or looking derelict, and it's hard to plan which result you'll end up with! So, err on the side of maintaining a tidy garden at all times. This might mean budgeting a gardener into the overall upkeep, so keep this in mind when planning.

Note that one tote goes on the bottom and will be the nutrient reservoir.,
Note that the upper container will hold several plant containers, usually filled with expanded clay pellets.,
Run a short length of tube from your water pump to the flood and drain fitting above it.,
Realize that a good system is only half the battle.",How to Build a Homemade Hydroponics System Cheaply," Run a couple of air stones from the air pump and keep them in here. Nutrient solution reservoirs should always be oxygenated in this way. The water pump also goes into this container.;
, In the bottom of this container (out of the way of the plants), drill two 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) holes. In one hole you install the flood and drain fitting (the shorter of the two). In the other hole you install the overflow fitting.

, Plug your water pump into the timer to flood the upper tray for a half hour, four times per day while the lights are on. The upper container will flood from the shorter fitting, but never higher than the overflow. When the pump kicks off, the top container will drain back into the nutrient reservoir through the shorter fitting.

, How to grow hydroponically really means how to feed your plants right. You should know the nutrient requirements of the plants you grow, as well as know how to maintain a nutrient solution reservoir daily for success.

Confirm the plants are getting enough light.,
Harvest the garden as it grows.",How to Build a Hydroponic Garden," The flood table will hold the water for the garden. You can build a simple flood table out of wood. The width of the flood table will depend on how much you want to grow in the garden and how much water you want to use.For a small garden, make a rectangular frame out of treated lumber that is 4 feet, 1-inch (1.2 metres, 2.54 cm) wide by 8 feet, 1-inch long (2.4 metres, 2.54 cm). Then, line it with a polyethylene plastic sheet. This will hold 20 gallons (75 L) of water.
You can also use a wide, deep plastic tray as the flood table. Pick a container that can hold 10 to 20 gallons (38 to 75 L) of water. You may want to line the tray with plastic to ensure it does not leak.;
, To prevent the roots and soil of the plants from rotting, make a floating platform so they can float in the water. For a small garden, use a 4 by 8 foot (1.2 by 2.4 metre) sheet of 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) thick styrofoam. Check that the edges of the platform can move up and down so the plants can float., Use a plant pot as a guide when cutting the holes with a saw. Cut enough holes to fit all the plants you want to grow. Make sure the plant pots fit snuggly in the holes and do not extend beyond 1/16 inch (0.4 cm) below the styrofoam platform.

, Drip emitters help to drip out water from the garden to ensure the water does not sit stagnant in the flood table. You can find them in the irrigation supply section at your local hardware store or nursery. They come in different drip rates, based on maximum gallons per hour (gph).For a standard garden, you want the flood table to hold 5 gallons (19 L) of water per hour. So, get two drip emitters that have a rate of 2gph.
Puncture two holes in the bottom of the flood table. Then, push the drip emitters into the holes. Seal any gaps around the drip emitters with epoxy or hot glue.

, The flood table will need to be elevated on a stand or stool. Place a bucket under the flood table, directly underneath the drip emitters. The bucket will catch the water as it drips out of the flood table.If you are growing the hydroponic garden outside, place it in a sunny spot in your yard. Position the flood table so it gets a maximum amount of sun.

, Pour enough water to fill the flood table halfway. Depending on the size you have chosen for your flood table, this may require 5 to 20 gallons (19 to 75 L) of water.You can always add more water to the flood table once you add the crops.

, Hydroponic gardens can be grown outdoors in warm climates, especially climates that tend to get year round sunlight. If you are growing the garden indoors, you will need grow lights. Use metal halide lights or sodium bulbs.Position the grow lights over the flood table so it gets a lot of light.

, You will then need to add nutrient rich plant food or fertilizer to the water so the plants can thrive. Look for plant food rich in calcium, magnesium, and other nutrients at your local plant supply store or gardening center.

You can buy plant food specifically formulated for a hydroponic garden. It will be rich in the nutrients needed for plants grown in water.

, Hydroponic gardens are best for plants with shallow roots, such as leafy greens like lettuce, spinach, and kale. You can also grow herbs like mint, basil, and dill.Choose plants that have similar light and water needs. This way, when they grow close together in the garden, they all do well and thrive.
As you expand your hydroponic garden, you may be able to grow vegetables with deep roots like beets, squash, and cucumbers.

, Start with a base that will provide moisture and air for the plants. Use eight parts perlite and one part coco fiber. You can also use vermiculite or peat moss instead of coco fiber.If you live in an arid climate, add more coco fiber to the perlite. For a humid climate, add less coco fiber.

, Use 4 inch pots that have holes on the bottom, or netted planting pots. The holes will allow the plants to get water and plant food in the hydroponic garden. Fill the pots ⅓ of the way with the mixture., Use sprouted seedlings in cubes of soil. Place the cube with the started seedling in the pot. Pour media around the sides and top of the plant. It should be snug in the pot.Using seedlings that have already been planted and started will make it easier for you to get your garden off the ground. Put one cube of started seedlings per pot.

, Water the crops lightly and then place them in the flood table. If you are using a floating platform, place the pots in the cut holes. If you are not using a floating platform, simply place them in the water in the flood table.Make sure the roots of the plants are submerged in the water only ⅙ of an inch. This will ensure the roots do not get too wet but still get enough water to thrive.

, Water the plants at the base every day. If they start to wilt, water them twice a day. You should also add more water to the flood table if it starts to look scarce.If the plants do not thrive as much as you’d like, they may not be getting enough air and too much moisture. Check if the roots of the plants are rotting. If they are starting to rot or smell, move them higher up so their roots are less submerged in the water.

, The water in the flood table should drip slowly out through the drip emitters into the bucket underneath. This can take seven to 10 days. As this happens, add a fresh batch of plant food to the bucket and more water. Then, pour the contents of the bucket into the flood table.This will ensure the plants get the nutrients they need as they grow in the hydroponic garden.

, If you are growing the hydroponic garden outdoors, make sure the plants get constant, direct sunlight 10-15 hours a day. If you are growing the garden indoors, have grow lights on the plants for 15-20 hours. Set up the lights on a timer so they shut off automatically at a set time each day.You can buy grow lights that come with a timer. Or you can set a timer yourself and shut off the grow lights as needed.

, Use clean gardening shears to trim the garden. Prune the garden for size and for eating. Cut leaves for eating at the stem. Harvest your yield as it grows so it thrives.

You can then add new plants to the flood table or replace existing plants based on your needs.

Choose the type of system you want to build.,
Gather all the materials you need for this project.",How to Build a Homemade Hydroponics System1," Your choices include:



Water Culture. This is a low cost, easy-to-build option. It results in your plants being suspended in water by a StyroFoam platform. The water will be filled with a nutrient solution. You can grow 5-6 plants per 5 gallon (18.9 L) water culture system.

Multi Flow. This is a medium cost, fairly difficult-to-build option. It relies on gravity to flood plant trays with water and nutrient. You can use a timer and float switch to control water levels. You can grow many plants at a time with this system.

Ebb and Flow. This is a low-cost, moderately easy-to-build system. Your plant tray is put on top of a reservoir and connected to the reservoir with tubing. A water pump pumps water and nutrients to the plants. Excess liquid is returned to the reservoir for later use. You can grow a fair amount of plants with this system.

, They are listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section.

"
"
Find a container to use as a reservoir such as a fish tank or a bin/bucket.,
If possible, use a fish tank or similar container as your reservoir.,
Use a tape measurer to get the length and width of your reservoir.,
Do not place StyroFoam in reservoir yet!,
The number of plants you can grow will depend on the size of the garden you build and the types of crops you want to grow.,
The pump you choose must be strong enough to provide enough oxygen to sustain plants.,
Connect the air line to the pump and attach the air stone to the free end.,
Set up hydroponics system.",How to Build a Homemade Hydroponics System2," If it's not light-proof, the reservoir should be painted black (or covered with thick black trash bag if you want to reuse a tank).


Allowing light to enter the reservoir will promote the growth of algae, which disrupts the growth of other plants by stealing oxygen and nutrients.
It is a good idea to use a reservoir that is the same dimensions (length x width) from top to bottom (Example: Top is 36"" x 20"" and bottom is 36"" x 20"").;
, Spray paint tank (if translucent) black and let dry. Before painting, apply a strip of painters' tape vertically from the top edge to the bottom. When the paint dries, remove the tape and use the unpainted space to show you how much water is in the reservoir.


Creating this line, however, is not necessary as you can determine how much water is in the reservoir simply by noticing how far down the floater (StyroFoam) has sunk.
Adding the line gives a more accurate and convenient view of the nutrient solution level.

, Measure from inside of the reservoir from one end to the other. Once you have the dimensions, cut the StyroFoam 1/4"" (inch) smaller than the size of the reservoir.


For example, if your dimensions are 36"" in length and 20"" in width you should cut the StyroFoam to 35 3/4"" x 19 3/4"".
The StyroFoam should fix nicely, with just enough room to adjust to water level changes.
If the reservoir tapers off at the bottom (the bottom is smaller in dimension than the top) the floater (StyroFoam) should be 2""-4"" smaller than the reservoir (or more if necessary).

, First, you need to cut the holes for the net pots. Put the net pots on the StyroFoam where you want to place each plant.









Using a pen or pencil, trace around the bottom of the net pots. Use a sharp tool such as a knife or box cutter to follow the trace lines and cut the holes for pots. (KIDS!!! Get help from an adult.)
On one end of the StyroFoam (any end), cut a small hole for the air line to run into the reservoir.

, Remember to space plants appropriately so that each receives ample amounts of light.

, Ask for advice choosing a pump at your local hydroponics supply store. Tell them the size of your reservoir (In gallons - 2, 5, 10 gallons, etc.) and they should be able to make a recommendation.








, The air line should be long enough to travel from the pump into the bottom of the reservoir or at least float in the middle somewhere so the oxygen bubbles can get to the roots. It also must be the right size for the pump you choose. Most pumps will come with the correct size air line.









To make your best approximation, use a one gallon bucket/bottle or any container of known capacity and fill the reservoir. Remember to count how much it takes to fill the reservoir and you will know the capacity of your reservoir.

,


Fill reservoir with nutrient solution.
Place the StyroFoam in tank.
Run the air line through the designated hole/notch.
Fill the net pots with growing medium and place one plant in each pot.
Put the net pots into the designated holes in StyroFoam.
Turn on/plug-in pump and start growing with your fully-functional, homemade hydroponics system.

"
Place your six pots on a stable surface.,
Connect them with the PVC fittings and tubes.,
Put the plants in the small plant trays.",How to Build a Homemade Hydroponics System3," Be sure that the surface is not tilted, or the system will not work properly.








, If the container you have is designed for a multi flow system, it should automatically turn the power on and off as the water levels in the container change. Thus, this is a safer and more efficient flood/drain system than those used in ebb and flows (see next section)

, Ensure that everything is working properly.

Use a pH test kit to test the water.,
Install grow lights (recommended).,
Monitor the water regularly.,
Change the water and nutrient solution regularly.",How to Grow Hydroponic Tomatoes," There are several varieties of hydroponic systems, and tomatoes can grow well in any of them. The instructions in this section will teach you how to construct an ebb and flow system, which is relatively cheap and easy to build. This system is also known as a flood and drain system because it floods the plants with nutrient solution and then the solution drains when it is about two inches from the top of the container.Alternatives:Deep water culture: simple system for cherry tomatoes and other small plants.Multi flow: a larger version of the ebb and flow that relies on gravity. Difficult to build, but supports more plants.Nutrient film technique (NFT): Suspends the plants with roots brushing against slope of trickling nutrients. Slightly more finicky and expensive, but preferred by some commercial growers.


Note: Hydroponics stores and home improvement stores may sell a hydroponics kit which includes everything you need to set up your system. Alternatively, you can purchase each component separately, or even find some of them around your house. Clean secondhand or previously used components thoroughly before building the hydroponics system.;
, Hydroponics systems are only suitable for indoor or greenhouse environments. They require precise control to function properly, so they should be set up somewhere closed off from other rooms and from the outside. This allows you to set the temperature and humidity to accurate levels needed for best growth.


It is possible to grow hydroponics using natural light, but keep the system under a glass or polyethylene covering such as a greenhouse roof, not open to the air.

, Use a plastic container that does not let in any light to prevent the growth of algae. The larger this reservoir, the more stable and successful your hydroponics system will be. Each tomato plant requires about 2.5 gallons of nutrient solution.However, many factors can cause the tomato plants to use water faster, so it is recommended that you use a container that can hold double the minimum amount of water.You may use a plastic bucket or trash can for this purpose. Use a brand-new one to prevent any contamination of the system, or at least a lightly-used one thoroughly scrubbed with soapy water and rinsed.
Collected rainwater may be better suited for hydroponics than tap water, especially if your tap water is especially ""hard"" with high mineral content., This ""ebb and flow tray"" will support your tomato plants, and will be periodically flooded with nutrients and water that the tomato roots will absorb. It must be sturdy enough to hold up your plants (or be placed atop additional support), and placed higher than your reservoir to allow excess water to drain down into it. These are typically built of plastics, not metal, to avoid corrosion that could affect the plants and wear out the tray.

, You can purchase a water pump at a hydroponics store, or use a fountain pump found at home improvement stores. Many pumps will have a chart listing the water flow at different heights. You may use this to find a pump strong enough to send water from the reservoir to the tray containing the plants. The best course of action, however, may be to pick a powerful, adjustable pump and experiment with the settings once you have your system set up.

, Using 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) PVC tubing, or the type of tubing that came in your hydroponics kit, attach one length of tubing between the water pump and the tray, so the tray can be flooded to the height of the tomato plant roots.


Position the inlet and outlet pipes at opposite ends of the tray to promote water circulation.

, Attach a second length of PVC tubing to the tray with an overflow fitting, located at a height at the bottom of the roots.When the water reaches this level, it will drain back through this tube and into the reservoir.


Keep in mind that the overflow tube should be larger in diameter than the inlet tube from the pump to avoid flooding., A simple timer intended for light fixtures can be used to power the water pump at regular intervals. This needs to be adjustable so you can increase or decrease the amount of nutrients delivered depending on the plants' stage of life.


A heavy duty 15-amp timer with waterproof cover is recommended.Any water pump should have a way to attach a timer, if it doesn't come with one already, but the exact instructions vary by model. Ask the manufacturer if you are having trouble with this step.

, Turn on the water pump and see where the water goes. If a stream of water fails to reach the tray, or if excess water spills over the edges of the tray, you may need to adjust the settings of your water pump or you may need to adjust the size of your drain pipe. Once you have the water set to the correct strength, check the timer to see if it sets the pump going at the specified times.

, Raise your tomato plants from seed whenever possible. If you bring plants in from the outdoors, you may introduce pests and diseases to your hydroponics system. Plant seeds in a nursery tray with a special growing material for hydroponics, instead of ordinary soil. Before using, soak the material with pH 4.5 water, aided by a pH test kit from a garden store. Plant the seed under the surface, and keep under plastic domes or other transparent material to trap moisture and encourage the seeds to sprout.


Growing materials:Rock Wool: excellent for the tomatoes, but wear a mask and gloves to avoid irritation.Coconut coir: excellent choice, especially when mixed with clay ""grow rocks."" Low-quality products may require rinsing due to salt content.Perlite: cheap and moderately effective, but washes away in an ebb and flow system. Best in a mix with 25% vermiculite.

, As soon as the plants sprout, remove the covering and place the seedlings under a light source for at least 12 hours a day.Only use incandescent light bulbs as a last resort, as these produce more heat than other options.


See the section on hydroponics system setup to learn about grow light options.
Take care not to let the light shine on the roots to avoid damaging them. If roots are protruding from the starter material before they are ready to transplant, you may need to soak additional starter material and use it to cover them.

, Wait until their roots start to protrude from the bottom of the nursery tray, and the first ""true leaf"" has grown, larger and different in appearance than the first one or two ""seed leaves"". This usually takes 10–14 days.When you move them into the hydroponics system, you may place them at 10 to 12 inch intervals in a layer of the same material, or transfer them to individual plastic ""net pots"" containing the same material.


If using the ebb and flow system described in this article, the plants are placed on the tray. Other systems may call for the plants to be placed in a trough, along a slope, or wherever the water and nutrients can reach the roots.

, To begin with, try setting the pump to run for 30 minutes every 2.5 hours. Do not go more than 2.5 hours without running the pump.Keep an eye on the plants: you'll need to increase the watering frequency if they begin to wilt, and decrease it if the roots become slimy or soaked. Ideally, the material the plants are in should just barely dry out when the next watering cycle comes along.


Even once the watering cycle is established, you may need to increase the watering frequency once the plants begin to bloom and fruit, since these processes require additional water.

, For ideal growing conditions, expose growing tomato plants to between 16 to 18 hours of light a day. Then turn off the lights and let them sit in total darkness for about 8 hours. The plants will still grow if you are relying on sunlight, but will likely grow more slowly.

, Some tomato plants are ""determinate,"" meaning they grow to a specific size, then stop. Others continue to grow indefinitely, and may need gently tying to a stake in order to grow upright. Prune them by breaking off stems with your hands rather than cutting them off.


Keep in mind that even though determinate tomatoes will grow without staking, there is a risk of lower yields if you do not stake the plants upright. When the plants set fruit, they may droop and come into contact with the growing medium.

, When the tomato plants bloom, since there are no insects in your hydroponics environment to pollinate them, you will need to do it yourself. Wait until the petals bend back to expose the round pistil and the pollen-covered stamens, or long, thin sticks at the flower center. Touch a soft paintbrush to each of the pollen-covered stamens, then touch the rounded end of the pistil. Repeat daily.

, During ""daylight"" hours, the air temperature should be 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 C). At night it should be 55 to 65 °F (12.8 to 18.3 °C).Use thermostats and fans to regulate the air temperature. Monitor the temperature while the plants grow, as it could change with the climate or tomatoes' life cycle.


Pay attention to the growing solution temperature as well. This should be between 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. However, you do not need to keep it exactly within this range. If it goes slightly outside of it, then that is fine. Just avoid letting the growing solution temperature go below 60 degrees Fahrenheit or above 80 degrees Fahrenheit., A fan that exhausts to the outside or another room may help keep the temperature even throughout the room. The air flow it creates may also make pollination easier, although to be certain of growing fruit you may wish to pollinate by hand anyway, as described below.

, Choose a nutrient solution made for hydroponics, not ordinary fertilizer. Avoid ""organic"" solutions, which may decompose and make caring for your system more complicated.Because the needs of your system vary with tomato variety and mineral content of your water, you may need to adjust the amount or type of nutrient solution you use. To begin with, however, follow the instructions on the packaging to determine how much you need to add to the reservoir.


Two part nutrient solutions create less waste and can be adjusted if problems arise simply by mixing them in different amounts, making them preferable to one-part solutions.You may wish to use a growth-focused formula while the tomatoes grow, then switch to a bloom formula once they flower to meet their new nutrient needs.

, Use a pH test kit or litmus paper to test the pH of your nutrient and water mix once it's had time to become an even mixture. If the pH is not within the range of 5.8–6.3, ask a hydroponics store or gardening store employee about materials that can be used to lower or raise the pH. You can adjust the pH with acidic or basic additions to the reservoir.


Phosphoric acid can be used to lower pH, while potassium hydroxide can be used to raise it.

, Artificial ""grow lights"" will allow you to simulate ideal growing conditions year round, providing your tomatoes with many more hours of ""sunlight"" than the garden outside may be receiving. This is one of the major benefits of an indoor growing system. However, if you are using a greenhouse or other area that receives high amounts of natural light, you may accept a shorter growing season and save money on electric bills.


Metal halide lamps simulate sunlight most accurately, making them a popular choice for hydroponics systems. Fluorescent, sodium, and LED grow lights are also available, but may cause slower or differently shaped growth. Avoid incandescent lights, which are inefficient and short-lived compared to other options., An electrical conductivity meter or ""EC meter"" may be expensive, but it is the best way of measuring the concentration of nutrients in the water. Results outside the range of 2.0–3.5 indicate that the water should be changed or partially changed. EC meter testing works best if you are using a two part fertilizer. If you do not have an EC meter, look for the following signs in your tomato plants:Leaf tips curling downward may mean the solution is too concentrated. Dilute with pH 6.0 water.
Leaf tips curling upward or a red stem suggest the pH is too low, while yellow leaves indicate the pH is too high or the solution is too dilute. In any of these scenarios, change the solution as described below.

, If the water level in the reservoir drops, add more water, but do not add more nutrients. Every two weeks, or once a week if your plants do not look healthy, empty the reservoir completely and rinse the support material and roots of the tomato plants with pure, pH 6.0 water to leach away mineral buildup that could cause harm.Fill the reservoir with a new water and nutrient solution, making sure to balance the pH and let the mixture become even before you start the water pump.


You may use the water used for leaching to water regular garden plants.

Almonds do not usually grow at all in colder climates.Unless you have a large, carefully-controlled indoor growing setup, you may have a hard time growing almonds outside of areas with a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern climate profile.


If you're in the US, a good way of determining whether your local climate is suitable for growing almonds is to use a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.These maps rate geographical areas by their minimum temperatures, giving an approximate indication of the types of plants that can survive there. For almonds, you'll want your area to have a rating of at least ""6"" — higher is better.
According to this system, suitable areas in the US include much of central and southern California as well as parts of Arizona, Texas, and inland Florida.;
, You have two options for starting your almond tree — you can either use seeds (fresh, unprocessed nuts) or seedlings (young trees).Nuts allow you to experience the growing process from the very beginning, but can be more time and effort-intensive. On the other hand, seedlings are more convenient, but can be a little more expensive.


If you want to harvest edible almonds, you'll want to be sure to pick seeds or seedlings for a fruit-bearing sweet almond tree. Keep in mind that bitter almonds are inedible and that not all sweet almond trees bear fruit. These varieties are only suitable for shade and decoration. Talk to the staff at your local garden supply store if you're unsure of which almond trees are productive.

, Almond trees do well with lots of sun. Before you get started, find a spot in your yard or garden that gets plenty of full, direct sun, free from shade. You will grow the almond tree in a pot prior to planting it in the ground, but it's still important to choose a location ahead of time — the tree will only fit in the pot for so long.


You'll also want to make sure your growing spot has well-draining soil. Almond trees don't do well if water is allowed to pool around their roots — this can lead to root rot.

, If you're growing your almond tree from a seed (which are just almond nuts surrounded by their protective husks), start by germinating the seed in a controlled environment — once it's started, you can plant it in a pot or in the ground. First, gather your seeds in a single large bowl (the more you use, the better — some may not sprout or may succumb to mold). Then, germinate them according to the following steps:









Add water and let the seeds soak overnight.
The next day, use a nutcracker to crack the almond shells open slightly — the shell should still hold itself together, but you should just be able to see the nut inside. Throw away any seeds that show signs of mold.
Fill a few small flowerpots with potting soil. Make sure the pots have holes on the bottom for drainage.
Plant the seeds an inch or two under the surface of the soil with the cracks pointing upward. Rest the flowerpot indoors in an area that will receive direct sunlight. Now, just wait for seedlings to sprout.

, Once your seedlings have started to grow (or, alternatively, if you bought ready-to-plant seedlings), prepare your decided-upon spot in the ground for planting. Make a small mound an inch or two tall (and slightly wider than it is tall) for each seedling. Push the seedling about an inch into the center of the mound until it's below the surface of the soil. This mound technique helps prevent water from gathering around the roots of the plant as it grows, which can cause serious problems (including root rot).









If you're planting germinated seedlings, plant them at the end of winter or in the spring. Alternatively, if you're planting un-germinated seeds, plant them in late fall so that they have a chance to sprout in the spring at the very start of the bloom season.If planting multiple trees, space each tree at least about 20 feet (6.1 m) apart. This gives the trees' roots plenty of space and allows for easy, effective irrigation., Immediately after planting, almond trees should be ""tanked"" (watered heavily) with at least a gallon of water to thoroughly hydrate the soil.After this initial watering, you'll want to maintain a regular watering schedule as the tree grows. Almond trees thrive in hot climates, but they're not desert plants, so watering is vital to keep the growing plant healthy.








Water each almond plant at least once a week unless it rains. Established trees can survive on two or three inches of water without rain, but growing plants will usually require more.Alternatively, you may want to use a drip irrigation system. This is an especially convenient choice if you have many trees.

, Once the growing season begins, it's appropriate to use a reasonable amount of fertilizer to boost your plant's growth (though this is not required). For young trees, you'll want to use small doses of Nitrogen every few weeks throughout the growing season. For mature trees, on the other hand, you'll want to use about two pounds of urea or 30 pounds of manure (applied once).


No matter what kind of fertilizer you're using, be sure to ""water it in"" after you apply it. Fertilizer can have a harmful ""burning"" effect on the plant if it's applied without water or an excessive amount is used at once., Fruit-bearing almond trees will start to grow small green fruits during the growing season — these hard, sour fruits aren't a common dish in the Western world, but are semi-popular in the Middle East. In the fall, these fruits will harden, turn brown, and crack open. Once the exposed almond husks have a dry, brown exterior, they're ready for harvesting. See below for more information on harvesting.


There are two types of almond tree: trees that grow ""sweet"" almonds and trees that grow ""bitter"" almonds. Bitter almonds and their fruit aren't safe for eating. Bitter almonds contain prussic acid, a toxic chemical. Just a handful of raw, unprocessed bitter almonds can potentially be deadly.However, it is possible to process bitter almonds with a special toxin-leaching process, rendering them edible.

, Winter is the perfect time for pruning — the tree's dormant wood makes for safe, easy removal. Note, however, that dead or diseased limbs should be removed immediately at any time of the year. To prune branches, use a pair of garden clippers to make a clean cut near the bottom of the branch. For tougher pruning jobs, use a saw.









Pruning a tree encourages healthy, even, visually appealing growth. Smart pruning choices can also make a tree stronger, sturdier, and more resistant to certain diseases.When pruning, try to thin out especially dense areas of foliage and eliminate spots where two branches rub against one another. You'll also want to prune any stray branches that grow higher or further to the side than the others to encourage even growth., Almond trees take some time to start producing nuts. Typically, this ""waiting"" period lasts about five years. However, depending on the species of tree, it can take as long as 12 years for it to reach full nut-producing capacity. Be patient — a mature, healthy tree can produce over 40 pounds of nuts in a single harvest!


Once an almond tree begins bearing fruit, it will do so every year for as long as 50 years, ensuring plenty of almonds for years to come.

, It's important to understand that most almond trees don't produce almonds ""by default"". The fruit of the almond tree (and, thus, the almonds themselves) are usually produced as a response to pollination as a method of sexual reproduction. This means that unless you have a self-pollinating variety of almond tree, you'll need to cross-pollinate your tree with another tree of a different variety to get almonds.









The easiest way to do this is usually just to have multiple trees of different varieties. Once you have two to three trees growing near each other, pollinators like bees will bring pollen from one tree to another as part of their natural behavior.
You can also pollinate trees manually by taking a flower-bearing branch from another tree and rubbing it against the first tree's flowers, mixing the tree's pollen in the process. However, this is much more time-intensive and may not work as well as natural pollination.

, Grafting will turn an unproductive tree into a productive one if the existing tree is not self-fertile and you graft on a scion from a different variety. Once the graft ""sets"", the grafted-on part will still have the ability to produce fruit, even if the rest of the tree doesn't. This is how the vast majority of certain crops like oranges are grown.









There are several ways to graft a productive limb onto your tree. The simplest is usually a technique called T-budding that involves making a long, narrow cut on the ""host"" tree and slipping the new limb into the groove formed. After this, the new limb is secured with string or rubber ties until the host tree accepts it.
Note that most grafting is performed in the spring when the material under the bark is moist and green.
Keep in mind that grafting will not make an unproductive tree productive if it isn't producing due to poor site selection, lack of nutrients, etc.

, Almonds are usually harvested between July and October (in some countries like Saudi Arabia, it starts end of May) once the external fruit has dried and cracked open. Shake the tree and gather the almonds that drop, taking care to throw out any rotten ones you come across. Sometimes, the fruit may fall without the tree being shaken. Unless they begin to rot, these nuts are still edible.









After harvesting, it's a good idea to freeze your almond husks for 1-2 weeks to kill any residual pests., One problem that can affect nearly any tree (including the almond tree) is root rot. This harmful condition is caused mainly by fungi that start to grow on the tree's roots if they're in contact with water for too long. Since root rot can be very tough to treat, the best policy is prevention. Never over-water your tree — any sort of watering that results in standing water around the base of the tree can do much more harm than good.









To help prevent over-watering, you may want to increase the drainage capability of your soil. This can be done by mixing in plenty of extra hummus or organic matter to give it added permeability. Note that shallow, heavy, and clay-rich soils have especially bad drainage.
If you have a case of root rot on your hands (usually signified by drought-like symptoms, including yellowing, wilting, and dying leaves), dig up the plant's roots and cut away any dark, slimy patches. If problems persist, dispose of the plant to prevent the fungus from spreading throughout your garden.

, Weeds are not a huge concern for old, established almond trees, but they can be a serious threat to young seedlings. Weeds compete fiercely for the same nutrients, water, and sun as young almond trees. If ignored, weeds can even ""strangle"" a seedling before it has a chance to grow.The best policy for weeds, especially during your plant's first few months, is to start weeding early and often. Try to keep a five or six foot strip along each row of seedlings free of weeds — you can use manual methods (like your hands or garden tools) or herbicides to kill the weeds.You can use a layer of mulch, or landscaping fabric to control weeds. This works well for small, home orchards.

, One particularly annoying almond pest is the navel orangeworm. Over the winter, this insect shelters in so-called ""mummy"" nuts — almonds that aren't harvested and are left on the tree into the late fall and winter. Once the spring rolls around, these grubs become active, resulting in damage to the almond crop. The best way to prevent this is simply to get rid of the mummies. Without any place to shelter over the winter, orangeworms should not appear, as they cannot penetrate healthy fruits later in the year.


After the mummies are removed from the tree, be sure to destroy them by mowing. Orangeworms can still shelter in intact mummies on the ground.

, Peach twig borers are just what they sound like — small, grub-like insects that bore into stone fruits like peach and almonds. These insects can cause significant damage to almond crops with their feeding, so if you see these pesky bugs (or chewed-up leaves, which can signal their presence), use a pesticide immediately to protect your crop. Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial insecticide, is a great choice for killing borers. Time the spray with the spring hatching season to kill the insects before they have a chance to do significant damage.








In addition to the two examples above, a huge variety of additional pests can potentially attack almond trees — so many, in fact, that it's impossible to list them all here. For more information, use a search engine query for ""almond pests"" or contact your local garden supply store or a local university's botany department.
You may also want to learn about integrated pest management. This is a method of controlling pests that combines biological, environmental, and chemical pest management techniques. It is more effective than using one method alone."

Start the seeds in a rectangular flower pot and transplant the seedlings to your garden so you will have consistent spacing.,
As the seed heads turn from green to rusty red, they reach maturity and begin drying.,
Using a large container about sixteen inches across remove the grain from the seed heads by rolling them hard and vigorously between your palms over the container.,
Winnow the grain.,
Final process: To separate out the grain that still has the hull attached use a soil sieve with an appropriate mesh for the sorghum variety and size grain you have.",How to Grow and Process Home Grown Sorghum Grain," Growing the sorghum is the easy part. When the seed heads are developing spray them with an organic insecticide.;
, At this point daily test them by pinching a grain between the edge of thumbnail and finger. When the grain is hard and dry you cannot break the grain with your thumbnail, and you should harvest the seed heads lest they begin dropping the grain. Cut the seed heads with garden scissors and lay them out on a table in a protected area not in the dark. A screen porch is ideal. Let them completely dry.

, Rub them hard to remove all the grain you can. Imagine you are rolling a candle between your palms with the candle perpendicular to your arms. This is the rolling action used to separate the grain from the seed heads. A small percentage of the grain will stick to the seed head, so just accept the small loss.

, Now, your collected sorghum grain will have lots of dust and debris from the blooms and hulls and a small percentage of the grain will still be in the hull. Either on a mildly windy day or using an electric fan drop handfuls of the grain held high about three feet or more into a large container letting the breeze carry away the dust and empty hulls (chaff). You should do this over a large plastic sheet on the ground to prevent waste in case you miscalculate the effect of the wind. It is so pleasing to see the breeze carry away the dust and chaff! You might repeat this process a time or two again. Now you will notice that your remaining problem is to either separate the grain that still has the hull attached or to remove the hulls from that grain. It is not so easy to remove the hulls from that small part of the grain that is not naked, so let's assume you choose the former solution.

, For example, a 3 mm (approx. 1/8 in.) mesh works for Dale Sorghum. Soil sieves are available at bonsai hobbyists websites. They are typically 12 inch (30.5 cm) diameter screens. This works well with a properly sized screen mesh though not with 100% effectiveness. You will find that the remaining grain with the hull still attached floats to the surface as you rinse the grain before cooking. Oh, and you cook it similar to brown rice, or you may grind it for a gluten-free flour.

If you are growing algae for a science fair project, you could use something the size of a plastic water bottle, or something larger like a small aquarium.;
, Your growth medium will be composed primarily of sterilized water. Put the water in your clear container.If you are growing microalgae, you should use sterilized saltwater.
If you want to grow spirulina, use clean freshwater. You can use water from any source, such as tap or spring water, as long as it has been filtered with activated carbon or a ceramic filter.If you are worried about bacteria, boiling the water before using it will reduce contaminants., In nature, algae cohabitate with and other aquatic life. These creatures keep the underwater ecosystem balanced and provide plenty of nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and silicates to the algae. Your bottle of water will be lacking those nutrients, and micronutrients like trace metals and vitamins, unless you add them. You can buy a nutrient solution over the counter, or take some water from a fish tank or pond to supply nutrients.Using water from a pond or fish tank could introduce other contaminants into the growth medium.
You can also mix nutrient solutions. The Walne medium is a nutrient mixture that is suitable for most algae.
Measuring the effect of different nutrient solutions could be one way to study algae in a science fair project.

, Before you add the algae, you want to know that you have a proper environment picked out. Look for a windowsill or somewhere outside in the sun that you can safely place your algae container. This will allow the sun to provide the energy needed for the algae to reproduce and thrive in your growth medium. If you have difficulty finding such a location, you can use grow lamps instead.Research your algae to determine what type of grow light is best for growing. Normal grow lights designed for plants are not very effective for certain types of algae. You may need to find a light that gives off primarily red and orange light.Different types of algae will require different amounts of light, and getting algae too hot (above 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit) can be lethal to your algae., The most up to date estimate suggests that over 70,000 different species of algae exist, and potentially many more species yet to be classified.We use these different types of algae for a host of reasons. Many species of algae are used to produce biofuels to power electrical components. Other types of algae, such as spirulina, are used as a food source. Sometimes, algae is grown in a classroom setting as a science experiment. Your intended use will decide what kind of algae you should grow.For example, spirulina would be a good choice if you want to grow algae to supplement your diet.
Spirogyra plants are sometimes used in science fair projects.

, For a basic experiment, you can just use any sample of algae, grow it, and observe it. If you are looking at algal behavior in general, you can just collect an algae sample from the any pond, lake, or other natural source. That said, many different types of algae are found in nature. If you are investigating a particular type, you might want to be more careful about where you get a sample. In this case, you should order your specific algae sample or algae starter from an algaculture supply company, or online.


For example, many people are interested in growing a type of algae called spirulina. Because spirulina is often eaten, you should get your sample from a reputable company.
If you are growing algae for a classroom experiment, collecting any sample from a local pond or lake is usually sufficient.

, Once you have selected an algae to grow, simply put the sample into your growth medium. Make sure that the appropriate amount of light is still available. Allow the algae time to grow.Often, a few weeks may pass before you can see the algae in the container. This is because many species of algae (referred to as microalgae) cannot be seen by the naked eye individually. They must reproduce and generate a high algal population to be visible to the human eye.
If you are growing a macroalgae species, such as kelp, you will be able to see it.

, As your algae grows, it will become more and more compact inside the container. The denser your algae population gets, the more opaque the solution will become. Most algae cultures will be green, but you can get different types of algae that are different colors.For example, the strain of algae known as rhodophyta has a red color.
Keep a log of all changes that your algae undergoes.

, For a short term experiment, you will likely only need to add nutrients at the beginning. If you are growing algae on a long term basis, you will need to add nutrients with each new batch of algae. You also might need to add nutrients as the algae population grows. If you are unsure of when to add nutrients or how much to add, consult an algaculture specialist.If your algae population becomes too dense, you may have to separate some of it into a new container. Otherwise, the container will be okay as long as you are growing the algae.

, If you wish to learn more about your algae culture, look at it under magnification. Putting a drop of your algae culture on a microscope will likely reveal much more than looking with the naked eye. In addition to your algae, you may even find protozoans or other life forms in your culture.This will likely be required if you are growing algae as part of a science experiment for class or work.

Enjoy the reduced risk of soil-borne pests and diseases.,
Utilize only the amount of water that is needed for your gardening.,
Grow more plants in less space using hydroponic gardening.,
Enjoy faster harvest times when growing fruit or vegetables.,
Reduce the strain on your own body when gardening.",How to Benefit from Hydroponic Indoor Gardening," When gardening hydroponically, you will be preparing the nutrient solution yourself. Because of this, it is very straightforward to minutely adjust the levels of any given nutrient in your growing medium. It is also much easier to adjust the pH of a water solution than soil. These factors will allow you to tailor your growing medium to your plants' specific needs and monitor it easily.;
, Many insects and microorganisms that can harm plants rely on soil to proliferate. These pathogens and pests have a much harder time living in a water solution, and therefore will pose a much lower risk to plants grown hydroponically. This will keep plants healthier as well as reducing the need for expensive and dangerous chemical pesticides.

, In both commercial agriculture operations and backyard vegetable gardens, most of the water applied to the plants will never be absorbed and used in their growth. Hydroponic gardening corrects this problem because the plants are grown directly in a water bath, and excess water is lost only through evaporation.


In fact, hydroponic gardening setups can use as low as 10 percent of the water requirement of a traditional, soil-based setup. This can save you money and reduce strain on the environment.

, When plants grow in soil, they grow long, extensive root systems to help them seek out the nutrients in the soil. When the nutrients are provided directly to the roots, however, the plant will focus its energy instead on growing foliage and will maintain a minimal root system. For this reason, hydroponic gardens can pack plants together very densely.


Gardening in water versus soil allows you to fit as many as 5 times the amount of plants in the same space. This makes it an ideal solution for cramped indoor growing. If implemented on a large scale, this makes hydroponics ideal for feeding densely populated urban areas.

, Since you control your growing conditions you will be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor much quicker than traditional gardening. By giving your plants the optimal blend of nutrients and light, harvest times can be reduced by 50% or more!

, A hydroponic garden can also reduce the fatigue produced through various gardening activities. Bending over to dig up weeds or harvest the plants is no longer required. Working with compacted, difficult soil is also no longer an issue. Hydroponic growing bins can readily be placed at a convenient height for working with the plants without bending over.

Purchase the staghorn fern from the local nursery.,
Ensure that you live in the right climate or can provide it the right greenhouse climate all year round.,
Mount it.,
Water frequently, especially during the hotter months.,
Feed.",How to Grow a Staghorn Fern," These do not grow easily from spores and are best purchased ready grown in a container or by detaching young plants growing from parent runners.


Note! Ask for an easy-to-grow variety of staghorn fern from your local nursery.;
, It requires moderate warmth and humidity all year. It also needs to be placed in a shaded position.


Very southern areas of the USA, many Australian states and tropical areas are good for growing this fern.

, If it's not already mounted, have it mounted to something suitable such as a piece of wood, a tree fern piece or on a wire structure. Your local nursery can show you what to do if you're not sure.


One of the easiest methods is to attach it to clumps of sphagnum moss and then attaching the moss to the bark or other object. Mix a little bonemeal into the moss if you have some. Then, attach the whole structure to a wall or other vertical structure located in a shady spot.

, The staghorn fern must not dry out too much; in its tropical environment it receives daily rains and remains in a moist environment. Spray it frequently during the hotter months, at least once weekly. Take care not to overwater though as it can rot easily. Allow the backing to dry out and then water.


When it's raining and cooler, less frequent watering is appropriate.

, The plant will enjoy some bonemeal (see above) or use a specific fern feed according to the package instructions. Foliar feed should be diluted heavily and only applied when the staghorn is undergoing active growth (during the warmer months).


Pack the moss or other backing for the staghorn with organic material on a regular basis.

Use agave juice to sweeten your food.,
Drink up your tequila and mescal, both of which come from agave.",How to Grow Agave Plants," Fast-draining soil that is sandy or gritty is essential to properly grow agave plants. Avoid loamy or clay soil, as your plant will likely develop root rot and die due to too much moisture in the soil.;
, Construct a 1 to 1 ½ foot high raised bed and fill it with sandy soil to ensure your plant grows properly.The sides of the raised bed can be constructed with landscape timber made of naturally rot resistant wood like red wood. Do not use wood that has been treated with creosote or pentachlorophenol as both of these substances are toxic to people and plants. Landscape timbers should be nailed together or held in place with a stake at each corner.
If you use rocks to construct the raised bed, put mortar between the rocks to hold them in place.

, The soil should be a cactus mix made of mostly sand and perlite, with a little organic matter and soil for nutrients.


You can find sandy soil mix at your local garden center.

, You can test the soil’s pH with a soil test kit, which you can find at your local garden center. Take the soil sample from a depth of 4 inches as the surface soil may have a slightly different pH and the roots of the agave will be at least 4 inches deep.If your agave plant is already growing and healthy, the pH is probably fine. If its leaves have become pale, the pH may be off or wrong. Test the soil again and adjust the pH until it is within an acceptable range.
Add elemental sulfur to the soil to bring it down if the pH is above 6.8 or add lime to bring it up if it is below 6.6.
Use 12 ounces of lime to raise the pH of 25 square feet of soil by .5, or from 6.1 to 6.6, or about 2 ounces of aluminum sulfate to lower the pH by .5, or from 7.2 to 6.7. Mix the lime or aluminum sulfate into the top few inches of soil. Then, water it in thoroughly to adjust the pH before planting the agave.

, Full sun exposure is a very important for the proper growth of your agave plant. These plants need at least six hours of direct sunlight every day and will thrive in direct sunlight all day long.


Agave plants that do not get enough sunlight will grow very slowly or not at all and their leaves will become pale.

, Give the plant about 3 gallons (11.4 L) or 1 inch of water each time you water it using a soaker hose, a watering can or a garden hose. Reduce the amount of water you give your plant if it rains or during a rainy season.If you use a watering can, pour the water slowly so it soaks into the soil instead of running off the top without soaking in.
You can gauge the amount of water delivered with a soaker hose by putting a 1-inch deep can right next to the agave. A tuna can or small cat food can works well. When the can is full, shut off the soaker hose.

, Agaves are extremely drought tolerant and rarely require any supplemental water after they have been growing for two years.As well, overwatering your plant will cause root rot so do not water the plant during winter.

, Sprinkle 1 to 2 ounces of a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 8-8-8 over the soil around the agave, being careful not to get it on the plant. Wash the fertilizer into the soil with a few gallons of water.


If any fertilizer gets on the leaves of the agave, it will burn them. So wash off the fertilizer on the leaves right away with clean water.

, The drain holes will allow oxygen to reach the roots and ensure the soil does not stay wet for too long.

, Plant your plant in a mix made of mostly sand and perlite, with a little organic matter and soil for nutrients. You can find cactus mix at your local garden center.

, Agave plants flourish in continuous direct sunlight so find a spot that gets a lot of direct sunlight for six hours or longer.


You can keep your plant outdoors in the summer and spring when there is no danger of frost or cold temperatures. Bring your contained plant indoors when temperatures begin to drop below 50 °F (10 °C)., Pour the water evenly over the soil until it runs out of the bottom of the container. Empty the saucer underneath the container so the water does not soak back up into the soil and make the soil too wet.

, Use a fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 8-8-8.Only give your plant fertilizer after a regular watering. Giving an agave plant fertilizer when its soil is dry could burn the roots.


You can also use water-soluble, houseplant fertilizer diluted at a rate of about ¼ teaspoon per gallon of water.
Do not give your plant fertilizer during the winter. As well, during the winter, you should reduce watering of the plant to only once a month.

, When the container becomes full of roots, blocking the soil and water, it has become pot-bound.Repot the agave once it becomes pot-bound in a new pot that is no more than 1 inch larger than the old pot or container.

, Weevils are the most common pests of agave plants. Adult agave weevils are brown and about 1/2 inch long. Female weevils lay their eggs in the base of agave plants and the white grubs then hatch and feed on the plant tissue. If an agave is attacked by weevils, the only solution is to remove the plant and throw it away.


Healthy Agaves are much less susceptible to weevil attacks than agaves that are stressed by a less-than-ideal growing environment and improper care, so always maintain your agave to ensure they do not acquire these pests.

, These insects attach to agave leaves and suck the juices out of the leaves.You can remove them by scraping them off the plant with your thumbnail or by putting some isopropyl rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball and wiping them off with the ball or swab.

, You can do this by hand or by catching them in a tuna can filled with beer, where they will drown. Slugs and snails are actually attracted to beer so you can sink a tuna can of beer into the soil around your agave plant until the top edge of the can is at ground level and the slugs and snails will leave your plant and head into the can instead.Check the can in the early afternoon two or three times a week and throw away any caught slugs and snails before re-filling the can with beer.

, Yellowing, shrivelled leaves that are easy to break off is a sure sign of root rot.If your plant displays these symptoms, use a shovel to dig up the agave and check its roots. Healthy roots will be white and firm. Rotted roots will appear gray or black and mushy.


If your plant still has a healthy set of roots, try replanting it and watering it less.
If your plant’s roots are all mushy, remove and replace your agave plant with a new one.

, The thick part at the base of the plant, considered the heart of the agave, can actually be baked and eaten.As well, the fresh, young leaves, seeds and even the flower stalks of the agave can be roasted and eaten.


The most commonly grown species of agave, known as a century plant or Agave Americana, is not safe to eat, as it contains multiple compounds that can make you sick.Several other agave species can be toxic when eaten, as the sap can burn or irritate the skin and mouth, cause swelling in the throat and difficulty breathing. Eating certain species of agave can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.
Desert agave, also known as Agave deserti,Parry’s agave, also known as Agave parryi, and Utah agave, also known as Agave utahensis,are a few agave species that are safe to eat.

, The sap of the agave plant can be used in poultices to treat skin infections and inflammation, and you can rub the juice of the plant on cuts or wounds as an antiseptic to help heal them.Agave is a close relative to Aloe Vera and the two plants can be used interchangeably for medicinal purposes., Fibers from agave leaves can be used as thread and the thorns of the agave can be turned into needles. In fact, the fiber of agave leaves were traditionally used to weave fishing nets, hammocks, and baskets., Agave is currently sold as a sugar alternative because it contains 90% fructose and has a low glycemic index.Though its use as an effective alternative to refined sugar for individuals with diabetes or those looking to cut down on their sugar intake is disputable, agave is currently sold as a sweetener., These alcohols are made by distilling the fermented juice of the agave plants. By Mexican law, tequila can be made from only one particular type of agave, blue agave, and can only be produced in designated geographical areas, primarily the state of Jalisco in west-central Mexico.Mezcal is made from the fermented juice of other species of agave and is produced throughout the majority of Mexico.

, Change the water each day.

, Plastic containers used for starts will allow for easy transplanting later on. Fill the container with soil and place the seed approximately 3/4 of an inch (2cm) or less below the surface.

, Depending upon your weather, you can place it outside or in a greenhouse.

, When at least one leaf has appeared, you can transplant it. If you have a variable climate, you may want to wait until it is more established to plant it in the ground.


If you have been germinating the seed in a low-sun area, you will need to move it into the sun and slowly increase the number of hours of sunlight. If not, it will burn in the sun.

, Queen palms have shallow, grass-like root systems, so other features, such as concrete or structures can be placed fairly close to it. The queen palm also likes a small amount of shade.,, It should be the depth of the top and no deeper.

, Add sand or Canadian peat moss if the soil doesn’t drain well.

, Loosen the palm from the pot and then place the plant and the soil from the pot in the hole. Fill in the area around the plant with more soil mix.

,,, Water every other day for the next week. Use a bubbler or soaker to ensure that the ground stays moist.

, You will generally want to water three times per week in the summer and twice per week in the winter. Due to its grass-like structure, it must be watered more than most trees., The following are good guidelines:


With temperatures below 85 (29 Celsius) you can water one to two times per week.
With 85 to 100 degrees (29 to 38 Celsius) you can water two to three times per week.
With temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), you should water four to five times per week., Use a slow release blend that contains magnesium, iron, copper, manganese and nitrogen.

, A healthy queen palm can grow up to six feet (1.8m) per year once established. It can grow to the height of 30 or 40 feet (9 to 12m).

, This is an indication that your plant needs manganese. This is unlikely to be native to the soil, so you will need to add more manganese to the soil at the first sign of this condition.

Water and fertilize the plant.,
Prevent disease.",How to Grow a Sensitive Plant2," Mimosa pudica or sensitive plants prefer warm, sunny, indoor locations (like in a window) with temperatures between 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C).


The sensitive plant can survive outdoors in the summer (in hardiness zones 9 to 11) but it has a tendency to spread and become weedy.

, The sensitive plant should be watered regularly to keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Try to use loamy soil for improved drainage, as this can prevent root rot.


During growing season, fertilize the sensitive plant approximately every two weeks with a diluted high-potassium fertilizer.

, The sensitive plant is not particularly prone to disease, but it may become infested with some common pests, such as red spider mites, mealy bugs and thrips. These can be removed by spraying the plant with a direct stream of water.


Avoid using insecticidal soaps, as these can turn the leaves of the plant black.

,, Well-rotted compost is a nice top dressing, but will not provide all the nutrients your houseplant requires. You should fertilize your plant every two weeks to a month or so in summer, but not in winter.

, Alternatively, you can use nursery ties to stake the tree.

, It is braided like a typical 3-strand braid. Either prune off side branches or incorporate them into one of the three main strands. You'll only want to braid the new wood, which is flexible enough to bend into the braid. Do not force your tree limbs or they will break. To keep the new braids from becoming too loose, you can use nursery ties.

Water your garden well and cover with bark mulch.",How to Grow a Bed Head Garden," Choose a smaller area to start your bed head garden, rather than an entire yard. If you go with too large of a space, you might exceed your budget and abilities.Starting small will also help get your neighbors accustomed to your garden’s natural look. Some homeowner associations discourage bed head or natural gardens, and some local ordinances ban or set limits on natural landscaping.
If you have any concerns, call your local government office or neighborhood association and ask about applicable codes.;
, Keep track of your garden area over the course of the day. Note which areas receive the most sun and which remain shaded, and choose plants that are appropriate for your site conditions.If a patch of your garden receives at least six hours of sun, go with plants that do best in full sunlight.
Choose plants that thrive in partial sun or shade for areas that receive less than six hours of sunlight.
To fully understand your garden’s light conditions, it’s best to make observations over the course of the year. Light conditions will vary as the sun’s position changes from season to season.

, Visit a local nursery or home improvement store and look for plants that are native to your location. Since they’re adapted to your climate, native species will require less watering and maintenance. Call your state or local government’s natural resource department or a nearby nature center for help finding a reputable nursery that offers native plants.Plants will be marked full sun, partial sun, or shade to help you make appropriate choices for your light conditions. You should also go with various heights to add aesthetic interest.
For example, you could choose Foxgloves, a mid-height wildflower native across Europe for color.For groundcover, you could go with a locally native fern or ivy. Finally, you could add height with a tall grass, shrub, or tree, like Paul’s Scarlet, which is a shrub or small tree native through continental Europe., The number of plants you’ll need to purchase depends on your garden’s size and your coverage expectations. If you want immediate coverage, you can purchase more seedlings and plant them a few inches away from each other. To reduce your cost, you can wait a season or two for full coverage and plant your seedlings ten inches apart.

, A short fence, edge of low plants, or garden divider can all serve to frame your bed head garden. If you maintain a lawn, you can mow and edge it around your garden area. For a more natural look, use the borders to create gentle curves around your planting area instead of framing it with straight lines., Consider using a hardscaped walkway if your planting area is larger and you need a pathway through it. A path will help prevent anyone passing through the space from picking up ticks that might be hiding in taller plants.Use natural materials for your walkway, like natural stone, wood steps, or bark mulch.When you clear out the planting area, designate a space for the path. Use a rake to spread mulch in a two inch layer, or position wooden or stone steps to create a walkway.

, Before you start planting, think about testing your soil to find out its pH and nutrient levels. You can use a do-it-yourself kit available at a home improvement store or nursery to find out the pH and get a rough idea of nutrient levels. A DIY will likely suit your needs well, but for a more thorough analysis, you can send a soil sample to a nearby garden center or soil-testing lab.Testing your soil will let you know if you need to make your soil more or less acidic and if you need to add nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus.

, Use a grub hoe to scrape away weeds and other undesirable plants from the garden. Work around any existing plants you want to incorporate into your garden, and take care not to disturb their root systems. Compost or bag and discard the plant matter you’ve scraped away., An organic material like compost or peat moss will help you improve your soil’s fertility and drainage. Add one to two inches to cover the garden. Your soil analysis will help you determine which other amendments to add.For example, if you need to add acidity, sprinkle a layer of used coffee grounds over your garden. Your plants’ information sticks will tell you if they prefer acidic or low-acid environments and whether they require high or low nitrogen levels.

, Use a roto-tiller or garden fork to work through and loosen the existing soil and to blend it with any amendments you’ve added. Till through the topsoil about six inches deep.A power roto-tiller will make the work easier. If you don’t have one, the most affordable option would be to rent one from your home improvement store.

, After tilling the soil, start planting your shortest plants first, like ferns, ivy, and other low creepers. These may include plants that define your garden’s edges and groundcovers that form its bed. Use a hand trowel to dig a hole large enough for each seedling’s root ball.Space your plants according to your coverage expectations. For immediate coverage, space them two or three inches apart. To lower your cost, space them about ten inches apart.
Try massaging or loosening the root systems a bit to encourage them to grow.

, Once you’ve planted a row of groundcovers and edging, proceed to add your mid-sized woodland flowers. Dig a hole to accommodate each plant’s root ball with your hand trowel. Place your seedlings in regular intervals across your garden according to your cost and coverage needs.Be sure that your flowers and shrubs will receive enough light for their needs. Most flowering plants require lots of sun.

, If you’re purchasing larger shrubs or small trees, look for specimens with unblemished bark and strong, evenly spread branches. Dig a hole for the root ball, and cover the bottom with compost or manure. For most trees, the top of the root ball should be level with the ground.Stake a newly planted tree for about year after planting by tying a short stake 1.5 feet (45 cm) in length at a 45 degree angle to its trunk. The nursery or home improvement store will carry stakes and tree ties.   

, Water your newly planted seedlings thoroughly, so the soil is saturated, to encourage root growth. When you’ve finished watering, cover areas around each plant with an inch-deep layer of mulch, and take special care to cover any trees’ planted area.Mulch will help retain moisture and keep away undesired weeds.
Water two to three times per week for several weeks until the seedlings start to develop coverage. If you’ve chosen native plants, rainfall in your area should be adequate to sustain them once they’ve established themselves.

Decide what you like best about the garden.,
Pick out plants to grow.,
Choose a space for the garden to expand into.,
Get gardening supplies.",How to Grow a Garden1," Gardens are personal. Everyone has a different approach, and factors like space, climate, and your own aesthetic determine what type of garden will work for you. Some people have gardens that are a mix of vegetables and flowers, and other people have gardens that are dominated by one type of plant. Choose the balance that makes the most sense for you.


Do you want to be able to eat what you grow? Perhaps adding more vegetables is the right choice. You could also have a smaller herb garden and still enjoy your plants in the kitchen.
If adding color and beauty to your yard is your primary desire, expand your garden by adding flowers.
If you live in a hot, dry climate, you could have a succulents garden.;
, Now that you've decided how you want to develop your garden, it's time to pick out plants. Here are some other factors you'll need to take into account:


Your climate. The plants you pick out must be able to thrive in your particular growing region.The temperature, humidity, and seasons have a big effect on plants.
The conditions in your yard or growing area. Do you have full sun all day long, or is your yard mostly shaded? What plants are currently thriving in your garden or backyard? Try adding new varieties of plants that are already doing well.
Your soil's chemical makeup. Get a soil testing kit and figure out your soil's pH and acidity levels. Some plants do well in all types of soil, while others need specific conditions.Talk with an employee at a local garden store or nursery to get more information about what grows well in your area.

, Look for an area that's relatively free of large rocks, roots, trees, and other objects that could make it more difficult to till the soil and plant a garden. Choose a spot with good soil drainage and sunlight.Choose to make the garden a geometric shape or plant it along a border or the natural curve of your yard. Consider the space in your garden as a resource and find ways to use it more efficiently as you expand and grow your garden.


Vegetable gardens usually require a lot of sunlight, while some flower gardens to better with partial shade. Figure out what conditions you need for the specific types of plants you're growing.
Plan to have the garden within view of your home, so you can enjoy it from the window.
Anyone can have a garden - even those without a yard. If your soil isn't great, you can have a raised bed garden, and if you don't have much space, try a container garden.
Expanding your garden can be as simple as breaking ground near your existing garden or re-arranging what is already there to make your space more efficient.

, Expanding a garden requires a lot of different equipment and supplies, but after you invest in gardening tools you won't need to spend as much in the years to come. Determine which of the following supplies you'll need for the type of garden you're growing. Simple hand tools are fine for small gardens, but anything larger than a few yards squared will be easier to handle with bigger machines.


Buy seeds or seedlings. Check out your local nursery or order from a catalog. Seeds are usually started indoors a few months before the planting season begins, while seedlings should be purchased just a day or two before you plant them. Seeds are more cost effective, especially if you are scaling up your garden.
Get the type of fertilizer you need for the plants you're growing. Fertilizer like bone meal, blood meal, or compost adds nutrients to the soil that help plants grow healthy and strong.
Mulch and topsoil are required to protect some types of plants in the early stages of growth.
Basic gardening equipment like a shovel, spade, and garden rake are required. You can pick these up at a hardware store.A soil tiller is very convenient for larger gardens as it can save you effort and time when breaking new ground. Tillers are used to break up the soil until the texture is fine enough for new plants to penetrate. Consider renting one to do the heavy work, and maintain your garden area with hand tools
A garden hose may not be strictly necessary, but you'll need one unless you want to tote water from the indoor faucet to the garden. Alternatively, you can install a sprinkler system. Electronic timing devices can save even more time by automating when they turn on and how much water they use.
For vegetable gardens, you might want to consider getting fencing supplies to create a small barrier that will keep out animals who want to eat your crop.

Plant at the right time.,
Prepare the garden area.,
Create garden beds and rows.,
Plant the seedlings.,
Water the garden.",How to Grow a Garden2," In addition to making sure your plants have the correct growing conditions, you've got to plant them at the right time of year. Some seeds won't germinate until after the last frost, for example. Others thrive when they're planted while it's still cold, and still others must be planted in the fall so they have all winter to get ready to sprout. Know your plants, and create a schedule so you make sure you plant at the right time.


If you're starting plants from seed, you might need to start the seedlings indoors a few weeks or months before it's time to put them in the ground.
Seedlings should be purchased a few days before you're ready to plant them. The sooner you can put them in the ground, the better. If it will be more than a week before you can plant them, wait to buy your plants.

, Go outside and mark the corners of where your garden is going to be with stakes or survey flags. Clear away rocks, sticks, yard decorations, and any other objects in the garden area. Pull out large weeds and make sure the grass is mowed short. Use the soil tiller, a shovel, or garden fork to break up the ground, and toss away large clods of dirt and grass. Till the soil again, to a depth of about 12 inches (30.5 cm).


Clear away rocks that are buried in the soil as you till.
Till compost or fertilizer into the soil if necessary for the types of plants you're growing.

, Beds and rows allow you to organize your garden to help with tilling and caring for the plants. Raised beds can even help drain the soil more efficiently. Measure out your garden beds and pathways, and mark them with survey flags or stakes. For a more precise outline, run a string between stakes. Shovel soil from the pathways onto the beds to create raised beds.To mark the pathways, line the pathways with mulch., Dig holes at the appropriate depths for the plants you're growing. Make sure they're spaced about 6 inches (15.2 cm) apart, or more for plants that require a lot of space. Place the seedlings in the ground so that their roots are inside the holes you've made, but the stems and leaves are above ground. Fill in the area around the roots with extra dirt or topsoil, and pat it gently around the stems to hold the plants upright.


If your plants require special fertilizer, scatter it in the holes you dug before you place the plants in the ground.
If your plants require a top cover, scatter mulch, straw, or topsoil around the roots to keep them safe from low temperatures and wind.

, After planting, the first thing you should do is lightly water the garden, making sure it is saturated with water but not soaking wet. A newly planted garden should never dry out, so check it every day to make sure it stays nice and damp. Water the garden in the morning, rather than at night, since unevaporated water could cause mold to grow in the garden.

"
Provide adequate water.,
Fertilize as necessary.,
Weed the garden.,
Keep animals and insects out of the garden.",How to Grow a Garden3," Continue watering the garden every day according to the specific needs of the plants you are growing. Both overwatering and underwatering can be detrimental to the plants' lifespan, so do your best to give each plant the amount of water it needs, no more and no less.

, Some plants require extra fertilizer a few times throughout the growing season; others are fine after they're put in the ground. It's up to you to figure out what type of fertilizer your individual plants need, and make sure they get enough nutrients to grow tall and strong.


Over fertilizing plants can actually harm them, so make sure you don't use more than they need.
Natural fertilizers are preferable to chemical fertilizers, which can be detrimental to the soil over time.

, Every week or so, you'll need to get on your knees and pull up the weeds. Left to grow wild, weeds will crowd out your vegetables and flowers, taking the nutrients and water from the soil. Grasp weeds close to the roots and pull gently to remove them from the ground, roots and all. Weeds will grow right back if you tear them off at the stem and leave the roots in the ground.

, Deer, rabbits, squirrels, beetles, spiders, and many other types of animals and insects will be as excited about your new garden as you are. If you see signs that your garden is being invaded, you may need to take measures to protect it by putting up a fence or using methods to keep insects away. Look for bite marks on leaves, holes in produce, or other signs of pest problems.


Before you take action, make sure there's definitely a problem. A snake in the garden, for example, is a sign that your plants are healthy. Spiders can keep the insect population down. You don't need to get rid of creatures that aren't actually causing harm.
Use organic methods to keep creatures out, rather than resorting to pesticides. Pesticides are indiscriminate when it comes to what living things they harm; they aren't much healthier for humans than they are for bugs. Methods like spraying bugs off leaves with a water bottle are less harmful to the environment than chemical sprays.
A good way to keep insect pests at bay is to plant 20% of your garden area with flowers to attract beneficial insects. This will let natural predators do the work for you. Some pest repelling plants include basil, sage, geraniums, chrysanthemum, and flax."

Water the fern generously two days before digging it up.,
Dig up an outdoor fern with a shovel.,
Use your fingers to get an indoor fern out of its pot.,
Rinse the soil off the roots gently with a hose or under a faucet.,
Examine the roots to determine if they are rhizomatous, clumping, or spreading.,
Divide a fern with rhizomatous roots by cutting the rhizomes apart.,
Divide a fern with a clumping root system by cutting them into sections with a sharp knife.,
Divide a fern with a spreading root system by working it apart with your fingers.,
Repot or plant the new divisions right away.,
Mist the new divisions every morning for one month to ensure they get enough moisture.,
Always divide outdoor ferns in the fall or in early spring.,
Always divide an indoor fern in the spring once its container is full of roots.,
Keep in mind that the type of fern you have will determine it's hardiness.",How to Divide Ferns," Make sure your fern is well-hydrated as the plant’s ability to absorb moisture will be diminished for a week or two after it is divided because its root system will be compromised., Push the shovel straight down into the soil about 6 inches away from the fern stems, all the way around the fern. Then, push the shovel in again and lift the fern up out of the soil on the tip of the shovel.

, As an indoor fern may be difficult to get out of its pot, you can grasp the fern’s leaves at the base gently between your fingers and tip the container upside down. The fern should drop out of the pot.If the fern does not slide out easily, tap the container against the edge of a counter or table to work it loose.

, You want to avoid ripping or tearing the roots so also wash them off carefully and on a gentle or low stream of water., There are different methods for properly dividing your fern depending on your fern’s root structure. Rhizomatous roots are thick, underground stems from which smaller fibrous roots grow. Your fern may have sections of thick, fleshy roots with fine roots growing from them. Ostrich ferns (Matteuccia struthiopteris) are commonly grown ferns with rhizomatous roots.Once the soil is washed off, the fern’s roots may appear as a mass of fine, fibrous roots growing from the center of the fern. These are clump-forming roots. Royal fern (Osmunda regalis) is one of the fern species that has a clump-forming root system.A spreading root system is somewhat similar to a clumping root system but the roots originate from all over the entire underside of the fern rather than just the center. Sword fern (Polystichum munitum) is a commonly grown species that has a spreading root system., Each division must have at least one rhizome with healthy fibrous roots and several leaves.

, Position the knife between the leaves over the thick, fleshy crown and push the knife down through the crown. Each division must have a section of the crown where the roots originate and several healthy leaves.

, Each new division needs to have a few leaves with a healthy mass of roots attached. If a few roots remain attached between two sections, snip the connecting roots with scissors., Be sure to only repot or plant healthy divisions.


Discard the dead centers from clumping ferns and damaged or diseased rhizomes with dark, mushy, unhealthy-looking sections.
Water the newly-planted or potted divisions generously right after planting them. Pour the water evenly over the potting soil until it drains freely from the bottom. Be sure to water them again when the top of the potting mix begins to dry., It takes time for the fern’s roots to recover and begin absorbing enough moisture so misting them each morning will help your plant get through the repotting phase.


If your fern starts to drop their leaves, this is a sign they are not getting enough water. So if this occurs, increase how often you water them.

, The best times to divide outdoor ferns are in the fall when they lose their leaves after the first hard frost or very early in the spring when they begin to send up new shoots.

, This indicates that your fern has become pot-bound or has outgrown its container. Dividing the fern will allow you to cultivate new ferns to replace the pot bound one.


Be very careful and gentle if you do any spring divisions of your fern as you don't want to damage any of the fern’s tender leaves.

, While ferns are generally hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 3 to 12, their level of hardiness varies greatly from species to species.


The Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides)is able to survive winter temperatures down to -40 degrees Fahrenheitwhile Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata), one of the most common houseplant ferns, is hardy only in Zones 10 to 12."

A cashew nut grows in a shell attached beneath a fruit or apple.,
Enjoy your cashew plant.

",How to Grow a Cashew Nut in a Pot," Remember, cashew plants grown into trees, so buy your pot keeping this in mind. Place pebbles near the hole with a small net.;
, You can buy potting soil or you can make it by mixing garden soil, compost, coir or coconut fiber, limestone, sand and fertilizers.

, Make sure the roots are free and firmly placed on the soil. Cover the roots with more soil till the pot is full. Press down with your hands.

, Remember this is a plant of the tropics. Never keep it inside air-conditioned rooms. Water often and keep the soil moist, especially in the first few weeks. Fertilize about twice a year (especially during flowering and nut development) with nitrogen,  phosphorus and zinc.

, when the fruit turns red, it indicates that the nut is ready. Remove the entire thing or pick it from the ground if it has fallen. Remove the nutshell from the fruit. Send the nut for processing or remove the shell yourself with precautions. The juices from the shell are known to cause irritation in a lot of people. See video below.

Feed grass and gardens with granular fertilizer.,
Use liquid fertilizer for potted plants.",How to Feed Plants1," Fertilizer that comes in granular form is easy to sprinkle around the lawn and garden. Since you don't have to work it directly into the soil, it has to be reapplied every few months. To help the fertilizer last longer, use a garden rake to sift it into the soil in your garden beds.


Commercial fertilizers are labeled with an N-P-K ratio noting the level of each substance they contain. If you're just fertilizing grass, choose a fertilizer that is particularly high in nitrogen, since that's the nutrient that helps plants grow lush and green. If you're fertilizing flowering plants or bulbs, choose a fertilizer high in phosphorus, since it helps flowers bloom.For a vibrant lawn, use granular fertilizer just after planting new grass seed. You can sprinkle it by hand or use a dispensing tool to spread it evenly across your yard.
Controlled release granular fertilizer can be useful if you have a large lawn that you don't want to worry about fertilizing more than about twice a year. The granules are designed to release fertilizer slowly and gradually.;
, Fertilizers that come in spray or pour bottles are convenient for all potted plants.


Pour or inject the recommended amount around the roots of the plants. The plants will absorb it immediately and you should see the results within a few days.
Too much liquid fertilizer can be harmful to plants, so don't use more than the amount recommended on the bottle.

Understand the four approaches to succession planting.,
Keep it simple for your own home garden.,
Know which crops grow when.,
Harvest one crop then plant the next one straight away.,
Stagger plantings of the same crop.,
Be aware of which plants should not be planted in the same soil following a harvested crop.",How to Do Succession Planting," They are:Planting the next crop straight after one crop is harvested. In this case, the seasonal growth requirements of the first and second crops need to coincide with the planting and harvesting times.
The same crop but planted in a staggered manner. Rather than planting the whole crop at once, it is seeded in stages, so that plants from the crop mature at different weeks.
Intercropping and companion planting. Planting two crops that are not related and don't compete at the same time in the same place, in a pattern.
Same crop but different varieties of it that mature at different times.;
, These systems can be very complex but only if you know what you're doing and really, only if you need to do so for a commercial growing business. For home, keep it simple as suggested in the following steps.

, The success of succession gardening relies on knowing the growing times of each crop. Some plants are perennial (all year round in temperate zones) while other plants grow only part of the season, others require the whole season to grow, and some plants can be pushed hard into late autumn and winter. If you have mild winters, you can grow more crops than someone living in a place with harsh, snowed-in winters, so use your seasons wisely according to where you live; with harsher winters, you'll need to be more aware of early-cropping varieties that can be harvested before the frosts set in.

, This method should be done using a crop that reaches maturity in mid-summer, so that there is plenty of time to grow a crop that will thrive from mid-summer into autumn/fall.


Harvest the crop and turn over the soil. Any plant material left behind can be incorporated into the soil unless it is diseased or mildewy, in which case it needs to be removed and consideration should be given to solarization of the soil.
Add some fertilizer. This could be well-rotted manure, compost, or whatever usual fertilizer you prefer.
Even up the soil. Use a rake or similar to even it out.
Sprinkle seeds over the soil and pat in according to the instructions for the seed type. Pat down.
Water the seeds. Germination should be fast as this is during the warm summer months. The weeds will also grow well, so be sure to remove them constantly.

, This method allows you to retrieve the crop at various stages of maturity. This is great for a continuous garden salad and it's ideal for those running a cafe or restaurant using homegrown foods. It works well for lettuce and other salad vegetables, many herbs, and so forth. Some plants not suitable for this method include peppers and tomatoes; anything that takes a long time to mature won't be such a good stagger crop.


Plant some of the seed initially when its planting season starts.
Two weeks later, plant the next lot of seeds. And repeat this in two week lots.
Thin seedlings as specified for the particular plant.
Enjoy the varied attention that the plants need; you will be dealing with them at different stages, so the work needed in the veggie patch will be varied, and therefore interesting and faster for each task.

, Incompatibilities, soil depletion, pathogens, and disease are possibilities when some plants are planted following others, so it is important to know what not to plant. For example, beans should not be followed by onions and garlic, and beans and onions should not be followed by tomatoes.

Know the law.,
Comply with state regulations and restrictions.,
Comply with federal laws.,
Comply with international laws.,
Select the seeds you want to germinate.,
Consider different growing methods.",How to Germinate Cannabis Seeds1," Recreational and medicinal marijuana use is legal in 4 states (Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington) and Washington D.C.,whereas marijuana can only be possessed and used for medically prescribed purposes in 19 states.It is important you familiarize yourself with state laws and regulations before attempting home cultivation. In a search engine, type the ""state name"" plus ""marijuana laws"".;
, Cannabis cannot be grown at home, and can only be obtained with a prescription from a licensed physician from licensed dispensaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, and Washington D.C. In Nevada and Arizona, you can only cultivate at home if you live 25 miles or more from a dispensary or receive a hardship waiver.Most states do not allow marijuana use for any reason by individuals under 21 years of age.How many plants you can grow (ranges from 0 to 24) or how much marijuana you can possess at a time (ranges from 1 oz to 24 oz; 10 to 60 day supply) varies by state. You can be fined or arrested if you do not comply.Most states require you to sign-up and pay a registration fee that can range from $15 to $200., Federal laws supersede state laws. The Department of Justice continues marijuana enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act.It is illegal to grow or possess marijuana on public or federal lands, or distribute it to a minor.

, Countries outside the U.S. have their own laws and regulations when it comes to growing and possessing cannabis. Research laws in your country to avoid fines or even imprisonment.Countries where it is legal to grow cannabis include: Colombia (20 plants), Czech Republic (5 plants), Spain, and Switzerland (4 plants). In all these countries, cannabis can only be grown for personal use (medical or recreational) and cannot be sold or transported out of the country., Cannabis contains over 70 cannabinoids that produce a psychoactive effect in humans, the strongest being delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinal (THC). THC is produced as a sticky resin on the surface of plants. Levels of THC vary based on: part of the plant (buds contain the most followed by the leaves, stems, and seeds), growing conditions, and subspecies.There are three subspecies of cannabis differentiated on the basis of cannabinoid content: sativa, indica, and ruderalis.Most seeds provided by commercial suppliers are ""feminized"", meaning they are treated with hormones or cloned from female plants.Male, or staminate, plants do not flower. Thus, only female, or pistillate, plants are capable of producing usable cannabinoids.
Untreated or organically grown seeds will produce 50% male (staminate) and 50% female (pistillate) plants.
Sativa and indica are the most common types of cannabis grown for recreational or medicinal use. Most plants grown today are sativa-indica hybrids.
Indica hybrids are known for their pain-relieving and calming properties, and are good for growing indoors as they only grow 2-3 feet tall and have a diameter of 12-18 inches., Growing cannabis indoors is notoriously energy inefficient and can increase you electricity bills more than 10%.Your seeds will have to be germinated indoors. However, if you plan on replanting outside, you should start your seeds by late-March to early-April at the latest.The growing season for cannabis in the northern hemisphere runs from early May to October.
You want to give plants a headstart and gradually acclimate them to outdoor climates by growing indoors under fluorescent grow lights for 2 to 3 weeks after germination.
Expect germination to take from 2 days up to 2 weeks.
The benefit of growing plants indoors is that you can control temperature, light, and humidity, and they can be grown year-round. Additionally, most states require cannabis to be grown inside in a secure location."

Use manure, bat or poultry waste.,
Use bone or blood meal.,
Nourish the soil with compost.",How to Feed Plants2," Cow manure has long been one of the most popular ways to fertilize plants. You can also buy boxes of bat guano, which contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, at many nursery and farm supply stores. Poultry waste is also a popular choice among farmers and gardeners. Sprinkle the substance around the roots of the plants you want to feed.

, These substances, made from the ground bones and blood of animals, contain high amounts of nutritious nitrogen and phosphorus. They are available from farm supply stores and nurseries in bags or boxes. Sprinkle meal around the roots of your plants.You can fertilize plants as you're planting them by sprinkling meal into the holes you dig during planting time.
Try mixing meal into your vegetable planting bed before planting seeds or seedlings, then adding more to the topsoil after everything is in the ground.
Most farmers and gardeners find that using an animal-based substance provides the best nutrition for plants, but if you're squeamish about using bone or blood meal, you could also try cottonseed meal.

, Working compost into your garden bed or potting soil goes a long way toward keeping the plants fed and healthy over time. It's still a good idea to fertilize them from time to time, but the nutrients contained in compost provide a good foundation for healthy plants.


You can make your own compost by collecting vegetable peelings and other food scraps in a compost bin.
Compost is also available for sale at nurseries.

Feed plants when you plant them.,
Feed plants every few months.,
Feed plants when they look distressed.",How to Feed Plants3," Any time you're planting a new garden bed or even potting a houseplant, it's a good idea to fertilize it to give it a head start. Work compost into the soil, sprinkle meal into the holes you dig, or scatter granular fertilizer over newly tilled ground.Remember that nitrogen helps stems and leaves grow strong, phosphorus fosters a healthy root system, and potassium gives plants a healthy shape with beautiful blossoms. Each type of plant has different needs, so conduct research or ask an expert at your local nursery if you're not sure exactly what to feed your plants.

, Try not to wait until a problem crops up before feeding your plants. Keep track of when they were last fertilized and plan on feeding them again every few months during the growing season.

, If your plants have yellow or brown spots, limp leaves, or other problems, they are likely to be undernourished. You can buy fertilizer sprays that are intended to help immediately revive plants that are in distress.

Obtain necessary materials.,
Soak cannabis seeds in distilled water.,
Evaporate chlorine from tap water.,
Place seeds in distilled water and store in a dark, warm place.,
Check the seeds regularly (at least once a day) for evidence of germination.,
Plant your germinated seed.",How to Germinate Cannabis Seeds2," This method is often preferred because you can use basic items found around your house. You will need:


Feminized cannabis seeds.
1 to 2 gallons of distilled (nonchlorinated) water.
A clean jar, preferably ceramic.
A warm, dark place to store seeds.
Tweezers (do not handle seeds with hands).
pH test kit.
Good potting soil.
Seed tray with 1x1 inch cells or plastic cups.
Compact fluorescent Lights.Grow light timer.

, Cannabis seeds require constant moisture and an ideal temperature of 70-90 degrees to germinate.Check water pH with test strips. Optimal pH is 6.2, with a range of 5.8 to 6.5., Fill a clean jug with tap water and let stand at room temperature for 24 hrs. to allow the chlorine evaporate out.Alternatively, you can purchase distilled water from a grocery store or plant nursery.

, Once the water has been distilled and is at or above room temperature (ideally 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit), the seeds can be dropped in the water. Store the jar with water and seeds in a warm, dark place such as a kitchen cupboard.


Replace the water every few days.
Place a ceramic plate over the jar of water to help retain heat.

, You will know your seed has germinated when the seed splits and produces a tiny taproot. At this point, remove the seeds from the water for transplanting in soil.


Your seeds should germinate on average in 2 to 5 days, though some varieties may take up to 2 weeks.
If a seed does not sink, it probably is not viable and will not germinate. Try planting it anyway and see if it eventually germinates and sprouts., Once you observe the seed split and rootlet appear. Fill the 1x1 inch cells on a standard plastic seed tray with good potting mix. Use tweezers to remove seeds from water and plant in seed tray, planting one seed per cell about 1/4 in (0.75 cm) down in good potting mix. Plant so the taproot is facing downwards.


The soil should be moist. Avoid over watering or allowing the soil to dry out.
Do not pack down soil - you want to keep the soil above the seed loose so it can push through to the surface.A sprout should appear within 2 days. At this stage, place under a fluorescent (T5, T8, or T12) grow light positioned 2 to 4 inches about the surface of the soil. Set timer to to a 24 hour vegetating light cycle. Switch to a 16 hour on/8 hour off light cycle once leaves appear."

Feminized cannabis seeds.
1 to 2 gallons of distilled (nonchlorinated) water.
2 clean dinner plates.
1 roll of paper towels.
A warm, dark place to store seeds.
Tweezers (do not handle seeds with your hands).
pH test kit.
Good potting soil.
Seed tray with 1x1 inch cells or plastic cups.
Compact fluorescent Lights.Grow light timer.

, To distill water at home, fill the container you will use to soak the seeds with tap water and let it sit in the open for 24 hrs to evaporate chlorine. You can also purchase distilled water from a grocery store or plant nursery.


Test the pH of the water with pH test strips.It should measure between 5.8 and 6.5. You want pH of water and soil to be as close to ideal as possible to ensure proper germination.The seeds will float at first, but eventually sink. You can give the seeds a little tap with the tweezers to help them sink. If they still float after 24 hours, they might not be viable (able to germinate).

, Use distilled water at room temperature to moisten the paper towels. Drain-off excess water.

, Use tweezers to remove seeds from water and place on moistened paper towel. Cover these with two additional moist paper towel sheets. Then, place a second dinner plate over the paper towels and seeds. This will help keep the seeds warm.


Keep the seeds covered and store in a warm, dark place. Ideally the temperature should be between 70-90 degrees Fahrenheit for the seeds to germinate.
Check seeds and paper towels regularly. Re-moisten the paper towels as needed, making sure to drain any excess water.

, After about 5-6 days (though it may take longer depending on the variety) you should observe a small white taproot extending from one end of the seed. Fill a small plastic cup or seed tray with good potting soil and water until saturated.Use your finger to create a 1/4 in (0.75 cm) hole and drop your seeds in with the taproot facing down. Cover with loose soil - do not pat or tamp down soil over the seed.
Use a spray bottle to ensure the soil remains moist, but not inundated.
A sprout should appear within 4-6 days, and seedlings should have leaves after 10-14 days.
Set tray or plastic cups with seedlings under a fluorescent (T5, T8, or T12) grow lamp positioned no closer than 2-4 inches above the surface of the soil. Set grow light to a 24 hour light cycle. Germinated seeds and seedlings require 24 hours. This can be reduced to 16 hours of light once the seedling produces leaves."

Obtain necessary materials.,
Stabilize and hydrate Rockwool cubes.,
Prepare Rockwool cubes for seeds.,
Cover tray with clear plastic dome or saran wrap.,
Transplant sprouted seeds.",How to Germinate Cannabis Seeds4," Rockwool cubes are better at retaining water than paper towels, you can maintain a constant pH, and they are easier to transplant after sprouting.


Feminized cannabis seeds.
Set of 1 inch Rockwool cubes.
Small pointed object such as a toothpick or clean nail.
Metal or plastic tweezers.
Waterproof tray to hold water and cubes.
Tweezers (do not handle seeds with your hands).
pH test kit.
pH balancing chemicals (lime juice, pH Up/Down, Phosphoric Acid)
2-liter bottle with plastic lid.
A warm, dark place to store seeds.
Good potting soil.
Seed tray with 1x1 inch cells or plastic cups.
Compact fluorescent Lights.Grow light timer.

, Rockwool has an alkaline pH of 7.8, which is too high for cannabis seeds that prefer a more acidic environment (pH 5.5 to 6.5).Fill a bowl with tap water or distilled water. Use test strips to measure pH of water.


You may have to acidify (decrease the pH value) of the water by adding lime juice or pH down. Add this to water in very small increments (a few drops at a time) and remeasure pH with test strips. Repeat until you reach ideal levels. If the pH of the water goes below 5, you will have to discard it and start over, or increase it with pH Up.
Soak Rockwool cubes in water for 1 hour.
Remove Rockwool cubes from water. Do not squeeze or drain water - Rockwool is designed to maintain ideal air to water ratio for several days.
Do not discard water. Pour into a 2-liter plastic bottle or spray bottle and reuse for watering.

, Place soaked cubes in a waterproof tray. Some cubes come with preformed holes, but if not use a pointy object (clean nails work fine) to create a 1/4 inch (0.75 cm) hole in one side.Make sure the hole is wide enough for the seed to fit.


Place 1 cannabis seed in each hole, use a toothpick or tweezers to gently push it down to the bottom.
Cover the hole with a small piece of Rockwool to create a dark, moist environment.

, This will help maintain a humid environment by trapping moisture and retaining heat. Place covered tray with cubes 2 to 3 inches under a 40 Watt fluorescent tube. Leave the lights on 24 hours.It should take between 24 hours and 10 days for a sprout to appear.


Place a thermometer neck to the tray, underneath the dome or saran wrap. Monitor the temperature, ensuring it does not go below 70 or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
Cannabis seeds do not require light until their sprouts penetrate the top of the cube. However, it is good to have a light source set-up and ready for when they do sprout - especially since you cannot monitor the seeds 24/7.
Check Rockwool cubes 2-3 times a day. Re-moisten them with the pH-balanced water (stored in a 2-liter plastic bottle) if needed. Spray or trickle water onto the cubes until you observe it soaking through and coming out at the bottom. The cubes should be damp, not drenched., After 2-3 weeks, the roots should begin poking out of the Rockwool cube. You want to transplant your seedling before the roots begin to tangle. Cut 1 1/4 inch wide by 1 inch deep holes into a slab of Rockwool. Remove the 1 inch Rockwool cubes, being careful not to touch or damage the roots (you might want to use tongs for this part), and place in holes you already cut out in the big Rockwool slab.


If the cube does not fit (too small), gently remove it and widen or deepen the cut. Do not try to force the cube into a hole that is too small.
The cube should not sink down into the hole or be lower than the surrounding surface. It is better if the cube sticks out a bit rather than sinking in. This prevents water from pooling that can cause stem rot."

Place your Hoya near a window.,
Hang sheer curtains if you place your plant in front of a south-facing window.,
Give your plant additional sunlight to help it bloom.,
Let the potting soil dry out almost all the way before watering a Hoya plant during the spring, summer and fall.,
Water Hoyas in the morning.,
Dump the excess water out of the saucer beneath the container.,
Let the potting mix dry completely before watering your plant in the winter to encourage the Hoya to have a rest period.,
Recognize signs that your plant is being watered too much, or has rotted.",How to Get a Hoya Plant to Bloom1," Sufficient light is one of the most important contributing factors when trying to get a Hoya to bloom.The ideal location indoors is right in front of a window facing east or west where it is exposed to two to four hours of direct sunlight.


Your plant should also be exposed to bright, indirect light during the rest of the day.;
, It can also be placed in front of a window that faces south, as long as there is a sheer curtain between the plant and the window to help diffuse the hot, direct sunlight.When the plant is left in a south window all day without a sheer curtain for shade, the leaves will scorch, becoming very pale or tan.

, If the Hoya plant is over three years old and is still not blooming, try giving it one or two more hours of direct sunlight each day.


Other signs that the Hoya is not getting enough light are new leaves that are small and pale green, long sections of bare stem, slow growth and dead mature leaves.

, Use water that has been left sitting in an open container for 24 hours or more.Leaving the water to sit allows the chlorine and fluorine, chemicals found in tap water that can harm a Hoya plant, to dissipate into the air naturally.The water will also be at room temperature which is better for Hoyas. Fresh tap water is very cold and could stress these tropical plants.

, This allows the plant to retain its moisture during the day. Distribute the water over the potting soil evenly until it begins to drain out of the drain holes in the bottom of the container.

, If left in the saucer, the excess water could wick up into the container and keep the soil too wet.


Wet soil deprives the Hoya roots of oxygen and encourages root rot.

, A winter rest period helps Hoyas bloom the following spring or summer.

, Hoya plant leaves will turn yellow and drop if it is being watered too much. Water it less often. If the leaves continue to turn yellow and drop, turn the container on its side and gently slide the Hoya out of the container. Shake the potting soil off the roots to get a good look at them.If they have black tips or the whole root is black or brown and mushy, the Hoya has root rot. If most of the roots are rotten, the plant should be thrown away.
If only a few are bad, repot it using peat-based potting soil that contains perlite or vermiculite for improved drainage. Be sure to use a container with drain holes. Water it immediately but then let the soil become completely dry before watering again.If the plant shrivels, it is not being watered often enough. Water it more often.

pH test strips.
pH balanced water (pH 5.5 to 6.5) in a spray bottle.
Saran wrap.

, Purchase a soil mix that is entirely organic, such as Sunshine Mix or Pro mix, as many commercial blends contain too much nitrogen or phosphorous.If you purchase a soil mix, check the bag to make sure the pH is between 5.5 to 7. Cannabis does not like alkaline (high pH) soil.Choose a soil mix that drains well. Mixes that drain well often contain a one-to-ten ratio of sand, sponge rock, or pearlite. You can also purchase pearlite separately and mix it in, or add porous materials such as rice hulls or pumice.You can also purchase a mycorrhizae mixture to add to store-bought soil. This is a fungus that is beneficial to plant root growth.
If you create your own soil mix rather than buying commercial potting mix, it needs to be sterilized to kill fungus and parasites. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Fill a non-plastic oven safe container with unsterilized soil, making sure it is no more than 4 inches deep. Cover it with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from over and set aside to cool. Do not remove aluminum foil until ready to use., Once you prepare you soil mix, and sterilize it if necessary, use it to fill peat cups. Use your finger to make a small 1/4 inch (0.75 cm) deep hole in the center of the cup. Drop a single cannabis seed in the hole and loosely cover with soil.Place peat cups in waterproof tray. Using a spray bottle filled with pH-balanced water (between 5.5 to 6.5), moisten but do not drench the soil. Stop watering if you notice water seeping out of the cups into the tray.


Use saran wrap to create a dome over the tray. You can place a cup in the center of the tray or use toothpicks to support the plastic dome.
Once the seeds have been planted, place the covered tray with cups under a 40 watt fluorescent light positioned 3 inches above the tray. Leave on 24 hours until plants begin to sprout.
Check soil 2 to 3 times a day to make sure it is moist. If needed, spray with pH-balanced water.

, Cannabis germination and growth can be affected by environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, insects, bacteria and fungi, and ultraviolet radiation.Set a thermometer next to the peat cups under the saran wrap dome. The ideal temperature for germination of cannabis seeds in soil is 90 degrees Fahrenheit.Once they sprout and produce leaves, you can decrease the temperature to 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.If you notice insects, remove them manually with your hands as soon as possible to prevent an infestation.

Give the Hoya plant 5-10-5 water-soluble houseplant fertilizer once a month in the spring, summer and fall.,
Do not give your plant fertilizer in the winter while it is resting.,
Dilute your fertilizer.,
Look for signs that your plant is getting too much, or not enough, fertilizer.,
Give the diluted fertilizer to the Hoya right after watering.",How to Get a Hoya Plant to Bloom2," Getting the right fertilizer ratio, 5-10-5, is important when trying to get the Hoya to bloom.The number in the middle (10) is phosphorus which promotes flowering. It should be higher than the first number (5) which is nitrogen because nitrogen causes stem and leaf growth. The third number (5) is potassium which supports light absorption. It should be about equal to the first number.

, Begin fertilizing again in the spring to give it the nutrients it needs to grow and bloom.

, The usual dilution rate is 1 teaspoon in a gallon of water but it may be slightly different, depending on the fertilizer you choose.


Check the label on the bottle and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.

, Pale leaves and stems and a slow growth rate are indications that the Hoya is not getting enough fertilizer.If that occurs, increase the frequency to twice a month.


When the Hoya is getting fertilizer too often, the new leaves are darker green and smaller and the stem length between the leaves becomes shorter. Reduce the frequency to every five to six weeks if that happens.

, Giving fertilizer to a dry Hoya could damage its roots.

Do not repot the Hoya until the container is full of roots.,
Repot your plant with peat-based potting soil.,
Leave the flower stem on the Hoya after the blooms fade.It will bloom again on that same stem.",How to Get a Hoya Plant to Bloom3," There should be very little soil left. When it does need to be repotted, move it into a container that is no more than 1 inch larger than the old one.

, Put 1 inch of potting soil into the new container, gently remove the Hoya from its old container and set it in the new one.


Fill in around the roots with potting soil and water it generously to settle the soil and give it a good drink.

, The faded flowers can be snipped off with sharp scissors just below the flower.

Keep a lookout for aphids.",How to Get a Hoya Plant to Bloom4," Hoyas are occasionally bothered by mealybugs and scale insects.They are small, flat, oval, immobile insects and are commonly white, tan or brown.

, If they do attack, rub them off with your thumbnail or dip a cotton ball in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol and wipe them off the plant with that. Check beneath the leaves and along the stems.

, Aphids may also try to make a meal out of a Hoya. They are small, oval, soft-bodied insects that are most often green or red, although they can be nearly any color.


If they attack, set the Hoya in the sink or tub and wash the aphids off with a strong spray of water."

Use a soil moisture meter.,
Look for standing water at the bottom of the container.,
Check to see roots at the bottom of the pot are rotting.,
Look for green, yellow, and brown leaves falling off the plant.,
Test soil drainage.,
Watch to see if the plant is wilting.,
Check to see if the soil is damp 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) deep.,
Provide 1 inch of water (2.5 cm) per week to vegetables.,
Read about the specific plant.,
Provide water based on the native environment of the plant.,
Ask an expert or someone at a nursery.",How to Determine How Much Water Plants Need," Purchase a moisture meter and stick it into the soil near your plant. Leave the meter there and use it to monitor the soil. The meter will indicate whether the soil is dry, moist, or wet. Most plants will thrive if the soil is somewhat moist.

Some meters have a 1 to 10 scale on them. The numbers 1 to 3 indicate dry, 4 to 7 indicate moist, and 8 to 10 indicate wet. Many plants tend to do well in the 4 to 5 range.
Once you’ve determined the optimum moisture range for your plant, use the meter to stay within it.;
, If your plant is in some sort of container, check to see if there is a lot of water built up at the bottom. Pooled water is a tell-tale sign of overwatering. This is important, as too much water at the bottom of the container could cause root rot and other problems., Tip up the plant container or dig down to the bottom of the plant. If you notice that the roots are brown, grey, black, or slimy, they’re probably oversaturated with water. Instead, healthy roots should be white, solid, and crisp., If the soil is moist and you notice leaves falling off the plant, you may be overwatering it. In this event, the best course of action is to reduce the amount of water you provide your plant., If you're working with plants in the ground, you'll need to do a little work to make sure your soil drains properly. To do this, dig a one foot deep hole in the ground. Fill the whole with water and allow it to drain. Then, fill the hole with water again and time how long it takes to drain. Your results will give you an idea of how well the soil drains:

If the water drains in less than 4 minutes, most trees and plants should do okay there.
If the soil drains in 5 to 15 minutes, most trees and plants will thrive.
If the soil drains in 16 to 60 minutes, plants that need well-drained soil will need a lot less water than in other soil.
If the soil takes hours to drain, only plants that grow in swamps or along bodies of water will do ok., Wilting leaves and stems may be a sign that you are underwatering your plants. Wilting leaves usually appear limp, weak, and seem to hang downward. Healthy leaves should appear crisp and firm. Ultimately, if your plant is wilting, you may need to give it more water.While it is more likely a sign of underwatering, wilting can also be a sign of overwatering. To properly determine whether wilting indicates underwatering or overwatering, consider other factors such as soil moisture. Usually, if the soil is dry and the plant is wilting, it needs more water.

, As a rule, the soil for most plants should be somewhat moist about 3 to 4 inches deep (7.6 to 10 cm). This is important, as you need to make sure moisture reaches the roots of the plant. If the soil is not moist below 3 or 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm), your plant may not be getting enough water., If you’re growing in some sort of container or in a garden bed, provide about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week. If you’re in an arid climate, provide 2 inches (5 cm). In addition, if you’re in an extra hot environment, add about ½ (1.25 cm) for every 10 degrees above 60 degrees. It is okay if this water is provided artificially or through rain.

Calculate the average temperature of your area by adding the daytime high and the nighttime low. Then, divide this by 2. For example, if the low is 60 and the high is 80, you’ll compute the average temperature as 70 degrees. If you’re in a temperate climate, you’d want to provide 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of water per week.
Measure rainfall or water provided by sprinkler by using a rain gauge., Find a book or visit a website that has information about the specific plant you have a question about. For example, if you’re concerned about providing enough water to your tomato plants, find a book on tomato plants (and the variety you intend to grow) and see what the book suggests.

General gardening books may also be very helpful. Some good books include ‘’Vegetable Growing Month by Month,’’ ‘’New Wild Garden,’’ and ‘’The Well-Tempered Garden.’’, Determine where a given plant is native to. Then, provide water based on that environment or ecosystem. For example, if a plant is native to a tropical region and you live in a semi-arid environment, you’ll need to provide a lot more water to it than to plants that are native to your region., If you have trouble providing enough water to a plant, you may want to contact someone who has experience dealing with it. Nursery employees, arborists, or plant biologists may be able to provide insight into how much water a specific plant needs."
"
Decide on your gardening goals.,
Research your favorite crops.,
Take note of incompatible plants.",How to Companion Plant1," Different companion plants will offer different advantages to your favorite crops. Decide how you want to boost your plants and choose a companion plant from there. The main advantages offered by companion plants are:Nitrogen fixation – some plants will feed nitrogen into the soil, which benefits other plants around them and makes fertilizer unnecessary.
Pest control – some plants may discourage pests or protect plants that are normally attractive to these pests. Alternatively, these plants can attract beneficial insects that keep pests at bay.
Pollination increase – some plants attract pollinators, which can benefit other plants in their vicinity.
Shelter or support – companion plants can serve to shelter or support other plants (e.g., by providing cover from the wind).
Flavor improvement – some plants can improve the flavor of other plants simply by being in close proximity with one another.;
, Read more about your favorite crops for insight or clues about what companion plants would benefit them. If you have friends or neighbors who garden, ask them for advice about companion planting and note any experiences they may tell you about. For other ideas, consult gardening resources such as:

Gardening books or magazines
The Farmer's AlmanacCompanion gardening apps (e.g.,Gardening Companion, a free app available for Android and iPhone)

, While companion plants may share a mutually beneficial relationship with other plants, there are also a number of ""antagonist plants"" that will hinder the growth of other specific crops. For instance, potatoes and asparagus do not grow well together because they compete for the same nutrients in the soil. Research your crops well and avoid any combination of antagonist plants in your garden."
"
Germinate seeds.,
Choose strategic spots in the garden for your companion seedlings.,
Transplant the seedlings.,
Monitor the companion growth.",How to Companion Plant2," Fill planter trays with all-purpose compost, mist the compost with water, then drop seeds from your companion plants onto the surface. Add another layer of compost on top and cover the trays with cling wrap, polythene, or a piece of glass to keep them moist and warm. Monitor the trays daily until seedlings emerge., Before planting your companion plant seedlings in the garden, plan where to position them for optimal growth. Plant tall plants in front of low, sun-sensitive plants to block them from the sunlight. Plant pest-repellent plants next to other plants that are frequently ravaged by such pests (e.g. planting garlic nears roses to ward off rose pests)., Dig holes large enough to accommodate the seedlings and rake a handful of compost into the base of the holes. Gently push the seedlings out of their trays from the bottom, leaving as much compost around the root as possible. Insert them into the holes and fill the space around them with an even mixture of soil and compost., Observe how your companion plants grow together and how they complement each other. Record your companion plant combinations in a journal and note how well they grew together. Keep track of how long it took for your plants to grow, what yields you had, and how long the crops lasted during their growth season."

Install a bird bath.,
To encourage birds to use a new bird bath, add stepping stones and rocks to bring the bathing depth to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) rather than the typical two or three inches in commercial baths.,
Change the water regularly.,
If you add an ornamental pond, construct at least one side of it with a shallow wildlife-friendly beach rather than a steep side.,
Add a waterfall or fountain to attract more wild visitors with the sound of moving water.,
Surround your ornamental pond or bird bath with native perennials appropriate to your region of the world.,
Protect habitat.",How to Get More Wildlife Into Your Backyard," One of the most important additions to your garden is water. All living creatures need water in some form or another. Here in the Midwest we are blessed with natural sources of water such as rivers, lakes and ponds. In residential areas, however, sources of clean water are rare. Birds and other ""critters"" will flock to bird baths and ornamental ponds.;
, Birds are afraid of drowning and will readily drink from shallow baths while standing on stones.

, Use a mild bleach solution to scrub the bird bath if it gets dirty. Rinse thoroughly and refill. Use an electrical element designed for this purpose to keep the bird bath functional during cold winter months. The birds will flock in large numbers when most water is iced over.

, Add rocks and pebbles so that the birds and animals will approach to drink and bathe.

, A simple, lo-tech drip system involves more labor but almost no cost. Take an old gallon milk jug and poke a tiny pin-hole near the bottom and another air hole near the top. Suspend it from a tree branch or shepherd's hook so that the slow drip falls into the bird bath. Refill as needed.

, Search the internet for a list of local native plants and add a few each year, or divide with friends, until you have a thriving native garden.

, Native butterflies are endangered in many areas due to loss of habitat. We all know that bees are similarly threatened. Anything we can do to add native flowers to migration routes and habitats will give the butterflies and bees a boost of nutritious nectar along the way.

Choose plants that attract butterflies and hummingbirds.,
Stagger flowering times when planting a butterfly and hummingbird garden.,
Offer shelter.,
Plant generous clusters of a few choice plants.,
Opt for vibrantly colored flowers when choosing plants for your garden.,
Provide a source of water.",How to Create a Butterfly and Hummingbird Garden," Since the nectar from flowers is their primary source of food, select nectar-rich plants to lure butterflies and hummingbirds to your garden. There are some plants that are better suited for 1 species over the other. For instance, hummingbirds' long beaks and tongues can reach to the depths of cone-shaped flowers, whereas butterflies prefer flowers with more of a flat surface. However, many flowers are available that attract both species. Bee balm, columbine, cornflower, fuchsia, impatiens, goldenrod, lupine, phlox, pinks and zinnia are a few of the many flowering plants that attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Even naturally growing flowers that some might consider weeds like dandelion, jewelweed and queen Anne's lace attract butterflies and hummingbirds.;
, This will provide food for the animals and ensure that your garden is visited by butterflies and hummingbirds throughout the entire growing season. If you plant only flowers that bloom during 1 part of the spring, summer or fall, the animals will go elsewhere to find food during the other times, leaving your garden barren of their beauty.

, Hummingbirds and butterflies are a cautious couple. They prefer a habitat where they can quickly find cover from danger. They even take cover from a passing cloud or too strong of winds. Select shrubs for your garden to both block the wind and provide a quick hiding place among the leafy branches. Hummingbirds will also use these for their nests. The butterfly bush is a good choice. An added bonus to selecting this shrub is its long blooming cycle. Azaleas, lilacs and rose of sharon are other flowering shrubs you could choose. Flowering vines like morning glory and trumpet vine also provide places for refuge.

, Once you have chosen some plants that appeal to you and are known to attract hummingbirds and butterflies, plant large patches of each type of flower instead of scattering 1 plant here and there throughout the garden.

, Both hummingbirds and butterflies are attracted to oranges and reds.

, Butterflies will land on the surface of puddles or bird baths. Hummingbirds enjoy being near water as well, though they prefer a light mist. Both hummingbirds and butterflies need water to drink and to bathe in.

Move large quantities of matter or large plants using a wheelbarrow.",How to Know What Gardening Tools You Need," A shovel will dig and remove soil or sand from the ground to prepare for plants and crops, and will also help you remove vegetation from the ground after it has been planted.;
, A shovel and spade may look similar in appearance; however, a spade has a straighter and sharper head that allows you to cut underneath heavy sod or even into sidewalk ice.

, A garden rake has strong aluminum or steel tines that will break up lumps of dirt and evenly distribute small stones and pebbles across the surface of a garden.


Turn the garden rake over so the tines are facing upward, then use the tool to level out the soil so you can effectively plant seeds and other types of vegetation.

, The tines of a leaf rake are lightweight and made from a flexible material such as plastic, rubber, or bamboo, and can help compile leaves, twigs, and other light debris in your garden.

, A garden fork looks like an enlarged version of a kitchen fork, and can be used to turn and aerate clay in addition to soil. This tool is also strong enough to work fertilizer and other matter into your soil.

, These tools will allow you to cut weeds carefully out of the ground, especially those that are close to your plants.

, A trowel resembles a small hand shovel, and is ideal for creating small holes that seeds can be placed into.


Remove shallow breeds of weeds using a trowel instead of a hoe or hand weeder to avoid digging deeper than necessary and disrupting the soil around your plants.

, A tiller is a high-powered tool that loosely resembles a lawn mower, but is used to prepare the ground for gardening in large-scale areas.


Use a tiller if you are planting rows of crops or vegetation that cover a wide expanse of area.

, Small gardens or potted plants can be watered with a watering can; whereas large gardens or yards will require the use of a watering hose, watering wand, or a sprinkler.

, A wheelbarrow can be used to transport soil, mulch, compost, large plants, and other gardening matter from one location to another within your garden.

Store your tools properly.,
Consider storing your tools in a bucket of sand and mineral oil.",How to Clean Your Rusty Garden Tools," Cleaning your garden tools helps to prevent the spread of infection through the garden from one diseased plant to another. It also helps to keep them rust-free, as clean tools tend to be exposed to less moisture.


It may seem fussy, but wiping your pruning blade with a full-strength household cleaner (such as Pine-Sol or Lysol) between cutting each piece of plant matter will help to prevent the spread of infection.
It’s especially important to clean your tools if they have been in contact with setting agents such as concrete that will dull the edge of spades and blades if left to harden.;
, Keeping garden tools sharp will make them safer easier to use. Although it seems counterintuitive, a sharper blade can be safer as it requires less force and is less likely to slip.


Additionally, when cutting through the cells on your plant with something like a pair of secateurs, a sharp blade will cause less cell damage and won’t crush as many cells as a blunt blade.
This will help the plant heal faster, which lessens the risk of infection setting in from fungi or the weather.

, First you need to remove any dirt or debris from the tool, especially the blade area or any fixings. Water and a fairly stiff brush should do fine for this.


Don’t delay if you've been using the tool for any setting or drying agents such as cement, sealant or paint. If your tool has any setting agents on it then it will need to be cleaned quickly before these have a chance to dry.
After using the brush to get the dirt off, rinse in running water and leave to dry. This can take as long as overnight if the tool has complicated surfaces which retain moisture.
Afterwards you can wipe a light coating of mineral or motor oil over your tools.

, A solvent such as kerosene or a household cleaning agent such as Scrubbing Bubbles will work to clean off residue from sap – this is useful if you’ve been pruning evergreen trees and shrubs.

, As you're cleaning, it’s good practice to inspect the tool for any damage. In general, you should avoid using any damaged tools as these can be unsafe.

, If your tools are rusty, try soaking the metal parts in a weak vinegar solution (1:1) for 24 hours. Try using a cheap distilled white vinegar from the grocery store for this.


Remove them from the solution and wipe down with paper towel to dry them, then clean the rust off with steel wool.
Heavily rusted blades may need a second soaking after the first layer of rust comes off.

, Some gardeners swear by a 3 % citric acid solution instead of vinegar – this is good for making up large quantities for cleaning large parts and tools. Be sure to clean the residue away with plenty of clean water after soaking.


Citric acid is available in small quantities in the grocery or winemaking store or try your local agricultural store as it’s used by pig keepers (and may be cheaper to buy in quantity there).
Avoid this method if you are cleaning parts such as brakes or engine blocks as they can become brittle in the citric acid solution.

, Other gardeners recommend using very strong black tea or even cola instead of vinegar to remove rust.


Soak your tools in it, then rub them clean with a rag or wire wool to remove rust.
You can also try using some scrunched aluminum cooking foil and a little water to take the rust off.

, Light circular motions, repeated for as long as necessary, are the best way to remove rust without thinning or scratching the metal beneath.


You are advised to wear protective gloves, eye wear and a face mask while doing this.
It’s also a good idea to make sure your tetanus vaccination is still providing protection.

, After removing the rust, it’s a good idea to sharpen the tools. There are a few options for sharpening tools: you can use a whetstone, flat file or sharpening steel.


If you are using a whetstone, start by wetting it thoroughly. You can use mineral/motor oil if you prefer instead of water. Without pressing especially hard, stroke the whetstone in one direction along the side of the edge.
Replenish either oil or water as required if the stone surface dries out. You might like to switch to a finer grade of whetstone finish to get a final precision edge.

, Test the sharpness on a small piece of plant such as a stem from the bonfire heap (don’t use your finger!). If it’s sharp enough, lightly oil the tool making sure the oil transmits into any mechanism and store carefully away.

, Cleaning your tools properly and regularly will stop rust from developing in the first place. It’s also important to prevent them from being wet for prolonged periods of time. Never leave tools outside as they’ll rust quickly if exposed to the elements.

, Once you've cleaned your tools, let them dry thoroughly before storing in a dry place such as a shed. Try to avoid congesting them together in a box or van as this can blunt the edges. It’s best to store them separately. Consider making a hanging rack in your shed.

, Some gardeners recommend cleaning your tools in water, letting them dry, then plunging them into a bucket filled with a mix of sand and mineral oil to store them there. This is supposed to prevent them rusting.

Know when to hoe.,
Hoe when the soil is dry.,
Stay as upright as possible.,
Use a sweeping motion to slice off weed tops.,
Cut the weed stem just below the soil.,
Exercise caution and aim for accuracy.,
Change hands frequently while hoeing.",How to Hoe Weeds1," Hoeing weeds is an important part of managing flowerbeds, vegetable gardens, and fields. You should always hoe weeds at first sight. Waiting until the weeds take over your garden will make hoeing more difficult., The best time to hoe is when the soil in your field or garden is as dry as possible. This creates what some gardeners refer to as dust mulch, which can help prevent new weeds from germinating. Try hoeing your garden early in the morning, before you water the plants., Before you begin to hoe, stand tall. Pick up the hoe by its handle and stand it on the ground beside you. Take notice of your upright position. Try to maintain as close to an upright position as possible while you hoe. This will make the process easier on your back., Grab the hoe and make sweeping motions over the tops of weeds, much like you would do if using a broom to sweep a floor. Make broad, fluid sweeping motions to slice the tops off the weeds., You should aim to sweep your hoe just below the surface of the soil. This will result in cutting off the tops of the weeds at this level, which can prevent future weed growth., It is important that you are precise and cautious while hoeing weeds. An accidental sweep to the right might result in an accidental chop to your favorite flowers. Make sure the hoe passes easily and precisely between the rows of plants, and does not disturb your flowers or crops.

, Hoeing weeds can be hard on your hands, arms, and back. Try to evenly distribute the labor on both sides of your body. You can easily do this by switching hands and arms frequently while hoeing.

"
"
Make sure the hoe is the right height.,
Control young weeds with a lightweight scuffle hoe.,
Keep large weeds under control with a field or grub hoe.,
Use a short handle hoe in tight spaces.",How to Hoe Weeds2," You should be able to stand upright while you hoe weeds. Make sure the handle of your hoe is long enough to allow you to stand while using it. If the hoe forces you to hunch over while hoeing, try to find a hoe with a longer handle.

, If you want to control young weeds that are popping up in a large area or amongst your rows of plants, try a lightweight scuffle hoe. A diamond, triangle, or stirrup hoe will work best on young weeds., If you are dealing with large weeds, you can use a variety of hoes to get the job done. Try a field or grub hoe. You can also use a Warren hoe or a standard American garden hoe. These hoes can also be used to make furrows and chop compost., If you need to perform spot weeding, or if you need to remove weeds from a tight space, a hoe with a short handle will work well. You can also try using a circular hoe, collinear hoe, or any other hoe that is mounted on a short handle."

Gather all the containers that need cleaning.,
Wear appropriate clothing.,
Remove the debris with the stiff brush.",How to Clean Plant Containers1," Throw away any containers with cracks, chips or signs of weakness.Terracotta containers which are cracked or broken can be used as broken pieces at the base of plant containers to help with drainage.;
, Wear protective gloves. Wearing gloves is important when cleaning plant containers because you will be handling bacteria, fungi and bleach. You do not want bleach to irritate your skin. Wear old clothes in case the bleach solution splashes on them. Also, wear goggles to avoid getting the solution into your eyes. , Scrubbing off the debris removes as much loose dirt as possible from the pot. Removing this superficial dirt will accelerate the soaking process."

Brush the dirt off your gloves after use each time.,
Wash occasionally.,
Turn your gardening gloves inside out when one starts to wear.,
Store them neatly and flat.",How to Make Gardening Gloves Last Longer," This helps prevent them from stiffening up and becoming too hard to use. It also helps prevent general wear and tear.;
, It is a good idea to hand wash your gardening gloves now and then. This removes dirt and brings back their suppleness.

, Change hands. One of the gloves usually wears out more rapidly before the other.

, Always unfurl gardening gloves before storing so that they lay flat. Put them somewhere that they won't be crushed by other objects or lost. Pin together to prevent losing one accidentally; a clothespin or peg is ideal for keeping them together and stops spiders etc. from crawling inside too.

Store your garden tools in a secure environment.,
Keep your tools out of the rain and away from damp storage.,
Wipe dirt off tools before long-term storage.,
Paint the ends of large tools with bright colours that don't match any garden plants.,
Oil joints regularly.,
Mend broken parts of tools quickly.,
Keep tools well ordered.",How to Keep Garden Tools in Great Shape," Garden tools are desirable objects and leaving them lying around can tempt fate. Always put them away after use and keep the area secure.;
, Tools subjected to dampness or rain over a period of time can rust and stiffen. The paintwork will also weaken when wet. Always wipe down tools that have become damp during use, and don't leave them to sit in the rain.

, This keeps them in great shape during the months that you are not gardening. Periodic wiping down when in regular use should be sufficient.

, This makes them easy to find if you drop them as you are working. It can be easy to forget a dropped tool at the end of the day and leave it languishing in the garden.

, Tools with screw and other joints should be kept well oiled on a regular basis to prevent seizing up and rusting.

, If you don't, they'll get avoided and will never get mended. Always check to see that mending is the cheaper option; occasionally a tool might be on sale for less than what it costs to mend the old one (recycle the broken one if you do this!). Uncurl kinks, unfold bends, stretch squashed pieces etc. Do this in a timely fashion so that the tool does not weaken. Equally, replace missing pieces, such as missing prongs in a rake etc.

, Label the storage place for tools so that you know where everything goes back. Use container baskets, hooks, shelves etc. for storage, as shown in the image.

Remove dirt and debris from tools.,
Dip or soak tools in a disinfectant solution.,
Dry tools.",How to Disinfect Gardening Tools," Before disinfecting tools, remove dirt, debris and sap by wiping the tools with a damp cloth or paper towels. The tools should be free of dirt and debris so the disinfecting solution can penetrate every cutting surface.;
, Many products can be used to disinfect gardening tools. Most products include basic household cleaning agents, however, commercially mixed gardening tool disinfectants are available at most garden centers. The amount of time necessary to dip or soak the tools varies depending on the disinfectant solution.


Choose a bleach solution to disinfect gardening tools. Mix 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water with 2 cups (.5 liters) of bleach in a bucket. Soak the tools in the bleach solution for about 10 minutes. Bleach solutions are highly effective in eliminating plant disease, but may corrode gardening tools with repeated use. Always wear protective masks and rubber gloves when cleaning tools with bleach solutions. Rinse tools immediately after soaking to avoid transfer of bleach to garden plants.
Use ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to disinfect tools. Ensure that the alcohol is at least 70 percent pure for effective disinfecting. Fill a bucket with enough alcohol to cover a single tool. Soak 1 tool at a time for about 1 minute each. If you prefer, you may wipe tools with the alcohol rather than soaking them. Do not rinse the tools after disinfecting. Alcohol is flammable, so keep it away from open flames.
Use detergent to clean gardening tools. A household detergent, like dishwasher detergent or laundry detergent, will remove viruses from garden tools. Mix about 1 cup (.2 liters) of detergent with 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Soak the tools in the detergent mixture for several minutes. Rinse with water after disinfecting.
Use Pine Sol to clean gardening tools. Fill a bucket with enough full-strength Pine Sol to cover a gardening tool. Soak the tool for 1 or 2 minutes. Pine Sol may be corrosive to gardening tools. Rinse with water after disinfecting to remove Pine Sol residue and keep the tools from corroding.
Choose a Lysol solution to disinfect tools. Fill a bucket with about 20 percent liquid Lysol and 80 percent water. Soak the tools in the Lysol solution for several minutes. Of the general household products used to disinfect gardening tools, Lysol is the least corrosive. Lysol poses little threat to garden plants, so you do not need to rinse tools after application.
Consider quaternary ammonium salts to clean tools. An effective disinfectant, quaternary ammonium salts are available through horticulture supply retailers or garden centers. Follow the directions on the product label. In most cases, the salts are mixed with water to create a cleaning solution. Hard water or organic matter may reduce the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium salts. Rinse tools after disinfecting.
Select hydrogen dioxides to clean garden tools. Hydrogen dioxide, often referred to as oxygenated water, is less toxic than many other cleaning agents, but removes a limited number of pathogens from garden tools. Commercial hydrogen dioxide products are available from garden centers and horticulture supply retailers. To use hydrogen dioxides to clean gardening tools, follow the label instructions. Hydrogen dioxides may corrode garden tools with repeated uses, so be sure to rinse tools thoroughly after application.
Consider environmentally-friendly products like Physan 20 or Oxidate. Physan 20 is a broad-spectrum fungicide, while Oxidate is a hydrogen dioxide-based product that kills bacteria, algae and fungus on contact. These products are more expensive than most household cleaning products, and are available at select garden centers and commercial agriculture retailers. Follow label instructions for information on how to apply Physan 20 or Oxidate to disinfect gardening tools.

, After disinfecting the gardening tools, dry them with a soft cloth. Do not allow water-based cleaning solutions to dry on the tools as they may rust the implements. In the case of pruning shears and other hinged tools, be sure to dry the inside and outside blades of the tool.

Determine what types of plants grow naturally in your climate to determine the style of garden you want.,
Consider how much sun and shade you have in your garden.,
Choose garden plants that create textures and layers.,
Determine whether you need to avoid potentially dangerous plants, such as shrubs with poisonous berries, if you have children or pets.

,
Visit your local gardening center and choose what to plant in your garden.

",How to Choose What to Plant in Your Garden," Though this isn't a foolproof way to guarantee a thriving garden, it will maximize the chances of the plants doing well without having to resort to artificial climate creation, such as a greenhouse. A Mediterranean garden with olive trees will be much harder to maintain in a cold climate, while an English rose garden will require a lot of extra irrigation in a warm climate.;
, Your neighbor's home, your own home and any outbuildings, as well as existing trees or shrubs, may cast shadows where you want to plant, so take this into account when choosing what to plant in your garden.

, This makes the garden more interesting to look at and offers more depth than garden plants that are all the same type or height.

Evergreen shrubs and trees offer color and structure all year round, which means that your garden will never look completely bare.






Trees add height, color, and interesting shapes to your garden. Deciduous trees are especially interesting to provide accents that change with every season, as they bud, bloom, and finally shed their leaves.






Shrubs can act as filler between trees or larger plants, and can be beautiful additions to your garden in their own right. There are evergreen shrubs and deciduous shrubs, as well as shrubs that flower.






Ground covering plants are sprawling and remain low to the ground. Consider how thickly and quickly they grow to determine how effective they will be in your garden.






Climbing plants, such as vines, provide texture and cover for walls, decorative elements, and any eyesores you want to cover.






Perennials bloom every year and come back each year. Annuals die after a year, and cumulatively cost more as you have to replace them every year.

Research.,
Decide which plants you'd like to collect.,
Choose plants that you know will thrive in your local conditions first.,
Do more research.,
Keep the plant collection within the confines of your time and energy.,
Seek out others with the same love of plants as you.,
Visit plant shows and garden exhibitions.",How to Collect Plants," Read a lot about the plants that interest you and about collecting plants in general. Read up on the experiences of other plant collectors to get ideas of what they did and any tips or tricks that they might have about collecting plants.;
, There are many plants in the world and it's likely that you have finite space, whether it be your indoor windowsill, balcony space, or a garden. Sticking to one species of plant makes good sense as you won't be able to cope with a collection that is too varied.

, It is best to get to know the needs of your plants well and to learn the ins and outs of cultivating and caring for them before branching out to rarer versions of the plants.

, Know what temperatures, light, water, etc., the plant(s) you've chosen prefers and find out how you can ensure these needs in your home environment. Think about whether you need to put in additional structures such as a shadehouse, a greenhouse, lighting, hydroponics, etc.

, It's important to only have as many plants as you have time to tend to them. If you have other interests, you will want to balance everything. It is also important to investigate what you might need to do when you're away from home, such as setting up timer systems to water your plants, or paying for someone to come around and care for them while you're away.

, Look for a club or a group that specialises in the plants that you're collecting. This is an opportunity to talk about the plants, trade specimens, and to help each other find the rarer ones.


Be aware that other collectors may draw your attention to new types of plants to collect and you could end up collecting several different species because they're all so attractive!

, This will introduce you to new ideas for display, to competitions, and to lots more information. It's also another excellent opportunity to meet other plant enthusiasts.

Place your ficus tree in a location with full light.,
Remove yellowed, dead leaves from the ficus tree as you see them.,
Water the ficus thoroughly, and then wait for the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil to dry out before you water again.",How to Care for Ficus," Ideally, it should receive 12 to 13 hours of sun every day.


Ficus trees don't do well with only indoor lighting. If you don't get enough natural light in your location, or if you need a supplemental light source during the winter, purchase a plant light and use it, on a timer, to ensure your ficus gets sufficient light.;
, This allows adequate sunlight to penetrate the growth to the remaining leaves.


Snip off dry, dead twigs for the same reason.
Ficus trees are notorious for dropping their leaves, sometimes over a span of months, when you place them in a new environment. All you can do is give the ficus consistent, appropriate care and pick up the fallen leaves to discourage pests. If your ficus is receiving adequate light and indoor temperatures, and you're watering correctly, the leaf-drop will eventually stop and the tree will generate healthy new growth.
Pruning isn't strictly necessary for a ficus tree. However, if it starts to grow out of control, prune each weak branch back to the intersection with a thriving branch (instead of leaving stubs). Some latex dripping from the cuts is normal; if you suspect you might be allergic to the dripping latex, wear gloves for protection.

,


Stick your finger down into the soil to check dryness/dampness before you water. If the ficus' soil is allowed to dry out completely, it'll drop its leaves.

Choose the right location.,
Give your plants the right amount of water.,
Keep your plants free of pests and dust.,
Fertilize if needed.,
Remove unhealthy growth.",How to Care for Your Plants1," Although you may have the perfect end-table or countertop in mind for your houseplant, you may need to rearrange things a bit depending on each plant’s individual needs. Find a location with good light, away from heat vents, air conditioners, radiators, and televisions. Do not place the plant between curtains and a window, since this makes temperature regulation difficult.South-facing windows provide the most light in the Northern Hemisphere, while north-facing windows provide the most shade. Switch these recommendations if you live in the Southern Hemisphere. East- or west-facing windows provide moderate sunlight in all regions.
Avoid placing your plant in a location where children or pets could easily knock it over.;
, Water is often the primary reason for a plant's death – either too much of it, or not enough. Make sure that your plant is getting plenty of moisture, depending on its type. For the most part, you want to make sure that the soil in your plants’ container is moist at all times, but not soaking; the soil should never be so dry it is crumbling.









Some plants, like succulents and cacti, require very infrequent waterings every few weeks.
In the winter months when the air is dryer, mist your plants with a spray bottle or use a humidifier to provide them with extra moisture without bogging down their roots in watery soil.

, Over time, your plants can become sickly and poor-looking as the result of dust buildup and insect pest infections. You can prevent health issues with your plants by cleaning them with a soft rag and organic insecticide soap every few months. If you notice that your plants seem particularly dusty or ill looking, take extra care and clean them a bit more often, moving them to a new location if necessary.


Don’t use a duster to clean your plants, as these can transfer bacterial pests from place to place and infect your plants all at once.
If insecticide isn’t your thing, you can gently wash your plants off with lukewarm water and the sprayer-head of your sink or shower.

, Occasionally it is helpful to fertilize your potted plants. You can purchase water-soluble fertilizers to mix in your watering can and apply as you water. Slow release fertilizers give you a little less control, but only need to be applied once or twice in a growing season.The choice of fertilizer depends on the plant species and its stage of growth.

, Although your plants are potted and indoors, that doesn’t prevent them from growing to a large size and becoming ill at times. Use a small pair of gardening shears to trim off excess growth and to cut away sick parts of the plant. This will not only keep your plant looking healthier, but also prevent them from turning into huge overgrown messes that take up massive amounts of space in your home."

Make sure your plants are getting enough sunlight.,
Water them on a regular basis.,
Make sure your plants are getting plenty of food.,
Keep weeds at bay.,
Dead-head and prune your plants when necessary.,
Kill off insects, slugs, and snails.,
Mulch your plants.",How to Care for Your Plants2," The most important thing for healthy plants is the perfect amount of sunlight. Some outdoor plants are sun-lovers, while others prefer more of the shade. If your plants are potted, move them to the right location depending on their species. If you are planting your plants in a garden, make sure they’re in a good spot or else relocate them to a better place which suits their needs.


You can look up the sun requirements for each plant by visiting a local nursery or checking online.
When in doubt, move a plant to a location that gets six to eight hours of sunlight per day.

, Outdoor plants tend to be a bit hardier than indoor plants (because they typically have to be indigenous), but that doesn’t mean that they don’t need plenty of water. Set up an automatic sprinkler system if you can. Water small to medium plants on a daily basis. Water trees and shrubs once a week.









Adjust your watering schedule to the weather. Skip a watering session if you've had significant rainfall, and provide more water in hot weather.
On the flip side, set up a drainage system if your garden plot seems to be flooding or having drainage problems.
Many plants have different watering needs in different seasons. They may need much less water during a dormant winter state.
If you’re not sure how much water your plants should be getting, look up their species online or visit a local nursery to ask.

, If your plants are looking a bit drab, they may not be getting the necessary nutrients from the soil. Visit a local nursery and see what plant food or fertilizer would be put to best use in your yard. You may add chicken manure or compost into the soil as a natural way to provide nutrients for your plants.









If you aren't sure about your soil quality, take a soil sample to an agricultural extension office or soil testing laboratory for testing. You can also purchase do it yourself soil testing kits.

, Weeding is a task few enjoy, but it is necessary in order to properly care for you plants and keep them looking healthy. Pull out all weeds from the roots, and check back on a regular basis to make sure they continue to stay away. It is important to weed regularly, as these unwanted plants can steal valuable nutrients and soil space that your plants need to be healthy.

, Although you may not want to cut back the size of your plants, it is important to cut off dead flowers and branches as well as sickly looking parts of your plants. Typically done after a growing season has finished, use a pair of garden shears to dead-head (cut off the brown flowers and leaves) your plants. If you feel you plants are getting too big, you can cut them back at this time as well.

, Nothing is worse than having a perfectly tended-to garden that gets destroyed by pesky bugs and slugs. Find an organic insecticide to use on your plants, or use predatory insects that eat the plant-eating bugs for an all-natural alternative.


For example, nematodes can be used to eat spider mites and ladybugs can be used to eat aphids - but neither will damage or consume your plants.To keep slugs and snails out of your garden, you can sprinkle crushed egg-shells around the perimeter. If you would rather kill them, a bowl of beer will do the trick.

, A 2–3 inch (5–7.5cm) layer of good mulch will help plants retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and keep down weed pressure."

, Papyrus is usually planted by rhizomes in moist, fertile soil in pots and then submerged in an aquatic environment, or it can be planted directly into 3 feet (0.9 m) of muddy soil to hold the heavy stems upright.

, Papyrus plant is suitable for United States Department of Agriculture zones 9 to 11. Mulching in zone 8 can help protect the roots but the foliage will mostly die in winter.

, Papyrus grass needs full exposure to sun for growth but can also be raised in partial shade. They also need to be sheltered from strong winds and for best effect they should be allowed to form a large colony. Papyrus can tolerate annual temperatures of 20 °C (68 °F) to 30 °C (86 °F)

, Treat papyrus with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half, every month in spring. Use the fertilizer during the time of watering to avoid fertilizer burn.

, Dig out the roots of the plant and remove the excess soil. If the plant was grown in a water garden pull the pot out from water and allow it to drain. After it drains, remove the plant from the pot and trim the roots. Cut the rhizomes which are discolored or damaged.

, You can cut the papyrus rhizomes into groups of two or three. Then repot the divisions and grow them as individual plants.

, Papyrus has no frost tolerance and should be moved indoors for the winter. Supply artificial light if you can't give an indoor papyrus plant enough sun during the winter.

, In the winter in Zone 8A and 8B it will totally die down, but if it is in a protected place, such as near the house, it always returns in the spring. It can also be rooted in water."

It is your choice to plant them in a pot, hang them outside, or plant them directly in the ground. Make sure that you choose an open space that allows room for the plant to grow.Place it in a space that allows 4 feet of height and 3 feet of width to grow.
Think carefully about the location because transitioning the plant from indoors to outdoors can be traumatic for it. If you do choose to change the location, gradually transition the plant during a course of two to three weeks. Start by moving it into a shaded area, like in a patio or under a tree. Then, move it into a place that receives more sunlight until eventually moving it into your chosen spot indoors.;
, This plant needs daytime temperatures around 50 to 75ºF (around 10ºC-24ºC). Night temperatures are best around 50 to 65ºF (10-18ºC). Choose a spot that maintains an average room temperature.Asparagus ferns can grow in places with moist or dry air, but they do best in a place with moist air.
To assure moist air, you can place a humidifier in a room adjacent to the room the fern is placed in., This plant will grow best in a place that has bright, but indirect lighting. It should not be placed fully in the sun. Too much direct sunlight will cause the needles to scorch and drop off of the plant.You will know that the fern is receiving too little sunlight if it the needles turn yellow.
Plant it in a place that benefits from the morning sun.

, Asparagus ferns do best in soil that is rich, light, and slightly acidic. The soil should also be well-drained. Add peat moss to your soil or buy a peat moss planting mix. Peat moss is the partially decomposed remains of several types of mosses that contribute to the right soil condition for your fern.Your soil is well-drained if water percolates through it easily. You can check this by digging a hole in your soil, filling it with water, and allowing it to drain. Your soil is well-drained if the water drops from 1 to 6 inches an hour., You can grow it from seed or by root division. If growing from seed, plant the seeds ½ inch deep in the container, and leave it on a warm, sunlit windowsill for about four weeks. Propagating by division, however, is the quickest and easiest method, and should be done in the early spring.For propagation by division, you can slice the root ball into half or quarter sections with a knife and repot into separate, smaller planters. It is also an option to pull the tubers apart by hand. Pulling the tubers apart by hand allows you to separate the tubers in a more natural direction than by using scissors. The tubers will need to be repotted into separate planters.
You can separate the good and bad seeds by putting them in a bucket full of water and leaving them for a few days. The bad seeds will float to the top, and the good seeds will sink to the bottom., With the proper and chosen conditions in mind, plant your seeds in a pot, or in the ground. To plant, dig a hole in the soil that is twice the length of the seeds you’re planting. Then, cover the seeds with a light layer of soil. You will not need to worry about planting and watering the seeds if you chose to plant the tubers instead of seeds.For example, plant seeds that are 1/8th of an inch in 1/4th soil.

, You will need to thoroughly water the seeds directly after planting. The plant should start growing from the seedlings within a week or two. During this time, you should be constantly watering your seedlings. You should water the seeds every time the ground is dry.


If you planted the tubers, you will still need to water them directly after planting. Water them once a day and every time the ground is dry.
In hot weather, you may need to water twice a day., You should purchase a soluble (liquid), all-purpose fertilizer. Make sure to dilute the fertilizer to ½ strength. During the period of growth, March to August, you will need to fertilize every three to four weeks. After that, fertilizing monthly should be adequate.Water soluble fertilizers typically come in liquid or powder form. Powder fertilizers need to be mixed with water. To use, you need a watering can or hose-end sprayer. Spray or pour the fertilizer until the soil is saturated, but not drowned in water., Once the seedlings grow into a plant you will need to continue watering the plant regularly. Asparagus ferns can survive during periods of drought, but you should continue to water it every time the soil is dry. During the winter, you should water the plant less.You can water the plant once a week during the winter. The heat during the summer causes the ground to become dryer faster. The soil does not dry out as quickly during the winter. You should water more than once a week if you live in a climate that is hot or warm during the winter.
Before watering, allow 50 percent of the soil to dry out and watch for the fronds to turn a light green. Yellow fronds indicate that the plant is getting too little water and brown fronds indicate that it is getting too much water.

, Pruning allows new growth, and it keeps your plant neat. You should trim old stems every spring. Old or dead stems will appear dry, withered, and they will no longer produce growth. Trim any stems or growth that sticks out too much, or appears dry or dead. Make sure to wear gloves while you prune to avoid being scratched by the “needles” on the fern.Scissors or hand pruners will work fine. You do not need anything bigger.
At this point, the plant will be sprouting white flowers and red berries. Be aware that the red berries that accompany the blooms are poisonous! Do not eat them!

, If you planted your fern in a pot, you will need to repot it once a year in the spring. Move your plant to a pot that is only one size larger. Ferns grow rapidly, and repotting allows them to grow freely and without damage.You can repot more than once a year if your fern is spilling over the pot it is currently in.
The roots of the fern can sometimes push the soil to the top of the pot. Keep your soil 1 to 2 inches from the rim of the pot.

, Asparagus ferns rarely have problems with major insects or diseases that can cause them to die, so you should not have to spray them. You should use insecticide soap on them rather than insecticide. Ferns sometimes become infested by spider mites, scale insects, and mealy bugs. However, this is only a problem if you are transferring the fern from outdoors to indoors.Inspect your ferns before transporting them from indoors to outdoors. If the infestation is too much, you can trim the stems back to the soil line. New stems will grow back.Trimming the branches should solve the insect problem. Try to avoid a spray if possible. Sprays will kill both beneficial and harmful insects.

Water the bulbs.,
Remove foliage.,
Provide support for the stems.,
Cover the flower bed with a layer of mulch.,
Uproot bulbs and store them to protect them from frost, then replant them when the weather is adequately warm.,
In the soil or anywhere on the plant, check to see if there are any bugs or diseases.",How to Care for Bulbs," You should water bulbs after planting them. This will help the plant develop roots and also set the soil around the bulb, eliminating air pockets.


Don't water shallowly as the bulb may be planted pretty deep and the water needs to soak the roots thoroughly.
Add about one inch of water every week after the plant starts flowering if the rainfall is not adequate in your area.
It is important to note that shallowly planted bulbs will rot if over-watered.;
, Foliage left after the bloom is spent is not a pretty sight. You may be tempted to remove it the moment it pops out but you should refrain from doing so and only cut away the foliage when it has dried and withered (when it turns yellow).


Foliage on smaller bulbs such as Snowdrops or Squill will not take long to dry like larger bulbs such as tulips.

, Some summer bulbs have weak stems which cannot support themselves. Often, a ring around the stems gives them enough support. Alternatively, you may embed a stake next to the bulb when planting, always taking care not to damage the bulb.

, Doing so helps retain moisture in the bed and also cools the plants during times oft too much heat.


Early blooming bulbs need not be mulched.

,


Spring bulbs enter their dormant period in the summer when the foliage and the roots dry. You can store the bulbs in a cool and ventilated place and replant them in the fall. This method prevents overcrowding as the bulbs create new additions to bulb cluster.
Summer bulbs do not like frost and should be stored before the frost sets in. Use a spading fork to remove the bulb, then remove the dirt which is still clinging to the roots unless the bulb is a Achimenes, Begonia, Canna, Caladium, Dahlia or Ismene. For these, leave some moist soil clinging to the roots.

First spread the bulbs out in a shaded place and let them dry.
When dry, store them away in a cool well ventilated cellar or basement. Make sure air can pass through the bulbs so as to prevent decay. Don't put them into too many layers.
Check whether the bulbs have any spots which may indicate disease. Also throw out undersized bulbs.



, Do some research on the internet about how to kill them. There is a high chance that beetle larvae might exist in the soil because of the huge roots.


Be sure to check them every month or the bugs/diseases would multiply making it harder for you to remove.

Pick out a bright spot for your Hoya.,
Move your older plant if it has stopped blooming as much.,
Water Hoya plants when the potting soil becomes almost completely dry.,
Water your plant in the morning.,
Pour the water evenly over the soil until it drains from the bottom of the pot.,
Keep the season in mind.",How to Care for a Hoya Plant1," In particular, look for a spot near an east- or west-facing window. Hoyas do best in bright, indirect sunlight throughout the day, though they also prefer to have two to four hours of direct sunlight.A south-facing window is also okay as long as there is a sheer curtain hanging between the window and the Hoya plant. Hot, direct sunlight all day is too much for these plants.;
, A two- to three-year old plant that does not bloom is probably not getting enough sunlight. If this occurs, try exposing it to another hour or two of direct sunlight.

, Use room-temperature water that has been “aged” or left sitting in an open container for at least 24 to 36 hours. Hoya plants are tropical plants that could be stressed by cold tap water.Letting the water sit for 24 to 36 hours also allows chlorine and fluorine dissipate naturally. Chlorine and fluorine are chemicals commonly found in tap water that can potentially harm plants.

, This allows the moisture to be available to the plant throughout the day. Doing this also ensures that the leaves will dry before temperatures cool at night.

, Empty the catch basin beneath the pot after the water drains through. Water left in the catch basin could be absorbed back up into the potting soil, keeping the roots too wet and depriving them of oxygen.


Hoya plant roots need oxygen to keep them healthy. If the roots are kept too wet they could develop root rot.

, Hoyas need to be watered more often during the spring and summer while they are actively growing and less often during the fall and winter.If a Hoya plant begins to drop its leaves, it is probably being watered too often. Let the soil dry a little more before watering it again.

"
"
Fertilize Hoya plants with a balanced, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer.,
Adjust the frequency that you feed your plant based on the plant’s health.,
Water your plant before fertilizing it.,
Do not remove the spent flower stems after your Hoya blooms.,
Repot Hoyas only when they are completely pot-bound.,
Use a peat-based commercial potting soil that contains perlite for improved drainage.,
Turn the Hoya on its side and gently pull it out of the old container.,
Set the Hoya in the new container.",How to Care for a Hoya Plant2," Do this every three to four weeks during the spring and summer. Fertilizer with a ratio of 5-10-5, 8-8-8 or 10-10-10 is fine.A common dilution rate is 1 teaspoon per gallon of water, but this varies.
The dilution rate and application frequency may need to be adjusted based on an individual Hoya plant’s needs.

, If the leaves and stems become pale, the Hoya needs to be given fertilizer every two weeks. If new leaves are smaller and darker than usual with shorter stems between the leaves, give the Hoya fertilizer every six weeks.

, Mix the solution up and pour it evenly over the soil immediately following a regular watering. Do not give Hoyas fertilizer solution when the potting soil is dry as it could burn their roots. They should not get any fertilizer during the fall and winter.

, It will produce flowers on those stems again the next time it blooms. Also, do not move the Hoya after it begins to develop new flower buds. Moving the Hoya could disturb it and cause it to drop the buds before they open.

, The container will be packed with roots when it is ready to be repotted. Being pot-bound encourages Hoyas to bloom. Repot the Hoya into a container with drain holes that is only one size larger than the current container., Read the ingredients on the potting soil bag. It should be primarily sphagnum peat moss. Pour an inch or two of potting soil into the new container.

, If it seems to be stuck, run a butter knife around the inside of the container to loosen the roots.

, Finish filling the container with potting soil. Water the Hoya generously to help settle the soil around the roots.

Look at when the seeds expire.,
Buy enough seed and not too much.,
Ask the retailer about heirloom variety seeds.,
Mark your gardening calendar with the expiry dates of the seeds you purchase.,
Store your seeds properly.",How to Buy Seed," Don't be tempted to buy seed that is past the expire date because seed deteriorates after that time. If you do get seed post the expiry date, make sure it's a bargain and don't be disappointed if it refuses to germinate or produces poor plants.;
, Having too much seed and nowhere to plant it will mean that the unused seed will go to waste. For the most part, it'll expire before you get the chance to use it for the next year's season.

, If they cannot stock such seeds for you, go online. There are many mail-order companies willing to send these to you. Check the terms and conditions though, to make sure you can return rotten or expired seeds if received that way.


Most garden centres and nurseries only stock the most popular seed varieties; you will find a lot more variety available online.
If purchasing seed online from a country outside of your own, check the quarantine laws. You don't want to spend a whole lot of money just to have your shipment rejected at the border because the seed is not permitted into your country.

, That way you won't forget to make sure to get the seeds into the ground before that time.


Some seeds are less durable than others. For example, carrot seeds have a very short shelf life and need to be resown each year. On the other hand, pea and pumpkin seeds might be happy to wait another year, depending on how they're stored.

, After purchase, if you don't intend using the seeds immediately, they'll need to be stored until you're ready. Place them in a cool, dry part of the house (the pantry is often good). Do not open the packets until you are about to plant them.

Look for a source that specializes in organic plants.,
Go to a small neighborhood nursery or garden center.While these locations may not deal specifically with organic goods, they are more likely to carry organic plants than big box stores.,
Try a farmer's market.,
Consider a big box store.,
Shop online.",How to Buy Organic Plants1," The easiest way to know whether or not the plants you buy from a specific vendor are organic is to shop with a vendor that only deals in organic goods. Odds are, an organic nursery, garden center, or shop will do the work of checking out the conditions the plant was raised in before selling it. Moreover, as it sits there, the plant will receive organic care and will probably not be treated with any chemicals. This is especially true if the store has some type of official certification from a nationally approved or third-party organic organization.;
, Neighborhood garden centers tend to have a more personal connection to the sources they buy from and to their customers, and this personal touch extends to the quality of merchandise sold there.


Simply put, a local source is more apt to pay attention to who they buy from and how the plants they purchase are cared for prior to purchasing them. Since these stores have limited resources and need to maintain a high level of care in order to avoid wasting stock, they are also more likely to take greater precautions when caring for plants. Many of these precautions will include using organic measures, especially on fruit and vegetable plants.

, Typically, a farmer’s market will only sell products of organic farming rather than organic plants, but a large enough market will likely carry a few organic plants, as well. Aside from the fact that farmer’s markets are a good source of organic goods, one advantage of buying an organic plant from a farmer’s market is that you know the plant likely came from a seed or cutting of a healthy plant in the grower’s garden or field.

, It is true that big box stores tend to have fewer organic plants to choose from and tend to be less dedicated in their methods of care, but they can be a good source for perennials and hardy shrubs as long as you buy during the correct time of season and examine the quality before making a purchase. Moreover, these stores generally do maintain organic methods of care for plants marketed as organic, if for no other reason than the fact that selling non-organic plants as organic could cause a business scandal.

, Using the Internet for any organic good can be both tricky and convenient. On the one hand, scammers abound, and you have no way of checking the quality of plants before you buy them. On the other hand, you can find a greater selection online and can comparison shop with greater ease. If you decide to buy online, make sure that the merchant is a certified organic seller and that the vast majority of reviews about the merchant are positive.

Keep some kind of records of your efforts.",How to Choose Plants for a Garden," Growing flowers, ornamentals, or vegetables all follow basic principles, and the choice of what you grow is up to you.;
, Even if they are not close friends, most hobby gardeners love to ""show their stuff"".

, In the USA, the Dept. of Agriculture has the Agricultural Extension Service, and these folks are there to help answer specific questions about lawn and garden issues. Often, they can give up to date advice on local conditions, growing seasons, and successful plant varieties.

, Watermelons and tomatoes come in more than the standard red colors, so if you want yellow, go yellow. The same applies to beans and peas, with ""bush"" type, vining, or climbing varieties available.

, Many plant species have ""dwarf"" cultivars which take up much less space.

, Plants vary greatly in the amount of sun they can tolerate or require, and this information will help you decide what to buy. Tomatoes and many leafy vegetables simply won't thrive without enough sun.

, Garden supply stores and nurseries are good places to go, often offering better selection and more knowledgeable advice, but usually at a higher price.

, Basically, they will have information about the plant including its name, the temperature zone it is appropriate for, and the amount of sun it prefers.

, Large plants in small containers are likely to be ""root bound"", a condition where the roots have been confined in the container so long they are simply a tangled mass which will not flourish when transplanted to the soil of your garden.

, The individual packaged variety of seeds will have information included on the label as to planting season, spacing the seeds, and depth to plant, as well as sun, soil type, and drainage requirements.

,, Here, it should be said, some guesswork will be needed unless you consult someone familiar with your particular growing conditions. Adding a composted organic soil conditioner is more beneficial in sandy or clay soil, where rich loamy soil wouldn't require much, if any, but nonetheless, adding it shouldn't hurt. Fertilizer, on the other hand, can have more dramatic effects, and not always in a positive way. Too much nitrogen on legumes (beans and peas) for example, can cause a tremendous foliage growth with little fruit, so unless you are pretty confident, leave the fertilizer until later.

, Corners, particularly those with little shade are a fairly safe bet, and mowing around the garden later will be easier.

, Repeating this until a large enough area for your purposes is all the preparation needed, but a rotary tiller or other implement will give better results.

,,, It is better to space these out a bit wide, rather than having them crowd each other later as they grow. For peat cup grown plants, you can tear the ""cup"" loose around the roots of the plant, and stick the whole mess in the ground, but for plastic containers, you will need to remove the container before planting.

, If there is excessive branching or foliage, some plants benefit from ""pruning"", or removing some of this growth, which leaves the roots less mass to support until they are fully established.

, This can be one with a shovel handle, a hoe, or other tool, by dragging it through the soil creating a small ""furrow"", or grove in it.

, Many common garden seeds have a suggested planting depth of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm), and if the soil is kept moist until the plant sprouts and puts down a root, it should work. Take care when covering the seeds in the furrow not to pack the soil too tightly, but it should be packed down some to set the soil firmly around the seed.

, When the plants are established or the seeds are up and growing, cut back watering frequency and increase water depth to encourage the roots to grow deep enough to support the plant as it matures.

, Yellowing or streaking of the foliage may indicate the need for fertilizer if the soil is poor. For beginning gardeners, a mixable soluble fertilizer may be better than calculating or trying to figure out proportions of a commercial type bulk material. Miracle Grow, Scott's, and many other brands, including store brands, are easily mixed and come with fairly comprehensive instructions on the packaging. One thing to note is that the product you use contains micronutrients and trace elements, like copper, zinc, and iron, all essential for healthy plants.

, These include anything from caterpillars to rabbits and even deer, all of which may have a taste for your new crop. Unfortunately, this article cannot cover all the possibilities, but if you see leaves that have been eaten or become spotted, you will have to address this problem.

, Mulch will help, although some plants may experience disease problems if too much mulch is used or the humidity is too high in your location.

, If you find one particular variety of beans or tomatoes is more successful for you, you will want to go back to it again next year."

Verify that the plant is organic.,
Choose a balanced plant.This is especially true if you are looking for an organic houseplant, but it also applies to vegetables plants, shrubs, and trees.,
Favor more flower buds over fewer.,
Make sure the plant is healthy.,
Look at the roots, if possible.,
Buy what you can care for.",How to Buy Organic Plants2," Unless bought from an organic nursery, an organic plant should come with a label or sign specifically stating that the plant is organic or from a certifiably organic source. If you are unsure about whether or not the plant is organic, ask the merchant about the conditions it was grown under and what, if any, organic practices or products were used in its cultivation. Make sure that the garden center or seller has not been using non-organic, chemical fertilizers or pesticides on the plant.

, Except in rare instances in which the plant is supposed to have an imbalanced look, the specimen you choose should have an even shape and should not be leaning in any one direction.

, If the plant you choose is meant to flower, look for one that had plenty of buds thriving on healthy stems. Look for plants with a few flowers that have begun to open if you do not plant on transplanting the plant into a garden. Do not buy a plant on which all the buds have opened, since you will get shorter enjoyment from the flowers. If you do plan on transplanting the plant, opt for plants that have no open flowers, since transplanting is less harsh on plants that are not fully mature.

, Merchants selling organic plants may use pesticides less often, especially if the merchant does not specialize in organic products. Examine the undersides of the leaves to check for diseased spots or pests. Give a few of the leaves a small tug. If they fall off without much effort, there is a good chance that something is wrong with the plant.

, If the plant you are buying is bare-rooted, examine the roots for signs of unusual brownness, softness, or rot. Good roots are firm and solid.

, If a plant requires full sun and you are unable to provide it with such, you should either be prepared to purchase fluorescent grow lights with it or be prepared to buy a different type of plant that you can care for.

Keep an eye on garden sales in catalogs.,
Buy plants that have been reduced due to lack of adequate attention or overstocking.,
Make your own garden decorations.,
Keep it simple.",How to Prepare a Spring Garden on a Budget," If you know what your budget allowance for the garden is from the very beginning, you will have something to stick to and if there is anything left over, you can reward yourself with something extra. If you don't have a budget, you will probably overspend, so don't skip this essential step.;
, Keep seeds back from the previous season from flowers and vegetables that grew in your garden. Allow the seeds to dry (to prevent mildew over winter) and place in separate bags, well labeled. Store somewhere that is warm and dry over winter. As spring gets closer, plant the seeds in seedling trays and keep indoors near a window that gets a lot of sunshine. Water and tend to them regularly and you will get a head start on the new season's plantings.


If you haven't managed to do this from last season, ask your neighbors or family members who garden for spare seeds that they saved from their gardens.






Look for discount days at your local garden center or hardware store to get seeds at a very good price.







, If you fancy the plants that are growing in someone else's garden, ask if you can take cuttings from them to strike your own. Many gardeners are very pleased to be asked this and will let you collect a few cuttings.


Botanical gardens often have mid-winter to early spring pruning clear outs in rose gardens, etc. Phone up to ask when this happening and to see whether members of the public can get cuttings from these tidy-ups (just avoid picking out anything that is diseased or rotten).
Read How to grow cuttings from established plants for more details.







, Once the likelihood of frost has cleared, take the seedlings outdoors and continue watering them in their trays. Do this for a week or two, to help them transition from the indoor environment to the outdoor one.


The budget-conscious gardener won't rush this step, otherwise you'll have to find more seedlings to replace the ones you've lost.
Read How to grow seedlings, How to thin out seedlings and How to keep birds off your seedlings for more ideas.







, In the same way that a shopping list helps you to curtail overspending in the store, a garden plan helps you to avoid over-purchasing of whims when you go to the garden center. Draw in the flowers, the vegetables, the ornamentals, the decorations, etc. that you'd like in your garden this year, in their exact places. This plan will guide you on buying ""just enough"" and no more. And don't forget to take account of plants that you're already growing yourself.

, When the sales are on, this is an excellent time to buy the garden sale items in bulk. Naturally, only buy what you will use but have an eye for a good bargain, including for updating/replacing, and so forth of new garden tools, hoses, netting, and other essentials.


Only buy in bulk if it will be used and is a good price.
Don't go overboard on gimmicky things like plastic garden decorations. They clutter the garden and may not be made from very good materials. Put your money toward plants and gardening tools you really need instead.

, In some garden centers, there will be a section of plants that haven't been adequately cared for, or that have not been selling as well as the store owner would like, going for a song. If you've a green thumb and you can identify the likelihood of successfully salvaging any of the poorer plants back to health, these finds can make incredible bargains.
Be sure to tend to the weaker plants from the moment you arrive home. Give them better soil, keep them away from wind and heat to begin with, give them a tidy up and a nutritious feed. Remember to water them regularly until they start to thrive again.






Spindly, too-tall tomato plants are a true bargain. Repot them and bury a good bit of the spindly stems. They will grow roots out of those stems into the new soil level and have a better root ball than the prettier ones that sold for full price.

, Rather than buying decorative items for the garden, recycle and reuse household items to create new and amazing garden sculptures, feature pieces, water features, etc. Be as imaginative as you'd like and rope the kids in to help too. They can have great fun making a dinosaur garden with their toys, a fairy garden with their fairies, an animal garden for their pets, etc. Following are some more suggestions for you to make on a budget:


Make your own bird feeder






Create your own mini Zen garden






Use rhododendrons to make a rhododendron decoration






Turn a part of your garden into a faerie garden.







, A budget conscious garden is a simple one that is pretty, effective, useful, and pleasant all at once. If you can't afford a greenhouse to keep tropical flowers, don't aim for that. Visit the local gardens instead and see theirs and think about how much extra work is involved anyway! And there is nothing more appealing than a well-weeded, well tended garden, whatever your budget.

",How to Practice Square Foot Gardening," The joy of square foot gardening is the easy access to the raised garden beds. The usually recommended measurement is 4 feet (1.2 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m), 16 sq ft (120cm x 120cm, 1.5 m2) beds, providing for easy access and good growing space.


Face the bed in the direction able to get the most sunlight.;
, Pathways should be wide enough to enable comfortable access and ability to tend to the garden.


Note that some square foot gardeners don't like too many pathways because using them compacts the soil around the boxes. Consider strewing straw or other soft material over the paths to reduce the impact of your tread.

, Do not use chemically treated wood to construct your raised garden boxes. The boxes should be 6 to 8-inches (15-20cm) high when built; too high and they risk toppling over with the weight of soil and plants.


An open bottom wooden box can be used, with dividers.






Alternatively, build the box shape from scratch. To do this, get some 2x6 or 2x8 boards and cut them to fit into the four square foot shape. Nail together and place on the chosen are of soil. Try to use clean, chemical-free recycled wood to save money and give old wood a new purpose.
If placing the garden on a table or other raised surface, be sure to add a plywood base to hold in the soil.

, Unless you are absolutely familiar with the quality of your garden soil and know it's good, it's not recommended to use it on its own. Either enhance the garden soil you have with compost or make a mixture consisting of 1/3 compost, 1/3 peat moss and 1/3 vermiculite to make amended soil.


Well rotted manure is another good addition to improve soil.






The issue of soil is a complex topic deserving of its own lengthy discussion. Consider reading the suggestions of other square foot gardeners who have shared their advice about soil usage online or in relevant gardening books.

, The overlays are laid over your garden bed to mark the areas for planting. Fasten the overlays with screws or rivets to secure the overlays.


Other ways to divide the portions in the box include simply marking with strings or shoelaces nailed to the edges. Or, insert thin boards to make divisions that sit in the soil itself.







, Each different plant or crop will be inserted into a different square, tallest plants to the back and smaller plants toward the front.

, Use your fingers to make the holes. The depth of each hole depends on the individual seed's requirements, so be sure to check each packet for this before making the holes.

, Use the recommended seed spacings when planting your seeds––follow the seed packet for guidance. If needed, use extra segments (or squares) to plant large plants; they still need space to grow even though they're in closer proximity than usual. To keep weeds from growing, the approach is to have plants touching without competing with each other for nutrients.


For each hole, most plants only require 1-2 seeds per hole to guarantee germination. However, for small seeds such as carrot seeds, plant about 4-5 to ensure germination. You can think out the weaker seedlings later by cutting them off with scissors, so as not to disturb the soil of the plants left to grow.
Expect that many plants will require a square alone, while other plants may fit several per square foot. For example, one square foot can handle sixteen carrots or onions, four leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, chard, etc.)., This garden can be watered by hand, by drip tape or a soaker hose. Be aware that raised garden beds tend to have excellent drainage, meaning that the soil will be drier faster. Keep the garden bed well watered, even during winter.


To know if adequate water is reaching the garden naturally, consider placing a rain gauge next to it and checking this regularly.
Consider adding mulch to help retain water. Mulch to a height of 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) but do not touch the stems of the growing plants. Add more as it decomposes.

, As with any organic gardening method, it is also vital to rotate crops around the square foot bed, to decrease the opportunity for disease to take hold or for nutritional deficiencies in the soil.


Draw up a crop rotation plan to help you remember which plant has been in which division at each particular date of planting and harvesting.

Avoid temperature hazards.,
Monitor humidity.",How to Bring Plants Indoors over Winter," You want to make sure your plants are in top condition before bringing them indoors. Examine the plants as you prepare them for the transition. If you notice any dead or damaged leaves, cut them off. This will help the plants thrive inside., Pests often hide in the topsoil of plants. You should not collect the topsoil in a pot when transferring your outdoor plants to pots. Before removing the plant from the ground, scoop out one to two inches of top soil surrounding the plant.Dig into the ground until you reach a plant's roots. Shake off as much of the dirt as you can, and then spray the plant down with a mild dish detergent diluted in a quart of water. This should get rid of any spider mites or egg sacks on the plant.

, Once you're sure most pests are eliminated, get a clean pot. Add fresh potting soil to the pot. You need potting soil rather than outdoor soil, as it's specifically made for indoor use. Replant the plants in the new soil., The transition to indoor life will be too dramatic if it's not done in intervals. Placing the plants so far away from natural light directly can cause problems. A week before moving the plants inside, put them in a shady area in your backyard.Even if you have good natural light in your home, this is important. Even a sun room does not provide nearly as much natural light as being outdoors.

, While your plants were out in the shade, new bugs may have gotten into them. Check your plants for spiders and other pests carefully before at last transporting them indoors.Make sure to check the leaves, stems, and soil for any bugs.
Remove the bugs by hand using gloves. Then, gently wash the plants down with an insecticidal soap. Make sure the soap you choose is safe for humans and, if you have them, pets.

, In general, plants need a stable temperature to thrive. Before bringing your plants indoors, find an area that stays around room temperature. Areas with dramatic temperature fluctuations are not great for house plants.Avoid areas prone to drafts. If you, for example, place a plant near your front door, it may be exposed to a lot of sudden temperature fluctuations.

, Humidity is usually lower indoors, especially if you have a furnace going. You will need to make sure your plants stay humid over the winter.Mist down the plants regularly with a spray bottle.
If it's very dry in your home, your plants may benefit from a humidity tray. This means placing your pots in a small tray filled with pebbles and water.

, Plants need light to thrive. Try to keep potted plants near a window. If you don't have a lot of natural light, or if your plants wilt even with exposure to a window, stop by a local greenhouse. Buy some grow lights. That will give your plants artificial light that should help them thrive., Plants actually need less water when they're indoors. There is less light to dry the plants out. Make sure you only water your plant when it's necessary.To check if you plant needs water, place your finger into the soil along the edge of the pot. If the first inch of soil has dried out, water your plant. Do not water your plant unless you notice this soil is dry., If you have pets, they can be a real hazard for house plants. Cats and dogs may eat plants, and may also knock over pots.If possible, keep your plants out of your pets' reach. You can hang plants on the wall or put them on high reaching counters and shelves.
You should also check to make sure the plants you're bringing in are not toxic to pets.

, Vents, radiators, and back doors are bad for plants. They cause rapid changes in temperature and humidity. Keep plants away from these hazards., It's a good idea to invest in a humidifier when keeping plants indoors. Humidity should be between 40 and 60% for plants to thrive. If humidity drops below these levels, you will have to quickly mist plants or invest in a humidifier."

Recycle eggshells to grow seedlings.,
Use eggshells to improve compost.,
Recycle eggshells as fertilizer for the garden.,
Add eggshells to the bottom of garden containers and pots.,
Use recycled eggshells to deter snails and slugs.,
Create egg heads with grass hair.",How to Recycle Eggshells in Gardening Activities," Eggshells can be used to grow small seedlings indoors. When the seedling is ready to be planted outside, place the shell and seedling directly in the ground. The eggshell will decompose over time and help fertilize the soil.

Use large eggshells to start seeds indoors.



 


Poke pin holes in the bottom of half an eggshell.






Fill the eggshell half with soil.






Place a seed in the soil and cover lightly with soil.






Write on the eggshell the type of plant the seedling is. Use a pencil or permanent marker to write on the eggshell.






Store the eggshell seedling in an egg carton and place it in a windowsill. Water the seedling as needed.






Plant the seedling in the ground when the first set of leaves appear. Lightly crush the eggshell with your hand, and place the eggshell and seedling directly into the ground.;
, Gardeners frequently add lime to compost to correct acidity problems in garden soil. Lime is made up of calcium carbonate, which is the main nutrient in eggshells. Rather than purchase lime, recycle eggshells to amend compost.


Crush eggshells and add them directly to the compost. To decrease the decomposition time, dry the eggshells in an oven and grind them using a blender before adding them to the compost.

, Eggshells contain calcium, phosphorus, sulfur and potassium, which help make plants healthy.

Rinse eggshells. Allow the eggshells to dry, and place them in a bowl or large container.






Grind the eggshells using a pestle, which is a hand-held tool used for mashing or grinding substances. If you do not have a pestle, grind the eggshells in a blender. The smaller the eggshell pieces, the faster they will break down in the soil.






Add the shells to your garden and mix them into the soil.







, The eggshells will add calcium to the soil in the containers, provide drainage and deter cutworms and slugs.


Place crushed eggshells in the bottom of empty pots before adding soil. Do not grind the eggshells, but crush them by hand so the shells are in pieces.

, The abrasive, sharp edges of the eggshells keep snails and slugs from crossing the shells to get to the plants.


Crush eggshells into pieces. Do not grind the shells, but crush the shells by hand. The shells should have sharp, rough edges.






Scatter the crushed eggshells around plants affected by snails or slugs. For best results, place the eggshells in a circular pattern around the plants.







, Egg heads are a fun and creative recycling activity for children.


Use large eggshells to make egg heads.
Crack eggs in half and rinse the eggshells. Allow the eggshells to dry.






Draw a face on each eggshell using permanent markers or colored pencils. The faces can be funny or resemble characters or animals, such as one-eyed monsters or farm animals.






Fill the eggshell with soil and place grass seeds in the soil.






Create a stand for the eggshell. Cut a small strip of cardstock paper. Tape the ends of the paper together so it creates a circular stand for the eggshell. Be sure the strip isn't so wide that it obstructs the view of face on the eggshell.






Place the eggshell in the stand on a windowsill. Water as needed.






Wait for the grass to grow. The eggshell will begin to grow grass, which will resemble green hair. The growth rate for the grass depends on the type of grass seed, but typically begins between 4 and 7 days. Children may cut the grass for a shorter ""hairstyle"" or allow it grow long to resemble long spikes of hair.

Plan your snowdrop planting.,
Improve drainage in your soil, if necessary.,
Plant your snowdrops.,
Water your snowdrops well after planting them.,
Remove foliage after the plant withers.,
Encourage full blooms and growth with fertilizer.",How to Plant Snowdrops1," Snowdrops do best in soil that drains well. If 5 to 6 hours after a heavy rain there are still puddles of water in an area, choose a different spot for your planting. Plan to leave at least 3 in (7.6 cm) between plants. Prioritize locations that receive full sunlight to light shade.Generally, full sunlight means that plants will receive 6 to 8 hours of sun throughout the day.
Watch the location where you'll plant your snowdrops throughout the day. At certain times, the angle of the sun might be blocked by trees or foliage.;
, If your garden is in an area with poor drainage but you still want to plant some snowdrops, you’ll need to add organic material to make the soil more hospitable. Do this by adding peat moss, compost, ground bark, or decomposed manure to raise the soil level at least 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.6 cm).You can find many kinds of organic, soil drainage improving materials (like decomposed manure) at most home and garden centers, nurseries, and florists.

, Use a shovel or a spade to dig holes that are deep enough that the pointed top of the snowdrop bulb will be 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.6 cm) beneath the ground. Remember to keep at least 3 in (7.6 cm) of space between plants.


When inserting a snowdrop bulb into a hole, orient it so the pointed end of the bulb faces upwards.
The best time to plant snowdrop bulbs is in late spring when the initial growth of foliage is dying back.
If you cannot plant your bulbs late in spring, buy grown plants that have just flowered but are still green and use these instead.
Grown snowdrops should be planted in late spring according to their care instructions. Buy these plants from nurseries and garden centers., Water will help the bulb settle in the ground. Expect most bulbs to sprout roots in roughly 1 to 2 weeks. However, even though the roots will be active, snowdrops won’t push up out of the soil until late winter or early spring.


After your initial heavy watering of newly planted bulbs, you’ll only need to lightly water it. In dry spells, you may need to water moderately, but do so cautiously. Snowdrops are sensitive to overwatering., Allow your snowdrops to keep their foliage until it withers and turns yellow. This will allow your plants to absorb and store more energy for next year. Once the leaves have withered, feel free to cut them with garden shears and remove them.


Trimming your snowdrops too early will diminish their health and appearance next year., Use a water-soluble fertilizer a few times throughout fall and winter in the areas your snowdrops will grow. This step is not required, but additional nutrients will enable next years’ plants to grow larger, healthier, and with fuller blooms.


Regular fertilizing can also extend the life of your bulbs. If you want your snowdrops to last as long as possible before having to replant them, be sure to fertilize."
"
Fill your pot with soil.,
Plant your snowdrop bulbs.,
Water your bulbs liberally after planting.,
Trim dead foliage from snowdrops.,
Fertilize your snowdrops.",How to Plant Snowdrops2," Most kinds of potting soil will be suitable for planting your snowdrops. So long as the soil drains well and the container you’ve chosen had adequate drainage, your snowdrops should flourish. Buy potting soil and pots at your local garden center or nursery.


Pots without enough draining can cause your bulbs to rot or become diseased before they can bloom. Check the bottoms of planting containers to verify they have holes in the bottom for drainage., In a container, you can create a more colorful composition by planting bulbs roughly an inch (2.5 cm) apart. Plant each bulb so its top is 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.6 cm) below the surface of your soil. Bulbs should be planted with the pointed end of the bulb facing upwards.Early blooming snow crocuses are a nice companion plant to go with your snowdrops. Use these to fill out extra space in your pots., This will help the soil to settle around the bulb, creating a more hospitable environment for it. After doing this, you should only water your snowdrops lightly to moderately. Overwatering is harmful to snowdrops., Once the leaves have fully withered and turned yellow, you can remove these from the plant. This can help prevent the buildup of debris in your pot and will keep your plants healthy., It’s especially important to fertilize potted plants. Even though the snowdrop is hardy, it won’t have as wide a range of nutrients in its pot as it would in the earth. For this reason, use a water-soluble fertilizer a few times throughout autumn and winter."
"
Allow plants damaged by frost time to heal.,
Prevent squirrels from eating planted bulbs.,
Avoid overwatering your snowdrops.,
Destroy contaminated bulbs.",How to Plant Snowdrops3," Due to the fact that snowdrops are an early blooming flower, it’s common for a late frost to do some damage to them. Winter plants, like snowdrops, are usually able to recover from such shocks naturally with enough time.If you’re concerned your snowdrops might be damaged by a heavy frost or cold snap, lay down some groundcover to protect them, like a layer of hay or a blanket.
When using groundcover like a blanket, be careful not to crush new growth. Remember to remove your blanket in the morning so your plants receive sun.

, Squirrels are the most common pest to plague freshly planted bulbs.These animals can be difficult to keep away from your plantings. Play music or have a radio running around bulbs to scare off squirrels, or spray a squirrel repellant around your plants.


Predator urine is a common kind of squirrel repellant. It’s available at many home and garden centers and hardware stores.

, If your snowdrops start to die or are looking unhealthy, you may be overwatering them. Snowdrops require only light to moderate watering, and overwatering can cause plants to die or become diseased.


Soil that is too damp can also cause fungi or mold to grow on the bulb or roots of snowdrops. Fungi and mold are dangerous to the health of your snowdrops., Fungus can usually be detected in snowdrops when bulbs fail to emerge or the plant collapses amidst a white colored growth. Mold is present when the leaves and flowers of your plants are covered in fuzzy, gray substance. In both cases, you should remove and destroy infected plants/bulbs.


There are no chemical treatments to remedy these common snowdrop ailments. Your best option, if you have a fungi or mold outbreak, is to separate and destroying the diseased plants.
By adequately spacing your and watering your plants, you can reduce the chances of your plants catching these afflictions."

Work out which animals are friendly to your garden and which are pests.,
Grow plants that attract birds.,
Grow plants that attract butterflies.,
Grow plants that attract bees.,
Grow plants that attract ladybugs.,
Attract more frogs to your garden.,
Attract lizards to your garden.,
Make food for the friendly animals.,
Spend time learning about the interactions of animals in your garden.",How to Attract Beneficial Animals to Your Garden," This may vary depending on what region you live in. It will also depend on the size of your yard and garden, and whether or not you have pets and other animals on your property.


Some animals, like earthworms and bees, actively improve your garden. Some, like butterflies, help your garden by looking pretty and not damaging it in the process. Some, like ladybugs, bats, spiders, and cats, eat or scare away others before they eat your garden. Not everything helpful to your garden should be encouraged into close contact with people, particularly children. You probably won't want a bee colony right by your house (but a beekeeper might volunteer to take it). Bigger animals might attack if too close, particularly if startled, even if you think they're tame.






Helpful animals include certain insects such as ladybugs and bees, insect-eating birds, earthworms (not in all places though), spiders (but beware of creating conditions, like woodpiles, particularly desirable to the few that can be dangerous), frogs, lizards, etc.






Animals that tend to be pests are those that have destructive habits and include rabbits, deer, mice, mosquitoes, squirrels, flies, aphids, moles, raccoons, possums, starlings, etc. However, it is really important to balance your sense of ""pest"" with the need to conserve local biodiversity and to be kind to fellow species. A mouse or a deer may be a pest if you gather many soft plants for it to eat. In its natural environment, including wilder parts of your yard, it can nibble down overgrown plants that would choke out a beautiful variety of species. Appreciate animals in their native regions as interesting, important parts of the web of life.

, Having more birds in your garden is beneficial for you because birds eat pest insects. In addition, people love watching birds set up homes, feed in, and fly around their own garden space, their intrinsic value being their beauty. Attracting birds to your garden will depend on the type of birds, as they'll all have their individual preferences, such as humming birds loving red flowers. Do research on the birds on your area and their preferences before purchasing and planting their favorite plants.

, Frogs eat insect larvae and insects, helping keep down the insect population; they are also excellent indicators of the health of your garden. Help make a suitable environment for them by providing a well cared for pond or by keeping a local stream clear of debris and pollution.

, Lizards eat a range of insects and they're enjoyable to watch as they sun themselves in the garden. Provide lots of hiding spaces for them by adding large rocks and nooks and crannies in your garden.

, There are a number of food solutions that you can produce for animals, especially during the leaner months of winter. Remember that it's important to feed the right food, and to not overdo the feeding. Some suggestions include:

Leaving berries on the bottom of bushes for local ground-feeding wildlife to enjoy.

, What you may have considered a pest animal may turn out to be something you've allowed to happen, such as not using adequate fencing, planting the wrong plants, or leaving your garden too open, etc. If you can make the fixes and let wildlife be, then every being is better off for the space to live and be.


Remove invasive plant species from your garden. Often these are a cause of attracting unwanted animals and their further spread harms the local biodiversity.

Insert the plants, along with any additional soil needed, into the teacup.,
Water the teacup garden as necessary.,
Determine whether you'd like to add more features to the teacup garden.,
Create mushrooms with air-dry modeling compound.,
Form the base of miniature houses with the compound.,
Use a toothpick to add fine details to the base of the house.,
Add a roof and finish the house.,
Paint your models.,
Add the models to your teacup garden.,
Decide where to place the teacup garden.,
Consider making a display of several teacup gardens together.",How to Plant a Teacup Garden," If you don’t have a supply of teacups already in your cupboard that you’re willing to sacrifice for this project, you’ll need to purchase some. You can find inexpensive cups at your local thrift or secondhand store.Or, look in antique stores for older, delicate teacups or sales at department or home-ware stores; the sales can be especially useful for mismatching and loose teacups sold at discount prices.

Purchase teacup and saucer combos. You can use the saucer as a drip tray to catch water that leaks through the drainage hole that you’ll drill into the bottom of the cup later.The saucer can be sourced from somewhere else, provided it complements the teacup nicely.;
, Place a small X of masking tape in the center of the bottom of the cup. Lightly tap a drill bit at the center of the X with a hammer until a small dent is created.Ensure that this tap is very light, or the cup can shatter., Before drilling, protect your eyes with safety glasses. Insert the bit into the drill. With moderate pressure, drill at the dent at a low speed until the drainage hole is formed.

Be patient while drilling. This process may take up to five minutes or more. Applying too much pressure could cause the teacup to crack.
Place a piece of scrap wood under your cup while drilling. This way, if you suddenly punch through the cup, you don’t accidentally drill into your work surface.
To reduce friction and the chances of damaging the teacup, irrigate the hole with a little water, as you're drilling. Spray bottles and eyedroppers work well for applying water in this fashion., Prioritize plants that are resilient and hearty. Generally, alpine plants and succulents work well for teacup gardens.These require little water and can thrive even in small containers. Suggestions for suitable alpine and succulent options include:Alpine plants: Thrift (Armeria juniperifolia), winter aconite (Eranthis cilicica), fritillary (Fritillaria uva-vulpis), primrose (dwarf Primula marginata), saxifrage (Saxifraga), stonecrop (Sedum species), and others.Succulents: Moon cactus (Gymnocalycium mihanovichii), aloe, small hens and chicks (Sempervivum tectorum), baby jade or hobbit jade (Crassula ovata), zebra plant (Haworthia fasciata), blue waves (Echeveria), and similar small succulent varieties., Alpine plants and succulents have adapted to severe, often arid or semi-arid climates, so too much water can be harmful to them. Fill the bottom third of the teacup with small pebbles, to prevent the buildup of excess water., Add soil to the teacup until it is about three-quarters of the way full. Remove plants from their containers gently. Brush excess potting mix off the plant root balls. Create a small hole in the soil with your finger, then insert the plant's roots. Fill in additional soil as necessary.The ideal depth for the root holes of specific plants should be indicated on the care instructions that came with your plant. When in doubt, look this information up online with a keyword search for the relevant plant.
To ensure that the plant has enough nutrients in the teacup garden, mix potting soil with fertilizer separately before adding it to the teacup. The amount of fertilizer needed should be indicated on the fertilizer's label directions (and possible also the plant's label).
When topping off the teacup with soil, refrain from adding too much soil. The soil should not cover the bottom foliage of the plants, as this can cause disease or rotting., After planting, water your plants well, but do not saturate the soil. After watering, check the care instructions for the plants, to determine how frequently they need to be watered. Different plants have varying watering needs.

If you don’t plan on using a drip tray, move teacup gardens to the sink when watering and replace them when they’ve drained completely.

, While this section is optional, adding miniature items does create a sweet atmosphere that draws the viewer's eye in for closer observation. You can add already made small items, or you can make some from modeling clay and craft items. The following steps give instructions for making your own miniature mushrooms and houses to add to the teacup., Open the modeling compound and separate off roughly a marble’s worth. Roll this into a ball with your hands. Pinch the ball at one end and pull the compound away from the central ball to form a stem.

Insert a small piece of floral wire through the stem into the cap of the mushroom to extend the wire out of the bottom of the stem.The length of the floral wire will vary depending on the size of the mushrooms. Generally, there should be enough emerging from the bottom to allow you to handle it easily.
You can make longer lasting, sturdier decorations using polymer clay. Follow the clay's directions for the best results. In most cases, polymer clay must be baked for it to harden., Double the amount of compound you used for mushrooms and roll it into a ball with your hands. Shape the ball into a rectangular box for the base of the house., Create little squares for windows with the toothpick. Even small indentations made with the toothpick will appear like tiny windows. Add a central rectangle shape for the front door., Take a marble-sized amount of compound and form it into a triangle or cone for the roof. Push floral wire through the bottom of the rectangle into the roof to connect both pieces.

Extra wire should emerge from the bottom of the house similarly to the sculpted mushrooms.
If the house is connected by floral wire alone, it may be unstable. Increase the stability by adding more floral wires or attaching the top and bottom parts using a dot of hot glue., The floral wire of models can be stuck into floral foam to make painting easier. Add a small amount of paint to a palette or paper plate. Dip your brush in the paint and apply your base layer. For example, for mushrooms this will likely be red. Once the red base layer is dry, you can add white spots.

Add accents to your teacup garden models. Attach Spanish moss to the roofs of the houses with a little hot glue.
Feel free to experiment with different colors. Coordinate your color schemes with the natural colors of your plants., Simply stick the floral wire into an open patch of dirt in the teacup garden to add any model to it. Arrange several houses together to make it look like you have a miniature village tucked away in your teacup garden., It can be either an indoor or an outdoor garden, although it needs to be sheltered if outside, to prevent breakage or over-drying of the plants, since they're growing in only a little soil. Most teacup gardens are kept indoors but there is no harm placing them on a sheltered patio, balcony or even in a herb or kitchen garden area., One teacup garden alone is fine but you can create even more impact and interest by arranging several teacup gardens together. Some ideas for doing this include:

Use a tiered cake stand. Place one teacup garden on each tier of the cake stand. Decorate the cake stand as preferred, such as with dried flowers and moss.
Place a row of teacup gardens together, such as along a shelf or on a table. Either keep to the same pattern of teacup or vary the teacup patterns but ensure they complement each other well.
If the teacup is on its own attached saucer, include it on a coffee table or other display table atop a strong, strategically placed pile of books you're purposefully displaying. This can help to suggest the ""eclectic country cottage"" look.
If placing on the patio, display on planter shelves or some other shelf place. As this is delicate, it should be somewhere safe from being bumped or trodden on.
Add one or two teacup gardens to your fairy garden, if you have one. The fairies will love it.

What flowers are native to your area? If you're not sure, go to a local gardening store and ask for a native wildflower mix, or do some research online before ordering seeds. If you don't want your garden to be completely wild, choose at least a few species that will complement the rest of your garden and attract bees.


The more wildflowers you plant, the more bees you'll attract, and the better your garden will grow. Planting wildflowers is beneficial in more ways than one!
Aim to plant a great diversity of flowers with a range of shapes and textures, not just one or two types. The more diverse your garden is, the better it will support different bee species as well as other beneficial insects and wildlife.;
, Flowers with a single row of petals, rather than flowers with more than one row, are more attractive to bees. Single-petaled flowers have more pollen than other flowers, so they provide a little more food for hungry honey bees. It's also easier for bees to reach the pollen when there is only one row of petals to crawl across.Here are a few flowers bees particularly love:


Asters
Calliopsis
Clover
Cosmos
Crocuses
Dahlias
Foxglove
Geraniums
Hollyhocks
Hyacinth
Marigolds
Poppies
Roses
Snowdrops
Sunflowers
Zinnias

, These colors attract bees more than pinks, oranges and reds do. Your garden doesn't have to be exclusively yellow, blue and purple, but having a good amount of flowers with these hues will keep the bees buzzing in your yard.

, If all of your flowers bloom at the same time, the bees will have a feast, then run out of food before the summer's end. Plant a variety of flowers that will bloom throughout the spring, summer, and into the fall to keep the bees in your neighborhood fed and happy.

, Berries, melons, squash, cucumbers, and fruit trees, especially cherry trees, all produce fragrant flowers and fruit that are attractive to bees. Bees are beneficial to these plants, so providing them in your garden will be a treat for you both.Bees adore these fruits and vegetables:


Blackberries
Cantaloupe
Cucumbers
Gourds
Cherry trees
Peppers
Pumpkins
Squash
Strawberries
Watermelons

, If you have space for a little herb garden, that's another great way to attract bees. Mints attract certain types of bees, as do sage, rosemary, thyme, bee balm, and a number of other herbs.Here's a list of herbs that bees love, for your reference:


Bee Balm
Borage
Catnip
Coriander/Cilantro
Fennel
Lavender
Mints
Rosemary
Sage
Thyme

, If your grass is close-clipped, every stick has been picked up, and there's not a muddy spot to be found, bees will have trouble finding a home in your yard, no matter how many wildflowers you plant. Bees are wild creatures who need a wild habitat to thrive. If you want them to take up residence in your yard, do the following:


Allow for some open, meadow-like spaces in your yard and garden.
Leave an area un-mowed and let wild clover grow. If you don't have clover in your yard, scatter some white clover seed over the area in the fall.
Leave a small brush pile and some leaves lying where they fell. Bees will use them to make a home.
Leave patches of exposed dirt that turn to mud when it rains. Some bees live underground and will thank you for access to the mud they need.

, Bees have trouble using birdbaths, because they aren't able to land in deep water. They need an island to land on so they can walk to the edge and take a drink or a bath without drowning. To make a bee bath, take a wide, shallow dish or tray and line the edges with flat rocks. Pour water over the rocks and into the bottom of the tray. Place it in your garden near the flowers that attract the most bees. The bees will be able to land on the rocks and access the water.

, Rotting vegetation and stumps are great shelters for bees. More and more backyard gardeners are installing hives and other bee shelters to provide nesting spots for bees. If you're serious about attracting bees to your yard and helping them thrive, this option might be something to consider. You can start by building a small bee ""house"" using the following method:


Take a small wooden box and paint it a bright color, preferably white, yellow, bright blue or purple. Use organic paint so the bees won't get sick.Layer the box with nesting tubes, standing them upright. You can buy them from a garden store or make your own by rolling brown craft paper around a pencil, pinching off the end and holding it together with tape, leaving the ends open.Fill the box to the top with these tubes standing upright, so that the exposed holes are open for the bees to climb in.
Turn the box on its side. Be sure you've used enough tubes so that they don't slip out when you move the box. Hang from a tree or a post at eye level in an area sheltered from rain.
Dig up an area of the ground nearby to expose dirt and clay the bees can use to build their nest., Bees are susceptible to pesticides and other chemicals sprayed and used in gardens. Aim to have a pesticide-free garden and use pest-ridding remedies that are natural and not reliant on chemicals. If you do spray plants, only do so after dusk, when pollinators are least active, avoid using chemicals known to harm bees.


Integrated pest management combines many different methods of pest control to reduce the need to use pesticides. Research integrated pest management methods to find the right system for your yard.

, Trees provide large amounts of food for bees when they are in full bloom. They are also a beautiful addition to the landscape.If you are in North America, some good trees include:

American Basswood
Southern Magnolia
Sourwood
Redbud
Crabapple
Locust
Serviceberry
Tulip Trees

Attach the bat house to the intended site.",How to Attract Bats to Your Yard," There are two broad types of bats, and each have different appearances and characteristic.The bats that inhabit the temperate regions of Europe and North America all fall within the family Microchiroptera (roughly, ""small bats""). Other than their small size (which is more of a common trait rather than a defining characteristic), they are physically unique from their cousins in that they tend to have short noses or muzzles, smallish eyes, and larger ears.
Megachiroptera is the suborder that represents most of the larger bat species of the world, but they are generally restricted to the tropical environments that stretch from Australia to South Asia and on to the Mediterranean. The species which make up this group tend to have longer muzzles and, some would say, even a vaguely rat-like or canine appearance. Because of this, several species native to Australia and Southeast Asia are commonly referred to as ""flying foxes."";
, If you want to attract bats to your home, the likeliest way is to guarantee a ready supply of food.The small bats that occupy much of the temperate regions fly at night and use echolocation to find the flying insects that make up most of their diet. If you do not have insects outside of your home at night, you may not be able to attract bats.
Larger tropical bats live primarily on a diet of fruit and nectar. They may search widely over the course of a year looking for ripening fruits or flowering plants.

, While food is the dominant factor in the ability of bats to thrive in an environment, they do also require shelter. This, too, differs by type.


Small insect-eating species tend to live in caves or in the hollow of a tree. Many species crowd very closely together, which can help them retain heat. Because they like to stay in enclosed spaces, many of them can be enticed to live in specially constructed bat houses.
The flying foxes and other larger fruit bats usually roost in very dense concentrations in a relatively small section of forest. Because of the sounds, smells, and overall destruction that can come from hosting a horde of several thousand of the bats, in most areas their roosts are considered a nuisance to be removed., If your goal is in fact to attract bats to your yard, you should consider how the needs of the animals fit with the environment you have created. Ask yourself these questions:


Are there places for the bats to stay or rest? If not, you will not have bats that live on your property.
Are there potential food sources? The most common bats to visit backyards are usually insect eaters. If there are no insects due to the use of pesticides, you will not likely have bats.
Are there their irritants that may discourage bats from coming to your yard? For example, many of the insect-eating bats use a combination of echolocation and passive listening to determine the location of the insects they prey upon. If you are in a loud neighborhood, those species would not be effective hunters and would stay away., A bat house does not need to be large, but when considering a potential location there are a few points you should keep in mind.


The house should be placed at a point roughly 15 feet off of the ground and inaccessible to climbing predators.
The house should be placed in a location that receives sunlight for most of the day.

, In nearly all ways that it can, a bat house will differ from the bird houses with which most people are so familiar. Here is a list of the basic characteristics:


Unlike birdhouses, the opening for entrance and exit will not be at the front. Instead, there should be a long open strip along the bottom. The entrance and the back wall of the bat house should be covered in a kind of mesh that the bats can climb with their their claws.
It should not be cube shaped (as is common for many bird houses) but instead be a very wide, fairly tall, flat box. Keep in mind that you are not making this house for a single bat or even a pair of bats. Many bats rarely settle down for the day in groups of less than a dozen. According to those who have customized bat houses based upon studies of behavior, the smallest bat house should have exterior dimensions of roughly 13 1/2 inches wide, 3 3/4 inches deep, and 20 inches tall (with an additional 4 or 5 inches of the back wall extending below the floor to the entrance, providing something for the bats to latch on to).
There should be several narrow open strips along the lower portions of the sides to to vent air from the box. Because they often rest in densely packed groups, the heat they generate and CO2 they release can make a bat house unlivable very quickly.

, These are the primary tools you will need:


A pole (optional) on which you will mount the house when completed.
Lumber, including 3/4 inch plywood and that has been treated to make it water resistant.
Mesh.
Screws (several sizes).
Screwdriver.
Saw.
Staple gun.

, The largest piece should be used as a back wall for the bat house. It is a good idea to cut out notches in the front and sides to serve as ventilation slits before you finish assembling the bat house.


All ventilation slits should be made no larger than 1/4 of an inch. If the slits are slightly greater than that, they could allow too much cold air in. If the slits are 1/2 an inch in size or more, it would allow small birds to take over the house as a nesting area for themselves and exclude bats altogether.
The roof should be long enough to extend from a position above the back wall to a place several inches beyond the front wall. It can be installed to meed the back and front walls at a 90 degree angle, but if you want to roof to be at a 30 degree angle it will have to longer. You may also want to cut the roof, front wall, and back wall to an angled edge on one side so they will fit together smoothly.

, The largest plank will serve as the back of the bat house. Staple the mesh in place.


You may need to cut the mesh to fit the plank. It should be cut smaller than the width of the plank, as it should not be between the joints that connect the back to the sides and roof. However, the mesh should extend to the bottom of the plank.

, The floor should be attached to the front side only. The floor should be narrow enough that it will not touch the back wall when the house is fully assembled. The gap should be 3/4 of an inch in order to allow the bats to enter through the bottom.

, Drill pilot holes using a small drill bit before you attempt to screw the pieces in place. Use a minimum of two screws per side.

, Again, drill pilot holes before attaching the roof. Screw the roof in place into the back and front walls. Use a minimum of two screws per side.

, Painting or staining the bat house will provide an additional seal and ensure that the wood will last longer.

, While you could screw directly from the bat house into the target site, it may be best to attach some kind of mounting bracket that will hold the house in place but allow you to easily move it if you so choose. If you have decided to mount it on a new pole, do so before you anchor the pole into the ground.

Use a sprinkler hose or a soaker hose for regular lawn watering.",How to Choose the Right Garden Hose," Garden hoses measure from 10 feet (3 meters) to over 100 feet (30 meters) in length.


Determine how far you will need the water to reach to decide on the length you need.
Get a standard size of 25 feet (7.6 meters), 50 feet (15 meters), 75 feet (22.8 meters), or 100 feet (30 meters), unless you have distant watering needs.;
, Most hoses are 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter and can provide about 9 gallons (34 liters) of water per minute.


Get a thicker hose to deliver more water. They can be 5/8 inches (1.6 cm) or even 3/4 inches (1.9 cm) in diameter. The thicker the hose, the less water pressure you lose over distance.

, Most garden hoses are vinyl or rubber.


Choose a vinyl hose if you live in a mild climate and have only light watering to do. Vinyl often costs less.
Choose a rubber hose for more durability and to handle extreme weather conditions. They are heavier and may cost more.
Look for a hose that is reinforced with several layers if you need extra resilience. If your yard has a lot of equipment, furniture or sharp objects that you may drag the hose over, the right garden hose might be one with a mesh covering on the outer layer, which can help protect against snags and punctures.

, A standard hose that is reliable, easy to use, and 50 feet (15 meters) in length will cost between $25 and $50. You can find a less expensive hose for around $10, or a more expensive hose for up to $100, if that is what you need.

, Water pressure is controlled from the hose with a nozzle attached to the end. The nozzle can be twisted to produce a fine spray or a strong stream of water. For the most flexibility in your watering, choose an adjustable nozzle.


Choose a brass nozzle if you want something less prone to leaks or damage.
Choose a plastic nozzle if you want something that tightens onto the hose easily and creates less wear and tear on the hose.

,


Roll the hose up and hang it on a reel to store it when you are not using the hose.
Choose a wall mounted reel, or a cart or wagon style that can move through the yard with you.

, Some consumer groups and testing agencies have detected carcinogens in some of the recycled materials used to make garden hoses.


Prevent bacterial growth with antimicrobial protection if you have children who will drink from the hose, or you are using the hose to fill up a swimming pool for kids.

, Made with a 6-ply construction and a reinforced cord, this is a power hose that has foam inner layers in order to maintain flexibility. It costs about $18, and if you do not use it for commercial purposes, you will never have to replace it.

, Constructed of rubber, including a rubber covering that is resistant to abrasions, this hose offers a high burst strength and can be used with extremely hot water.

, A sprinkler hose can be left on the ground in one place, and provide a light watering, through a series of holes, to the surrounding garden or lawn. A soaker hose lays on the ground or just beneath the ground, and allows water to saturate the soil.

Apart from that, select a garden store that you wish to go for shopping. If you want to save your time, you can choose to shop at online garden store where you will also get a chance to discover a wide variation of stuff, which you may not find at bricks and mortar store.;
, Ensure you will be comfortable working with it, since you will have to do a lot of lifts and digs and pulls. Look for items that are lightweight with wide handles as it will give you proper grip to hold. After you have received your product, trying the product is indeed very important especially if you have a small hand, weak grip or difficulty moving your hand.

, While buying garden products, check the length of the item to ensure it allows you to work without bending too much or pressuring your back. Working with a good posture in the garden will help avoid stresses, aches and strains. Therefore, consider choosing a product that will give you comfort, while also help you accomplish task effectively.

, Finding a quality product between the jumbles of various brands and types of items at the garden store can be a bit tricky. However, you could sort out the trouble by deciding whether you are looking for durability or are fine with replacing the product. Read online reviews that will give you a gist about the product. If you find the reviews to be positive, then there's a green signal for you. Also, find out how long the manufacturer's guarantee will last.


If you want the product to last longer, check the material it is made of. This will let you know whether it is worth purchase or not. For instance, if you are looking for lightweight tool, a fibre, aluminum or plastic tool can be ideal for you. Stainless steel tools slide easily through the soil and is also easy to clean. If you are searching for the strong, robust, durable equipment, then a traditional forged steel tool is the thing for you.

, For gardening, you cannot always rely on manual garden equipment. For task like grass trimming, you can use power tools, which is an easier way to complete the job. These products are either battery-operated or need mains power to run them. Buying them depends on your requirement and whether you are comfortable using it or not. Power tools are certainly heavy, so decide if you can cope with the weight. Nevertheless, it is an easiest option for trimming hedges and grass. Also, always consider using residual circuit breaker when you are working with mains powered products.

, They can be the best option as all you will have to do is buy a handle with a suitable handle for you and then get separate tool head like fork, brush, trowel etc. To switch the tools, you will simply have to adjust the tool head over the handle and get started with it. These tools are expensive, but it gives you an added benefit of using the heads with long and short handles, depending on your work.

Assess your needs.,
Look for a design that is user-friendly and good for your back.,

Look for comfortable hand grips.,
Shop for wheelbarrows in local hardware stores and national home improvement chains.,
Browse selections online.,
Ask about warranties and return policies.,
Ask about the best way to care for and maintain your wheelbarrow.",How to Buy a Wheelbarrow," Wheelbarrows come in homeowner and contractor grades. Most recreational gardening can be done with a homeowner's wheelbarrow. Contractor grades are bigger, with more support in the tray to accommodate larger loads.


Decide if you want a metal or plastic tray. Metal trays are sturdier, but can be loud during loading and unloading, and often make the equipment heavier to maneuver. Plastic trays are lighter and quieter.
Buy a wheelbarrow with the right load capacity for your needs. Consider how much dirt, mulch and other gardening materials will be hauled. Most standard wheelbarrows have a capacity of around 200 lbs. (90.7 kg). The larger tubs have a greater capacity for their loads and can hold more weight.
Choose a wheelbarrow with 1 wheel or 2. A model with 1 wheel will have an easier time turning and navigating but may have trouble balancing. A model with 2 wheels will provide more stability, but may be clumsier to turn.;
,


Assess the weight distribution of the wheelbarrow. Most models require the user to bear from 15 to 30 percent of the load's weight. Make sure the tray of the wheelbarrow you buy will evenly distribute its contents, so your back and arms do not strain unnecessarily.
Test the wheelbarrow by placing heavy objects and bags of dirt or rocks into the tray. This will give you a feel of how the weight feels to you when you lift the handles.
Check for sturdy wheels. Test the wheels with some weight inside the wheelbarrow to make sure they do not wobble or cause tipping.

, If your yard is uneven, buy a wheelbarrow with enough space between the bottom of the tray and the ground.

, If you are working in a small area with little room to move, make sure your wheelbarrow can turn quickly and in cramped spaces.

, Most handles are wood or metal. Look for rubber coverings on the handles, which will make gripping the handles easier and more comfortable.

, Try out several different models, and be sure to test them out when they are holding a good amount of weight.

Determine which types of garden tools you need.,
Visit a garden or home store that employs garden professionals.,
Pick up each garden tool that interests you.,
Make sure the garden tool construction is solid.",How to Buy Basic Garden Tools," Each basic garden tool does a different job, so it's important to know which tools you need before you begin shopping.

A hoe helps you scrape the surface of the soil, which you'll need to do when preparing your garden plot. There are flat hoes and loop hoes, both of which help smooth the soil. The flat hoes also function as a small chopper if you need to break up clumps of soil or pull up small plots of weeds.



 


Trowels are basic garden tools used by gardeners. These mini shovels are perfect for digging small holes for transplanting seedlings, pulling up small patches of weeds, and providing leverage when pulling larger plants out of pots.






A handheld cultivator is essential for breaking up clumps of soil away from roots and root vegetables. This tool resembles a small rake with curved tines, although there are long-handled cultivators that have a couple of spinning blades attached at the end. Either will perform good cultivation, but the handheld version gives you more control.






A shovel is used to overturn large plots of earth and to dig holes to plant trees and shrubs.






Garden rakes are essential for leveling soil and mixing addendums, such as lime and calcium, into nutrient deficient soil. A metal garden rake can handle these heavy-duty tasks better than a plastic leaf rake.






Pruners work to trim back trees and shrubs. There are both handheld and long-handled versions, with the long-handled style allowing you to get closer to thorny bushes or reach higher branches.





;
, Employees at a mass retailer may not have the knowledge to help you buy garden tools.

, It's important that the tools feel comfortable in your hands and not too heavy. Since garden tools can last for years with proper care, you want a set that's easy to work with.

, While at the store, check that the tool doesn't bend easily, and the handle is securely attached.

Choose your pot liner material.,
Measure the liner against the pot.,
Trim your liner.,
Cut drainage holes in the bottom of the liner.,
Fill your liner with potting soil.,
Place your plant in the soil.,
Place your pot in sunlight and water it regularly.",How to Make Pot Liners for Plants," The most common materials are plastic and fabric, such as burlap. Smaller plants can even use coffee filters.The material you use simply depends on the size of the pot you’re lining and what material you have at your disposal. Look around your house for material you can repurpose into pot liners.


Plastic milk gallons, bottles, and similar items can be great pot liners. You can cut off the spout, wash out the inside, and nestle the body of the jug or bottle into a similarly sized pot.
You must use a material that you can poke holes in. It is critical that water can drain from your pot liner.;
, In other words, place your liner within the planter and use a writing utensil to mark the places you’ll need to cut or trim. For example, if you are using a piece of burlap, place it within the planter and mark where the burlap extends beyond the rim of the planter. If you’re using an old plastic carton, mark where you’ll cut the plastic so that it nestles discreetly into the pot.The liner can fit all the way to the bottom of your planter, but it doesn't have to. If you have a very deep pot, you might not want to fill the entire thing with soil. If you create a pot liner that is sturdy and strong enough to hold your soil and plant, you can always try creating one that hangs from the rim of the planter without actually going all the way to the bottom. The planter or pot will appear to be completely full, but only the liner will actually be full.

, Typically, you will want to cut it so that it’s not easily visible, and it appears that the plant is directly placed in the decorative pot or planter. However, you should leave enough material so that you can grasp it when you need to pull out the liner from the pot. Using sharp scissors, cut the liner material along the marks you made against the planter. Place it in the pot, and double check if you need to trim again.


If you’re using a fabric liner, such as burlap, try letting the liner show for a decorative, rustic look.
You can leave excess material on either side of the liner so that they act almost as handles when you need to pull the liner out of the planter or pot. Just make sure that you practice pulling the liner out of the vessel a couple times before you fill it with heavy soil. You need enough material to get a sturdy grasp.

, The holes should be dispersed evenly along the bottom of the liner, and they should be big enough just to let water drain out but not so big that you are losing chunks of soil every time you move the pot. That will defeat the purpose of your liner! The drainage holes are absolutely crucial for healthy plants. If the roots are constantly soaked, they cannot get the air they need. Plants often die from sitting in stagnant pools of water and developing rot.Whether you’re using plastic, fabric, of filters, you must cut or poke holes into the bottom.


This is another huge benefit of using pot liners. When you’re planting in a pot or planter that does not have drainage holes, the pot liner will allow you to lift the plant out of the pot, let the roots drain properly, and place it back into the pot.

, The potting soil you use will depend on the plant. A good soil will hold moisture and nutrients at the roots, while still allowing them to breathe. You can find various potting soils at any store that sells gardening supplies. Look for ones that specifically contain peat moss, pine bark, and perlite or vermiculite.Fill the pot about half way before placing the plant.


It is important to buy soils that are specifically for potting. Things like garden soil and mulch were not created for planting in containers.
Leave two or three inches between the top of the soil and the lip of the pot.

, The largest plant should go in the center of the pot, and smaller plants can go closer to the perimeter.After you’ve transferred your plant into the potting soil, add more soil so that the roots are fully covered.The soil shouldn’t be packed extremely tightly— “fluffy” soil is the best soil for growing in pots.

, However, be cautious of overwatering. Touch the surface of the soil, and add water whenever it feels dry. Slowly add water until there is water running from the drainage hole. Ideally, there is a drainage hole in your decorative pot or planter. If not, you will need to lift the liner and plant, drain the pot, and put the liner and plant back down into the pot.The entire root zone should be damp, but not constantly soaked. Ventilation and drainage are crucial.

Sargentii, which has green foliage and spreads to 7 feet (2.1 m)
Plumosa Compacta, which spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m) and has gray-green foliage in the summer and bronze-purple foliage in the winter
Wiltoni or Blue Rug, which spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m) and has silver-blue foliage
Shore juniper, which has yellow-green foliage and spreads to 8 feet (2.4 m)


Medium growing varieties reach heights between 2 and 5 feet (0.6 and 1.5 m). Several common cultivars include:

Sea Green, which has arching dark green foliage that spreads out as far as 8 feet (2.4 m)
Saybrook Gold, which spreads to 6 feet (1.8 m) and has bright gold needle-like foliage
Holbert, which has blue-tinted foliage that can spread as wide as 9 feet (2.7 m)


Large growing varieties tend to reach heights between 5 and 12 feet (1.5 and 3.7 m). A few example include:

Aureo-Pfitzerana, which has yellow-tinted light green foliage that spreads as far as 10 feet (3 m)
Pfitzeriana, which has bright green foliage that spreads out to 10 feet (3 m)
Blue vase, which has steel blue foliage that grows out to 5 feet (1.5 m)

;
, If you want to add juniper to your garden, you should buy young juniper plants from a local garden center.Juniper plants can be grown from seed or propagated through cuttings, but the process is time-consuming and difficult, so it is not recommended for the average gardener.
It is also more difficult to find seeds and cuttings than it is to find a young established plant.

, Junipers do best with full sun, but they can also survive well in partial shade.


Areas that are mostly shaded should be avoided. Junipers planted in the shade tend to open up and thin out. They may also face more problems with pests and diseases.
You should also avoid sites that are directly next to lawn sprinklers or similar sources of irrigation. Heavy, frequent watering can drench the soil too severely for your juniper plant., Most juniper varieties tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, but the soil must be well-draining. If it isn't, you should amend the soil to improve its drainage abilities before planting your juniper.


The pH of the soil does not matter much for most varieties.
Most varieties can manage well in dry, clay-based soils and standard soils. Some can even grow in sand or notably salty soils.
If the soil is heavy and drains poorly, you should dig several buckets of gravel or grit into the intended planting area prior to the planting period. Either material should help improve drainage conditions.
While it is not necessary, if you want to make the soil more nutrient-dense, you may also wish to add a bucket of organic material, like leaf mold, rotted manure, or compost. Dig it into the planting site shortly before you intend to plant the juniper.

, Thoroughly water the juniper in its container, soaking the soil and making it more compact.Feel the soil in the container before you do this. If it already seems very moist and very compact, you should skip this step.
Watering the soil reduces the amount of air in the container and makes it easier to remove the root ball.

, Use a shovel or spade to dig a hole that is twice as wide and at least as deep as the container the juniper plant is currently in.


There needs to be plenty of space. If you make a hole that is just barely big enough, the roots may not settle and establish themselves well.

, Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer into the soil for every 1 gallon (4 L) plant.


Note that a 10-10-10 fertilizer refers to a blend containing equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
You should either mix the fertilizer into the soil at the bottom of the hole or spread it around the outside of the hole. Do not lay the fertilizer directly inside the planting hole.

, If the plant is in a disposable plastic container, carefully tip the container on its side and press around the outside to loosen the soil and root mass inside. You should be able to carefully slide the entire soil mass out of the container with your hands or shovel.


If the plant is not in a disposable plastic container, you may need to loosen the soil around the sides of the container by gliding your shovel around the inner perimeter.

, Use your hands or a dull knife to separate the individual roots from the compacted mass. Loosen as many of the roots as possible without damaging too many.


You do not need to tease out all of the roots, but the longer ones at the bottom of the root ball should be loosened from the mass. This will help the roots spread into the surrounding soil as you plant the shrub.

, Place the root ball in the center of the hole you dug. The top of the root ball should be level to the surface of the soil around the hole.


The soil level should be about the same as it was in the pot. If you discover that the planting hole is too deep, take the plant out and add more soil before putting it back in. If the hole is too shallow, remove the plant and dig the hole deeper before returning it.

, Hold the shrub steady and upright while you fill in the hole around it with some of the soil you removed while digging the hole.


You can also add some organic matter during this time, but that is strictly optional.
Pat down the soil with your hands or feet to settle it and remove any air pockets. Do not stamp the plant into the ground, however.

, When junipers are planted too close together, a thick layer of foliage can form, causing problems with air circulation. As a result, the plants are more likely to face problems with pests and diseases.


This can be a problem for all juniper varieties, but it is especially problematic for horizontal growing varieties.
The exact amount of space you need to leave in between juniper plants will vary based on the type and size of the variety you choose. Consider how far the shrub spreads and space the plants wide enough apart to prevent them from spreading into each other.

, Give the plant plenty of water immediately after you finish planting it. Doing so will help the plant establish itself while further compacting the soil.


Continue to water the plant twice a week for the first month to help it establish itself.

, Established juniper plants only need to be watered during periods of severe drought.


These plants are fairly drought tolerant, so you should be able to leave them alone during minor droughts.
Junipers can actually weaken if you water them too often. Soggy soil and water-logged roots make the plant more susceptible to diseases and pests.

, Fertilizer should be mixed into the soil around the junipers once in the early spring. Apply fertilizer once more in the late summer.


Use 1/2 lb (225 g) of fertilizer per 100 square feet (9.23 square meters).
For best results, apply the fertilizer immediately before an anticipated rainfall. If this is not possible, water the area thoroughly after application.
Select a 16-4-8 or 12-4-8 fertilizer. These two types have a large amount of nitrogen (represented by the ""16"" and ""12""), which helps the juniper produce more chlorophyll to grow faster. The phosphorus (""4"") is minimal since phosphorus primarily helps with flowering ability. The potassium (""8"") is mid-range and helps protect the plant from disease while improving root development., You only need to prune old, dead foliage that builds up underneath creeping juniper varieties. Clearing out dead wood improves air circulation, leading the a healthier plant.


You can also prune the tips of the plant as they bud to limit the height and reach of the plant.
If the plant becomes too bushy or dense, you can thin out some of the older wood, as well.
Wait until new growth has begun to sprout in the spring before doing any pruning.
Since the needles can be painful, you should wear gloves and long sleeves while pruning the plant.
Do not do any heavy pruning, however. Not much new growth develops on old wood, so if you cut the wood back to its large limbs, that wood will not grow back and the plant will remain bare.

, Junipers can develop problems with insects, including bagworms, spider mites, leaf miners, webworms, and aphids.


Most of these pests can be controlled with pesticide. Wait until you see a problem, then purchase a pesticide labeled for use against that pest and apply as directed on the label.
If you see carrot-shaped bags forming on the needles of your juniper, you likely have a bagworm problem. You can physically remove these bags to prevent the larvae from hatching and eating the needles.
Spruce spider mites can be especially problematic since they come in heavy infestations and cause massive needle browning and death. Chemical intervention is almost always necessary.
Twig borers can be detected when branch tips brown and die. Webworms can be detected when you see heavy webbing and browning of the foliage. Both of these must be treated with pesticides, as well., Junipers planted in ideal conditions rarely have trouble with disease, but some diseases can occur, especially during particularly rainy or shady seasons.


Twig and tip blight can be avoided with proper air circulation, but if you notice it, you should quickly remove any infected branches.Apple cedar rust can develop when apples or crabapples are planted near junipers. If you see it, remove the infected portions of the plant immediately.
Phytophthora root rot results in the sudden death of the entire plant and cannot be treated after it develops. It can be prevented by planting the juniper in raised beds or well-draining soil.
Scale appears on stems and leaves and can be minimized by applying dormant oil in the spring or at first sight of a problem.

Check your chosen vine that you want to cut and see if it is healthy.,
Cut off a piece of vine that's at least 6 inches long, has at least 5 healthy leaves, and has nodes.,
Remove two of the closest leaves to the bottom node.,
Place your cut vine in a jar or container of clean water, only filling the water up to where it covers the bottom one or two nodes.,
Put in a place where there is indirect sunlight, and wait.,
Use potting material that is mostly peat and drains well.Whether your plant is growing outside or indoors in a pot, make sure there is at least six inches of soil-depth in which to grow.,
With your finger, make a hole that will cover the cutting up to half an inch above its roots.,
Water the plant by sprinkling onto the dirt.,
Let the plant grow!,
Water moderately when the soil begins getting dry, not really dry.

,
Get a nice ceramic jar, flower vase, or container that is not taller than the cutting.,
Using pebbles or marbles, fill the container about 75% of the way up.,
Make a ""hole"" through the substrate and place the cutting in it.,
Fill the container with water.,
Let it grow!",How to Clone Pothos," Do not choose a vine with:


Yellowing or decaying of the vine portion
More than a few brown, dried leaves
Black leaves
Decaying/dead growth-tip of the vine;
, Nodes are brown stubs opposite each leaf stem on the vine. Cut close to a node, because this is where the roots will sprout., This will prevent the leaves from rotting when placed in water.

, If you want to, you can add a tiny bit of liquid plant fertilizer. Overdoing fertilizer can be bad for your cutting, so if you don't know exactly how much to put, don't risk it.

, Make sure to check and refill the water level so the node(s) will keep growing roots. Once roots (at least half an inch long) show, you can transplant the cutting quickly if you want your new plant to begin growing in soil.If growing it in water, you can wait to transplant put watch out for stagnating/souring water (pour water out and refill).

,


If using a pot, there needs to be a drainage hole and a water tray underneath.
Using fertilizer is unnecessary, as pothos grows fast and it is optional.

, Place the cutting in the hole and place dirt gently over it to fill the hole. Do not pack down the soil.

, Watering on top of the leaves won't ensure all the water gets down to the dirt. The potting soil should be moderately moist and an inch of topsoil; not ever overly wet. Puddles and mud are not good for the plant.

, With good conditions, with a warm winter climate or re-starting each spring, pothos outside can create a ""carpet"" of leaves. You can use a trellis to encourage the vines to climb; just twine some long vines through/around the structure. Indoors, it can create a curtain of foliage if several vines are placed on a high shelf.,, Even a mason jar will work. The container should allow light to reach all of the leaves. .

, Using gravel sold for aquariums is another great substrate. If using material collected from outdoors, soak, brush and rinse it thoroughly first to get rid of any dirt.

, Gently cover the hole with the rest of the substrate. Choose a fairly long vine to be visually attractive. The roots should be completely covered, and an area up to an inch above the roots can also be covered with substrate (remove leaves that would decay in the water).

, Only add enough so that the roots are covered. Some water visible above the substrate level is fine, but avoid putting a lot of the cutting underwater.

, The vines can make a nice, small centerpiece in a casual room. Check on the water level once a week and refill accordingly.

Choose the right location.,
Keep the humidity high in proximity to your fern.,
Keep the temperature constant.,
Water regularly.,
Fertilize your ferns once a month.,
Remove dead or diseased parts of the fern.,
Transplant ferns after a year or longer.",How to Care for Ferns1," Ferns require lots of shade and ambient (rather than direct) sunlight. Place your plant near a north-facing window; east and west windows let in too much direct sunlight. You can put your fern next to a south-facing window if a north-facing window isn’t available. Keep the plant a bit away from the window, so that it receives more ambient light.;
, High moisture levels in the air are perfect for humidity-loving ferns. There are three ways you can create higher humidity levels for your fern: double-pot your fern, place your fern on a tray full of water, or add a humidifier to your room.









To double pot your fern, select a second pot slightly larger than the pot your ferns are planted in. Fill the pot with moss heavily soaked in water, and then place the second pot inside. Cover the top of the soil and the rim of the inner pot with the soaked moss, and wet it every few days to make sure it is still moist.
You can also place your potted fern on a tray or saucer full of pebbles and fill the tray up to just under the pebbles' surface with water. The water will evaporate and add humidity to the air around the fern.
If you use a humidifier, place it near your fern for the best growth.
Mist your fern with a spray bottle filled with lukewarm distilled water on a daily basis. Try spraying the air above the fern and letting the mist settle onto the leaves, rather than misting the leaves directly.

, Most indoor species of ferns are tropical, although not all require tropical weather. Make sure that the temperature in your home (or at least the room in which the fern is kept) is near 70 °F (21 °C). The ferns can handle temperatures as low as 60, but they won’t thrive as well under low temperature conditions. When in doubt, turn the temperature up.


Consider placing your fern by a window in a bathroom; the temperature and humidity are often higher as a result of showers and baths., Ferns love a humid atmosphere, but they also prefer moist soil as well. Make sure that your fern’s potting mix is always damp (but never soaking). This may mean you water a small amount on a daily basis, rather than heavy amounts irregularly. To determine whether or not your fern needs water, always check the soil dampness before watering.








, Visit your local gardening center and find a house plant fertilizer that specializes in species like ferns; ask an attendant for help, if necessary. Spray this fertilizer onto your ferns on a monthly basis to provide nutrients that the potting mix lacks. You should wait until at least six months after you’ve potted your fern to start fertilizing it, though.

, House-ferns are able to contract some diseases, however they tend to be hardy and don’t succumb to most. If your plant appears diseased, cut off the damaged areas. If your fern begins to die as a result of neglect, do the same by removing the damaged/dead area with a pair of shears. If your whole plant appears diseased, it is best to remove it before it spreads to other house plants.








, Given enough time, any fern will outgrow the pot it was originally planted in. The time between transplants will vary depending on the health of your fern, but you may need to repot it in a larger pot as early as 6 months after originally planting it.







"
"
Plant ferns in the ideal location.,
Keep the soil moist.,
Fertilize the ferns once a month.,
Cut back damaged fronds.,
Transplant if necessary.",How to Care for Ferns2," If you have ferns that are already growing in your garden, you likely won’t need to move them unless they’re showing signs of ill health. Ferns like lots of shade and moisture, and do well under the canopy of a few other larger plants or trees. Plant (or transplant) ferns onto a plot that gets northern sun and no direct sunlight. If ferns are left in an area with direct sunlight, their leaves will burn.

, If it does not rain regularly in your area, you’ll need to water your ferns on a daily basis so that the soil is kept moist. Add a dense layer of pine needle or leaf mulch to the tops of your ferns; about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) thick is ideal. This will help to lock in moisture and keep the rate of evaporation relatively low, so that the air near the ferns is a bit more humid.








, Six months after the original planting, you can begin fertilizing the ferns for added growth. Select an organic fertilizer that is spray-on, and apply it to the ferns (following package directions). Additionally, you can add a layer of compost and mulch to the soil to create a better growing environment for the ferns. Do keep in mind that ferns have a lesser requirement of fertilizer than other common houseplants.

, Ferns don’t have many natural predators outdoors, other than slugs and one or two rare diseases. If, however, you notice that your fern has damaged or diseased fronds, use a pair of gardening shears to cut them back. This will keep the integrity of the rest of the plant, and if it is a disease, prevent it from spreading to other plants.

, Ferns can get quite large over time, and require splitting and transplanting. To divide a large fern into several smaller ferns, carefully dig out the plant and its roots. Carefully break apart the plant into sections; typically, the fern will grow in clumps making it easy to split. Then replant each of these, and water them well."

Decide which plants to use.,
Choose a container.,
Decide where to keep the terrarium.,
Purchasing supplies.",How to Make a Terrarium1," Any low maintenance plant can be used to make a terrarium. Choose plants that will grow well together. Classic plants for a terrarium include (but are not limited to) ferns, mosses, succulents, and cacti.









Pick a plant that will stay small. You could make a terrarium big enough to house a bushy lavender, but it's easier to stick with mini plants. Choose plants that won't outgrow the terrarium container.
Plants that prefer shade are best. Plants inside a terrarium have to be tolerant of low levels of light - if you keep a sun lover in the dark, the plant will be stressed and will die.
Plants tolerant of high humidity. Humidity levels in terrariums rise quickly, so choose plants, like those from rain forests or woodlands, that grow well in such an environment.
If you're a beginner, pick something cheap and easy to grow. Choose a plant that's inexpensive and easy to grow.;
, You will need a glass container that is deep enough for your plants' roots. The container you use can be an old fish bowl or one specially made for growing plants.










Cloches - these have high levels of humidity, and the cloche will need to be raised occasionally to give plants inside a breath of fresh air.

Lantern cloches - though these have high levels of humidity as well, lantern cloches are easier to ventilate.

Bell jars or apothecary jars are a pretty option for a taller terrarium.

Wardian cases - available both closed and not airtight.

Aquariums - aquariums work well as terrariums, and can be left open or fitted with a piece of glass.

Vases, tureens, or compotes - terrariums can still work their magic with an open top, though you will have to water the plants inside any container that isn't airtight.
In this example, a glass bowl similar to a goldfish bowl was used (pictured).

, Terrariums are ultra low maintenance, but in order to remain so they must be placed in an ideal location.










Light: All plants need light, and plants in terrariums are no exception. However, since glass magnifies, choosing direct light is foolhardy. Instead, choose a location where your plant will receive plenty of indirect light. Or you can choose fluorescent lights, but always follow safety rules when purchase gardening-specific lights.

Temperature: Terrariums should be kept inside, in a warm room (mudrooms, cold porches, and other such rooms aren't good options unless you're ready to risk the terrarium freezing). Keeping a terrarium next to a heater or AC unit is also unwise; Avoid extreme temperatures or sudden changes in temperature.

The right surface: Avoid placing a terrarium on easily damaged furniture. Also, avoid places where young or energetic children, or pets, can access it.

, To make a terrarium, you will need:










Potting soil. Choose light soil with lots of drainage, and preferably sphagnum/peat moss included. To check drainage, lightly wet soil and hold it in your fist: when you open your hand, heavy soil will clump, whereas light soil will fall apart.

Pebbles or gravel. Both provide drainage when placed at the bottom of the terrarium, and a neat appearance when placed at the top of a terrarium. Choose stones 1/4 of an inch or smaller for drainage, but choose whatever you'd like for topdressing.

Activated charcoal. Unless the container the plant will be in has a drainage hole, use activated charcoal pieces, which you can purchase from aquarium supply stores or garden centers. This keeps soil fresh.

Sheet moss. Sheet moss is useful when lining the bottom of the terrarium. It provides a ""sponge"" for absorbing excess water.

Gloves. Whenever handling sheet moss, you should be wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt to prevent fungal infection. Gloves are also helpful when handling charcoal.

Decoration Pick any decoration you'd like to add to your terrarium, as long as it won't be damaged by exposure to water. Examples include miniature garden gnomes, shells, rocks, small statues or aquarium decorations.
Avoid adding ""critters"" to your terrarium. These can damage plants and spread diseases.

Create a plan for the paint scheme of your garden ornament before you begin.






Brush all the parts of the garden ornament that you wish to be the same color while you have that paint color available and the paintbrush is full of that color paint.






Clean the paintbrush between colors using tap water or water with a few drops of dishwashing detergent mixed in to it. This is sufficient for cleaning latex paint from the paintbrush, so paint thinner will not be necessary.

, Mix the gravel/pebbles with a generous handful of charcoal. Put a layer about an inch high of this mixture inside the terrarium container.









, Moss will prevent soil from filtering down into the gravel.









, Depending on the size of the terrarium and the length of the plants' roots, you should be adding about two or three inches of soil. Gently pack it down to remove air pockets and level the surface. Dig small holes into the soil where you will put the plants.









, Remove a plant from its container and tease the roots gently apart to remove excess soil. Nestle it carefully into a hole you made previously and add more soil around it, patting it down gently. Repeat with the rest of the plants.








, You can also add moss or pebbles to neaten the top of the terrarium.

, If you see weeds, mold, or sick plants, remove the affected area immediately. Also, remove wilting parts of the plant, such as old flowers.








, If your terrarium is airtight, air it out. Though this usually isn't necessary, if your plants are wilting or there's condensation on the sides of the terrarium, air it out (for example, by propping the container slightly open by putting a rock underneath the edge).

Gather the necessary materials.,
Choose a sunny day for observation.,
Sketch a map of your yard.,
Record observations of the sun at 9:00 AM in yellow colored pencil.,
Record observations of the sun at 1:00 PM in blue colored pencil.,
Record observations of the sun at 5:00 PM in red colored pencil.",How to Make a Sun Chart1," To make this type of sun chart, you will need a piece of paper, a pen/pencil, three different colored pencils/crayons/markers (red, yellow, and blue), and a leisurely day where you can make regular observations of your yard.;
, In order to make the most accurate sun chart you can, you want to make your observations on a sunny day. The time of year is also an important factor. Your yard will have more overall sunlight during the summer than during the fall. For maximum sun exposure, choose a sunny, summer day.


You can repeat this sun chart exercise during the spring, fall, and winter if you want an idea of how much sun your garden gets throughout the year., Draw a basic map of the area that you want to use for gardening. Include the relative locations of anything large enough to cast a shadow such as buildings, fences, and trees.Scale is not important.


Mark out the basic area of where you want to plant your garden as well.

, At 9:00 AM look out at your yard and draw yellow lines marking out the area of the yard that is currently getting sunlight. Sketch the lines with a small space in between.Don’t draw any lines on the map that are in shade.

, Repeat your observations four hours later with a blue colored pencil. If the sun is still shining in the areas marked yellow from the morning observation, add blue to that area. Make blue lines in the areas where the sun has shifted to as well.Again, if there is shaded area, leave that blank.

, The 5:00 PM recording will be your last observation. Using the red colored pencil, make lines that represent the sun for that time of day. If the sun is still in the areas already colored yellow and blue, simply add the red on top.The areas that have all three colors will get the most sun during the day and be best for planting seeds that require at least 6 hours of sunlight a day.
The areas with just two colors are best for plants that need partial shade and partial sunlight.
Areas with one or no color are best for plants that need mostly shade.If you want a more specific sun chart, you can take recordings every two hours instead of every four hours and use more colors to fill it in.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Choose a sunny day for observation.,
Divide your yard into regions.,
Make a chart with the yard regions in rows and time in columns.,
Observe the sun once an hour from dawn to dusk.",How to Make a Sun Chart2," To make this type of a sun chart, you will need a piece of paper, a pen/pencil, and a free day to spend observing the sun in your proposed garden space. You’ll get the most accurate representation of the sun if you take hourly observations, but if you’re not able to do that, make as many observations throughout the day as your schedule allows., To make the most accurate sun chart, you’ll need a nice sunny day. Remember, there are varying amounts of sun depending on the time of year; summer has the most sun, while winter has the least. Try to make your sun chart on a sunny, summer day so you can get a good idea of the maximum amount of sun your garden will get.


You can make multiple sun charts for each season to know what plants to grow.

, For this type of sun chart, you’ll want to divide your garden into separate regions and observe the sunlight in each one. You can split it up however you want. You don’t want the regions to be too large because half of it may be in sunlight and half in shade.


Give your regions distinct names so you remember each one when taking sun observations: Back left corner, front right corner, middle left, etc.

, Label each column with one hour of the day starting with sun-up and ending with sun-down. During the height of summer this will likely be from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM depending on your location. Label each row with the regions you divided the garden into., Each hour, look at where the sun falls in each region of your garden and record it using “sun”, “partial”, “shade”, and “dappled”. “Sun” is when the region is in full sun; “partial” is some shade, some sun; “shade” is no sun; and “dappled” is sunlight through a tree, fence, or shrub.It’s okay if you aren’t able to make observations every hour, but try to take them as close to that as possible for the most accurate sun chart.
Track the sun until it sets.
Use this chart to inform you decisions on the type of seeds to plant and where to plant them.

"
"
Plant fruits, flowers, and vegetables according to their sun/shade needs.,
Move planters around to maximize sun exposure.,
Keep the sun chart to inform future plantings.",How to Make a Sun Chart3," Once you’ve constructed your sun chart, you will have a good idea of what areas of your yard get exposed to light and for how long. This information is crucial in growing a vibrant, healthy garden.


Plants are categorized by their need for sunlight and usually sorted into three broad categories: full sunlight, partial sun/partial shade, full shade. Full sunlight means at least six hours of sun per day and full shade means less than three hours of sun.Plant according to the amount of sunlight an area gets from the observations made in your sun chart.

, Maybe there isn’t one location in your yard that gets enough sun to plant what you were hoping to plant. This can be remedied by planting in a small pot or planter and altering the location of the plant to get the sun it needs. This can be a tedious process, but will allow you to grow plants that need more or less sunlight than your yard can provide.


Note: As the plants grow, the planters will get heavier and be more difficult to move.

, Hang on to your sun chart and use it as a reference the next time you want to do a round of plantings. You might also want to make separate sun charts for the different seasons and refer to those as well.


Keep the sun chart with your gardening tools or in the gardening shed if you have one.

Finished.

",How to Make a Seed Sprouter at Home," There are many different options; all grains and legumes work well as sprouts. Alfalfa and clover are 2 of the most popular seeds for sprouting. Also popular are pumpkin, sunflower, almond and cabbage seeds. Taste and nutritional value are 2 things to consider when choosing a seed variety.;
, The best thing to use is a glass canning jar; pint or quart (half-liter or liter) jars work best. Any glass jar will do in a pinch, though, including empty pickle or jelly jars.

, Rinse the jar and then wipe it dry with a clean cloth.

, This will be used to drain water from the jar. In place of cheesecloth, you could substitute nylon stockings or fine wire mesh. Anything that will let water pass through but won't allow the seeds to pass through is sufficient.

, A few tablespoons (30 ml) or so worth of seeds is appropriate, although there is a wide margin for error. Adding too many seeds will generally result in some of them not receiving enough light to germinate.

, Place the cheesecloth square over the top of the jar, and then use the canning lid ring to secure it. If you are using a jelly or pickle jar, you can secure the cheesecloth tightly with a few rubber bands.

, The next morning, drain all the water from the jar by turning it upside-down over the sink and letting the water run through the cheesecloth.

, Immediately drain the water off (the seeds should be wet, not fully submerged). Shake the jar so that some of the seeds stick to the sides of the jar; this allows them to reap the maximum amount of sunlight. Place the jar in a sunny location, and continue this rinsing routine once or twice a day until the sprouts appear.

, Once the sprouts are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, they are ready to be eaten. They can be enjoyed fresh in a salad or cooked in a stir-fry. Be sure to wash, rinse and dry your sprouting jars before using them again for sprouting. It is best to replace the cheesecloth every once in a while as you continue growing sprouts.

Place some gravel in the bottom of the can.,
Layer potting soil over the gravel.,
Add the plant(s) of your choice to the planter.",How to Make Paint Can Planters," To make the planter, you can use a new or recycled metal paint can. If you are using a used can, you must remove any dried paint inside the container. Use a paint scraper tool to carefully scrape the paint away and discard.You can use any size paint can that you like for your planter.
You can purchase new, unused paint cans at your local hardware store or home improvement center.
If there is still wet paint inside the can, be sure to follow your local municipal guidelines for proper disposal.
If there is any dried paint on the outside of the can, scrape it away as well.;
, Whether you are using a new or recycled paint can for the planter, you must wash it first. Use soap and water to thoroughly clean the interior, and dry it well with a clean rag.Liquid dish washing soap works well to clean the paint can.

, If you are using a recycled paint can, you should remove the label from the exterior. Peel or scrape it off, and use an adhesive remover product to get rid of any residue on the outside of the can., When the paint can is completely clean and dry, turn it over so you can easily reach the bottom. Set a nail against the center of the can and use a hammer to strike it and create a drainage hole in the center.If you are using a large paint can, you may want to add more than one drainage hole. However, one in the center is usually sufficient.

, Once you’ve cleaned and punctured the paint can, choose a spray paint shade to serve as the planter’s base color. Carefully spray the exterior of the can with the paint to cover it an even coat. Allow it to dry throughly for at least 5 to 6 hours.Don’t worry about getting any paint inside the can. It will be hidden when you add the potting soil and plants.
If you are using a recycled paint can and there is any rust on the exterior, use a piece of medium grit sandpaper to buff it away before spray painting it.

, If you aren’t comfortable using spray paint on the can’s exterior, you can use traditional paint and apply it with a brush. For a metal paint can, an oil-based paint is your best option. After you’ve painted the can, allow it to dry for at least 4 to 5 hours.Latex and acrylic paint can also work on the exterior of the paint can.

, After the base coat of paint on the can has dried completely, you can decorate the planter further. Use stencils to add a design with fun shapes, such as flowers, stars, hearts, or polka dots, in other paint colors. Allow the painted design to dry for at least 4 to 5 hours before adding soil to the planter.It’s best to use the same type of paint for the stenciled design that you used for the base color.
If you don’t want to bother with stencils, you can wrap painter’s tape around the can to create stripes on the planter.

, To figure out the proper amount of fabric to cover the can, use a tape measure to determine its circumference. Next, measure the height of the can., Once you know the can’s measurements, mark a piece of fabric in your chosen pattern or color to fit the can’s dimensions. Carefully cut it with fabric scissors so it’s the right size.Depending the size of your fabric, you may need to cut multiple pieces to cover the entire exterior of the can.

, Once you’ve cut the fabric to fit the can, turn it over so its underside faces up. Carefully apply an all-purpose spray adhesive to the fabric, and then wrap it around the can, smoothing it in place.You can use a traditional glue to adhere the fabric to the exterior of the can, but it may cause lumps or dimples.

, Before you add the soil and plants to your planter, it’s a good idea to add some gravel. The gravel will help improve drainage in the planter so the roots aren’t overwatered. Fill the planter with an approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) layer of gravel.Pea gravel is the best option for the planter.

, Once the gravel is in place in the planter, pour some potting soil into the can. You don’t need to fill the entire planter with soil, but you should add at least 10- to 12-inches (25- to 30-cm) so the roots have sufficient space to grow.Potting soil is sometimes sold as potting mix or container mix.
Don’t use soil from your garden or yard even if it’s high quality soil. It is usually too heavy to drain properly in a container.

, When the gravel and soil are in place, you can place the plant(s) in the container. Lift the plant(s) from the nursery container, making sure to support the root ball with your fingers. Set the plant(s) down on top of the potting soil and carefully pat the soil around the roots to cover it.It’s a good idea to water the plant(s) in the nursery container at least one hour before moving it to the planter. That will make it easier to remove it.
Water the plant after you’ve added to the planter. That will help the roots settle into the soil.
If you’re adding more than one plant to your paint can planter, make sure that there’s at least 1-inch (2.5-cm) between their root balls.

Watch for the growth.",How to Make Garden Crafts with Kids3," Buy or harvest quality seeds that you know will grow well over a large area or in poor soils, without needing too much attention. Don't choose any plants that will cause ecological or other damage such as weeds, invasive plants, or ones that have destructive root systems. If you're not sure, find out which plants are problem plants for your area or region; don't just rely on general information because some plants might be ideal in their local environment but a rampant pest in yours.


Consider the entire habitat when selecting the seeds. Do you want seeds that will create an entire new habitat or do you just want seeds that will provide a few varieties of crops or plants? Heather C. Flores suggests that you can use anywhere from one variety of seeds to one hundred different kinds., Discard any seeds that still float – seeds that float are mostly broken or damaged seeds that won't grow or that will have weak genetic stock., There are four main ways to go about making the seed balls:


Method 1. Purchase or secure some rich loam soil, or other clay type soils that can form a stable ball. The soil should be suitable for plants to grow in; make sure it's not too acidic. Shape the pure loam into a golf-sized shape ball using water to make it pliable and insert the seeds into each ball as you go, or sprinkle seeds in prior to shaping balls if easier.
Method 2: Use semi-dry, living compost (not sterilised) and powdered red clay.Mix one part seed mix, three parts compost, and five parts clay. Shape into a round ball with your hands, adding enough water to make it pliable. It should have the consistency of cookie dough.






Method 3. Alternatively, save up small biodegradable cardboard cartons, such as egg cartons or find biodegradable netting, such as old cotton stockings. Fill the egg cartons with the preferred soil and seed mix as above methods outline. Pinch the tips over so that the contents won't fall out. With stockings, you can fill them with a seed and soil mix, then twist, tie and cut them out much like you'd do if you were making sausages.






Method 4. Mix sawdust on a ratio of 5 parts sawdust to 1 part seed with a rapidly biodegradable, non toxic and preferably food safe glue and a small amount of seaweed extract. The mix should not be wet, but moist enough to form a ball. It's better to make this version in small batches.







, Arrange the seed bombs on a dry tarpaulin or on sheets of newspaper laid out in a sheltered area such as a shed.Here they are ready for use.

, If you have a plot with rows already dug for planting, install a ball every few feet (meters), (or as recommended by the seed producer), then cover over with existing soil.


If you are looking to re-vegetate open space with grass or tree seeds, just throwing the seed balls will create a more random, realistic landscape, then bury them sufficiently to retain the moisture for the seed.
If you'd rather store the seed bombs for a bit, keep them in a cool, dark, and dry place for no longer than several weeks.It is best to use them when fresh though, as the seeds might begin to sprout!

, If made correctly, the seedling will be visible within 2-3 weeks, or quicker in warmer conditions. The process doesn't really speed up germination time dramatically, but when the seedling starts growing it has ample nutrients directly at its roots so will grow quicker and more healthily.

You'll also need some glue suitable for ceramics. The bowl and the cup can be purchased from a thrift store if you don't have old ones at home to spare. The paint must be suitable for ceramics.

Check the the bowl sits in a nicely balanced way over the cup or mug before proceeding; it must be a good fit.

, Paint the bowl one color and the cup or mug another color. Allow to dry fully, then paint another layer for a smooth look. Allow to dry. If needed, paint one more layer for good measure.,

For the bowl, paint large round circles in a different color at varied intervals across the bowl. These will appear like mushroom spots when the fairy house is put together.
For the cup or mug, paint a door and two windows. The door should be centered away from the handle and begin from the open end of the cup or mug.

, Carefully glue the bowl (open end facing down) down onto the solid end of the cup or mug. Allow to dry. This forms the little fairy house., If wished, you can twist a piece of artificial plant around the handle to cover it up. A small chimney could be glued on; use a small block of wood (paint it first). Other decorative elements can be glued on, such as pieces of lace for curtains, etc., This will provide a layer of protection for the fairy house. Allow to dry overnight., Let the kids decide where it's best placed."

Consider concreting the flagpole into place.",How to Make a Garden Flag," This project requires a length of tough cloth, some paint or other decorations (such as material for applique), scissors and some fabric glue, a needle and thread, or a sewing machine.


You’ll also need a way to hang your flag. One option is to get a steel, rust-resistant garden flagpole that inserts easily into a flower bed or large planter.
A store like Home Depot will sell these for a few dollars.;
, Burlap makes a good rustic-looking choice for a garden flag.


However, you can also use any type of robust cloth, such as canvas. A heavier cloth will usually hang better.
A place mat from a dollar store also makes a good choice, or you could consider cutting up an old, sturdy canvas bag.

, Bright colors are usually popular when making a garden flag. You can also use burlap or unbleached cotton or canvas for a more rustic look. For inspiration check out a site such as Pinterest or some craft blogs.


With a garden flag that hangs vertically, it isn't all that important that the material can flutter in the breeze.
Consider weighing your fabric down with heavier materials so that it hangs well and displays your design without wrapping around the flagpole.

, Here are some fun ideas to provide inspiration for your garden flag:


Using applique techniques, add your house number or a word that has significance to you onto your canvas using a material that contrasts with the background.
Use fabric paint to draw on your flag.
Use a glue gun to paste objects onto your flag. Ideas include seashells, Christmas baubles, silk flowers or buttons.
Make a patchwork garden flag by stitching clashing prints onto the background using bright contrast yarn for the stitches.
Use stencils and a spray can to quickly create a design on your flag.
Try using the same material or a contrasting material to add a bow or ruffle to your flag.

, It’s best to get your flag stand first so you can measure the material to fit. Cut a length of your main flag material to the width of the hanging bar of your flagpole.


Most flag poles are around 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide on the horizontal pole from which the flag will hang. So cut your flag material to 12 inches (30.5 cm) width (or whatever the appropriate measurement it) or very slightly narrower..

, Most flag poles are around 18 inches (45.7 cm) tall. Allow 4 inches (10.2 cm) length for the hanging flap, then cut your flag material an additional 18 inches (45.7 cm) long i.e. 22 inches (55.9 cm).


If you are growing tall plants underneath the flagpole, consider making the flag shorter in length so it will all be visible above the plants. The main thing is that the material should not touch the ground as it will get wet and muddy.
You might like to double it the flag length to provide extra weight and make it hang better.

, Lay your flag material out on a flat surface. If you are doubling up the material, do that now and glue the two sides together along the left, right and bottom sides.


At the top of your flag, fold over a 4 inch (10.2 cm) piece of material. This will create the pocket that the flag rod will insert into in order to hang your flag.
Glue or stitch along the bottom horizontal side of this flap but do not glue the left and right sides as this is where the flap pole will insert into.

, Now that you have made the main part of your flag, you can do the creative design using the ideas in the section above.


Stitch, glue or paint your design onto the flag background you have created.
A bright design can work very well, but remember some colors may fade over time.

, A fairly sheltered place is usually the best location for your flag. Make sure the flagpole is erected in a secure manner.


Usually it should be enough to drive the standing prongs deep into the earth, but remember the wind may catch your flag and try to topple it over.
You might like to avoid planting the flagpole too near breakable objects such as a terracotta planter or a window just in case it tips over in a storm.

, Slip the top hanging flap of your flag over the horizontal hanging pole of the flagpole. If your flagpole has a loop end, this should be enough to hold the flag in place there.


If the flag doesn't seem secure enough, you can try pinching the hanging flap in a bit and using a safety pin to secure it so it is less likely to come off.

, If your flag is too lightweight it will twist and turn easily. Consider weighing the flag down by stitching a metal rod into the lower edge. This will also help stop your flag twisting itself around the flagpole.

, If you really have trouble getting your flagpole to stand tall without falling over, consider concreting it into place. To do this, dig a hole, insert the flagpole base and temporarily secure it at the right angle using bricks or similar.


Whilst it is held in place, pour concrete or post mix into the hole. Post mix can be easily stirred up in the hole so that’s easy to use. Fill the hole to slightly below the surface.
Once the mix is set, remove the bricks securing the flagpole in position and cover the concrete with dirt to hide it. Now you can hang your flag.

Check the water level every day, and refill the pet when it drops.,
Pour out the excess water from the drip tray every day.,
Turn the pet 180 degrees once a week if you are keeping it next to a window.,
Watch out for mold and mildew.,
Pull the sprouts off when they become unruly and overgrown.",How to Grow a Chia Pet," Take the terracotta pot out of its packaging, and put it into a bucket filled with water. The pet needs to be completely submerged. This will moisten the entire pet, and help the seeds stick to it better.;
, While the pet is soaking, put 2 teaspoons (5 grams) of Chia seeds into ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of water. This softens the seeds, and ""wakes"" them up. The seeds will start growing once they get wet. This will be enough for one pet. Chia pet kits often contain enough seeds for several pets.

, This will help the seeds soak more evenly.You don't need to stir the seeds again after this.

, During this time, the seeds will form a gel-like coating. This will help them stick to the Chia pet.

, After the soaking time is over, take the Chia pet out of the water. Place it on the drip tray, and fill it with fresh water. The drip tray will catch any extra water. It will also protect your desk or windowsill from getting stained.


If you don't have a drip tray, use a plastic dish or lid that is a little bit larger than your pet.

, Make sure that the seeds are somewhat sparse and spread out. You can use your fingers, a small knife, or even a spatula. Try to spread the seeds as evenly as possible; don't let them clump in any one area. If there is a hole in the top of your pet, take care to avoid it. This is where you will be pouring the water.


You may not end up using all of the seeds.If your seeds aren't sticking to the Chia pet, empty the pot, and spread the seeds over it again. Keep the pot empty, and don't water the seeds 2 days., Don't let the bag touch the actual pet, however, or the seeds won't sprout. The plastic bag will help create a mini greenhouse for your Chia pet. Take the bag off after 3 to 4 days, when most of the seeds have sprouted.If you are having troubles getting the bag to stay up, put a long stick inside the watering hole of your pet, then place the bag on top of that. The stick will prop the bag up, like a tent.

, Some gardeners will recommend waiting until the seedlings sprout before moving the pet into a sunny spot., Most Chia pets will have a hole at the top. You will need to pour the water through this hole. Try to use something with a narrow spout, such as a water bottle. If you get any water on the actual seeds, they may slide off.


Some gardeners will recommend not watering the pet for the first two days so that the seeds can stick to the pot., As you water your Chia pet, you may notice some water gathering in the tray. You should pour this water out as soon as possible, or it will become stagnant.

, This will help the seeds grow more evenly. Plants in general tend to grow towards the sun. If only one side of your pet is facing the sun, one side will be bushy and full, and the other will be sparse and thin., White fuzz is normal when Chia seeds first sprout. However, misting the seeds with water will help to reduce the fuzzy appearance, so make sure to do this daily. This fuzz is simply the root hairs, and they will disappear after the first week. If you notice white fuzz after the first week, you will need to start your Chia pet over. Scrape the seeds off the pet first, soak the pet for 30 minutes in a solution made from 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Rinse the pet well with fresh water, and plant your Chia seeds anew., Simply pull them off, and wash the Chia pet well using water and a scrubbing brush. At this point, you can reuse the pet, and plant more Chia seeds.Don't wait until the sprouts turn brown. They will be harder to remove.

Decide what purpose you want your gardening journal to fulfill.,
Choose a journal format that suits your purpose.,
Divide your garden journal into sections.,
Leave space in your new sections for non-text items such as seed samples, diagrams and pictures of your garden.

,
Cover your gardening journal with a book cover or plastic lamination so that it can safely get wet and dirty.,
Begin entering information, such as description of a day's work or planting dates into the appropriate sections of the garden journal.,
Let your gardening journal evolve as the growing season goes on, adding new sections, including a second volume, inserting additional paper.

",How to Make a Gardening Journal," This could be a more casual record of your activity or a repository of essential information.


If you are a more casual gardener who merely wants to look back and see what you've done, a simple diary will suffice. If you are a more serious gardener, especially someone hoping to use or sell produce from your garden, keeping a gardening journal will be an essential part of planning your future activity.;
,


For a simple journal, use a notebook or diary, or even graph paper if you just want to record planting dates. For a more serious journal, choose a large binder to which you can add paper and pouches for seeds.
Electronic formats are also an option. For a diary-like journal on a computer, use a word processing program and create a new page or file for each entry. For a journal with measurements or statistics, use a data organization program like Microsoft Excel. There are also apps available for smartphones, such as Garden Pro and Master Gardener.

, These may be chronological, topical, or practical.


You may choose to have a section for each growing season, or to divide your journal into plant types. Additionally, you might have different sections for seed notes, weather notes, and financial data. In all cases, you can use each section either as a diary or as a folder for information.

,, You will want to be able to bring your journal into your garden.

, Leave space after each entry so that you can come back later and add notes or edit what you have written.

If you are using patterned canvas, however, be aware that both the right and wrong sides will be visible on the front of the apron., Cut a piece of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide cotton webbing down to 24 inches (60.96 centimeters). Fold it in half lengthwise, then iron it to make a crease. Tuck it over one of the 24-inch (60.96-centimeter) long edges. Make sure that the raw, cut edge of the canvas is nestled right inside the crease, then pin it in place.Cotton webbing is a thick, woven strip made from cotton. It is similar to backpack straps.
Choose a bight, contrasting color for the cotton webbing. You can also use twill tape instead.
You can use ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) bias tape instead of cotton webbing or twill tape. You don't need to fold it.

, Sew as close to the inside edge of the webbing as possible, about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins as you sew, then trim off any excess webbing from the sides.Use a heavy-duty, denim or jeans-weight sewing needle.

, Turn the canvas so that the edge you just bound is facing you. Fold the edge upward by 7½ inches (19.05 centimeters) and press it flat with an iron. This is your pocket.If you are using patterned canvas, you can have the right or wrong side facing you. It depends on what part you want to have the pattern on it.

, Keeping the canvas folded, place a ruler along the bottom edge. Starting at the left side, make a mark with a fabric pen in the following places: 5½ inches, 9½ inches, 15½ inches, and 19½ inches (13.97, 24.13, 39.37, and 49.53 centimeters). Move the ruler to the top, bound edge of the pocket, and repeat the marks., Use a ruler and fabric marker to connect the top mark to the matching bottom mark. You will have a series of four vertical lines along your pocket. These will be your sewing guidelines., Start sewing at the top, bound edge and finish sewing at the bottom, folded edge. You can use a thread color that matches the cotton webbing, or a thread color that matches the canvas. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing a few times for extra strength., Cut two pieces of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide cotton webbing down to 12½ inches (31.75 centimeters). You can use the same color as you did to bind the top edge of the pocket, or a different color. Fold the bottom edge of each strip by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron., Take one of the cotton webbing strips, and align the bottom, folded edge with the bottom, folded edge of your apron. Fold the sides of the cotton webbing over the sides of the apron, just like you did the top edge of the pocket. Pin it in place and trim off any excess webbing from the top edge.Repeat this step for the other side edge of the apron.

, Begin sewing at the bottom edge of the apron and finish sewing at the top edge. Sew as close as possible to the inside edge of the webbing, about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter). Use a thread color that matches the cotton webbing and remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Remove the pins as you sew., You will need at least 78 inches (198.12 centimeters) of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide cotton webbing for this. It can be the same color as the ones you used to bind the edges of the pocket/apron, or a contrasting color., Fold the webbing in half first to find the center, then mark it with a pin. Fold the webbing over the top of the apron and pin it in place, just like you did when binding the top edge of the pocket. Leave the webbing outside the apron unfolded., Start sewing at the webbing at the left, side edge of your apron, and finish sewing at the right edge. Sew as close as possible to the bottom edge of the webbing, and remember to backstitch. Use a thread color that matches the webbing and remove the pins as you sew.Do not start sewing at the end of the webbing. You want the webbing to go from being 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide, to ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide as it meets the apron, then back to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).

, You can leave the ends of the webbing raw, or you can fold them over for a neater finish. If you want a neater finish, fold one of the ends over twice by ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters). Topstitch it down several times for extra strength, then repeat the process for the other end.Make sure that you are folding the ends on the same side.

, You can leave the apron blank, if you wish, or you can decorate it further. For example, you can paint designs onto the apron using stencils and fabric paint. You can also draw designs on using puffy paint/dimensional paint.

You don't need to decorate patterned canvas since it is already colorful.

Take your tape measure and scissors and cut these four strands from your cotton rope. Lay out all strands evenly on a flat surface., Take all four strands and thread them through your metal ring so that each strand hangs from the ring at its midpoint. Each strand should hang evenly at both ends. Then:Hold the rope firmly with one hand at the base of the metal ring to gather the strands together.
Wrap embroidery floss around the base of loop around the metal ring. Wind the floss tightly around all strands until the windings are about 2"" (5 cm) long.
Tie off the loose ends with a simple, sturdy knot. You can further strengthen this by adding a layer of transparent glue., Hang the ring and attached rope from a hook or other suitable location to make knotting easier on yourself. Measure 2 feet (.61 m) down from the hook and gather two neighboring strands together. Tie these together using an overhand knot.The overhand knot is relatively simple. Form a loop with your two strands of rope and feed the loose ends of the strands through the loop. Pull the ends tight, and the knot is tied.
Continue tying knots to connect neighboring strands at 2 feet (.61 m) below your metal ring. In total, there should be four knots.

, Below each knot should hang two stands. Take one strand apiece from neighboring knots, and tie these together in the same fashion as before with an overhand knot at 6"" (15.24 cm) below your first row of knots.The base of your pot will rest in the knotted portion of your rope. If it looks like the planter may not fit, untie your knots and increase the space between the two rows., In the same fashion you fastened the top of the rope at the base of the metal ring, you're going to close off the bottom of your hanging rope basket.


Begin wrapping your embroidery floss around all strands at 3"" (7.62 cm) below your second row of knots.
Wrap the floss so there is no space between windings and the strands are held together firmly.
Tie off the end of your floss when your windings are about 2"" (5 cm) in length. You can strengthen the hold of your floss by applying a suitable transparent glue., Unless you had to significantly adjust the distance between rows of knots to better accommodate a large planter, you should have some extra rope at the bottom of your planter. This can be cut away with your scissors."

, Start by cutting one of the legs off, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the back pocket. Fold the jeans over and use the cut leg as a guide for the second one.Use a ruler and marker to draw a guideline across the bottom of the jeans, if needed.

, Turn the jeans so that the zipper and front pockets are facing you. Cut up both of the side seams from the bottom cut edge all the way up to the bottom of the waistband. Leave the folded/topstitched part of the seam attacked to the back of the jeans. They will become part of the design., Begin cutting at the zipper and finish cutting at the side seam. Try to cut as close to the bottom edge of the waistband as you can; use the seam as a guide.Leave the button and button hole. You will need these to secure the apron.

The front pockets will fall away as they will have nothing to hold on to. Set them aside for another project or recycle them.
When you reach the belt loops, you can cut under them so that they are still attached to the waist band. You can also cut them off entirely.

, Sometimes, when you cut the legs off of a pair of jeans, the crotch part sticks out in a little triangle. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut this triangle off., You can leave your apron plain if you want to, or you can decorate it further. Choose garden themed motifs and designs, such as flowers, bees, or butterflies. Here are some simple design ideas that would work well on a denim apron:

Iron a patch onto a pocket or the corner of the apron.

Additionally, a clear, unobstructed work area will prevent you from tripping and accidentally injuring yourself.


Make sure your work surface is sturdy, clean, and level. This kind of work surface will be safest and easiest to work on.

, Take a pot and place it topside down onto your wood. Use a writing utensil to outline the mouth of the pot onto the wood. Then take your tape measure and mark the wood 1 - 2"" (2.54 - 5 cm) outside the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the circle. These marks form the outer edge of one tier.


Thicker spacing between the outline of the mouth of the pot and the edges of each tier will create a sturdier hanging planter.
Repeat this procedure to mark out more tiers in your wood. Avoid adding more than three tiers of moderately sized plants. More than three tiers may make your planter too heavy.
The spacing between the outline of the mouth of the pot and the outer edge of each tier should be the same for all tiers., For better accuracy, you may want to use a straight edge to extend horizontal lines through your top and bottom marks and vertical lines through the left and right ones to complete each square tier outline. Take your saw and cut each tier at its outer boundary marks to create equal sized, square wooden tiers.


Depending on the size and weight of your wood, it may be a good idea to clamp it to your work surface before cutting.
If you are using an automated saw, like a reciprocating saw, be sure to wear proper safety equipment, like protective eye wear, a dust mask, and gloves.
After sawing, your wood may be rough where you've cut. Rub medium grit (60 - 100) sandpaper with moderate pressure to smooth rough spots and burrs., If the tier hole for your pot is too big, the pot will fall through, and if the hole is too small, the pot will be unbalanced and top-heavy. Measure and draw a second circle ¼"" (.64 cm) inside the outline of the mouth of the pot. You may find it easiest to dry this circle by:Tying a writing utensil to one end of a length of string. Attach the string with a tack at the center of the outline of the mouth of the pot.
Pulling the pencil to make the line taut. Measure the distance between the pencil and outline of the mouth of the pot.
Shorten the string until the pencil, when held taut, is ¼"" (.64 cm) inside the outline. Keep the string taut as you draw on the wood to form your second circle, and repeat this process for all tiers., Clamp your wood so that the inner hole is positioned with nothing beneath it. Failing to do this will likely result in unnecessary cuts on your work surface. Then use your saw to cut the inner circle along the line you have marked until it comes free.


Cutting from the edges will compromise the stability of your tiers. Instead, use your drill and boring bit to create a starting point for your saw at the center of your inner circle., Measure and mark four points on each tier, with one point in each corner. These marks should be ½"" (1.27 cm) from both edges of each corner. Then, use your drill and boring bit to drill holes at these points.


Be extra careful when measuring and marking your rope holes. If these are inconsistent, your planter may hang crookedly., The distance between your tiers will rely on the size of the plants you'll be putting in the pots. Taller plants will require more vertical space between tiers. In many cases, 1 foot (30.5 m) will be more than enough space separating tiers.Once you've decided the distance between tiers, you can estimate the amount of rope you'll need.
Including the distance between tiers, you'll also need 1 foot (30.5 cm) of extra line to fasten the rope at the top.
It's much easier to cut free extra rope than splice in more. For this reason, you may want to add a little length to your rope estimate., Cut four stands from your rope, each one the same size. The length of your rope will be determined by your estimate, but in most cases, 30"" (.76 m) should be sufficient for a two-tier hanging planter. To fasten your rope:


Align all ends so they are collected together evenly. Thread one end of the strands through your metal ring, then tie it to the ring in an overhand knot.
Strengthen your knot by applying a suitable, transparent glue to it. Cover the knot thoroughly in a thin layer of glue, then allow it to dry completely., Separate your strands of rope and feed one strand through each corner hole in your first wooden tier. Measure out the distance you planned, then tie a thick overhand knot below each corner hole. Repeat this for each tier.Once the knots have been tied beneath your final tier, your tiered hanging basket is complete. Hang the planter, insert pots into the center holes in each tier, and enjoy your handiwork.

Thread wooden accents and beads on your rope.,
Apply paint to hanging planters.,
Braid and weave excess rope to create unique designs.",How to Hang Planters with Knotted Rope3," The simple addition of wooden beads above the knotted portions of your rope can give your hanging planter a polished, professional look. Glass beads are also a great option, as these will catch the light and sparkle.In many cases, a hook or pin can hung from excess rope below your hanging planter to fasten other ornaments and knickknacks as well.

, You may want to paint your planter so its coloring matches your home decor. For most kinds of rope, acrylic pant can be applied directly to it directly to change its color.


If you want to paint your wooden tiers, you'll have best results if you sand, clean, prime, and paint the tiers in that order.

, Surplus rope at the bottom of your planter doesn't have to be cut away. You can turn this into an interesting design with a simple braid or weave. Give your braid or weave character by inserting beads, coins, and other accents."

Identify an area in your garden where pot plant markers will be effective.,
Measure the area around the specific plant.,
Choose a pot piece for each specific plant.,
Write the plant name around the top of the pot piece.,
Embed the pot around or near the plant.",How to Make Plant Markers from Broken Pots," This will help you to gain an idea of how many markers to make. Typically you’ll need a bit of space so you can surround the planted greenery with the pot, however you could trim a potted plant in a smaller garden using a smaller size.;
, A tape measure is handy but even eyeballing the area to determine the pot size will work well too.

, Since each plant may take up a different amount of space, you'll want to customize the marker for each plant’s size.

, Make sure it's written clearly so that you can read the name.


Consider using a stencil to create uniformity. This takes more effort but might be best for a showpiece area of your garden, such as an herb garden or a special vegetable plot.
Allow time for the writing on the pot piece to dry before adding it to the plant area.

, Try a few positions before deciding where it sits best (don’t embed the pot deeply into the soil until you are sure you like the location). Done!

Select your bottle.,
Turn the bottle right-side up.,
Place pebbles and sand on the base of the bottle.,
Cover the sand and pebbles with soil.,
Plant the garden.,
Watch the plants grow.",How to Grow a Garden in a Bottle," The bottle should be large enough to allow room for plants to grow. Clean it and allow the bottle to dry thoroughly before using it. The larger the opening, the easier it'll be to maintain the garden.;
, This will form the base of the bottle garden.

, You can use a small spoon through the mouth of the bottle to add the pebbles and sand and move them around. This will provide a good drainage base for the plants. Wet the sand before putting it in place. Do not underestimate the importance of good drainage, as the bottle does not have drainage holes and wet substrate can lead to fungus issues.


Adding a thin layer of activated charcoal on top of the drainage layer will minimize any smell caused by decomposition within the bottle.An additional thin layer of sphagnum moss or a piece of weedblocker this will prevent the soil from settling into the drainage layer., The soil should be good quality and pre-dampened. If you accidentally get soil on the sides of the bottle, obscuring the view, you can tie gauze or cotton to the end of a pencil and reach in to wipe off the soil.

, Choose seeds of small indoor plants. Place the seeds in the soil using tweezers, a long, thin stick (if you have a steady hand) or chopsticks. Put the seeds in different spots to make it an interesting arrangement.


Bottle gardening lends itself well to plants which require a good deal of humidity (e.g. tropical plants) because the bottle will trap moisture.Do not mix plants with different requirements, especially in terms of water. Growing a thirsty plant next to a cactus will make for difficult maintenance.
You can also make an aquatic bottle garden (shown in a previous step).

, Tend to them as they mature. The plants will need air and moisture. Be sure to perforate the lid or cap of the bottle or jar, or don't put it on at all. Use a water sprayer to put moisture into the bottle. Only water when no condensation is observed on the glass--it's always better to under water than over water to prevent the growth of fungus or mold."

Tilt the bottle over your plants to water them.",How to Make a Bottle Watering Can1," If the bottle is dirty on the inside, fill it with water, close the cap, and shake it, then pour the water out. Do this a few times until the bottle is clean inside. When you are done, peel off the label and remove any glue residue.;
, Use a permanent marker to draw a square on the side of the bottle, just below where it starts to curve upward into a dome shape. You can also mask off the patch with masking tape. The square should be no longer than your finger.

, Space the holes as evenly as you can. You will need to make five rows of five holes each for a total of 25 holes. If the plastic is very thick, you can heat up the nail over a flame for about 10 seconds; hold the nail with a pair of pliers so that you don't burn yourself.Wiggle the nail to remove it from the bottle.

, Rotate the bottle so that the holes are facing away from you. Draw a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) U-shape on the side of the bottle. Have the top of the U touch the bottom of the bottle's dome. Cut the U shape out with a razor blade.

, Your watering can is more or less finished, but you can make it look more interesting by decorating it. Draw some gardening-themed designs on it using permanent markers. You can also stick on some stickers instead, but be aware that they may fall off if they get too wet.

, Fill the bottle until the water level reaches ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) below the bottom row of holes. If you want to, you can even add some water-soluble fertilizer to the water.

, Hold the bottle by the sides, then tilt it on its side. Keep the watering holes on the bottom and the pouring hole on the top. When you are done watering, tilt the bottle back upright.

Make goals.,
Narrow down the options for improving processes.,
Identify gaps between your goals and your existing processes.,
Get access to a project management methodology.,
Measure improvements.",How to Implement ITIL," Experts point out a range of different business processes to which business owners or leaders can apply ITIL. These include problem management or change management as well as incident handling and some other types of business issues like capacity, financial accounting and supply chains.


Get staffers involved in identifying applicable business processes. Some experts recommend using ""process workshops"" and other inclusive strategies to get more feedback on what can be improved with ITIL. This kind of collective brainstorming can help a business get better data for the following tasks.;
, Often, it's important to start at the beginning and document how existing processes work in order to build an environment for implementing ITIL and improving certain aspects of the business.

, In order to implement ITIL effectively, you'll want to have goals and objectives on hand in order to craft strategies that will work.


Use people-centered tactics to assess business processes, set goals and achieve them by implementing ITIL. Those who are experienced in business communications know that it's important to reach out to individuals to get them engaged and active in promoting this sort of business strategy. This may require some creativity from a management perspective, but according to many of those who have used ideas like ITIL to streamline business operations, getting more hands on deck is critical.

, Some businesses may need to cull their original list and further identify viable improvements as needed.

, Defining the problem or the gap helps business leadership to craft the right kinds of responses and strategies.

, Some business consultants recommend specific methods for implementing ITIL. In other situations, it might be as simple as creating relevant PowerPoint applications with conventional project management charts, including timelines and other resources as necessary.

, When ITIL has been implemented, it's a good idea to keep looking at current operations to observe whether or not these strategies are paying off as they should.

Punch holes into the cap with a nail.,
Consider adding a hole above the handle.,
Fill the bottle with water.,
Use the watering can.",How to Make a Bottle Watering Can2," Detergent jugs, and milk jugs are all great choices. Large water jugs and juice jugs may also work, as long as they have a handle. Most importantly, make sure that the lid screws on. A cap that you pop on and off will not work for this due to the water pressure., This is especially important if you are recycling a detergent bottle. The easiest way to clean the bottle is to fill it partway with water, close the cap tightly, shake it, then pour the water out. When you are done, remove the label and any glue residue left behind., Keep the cap on the bottle. Use a nail to punch holes into the lid. You can also use a needle or thumbtack instead. Punch as many holes as you want.

If the cap is too hard to piece, heat the nail over a flame first. Hold the nail with a pair of pliers so that you don't scorch your fingers.If your bottle had a thick lid (ie: detergent bottle), use a drill and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) drill bit instead., Do this with a drill and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) drill bit. This will help make the water flow smoother and help release pressure., Unscrew the cap, then fill the bottle with water from the sink or hose. Close the cap when you are done. How much you fill it depends on how much weight you are able to carry; the more you fill it, the heavier it will become.

If you used a drill bit, you will need to rinse the bottle out first to get rid of any plastic dust.

Shake the bottle, then pour the water out. Do this a few times until the water comes out clean. If there is a label, peel it away, then remove any residue., The size of the hole does not really matter, but it needs to be big enough so that you can cover it completely with your thumb. Something around 3/16-inch (0.48-centimeter) wide would be ideal, however.If you make the hole too big, you won't get a tight enough seal., If the bottle is made from soft plastic, you can do this with a nail or thumbtack.If the bottle is made from thicker plastic, you will need to use a drill and 1/16 to 1/8 inch (cc to cc centimeters) drill bit., Fill a large bucket with water. Place the cap on your bottle, then dunk the bottle into the water. Cover the cap hole tightly with your thumb, then left the bottle out.If your bucket is deeper than your bottle, dip the bottle only ¾ of the way.
The bottle will only fill to the same water-level that's already in the bucket.

, Carry the bottle to your plant, then lift your thumb away. This will release the pressure, and allow the water to flow out of the bottle. When you want to stop the water flow, simply cover the hole in the cap with your thumb."

Own up to your mistake.,
Focus on the things you did right.,
Don’t be too hard on yourself.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Let Go of Financial Regrets1," Before you can let go of financial regrets that haunt your past, you first need to admit to yourself that you made a mistake. People who have made financial mistakes are often prone to repeat the same error over and over, continuing their financial regret and the cycle of frustration. By owning up to the mistake(s) you’ve made, you’ll be able to take responsibility for the error and not repeat the mistake.You can own up to the mistake by admitting that you’ve handled elements of your finances irresponsibly. Take responsibility and don’t seek to pass the blame on to other individuals.
If you are in debt or bad financial straits, you need to face the problem head-on. Ignoring it won't make it go away, and neither will feeling sorry for yourself.;
, Even if you feel likely somehow sabotaged yourself, or made poor financial decisions in the past, remind yourself that you did the things you thought were best at the time. Hindsight reveals many of our past mistakes and can often cause regret, but at the time when you made your decisions, you did so with the best information at hand.Remind yourself that, in fact, you may have made a good decision with the limited information available to you at the time.
For example, imagine that you splurged on an expensive personal vacation before your spouse for filed for divorce, leaving you with no money left over. While this may be a financial regret for you now, before knowing about the impending divorce, your decision was not necessarily a bad one.

, Everyone can make mistakes, and we’re often much quicker to blame ourselves for poor decisions than we would be to blame others. Think of how you would comfort and support your best friend if they made a similar mistake, and try to develop that kind of compassion toward yourself as well. If you find yourself engaging in mental self-criticism, stop and focus on positive decisions that you’ve made instead. Part of letting go of financial regrets is the ability to let the past stay in the past, without constantly using past mistakes to berate and put yourself down.If you catch yourself engaging in excessive mental self-criticism, stop and divert your thoughts to something else. Remind yourself: “I am more than my past mistakes.”

, There's always a silver lining, even if it's hard to see at the time. Maybe you learned how to budget or be more responsible. You also gained practice in dealing with financial mistakes and related emotional reactions. Think about which of your responses helped you recover, and which ended up being counterproductive. Both of them teach you how to do better next time.

Learn about currency printing.,
Observe standard features.,
Inspect the paper.,
Look at the bill’s portraits.,
Check the watermark.,
Watch the ink color shift or holograms.,
Find the security thread or ribbon.,
Read the serial numbers.,
Use central bank resources.,
Correlate two bills.",How to Identify Counterfeit Money1," If you want to examine or compare bills you receive for counterfeits, it’s a good idea to have a little knowledge about how currency is printed. From the fact that design and material can change over time, taking a few minutes to learn about currency could save you money or even legal hassles.Recognize that looking at the security features of a bill, such as watermarks or raised areas, is usually enough to detect fakes without the aid of a device.Be aware that most countries or regions, such as the European Union, have series of bills in circulation issued after specific dates. Notes are often taken out of circulation as counterfeiting gets more sophisticated, but also because the average life span of notes varies.Check out resources such as the US Currency Education Program (CEP) or the European Central Bank to learn more about the design, legal status, and life cycle of bills, as well as how you can spot fakes.;
, Most currencies come with different features that help identify them such as colors, seals and watermarks.However, there are often a few standard features that can guide your examination including:


Portraits or images
Watermarks
Colored or color-shifting ink
Security thread or ribbon
Serial numbers., Notes are often made of material other than paper. For example, US notes are made with a mixture of 25% linen and 75% cotton and European bills with cotton. In addition, bills may have randomly dispersed security fibers throughout the note.Be aware it may be difficult to detect some of these features with the naked eye and may require more in-depth analysis.


Run your finger along the note’s surface. Many currencies, including the dollar and Euro, have raised printing, which gives them their special texture., Most countries or currency unions have some type of image on their notes as a security measure.Check any notes you have for images, which may also include special features such as holograms.Research central bank sites for specific portrait information. For example, Benjamin Franklin appears on the $100 note and is slightly off center.In India, you’ll find Mahatma Ghandi on most notes., Most notes in circulation in world currencies were printed at a specific time and have a watermark to help authenticate them.The watermark is often visible from either side when the note is held up to a source of light.Put each side of the bill up to a window that has access to sunlight and make sure you can see the watermark on both sides before using it.Consider using other sources of light such as a UV-light or a lamp and use the same procedure to check for the watermark.

, Many bills used have colored or color-shifting ink and/ or holograms. Moving the bill back and forth can help verify that the note isn’t counterfeit.Look for the ink on the face of bills and recognize color-shifting ink and holograms by tilting the bill back and forth.If you can’t find this, the note may be counterfeit.
Be aware that some smaller note denominations may not have the same security features as larger notes.

, Many countries, such as the United States, Thailand, and India, use security threads to further authenticate their bills.Using either a UV-light source or your naked eye, look for this marker to ensure your bill isn’t counterfeit.Look for clear or colored threads that are embedded in notes. In some cases, this feature may only be visible when held to light.Check with the state’s central bank to see if there are further special features with security threads. For example, threads in US dollars glow with the number of the denomination under UV-light., In addition to other features, many countries have bills that contain serial numbers, which help identify when and where it was made.Check for serial numbers—which may be a combination of letters and numbers—to help ensure the money is not counterfeit.Check with the central bank of any country you’re visiting for information on serial numbers. For example, the United States provides data on the serial numbers of dollars.You can similarly get this information from countries like Thailand and India as well as the European Union., Most countries or customs unions have central banks that provide information on their currency. If you are looking for information about elements such as specific placement of face or back plate numbers or even want to see up close examples of how to review standard authentication features, you can draw upon the resources that central banks or currency issuers provide., You can easily check for fake money by comparing two bills of the same denomination. Use or obtain an authentic bill from the bank and compare the various aspects of the bill that looks suspicious.


See if you can detect any differences between the notes by sight. Look at both sides of each bill. This may confirm your suspicion that you received counterfeit money.
Place the authentic bill on top of the suspicious bill. Hold them up to the light, which may expose any differences between the notes.
Make sure to report any counterfeit money and the person from who you received it to your local authorities.If you do not know the person who passed you the money, provide the authorities with any information you can that may help them apprehend the counterfeiter."

Focus on your financial future.,
Use your guilt as an opportunity for personal financial growth.,
Set up electronic automatic payments and reminders.,
Make a “monthly regrets” budget.",How to Let Go of Financial Regrets2," Obsessing over regrets will leave you looking to the past and the mistakes that it contains. Although there are appropriate times for self-pity and regret, the emotions are ultimately unproductive and may even cause you to repeat the behaviors that caused you regret in the first place. Rather than doing this, focus on the future and ways in which you can overcome the financial situation you find yourself in.Planning a financial recovery can also provide a sense of mental clarity and feeling of control that will improve your mood and outlook on life.


As part of focusing on the financial future, you may wish to speak with a financial advisor who can help you deal with any debt you may have.

, While guilt and regret and negative emotions and need to be let go, they can also help motivate you to avoid financial mistakes in the future. Optimism about your financial future can be helpful psychologically, but it’s also important to start implementing practical financial choices that will reduce your risk of future financial mistakes:Take action sooner rather than later. This applies to many aspects of financial life: don’t get behind on credit card or car payments, as interest will pile up quickly.
Tackle one task at a time so you start to gain momentum and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This momentum will help you push through each obstacle as it comes and decrease guilt.

, If you feel stressed out by the number of payments you have to make, take the pressure off (and make sure bills are paid on time) by using an auto-pay feature or setting payment alerts for yourself.Most credit card websites allow you to set up monthly automated payments, as do websites for utilities and services like electricity and internet service.


If you prefer to make your payments manually, some of the credit card and utility websites can send you an automated reminder a few days before a payment is due.

, A monthly regrets budget is essentially a balance system that allows you to track your overspending and compensate appropriately. For example, imagine you splurged at dinner and spend $100 on the meal when you only meant to spend $40. Since you’re now $60 in the red, you’ll need to save $60 on other expenditures. You could bring your lunch to work (saving the ~$7 you might be spending to buy lunch) and compensate for the $60 “regret” in five to seven work days.The monthly regrets budget will give you room to make mistakes and overspend each month by giving you a system to compensate for these oversights.

"
"
Stop overspending.,
Bulk up your financial savings.,
Plan ahead for retirement.",How to Let Go of Financial Regrets3," Overspending is the single most common reason for financial regrets. People spend more money they can afford, and then find themselves saddled with debt over unnecessary purchases and investments. Once you’ve put together a monthly “money regrets” budget, stick to it; don’t give into the temptation to purchase goods or services that put your total expenditure over your total income.It’s worth noting your motivation for overspending so you can reign in these impulses in the future. For example, do you overspend absentmindedly, or do you overspend socially (only when out with friends)?

, Many people also experience financial regret due to a lack of savings funds. For an individual without savings, any financial emergency—from medical bills to car payments—can be ruinous. To help leave your savings account intact, view it as money for emergencies or for unexpected expenses; don’t think of savings as a large reservoir of spending money.As a rule of thumb, you should always have on hand (e.g. in an easily accessible bank account) at least six months of net income.

, No matter your age—provided that you’ve at least graduated from college—you should be thinking about your retirement, especially once you’ve found a career or are steadily employed. A large source of financial regret for individuals later in their lives comes from the fact that they did not plan ahead or save enough for retirement.You can avoid this mistake by increasing the amount of monthly savings you set aside (earmarked “for retirement”) or by increasing your monthly payments into your employer’s retirement system or a 401k account.
As a general rule, about 20% of your income should be saved for financial priorities, including retirement and debt payment (if applicable).

Mark the note with a detector pen.,
Run notes through a detector machine.,
Scan notes under UV-light.,
Go to your local bank.",How to Identify Counterfeit Money2," Some companies have begun making felt tip pens that can detect counterfeit bills. Draw a line or an “x” on suspicious bill to see if it leaves a mark, which can indicate a counterfeit bill.Be aware that detector pens are not foolproof, but work in many cases because their active ingredient, which is an iodine solution, reacts with wood-based paper.Realize that a detector pen may leave a pastel mark on an authentic bill and that it will fade within a day.This can help you identify which bills you’ve checked.
Purchase counterfeit detector pens at most large retailers or office supply stores. They generally cost around $5 and can check up to 3,000 bills., If you work with a lot of notes, you may want to consider getting a machine that detects counterfeit bills. Running bills through these machines can help you ensure the authenticity of your money in a quick and effective manner.


Recognize that there is a wide variety of counterfeit detecting machines a broad range of price points. Buy the type of machine according to the type of work for which you need it. Machines can do everything from detecting watermarks and other features with UV-light to detecting magnetic strips and magnifying micro-printing feature.Place a stack of bills into the machine and it will self-feed and alert you if it discovers
Buy your machine at a large retailer or office supply store. You can ask other businesses or colleagues if they have any suggestions on good models.

, Most notes in circulation have features, such as watermarks or security threads, that are visible when viewed under ultraviolet light.If you work with large sums of cash or prefer to not mark bills, consider getting a UV-light to scan for counterfeit notes.


Choose a model appropriate to your needs. You may want to consider self-feed scanners or hand-held UV-lights that illuminate security features. You can buy UV scanners at many large retailers and office supply stores.

, If you are truly unsure if a note is authentic after looking at it or scanning it, take it to your local bank. Most banks have personnel and devices that can see if the notes are counterfeit.


Explain to the bank manager that you are concerned money you received is counterfeit but are not sure how to tell. Ask if the branch can verify the money and then follow any suggestions the staff has if they discover fake notes.
Remember to be kind and provide any information you can about the origin of the notes.

Think about where you last had the money.,
Make a plan.,
Search your home.,
Retrace your steps.,
Search your car.,
Ask if anyone found your money.,
Check the lost and found.,
Consider reporting your lost money to the police.",How to Find Lost Money2," Losing money can be very upsetting, but getting frazzled will make it more difficult for you to think about where you had the money last. Wait a moment before you begin your search and take a deep breath., You may know the exact amount of money that you are missing, but if not, make an estimate. Are you missing a small amount or a larger amount? What denomination was the money? $1s, $5s, $20s, etc.? Having a solid idea of how much you have lost and what bill denominations will make it easier for you to ask people about your missing money.

, Try to remember where you had the money last. Did you have it at home, take it with you to the grocery store, or somewhere else? Do you remember spending any of it? If so, did you put the change back into your wallet or your pocket? Do the best you can to remember the details of when and where you last had the money.

, Now that you have thought about how much money you have lost, as well as where and when you might have lost it, you can plan out where you should look. Include the places you might have lost your money and anywhere you passed through along the way.

, Check usual and unusual places for your missing money. Look in the pockets of the clothes you wore when you last had the money. Check between couch cushions and on the floor. Check where you stash your keys at the end of the day.

, Go back to the places where you might have lost your money and follow the same route that you took before. As you walk, scan the ground for your money just in case it fell out of your pocket along the way.

, Check the floor and around the seats in your car to see if your money is there. It may have fallen out of your pocket as you got into or out of your car. Check the glove compartment, overhead visors, and other places that you might have stowed your money without remembering.

, If you think you might have lost your money in a store or some other place of business, ask the manager if anyone found your money. Say how much you lost and what denomination the money was in. You can also leave your name and number just in case someone turns the money in.

, If the places you went to with the money have a lost and found, check to see if your money is there. You may have to offer identifying information about your money, such as the amount, bill denomination, and when you lost it, so be prepared., A small amount of money probably would not be turned into the police, but a large amount might be. If you have lost a substantial amount of money, then you may want to report it to the police. Conduct a thorough search first, but if you still can’t find your money, file a report with the police."

Gather together all your coins.,
Organize by size and value.,
Calculate the value of each stack.,
Add it all together.,
Consider using a coin sorting machine.,
Organize your bills.,
Count and record your bills.,
Combine your bill and coin totals.",How to Count Money," The first thing to do is get together all your loose coins. Empty out your pockets, purse, wallet or anywhere else you keep coins. Spread them out on a flat surface so all the coins are visible are none of them are overlapping each other. You want to be able to distinguish each coin easily.;
, Next you can split the coins up into groups determined by their value. For example, scoop together all the nickels in one place, all the dimes in another, and so on. Do this until you have little piles of each coin. Then stack up the coins from each pile into a column. Once you've done this you should have a collection of little stacks of coins on the table.


The size and color of the coins makes this easy to do very quickly.
You could do this in descending order from high value to low by first stacking all your dollar coins together in one pile, followed by your quarters, dimes, nickels and, finally, pennies.

, Now work your way through the stacks calculating the value of each one and noting it down. For example, if you have a stack of ten 1 cent coins note down that that stack's value is 10 cents. Five 50 cents coins? Write down $2.50. Complete this calculation for each stack.


You could also write it down in a tally chart. With headings for each coin denomination, you can tick for each coin you have of that value and then add up the totals.
If you have a lot of stacks you will need to clearly identify which ones you have already counted. You can do this just by moving them to one side when they are counted. For example, keep uncounted stacks on your right hand side and slide them over to your left when they are counted.

, Once you know the value of each stack you just need to add them all together to get the total. You can add that up as your go and keep a running total to make it quicker. If you think you might forget, writing the value of each stack means you can go back and add it all up together at end.

, If you have a lot of coins or regularly need to process a lot of change for your job, it might be a good idea to get hold of a coin sorting machine. These are devices which sort your coins for you by denomination. Some of the more advanced machines will also count them and tell you the total value.


You may find coin counting machines in your bank or store which you can use. But be aware that there will typically be a charge for this service.
The most common coin counting machines in the US generally cost a fee of around 10% of the total value of the change you process., Once you have counted up all your coins, you can move on to your bills or notes. You will basically follow the same method as with the coins, namely splitting the bills into piles of the same denomination and then calculating the value of each pile. The first step is to spread out your bills on the table so you can clearly see each one. Then separate them out into groups.


For example, you could have a pile of $5 bills, one of $20 bills, and so on.
Depending on how much cash you have this could be a fairly speedy process and take a little longer.
If you have a lot of cash to count, begin with your largest bills. Stack your $100, $50 and $20 bills in their own piles. Then move on to the $10, $5 and $1 bills.

, Now you have organized your bills into separate piles, all you have to do is go through and calculate the value of each pile. If you have five $20 bills, that's $100. Just like the coins you can go through each pile and note down the value on a sheet of paper and add them all together at the end. If you are more confident in your maths and memory skills, you can calculate the total as you go only writing down the final amount when you get to the end.


Another way to do it is create a table with headings for each bill denomination in which you keep a tally, and then add up the totals.
For example, if you have two $50 bills, three $20 bills, four $10 bills, two $5 bills and 6 single dollar bills, your ""totals"" column should read, ""100, 60, 40, 10, 6."" You should add all these bill totals together and hopefully come to a total of $216.

, The final step is to combine the two totals you have for coins and bills respectively. This will give you the total amount of money you are counting. Write the total down and use your records to keep track of your personal finances, and budgets.


If you are going to deposit the money you can place it into special bank deposit bags. You can write the value of the contents on the outside of the bag.
For bills, consider paper clipping them to a deposit slip if you plan on depositing the money.

Understand the terms you will be working with in your interest rate equation.,
Know the equation used to calculate the total amount you will pay.,
Read through the equation you are given and determine which numbers coincide with each variable of the equation.,
Plug the known numbers into the equation for fixed rate.",How to Find the Total Amount Paid in an Interest Rate Equation1," When you are solving an interest rate equation, such as that for an interest rate you have for a loan you took out, you will work with several different variables. These include:


P = principal amount borrowed.
i = the interest rate.
N = the term of the loan, in years.
F = the total amount paid at the end of the designated number of years.;
, To find the total amount paid at the end of the number of years you pay back your loan for, you will have to multiply the principal amount borrowed with 1 plus the interest rate. Then, raise that sum to the power of the number of years. The equation looks like this:


F = P(1 + i)^N

, Normally, interest rate problems will be given in sentence format and you will have to figure out what each number represents. For example, you are given: “You borrow $4,000 from a bank and promise to repay the loan principal plus the accumulated interest in four years at a rate of 10% per year. How much would you repay at the end of 4 years?”.


P would be $4,000.
i would be 10%.
N would be 4 years.
F would be what you are trying to find.

, Once you have figured out what numbers you are working with, you can plug the numbers in so that you can work with the equation to find the fixed rate. Our equation would be:


F = 4000(1 + 10%)^4. Note that to make things easier, you can convert the interest percentage to decimals so the equation would be F = 4000(1 + 0.1)^4

"
"
Work through the problem in stages.,
Create your equation.,
Solve the inside of the parentheses first.,
Use N to solve the next part of the equation.,
Finish the equation.",How to Find the Total Amount Paid in an Interest Rate Equation2," In order to find the total amount you will pay over the course of the time you pay back a loan, you will have to work through the article in stages. Let’s look at an example article:


”You borrow 5,000 from a bank and plan to repay the loan principal, plus and accumulated interest in five years. The rate of the interest is 10%. How much will you pay, in total, at the end of the five years?

, Once you have read through the article, create an equation based on the standard equation F = P(1 + i)^N. For our question, our equation would be:


F = 5000(1 + 0.1)^5.

, When you have written out your equation, start to solve your problem. The first step towards doing this is to solve the equation within the parentheses first. For our equation:


Solve (1 + 0.1) = 1.1. So now our equation looks like this: F = 5000(1.1)^5.

, Once you have simplified the information in the parentheses, you should move onto applying the years (N) of the equation. This means raising the number inside the parentheses to the Nth degree. For our equation:


(1.1)^5 means multiplying 1.1 to itself five times. In this case, (1.1)^5 = 1.61051.

, You should now only have one step left in the process of solving your equation. To finish the equation and find F, or the total amount paid, you will have to multiply P with the number in the parentheses. For our equation:


F = 5000(1.61051) therefore, F = $8,052.55. That means that you would have paid $8,052.55 over the course of the five years.

Recognize proper styles and colors.,
Measure the bills.,
Feel the distinctive paper.,
Look out for the Europa Series.",How to Detect Fake Euros1," First and foremost, you should be aware that Euro bills come only in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500. So, if you are handed a €15 note, reject it immediately. Each legitimate Euro denomination also has a standard color palette and image style.Euros feature distinctive styles of architectural imagery from different periods of European history. The front of each bill shows a window, door, or gate motif; the rear, a bridge (along with a map of Europe).
Five Euro bills feature Classical architecture and are predominantly gray in color.
Ten Euro bills feature Romanesque architecture and are predominantly red in color.
Twenty Euro bills feature Gothic architecture and are predominantly blue in color.
Fifty Euro bills feature Renaissance architecture and are predominantly orange in color.
One-hundred Euro bills feature Baroque / Rococo architecture and are predominantly green in color.
Two-hundred Euro bills feature iron and glass architecture and are predominantly yellow-brown in color.
Five-hundred Euro bills feature Modern architecture and are predominantly purple in color.;
, Unlike U.S. currency, for instance, Euro bills are different sizes. This hinders counterfeiting somewhat, but is mainly done for the benefit of the visually-impaired.€5 = 120 x 62 mm
€10 = 127 x 67 mm
€20 = 133 x 72 mm
€50 = 140 x 77 mm
€100 = 147 x 82 mm
€200 = 153 x 82 mm
€500 = 160 x 82 mm

, Euros are made of 100% cotton fiber, which enhances durability and gives the bills a distinctive feel. Real Euros should feel crisp and firm, and the print should feel raised in areas where the ink is thicker.Fake Euros tend to feel limp and waxy to the touch, and often lack the raised print texture.
The older and more worn the Euro bill is, the more difficult it may be to distinguish these features. Even then, however, an experienced handler of Euros can likely tell the difference.

, The European Central Bank has over the past few years been slowly rolling out a new series of Euro bills. These are widely known as the Europa Series because some of the major security enhancements involve imagery of the Greek mythological figure Europa.These bills include a watermark portrait of Europa (a female), visible when the bill is held up to light.
They also include a hologram image of Europa in the silver security stripe, which becomes visible when the bill is tilted.

"
"
Watch for the watermark.,
Handle the hologram.,
Study the security thread.,
Check for color changes.,
Mind the micro-printing.,
Uncover ultraviolet and infrared properties.",How to Detect Fake Euros2," All Euros have a watermark image that becomes visible when the bill is held up to light. The image replicates an architectural image from the bill. It is located on the left side of the front of each bill.On real Euros, the watermark is created by a variation in the actual paper thickness. The image will be clearly visible when held up to light, and there will be smooth transitions between the light and dark elements of the image.
On fake Euros, the watermark is usually printed onto the paper. The image is usually not as clear, and often there are sharp light-dark transitions when it is held up to light.

, All Euros feature a hologram image. Depending on denomination, it will appear either as a vertical stripe or a rectangle on the right side of the front of the bill. Tilting the bill’s orientation in relation to your eyes will reveal changes in the image.On real Euros, the hologram will clearly change when tilted. The actual image varies by denomination and series (the newer Europa Series utilizes her portrait, for instance).
Fake Euros usually lack an actual hologram, meaning the image remains static when the bill is tilted.

, All Euro denominations include a security thread which appears as a vertical stripe in the center-left area of the front of the bill. The thread is not printed on the bill, but is actually embedded in it.The security stripe on real Euros always appears as a very dark stripe when held up to light. It also includes, in tiny but clear lettering, the number denomination and the word “EURO” (or, in the new series, “€”).
On fake Euros, the security stripe is usually just a printed grayish-black line. It does not appear very dark when held up to light, and usually has micro-printing that is either blurry or nonexistent.

, In addition to holograms, Euros also utilize color-shifting elements when bills are tilted. Look for the numeral value of the bill on the back right. Note, however, that only denominations of fifty Euros and above use this technology.The denomination numeral on the back of a real Euro will shift in color from purple to green or brown (depending on denomination) when tilted.
Most fake Euros lack this effect, meaning the numeral remains purple when tilted.

, Micro-printing that is illegible to the naked eye but becomes clear under magnification requires sophisticated printing techniques that are beyond the ability of most counterfeiters. All Euro bills utilize some micro-printing elements. Depending on denomination and series, they can appear in the word “EURO” or the star decal, for instance.To the naked eye, micro-printing on legitimate Euros will appear as a thin line. With the aid of a magnifying glass, however, clear print will be visible. A running repetition of the numeral denomination of the bill is commonly found in micro-printing.
On fake Euros, the micro-printing is normally either blurry under magnification or non-existent. A good magnifying glass is therefore a handy tool when you need to weed out possible fake bills.

, Holding Euros up to standard light sources reveals many of the key security features. Using ultraviolet (UV) or infrared technology, however, reveals special features as well.Real Euros do not emit a “glow” under UV light. Fibers embedded in the bill do however emit areas of coloring that vary by denomination. Newer bills emit three colors under UV light.
Under infrared light, only the far right side of the printing on the front of a real Euro, including a small bit of the architectural image and the hologram, will remain visible.
Under UV light, fake Euros usually emit a bright glow and reveal the fake watermark and security thread as dark lines.
The text and images of fake Euros are usually either completely visible or invisible under infrared light.

LESS: Regular Savings Contribution
ADD: Withdrawals from Savings (except new home)
LESS: Equity additions & Expenses
Cash On Hand: OVER (SHORT),Ending Balance


(Note: if you're SHORT per your Budget, you need to spend less, get a loan and/or to make more money.)

, Follow the subsection instructions for January as to whether to add all the items in a subsection (like INCOME or SAVINGS) or subtract some. Then bring the subsection total or line item down to the ANNUAL BUDGET RECAP bottom section and add or subtract accordingly -- careful, some are reversed from Savings because a contribution to Savings is a deduction from Cash on Hand, and a Withdrawal from Savings adds to Cash on Hand.

,, When you have your copy, retitle it Budget. Again make another copy of the Actual sheet and title it OVER (SHORT). Subtract your Actuals from Budget to arrive at OVER (SHORT) by clicking in cell B4 of OVER (SHORT) and entering the formula, =Budget!B4-Actuals!B4.

, Clear any blank rows you may have inserted so you don't end up with cluttering zeroes.

They also have a supplemental trust left to them.
They have other investments and are pretty thrifty.
They own a small business they report on Schedule C of Form 1040.
They own their own home and rent out a room to also supplement their income; the tenant also does housework and cooking, etc. in lieu of cash rent.
They have recently refinanced their home to take advantage of low interest rates and to do a remodel, driveway repaving and fix the roof.
However, the refi wasn't as much as they wanted, so they've had yard sales and also sold some recreational vehicles and assets of their youth -- they're semi-retired -- and they also sold one of their two cars. They're going to either buy a smaller home or retire to a senior community -- they haven't decided which yet though.
They do have a fair retirement ""nest egg"" built up though, that they'd like to avoid drawing down from for as long as possible.
So now, one of them pays a friend to transport her to doctor's and dental appointments, grocery shopping, etc., and this was all worked out on a mileage basis, with amounts factored in for repairs, insurance and fees, etc.
Her husband, though working and helping her run the small business, went back to school, and will need to start paying back an educational loan this year. His employer covered most of the cost of the texts and school supplies but not the laptop or home PC he bought, which he also uses in his home business, and keeps a career library on and other professional software (which is deductible above what was reimbursed by the employer).
The couple has certain medical, visual and other physiological issues -- all deductible, as well as the transportation to and from the offices.
The couple is active politically but these expenditures are not deductible in most cases.
The couple requires assistance with certain aspects of the bookkeeping and accounting for the small business, and they also have hired a part-time production assistant, so they needed help coping with all the payroll, insurance and human resources issues as well.
The new company will operate partially over the internet via a website, which is under development, for a ""one-time"" fee, which is deductible.
They plan to use Excel to help budget both their business and personal financial activities, by copying these accounts to a second and third worksheet. The leftmost tab or worksheet will contain Actual amounts, the middle worksheet will contain Budget amounts, and the rightmost worksheet will compute the difference as OVER (UNDER) amounts. With this workbook, a Cash Flows worksheet, a Balance Sheet and a Profit & Loss Statement, they will have the reporting they need to not only stay on top of their business but also take all the deductions on their tax forms to which they are legally entitled, so long as they maintain their files, ledgers and receipts in good order.
You will note that, because this document is designed for people in semi-retirement, it contains many tax items faced by other people with fewer years of work behind them (but may be missing a huge item like day care), as well as addressing many of the concerns of many senior citizens.
The following is the Budget for the semi-retired couple. Note that items which have a Beginning Balance and Ending Balance have the Beginning Balance transferred over to the far right YTD column, which otherwise sums across, except for the Ending Balance line, which sums down vertically. Mostly, the Year to Date column sums across horizontally. Months April to October are filled in but hidden.

Learn about the fund.,
Know who is eligible.,
Make any necessary changes.",How to Ensure You Get Your Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) Quickly in Alaska1," The Permanent Fund Dividend is also called the Alaska Dividend. Each year, Alaska invests part of its oil revenue into this investment fun. Many states have investment funds, but Alaska is the only one who provides every citizen with an annual dividend from the fund. Since 1982, Alaskan citizens have received annual income from the PFD. This money is given to every man, woman, and child who is a citizen of the state.;
, There are several requirements residents must meet to be eligible to receive their dividend. You must have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year and you must intend to remain in Alaska indefinitely. Additionally, cannot have claimed residency in any other states during that year. Your criminal history is also taken into account. You cannot have been convicted of a felony in the past calendar year. If you were incarcerated, you are not eligible for the dividend.
If you were absent from Alaska for more than 180 days, you need to make sure it was an allowable absence. Check with the governor's office to make sure your absence was approved.

, If you don't meet the requirements for this year, you can take steps to ensure that you are eligible for the next dividend. The most important thing you can do is to establish residency. It is not enough to simply be physically present in Alaska.In order to establish residency, you must:


Move to Alaska;
Prove your intent to stay, which could be done by buying a home, getting a job, registering to vote, or registering a vehicle;
Preserve documents that prove your residency;
Sever connections to other states; and
Maintain the residency requirements for one year."

, If you have recently moved to Alaska, this might be your first time applying for your permanent fund dividend.You want to make sure that you have proof of residency. The documents that you provide will need to include dates that indicate you have been in residence for the previous calendar year.There are several different types of documents that can be used as proof of residency. You can use school records, your voter registration card, employment records, or motor vehicle registration paperwork.

, You start applying for your PFD on January 1. On this date, you will be able to visit the PFD website and start your application.Every person who wishes to receive a payment must fill out a separate application., If you would rather have a hard copy of your PFD application, you can get a copy at any distribution center in the state., The application period is from January 1 through March 31 every year. During those months, the application is available to all Alaska residents. The easiest way to complete the application is by using the online form provided by the government of Alaska. If you prefer to fill out a paper application, they are available at statewide Distribution Centers.
The sooner you fill out your application, the sooner it will be processed.

, Before you file, you will need to sign your application. Even if you file electronically, you must still sign the document. There are two ways: either print a signature page off or sign electronically.


To print a signature page, click on the ""Reprint a Signature"" tab at the PFD website. The link is on the right.

Print off the signature page after selecting it from ""Required Items."" Mail the signed page to the ""Alaska Department of Revenue, Permanent Fund Dividend Division, P.O. Box 110462, Juneau, AK 99811-042.""It may also be faxed to 907-465-3470.
Alternately, you may sign the application electronically. To do so, you must create a myAlaska.gov account.A myAlaska account is only available if you are an adult who has received the PFD previously.

, The application deadline is March 31. When you file your application, make sure you retain a receipt as proof of filing. If you filed online, print off the receipt page when it comes up. If you mail it in, make sure you keep your postage receipt. If you filed it in person, ask for a receipt.

Pay attention to updates.,
Enjoy your money.",How to Ensure You Get Your Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) Quickly in Alaska3," The government of Alaska makes it pretty simple to receive your money.

If you choose direct deposit, you'll need to provide your financial information in advance. You can do that online on the website for the Alaskan government.If you have a child, he or she will also receive a check. As a parent, you can cash the minor's PFD check. You will simply need to provide picture identification at an Alaska USA branch.

, You will be informed in advance of the date of distribution. This date is provided on the state website, and is often reported in the news. You will also be informed of the amount of your dividend.Since the PFD is based on investments, the amount distributed each year will vary. News about the specific amount for the year is usually released in the summer, with the actual distribution

, The PFD is one of the great things about living in Alaska. It is one of the very few examples of guaranteed income in all of the United States. Many Alaskans like to use their dividend to treat themselves to something nice. Maybe you'd like to go on a vacation or make a down payment on a new car. Whatever you choose, enjoy!"

Effectively track your goals.,
Discipline yourself to keep on track to really achieve any goal that is worthwhile until it's accomplished.,
Review your goals regularly, preferably daily


Keep yourself constantly reminded of your goals by reviewing them at a specific time each day.,
Break down a goal into actionable steps


Many people tend to easily get overwhelmed by all the things they need to do to accomplish a goal.,
Break down a goal into quantifiable results


Find a measurable aspect of your goal, and write it down as a number.,
Track a goal by the amount of time you spend on it


There are certain kind of goals that can't be easily broken down to definitive steps.",How to Effectively Track and Accomplish Your Goals," One of the most common reasons that people don't get to accomplish their goals is that we tend to get distracted, and we lose track of important things that need to be done consistently in order to move forward towards our goals. Maybe you have set a perfectly achievable goal and planned every detailed step, but without effectively tracking your goal and knowing your progress, most certainly you will get discouraged when the first obstacle gets in the way and end up giving up on your goal eventually.;
, There are several ways to effectively track your goals.

, It can be in the morning, first thing after you get out of the bed. It can be at night just before you go to sleep. Write down all your goals in a notebook, or store them in a computer software. When you review them, envision how accomplishing that goal will make you feel.
Check your current progress, understand what you did to move it forward, find out what else you still need to do. By doing this regularly, you train your mind to become alert to things that are related to your goals, and gradually your mind will automatically guide you to do whatever needed to achieve them.

, The trick is to break down a bigger goal into smaller actionable steps. For example, say your goal is to start your own business. There are many things you will need to do. But before spending too much time on thinking about how difficult or time consuming they will be, first break things down a bit. For instance, obviously first few steps towards your goal could be: decide an overall direction or business model, find a right product/service to sell, list requirements to make this product/service work, etc. If any of these steps still looks big, break it down further. Once you break it down to doable steps, all you need to focus on is just one small step. As long as you keep doing these small steps, the completion of the goal will take care of itself.

, For example, your goal could be to lose weight, then the number is your body weight. If you want to finish reading or studying a book, the number is the number of pages to read. If your goal is to save money for a dream vocation, the number is the amount of money you put in a bank account. As long as you know what this number is, you will always know your progress. All that's left is just to keep doing things that help you move that number closer to your goal's end result, and stop doing what doesn't change the number.

, It is often difficult to find any obvious measurable aspects for their end result. They can be goals, such as, stay in shape, have a peaceful mind, become more fluent in a foreign language, etc. For this type of goals, you can try tracking the amount of time you spend on doing things required by them. For instance, to stay in shape, track how many hours you work out per week. For having a peaceful mind, track how much time you spend meditating, or doing yoga per day. For becoming fluent in a foreign language, track how much time you spend practicing speaking the language per day. So on and so forth.

"
"
Evaluate your investment knowledge and aptitude.,
Determine your goals.,
Understand the different roles of investment websites.",How to Choose an Investment Website1," Before you choose an investment website, you need to have an idea of what you're looking for and what you wish to accomplish. Consider what you already know about investing and how much guidance you will need. Do you already have a strategy and know how you'd like to invest and you're just looking to reduce service costs? Or are you a total novice and require someone to advise you, or a website that will do most of the work for you?

Think about how much time and attention you want to devote to your investments. Are you interested in following the market devoting time to track and analyze? And do you have the skills to do this? Or would you rather be more hands-off with your investing? Are you prepared to pay someone to advise you? Your answers to these questions will help you choose a website that works best for you.;
, Ask yourself what you hope to achieve through investing. Are you saving for retirement with a personal IRA? What is your timeline? Are you hoping to use the money decades from now, or in three years?

If your goals are far in the future, then you can afford to take more risks with your investments for bigger payouts, because you have plenty of time to let your investments grow and ride out a volatile market. If you need the money sooner, then you will want to make safer investments with a lower rate of return, because you don't have as much time to recover from a loss.
Again, understanding your goals will help you know what to look for in an investment website. Look for one that will help you reach your goals, whatever they may be.

, You can use an investment website to simply make transactions — logging on, entering your oder, then logging off — but keep in mind that different websites will offer other services as well. Beyond making the trade, an investment website might connect you with a professional who can offer you advice, allow you to manage your portfolio, follow the market, or even take classes to educate yourself further. Think about whether you want something that is bare-bones, or a website that will help guide you through the process and allow you to learn more about your finances."

Make sure you have software to plot your risk graph.,
Your break even points range is at least 10% of stock price.,
Max Profit to Max Risk ratio is at least 100%.,
Probability of Winning is at least 60%.,
Avoid trading through earnings date.,
Avoid trading through a dividends date.,
Pre-set your exits at the two break even points.,
Trade with Puts.,
Trade Back-To-Back Spreads.",How to Ensure Success With Options Calendar Spread," When trading straight calls or puts or vertical spreads (all legs on the same month), it is relatively easy to work out the max risk, max profit and break even point to draw risk graph. However, calendar is a horizontal spread that makes up of two different option months. That makes it almost impossible to manually and accurately plot your risk graph. So, you need software to do this. Utilize your free broker tools or sign up for a paid program. It does far more than just plotting risk graph such as modeling the implied volatility of the stock. This analyzes if you should trade this stock or not. 20% of the last year low in IV is the best.;
, This spread trades on stocks that move between an obvious support & resistance. It is recommended that you structure your risk graph so that your 2 break even points cover the range of stock’s movement. The best distance between these two points is 10% of stock price. For example, if stock prices at $30, your upside point should be $31.5 and downside point is $28.5. The wider, the merrier. It will increase your chance of winning. Also, when trading calendar you would want your stock to move less. Statistics say that stocks under $50 move a lot less than those above $50.

, Max Profit in this spread is the pointy head in the risk graph and your max risk is what you invest in the trade. This is a very low risk trade so u would want at least 100% potential profit to make your time and commission worth it. 120% or more in potential profit is the best.

, Different traders will have different number to identify their worth-the-time trades. This author's probability for calendar is 60% to make it worth trading. The higher is the better. 80% is the best.

, Earning potentially causes the stock to jump in either direction and out of your trading range. If you don’t really care or think this is a minor problem, do a research on the stock and see if it has historical record of jumping on earning.

, This author traded once thru dividend date. The risk graph completely crushed and collapsed. The author lost a bit more than 50% of the trade before he/she was taken out by the pre-plan exit order.

, Pre-planning your exits, as you know, is the most important part of your trading. For calendar spreads, you have 4 exit targets: 100% profit, 50% loss, upside break even and downside break even. You can do this easily by setting up an OCO order that contains 4 orders that aim at those 4 targets above. 100% profit and 50% use limit order. The other two utilize market order.

, Generally, you should trade put calendar. This is because most of the time it is cheaper than calls. Also, in case of an exercise, a call option will force you to short stock. This can be harmful if the stock pay dividends on the day you get exercise, you will have to pay dividend to the owner of the share you short.

, Back-To-Back means selling a nearest month option and buying the month right after that. When trading this spread, you would expect the stock not to move. And if it does, you would hurt so much. The way to do this is make it gamma neutral or as close to zero as possible.

This is a pretty high percentage. However, if you make a hundred and fifty transactions and invest $37.50 per month, you will only be giving Acorns 2.7% which makes a lot more sense., This site uses gaming systems, which can make investing more familiar and comfortable if you are a gamer.

Learn more about the environment.,
Join an environmental group.,
Spread the word.,
Go to an Earth Day fair.,
Enjoy Earth Day entertainment.,
Cook a special Earth Day meal.,
Remember that every day is Earth Day.",How to Celebrate Earth Day1," Earth Day is a good time to make a commitment to learning more about the environment and how you can help to protect it. Read articles to get up to date on the current issues affecting the environment, like pollution, water shortages, and climate change. Or, learn about a region you've never considered before, like the Arctic, the deserts, or the rain forests. Not sure where to start? Check out your local news sources for information about environmental issues in your own backyard.


Understand how climate change works, and what you can do about it.If you live in a city, look into urban environmental issues like contaminated drinking water and energy conservation.If you live near a body of water, do research to find out whether it's healthy or in need of help.Learn more about fracking, which is affecting many communities in the United States.Find out which species native to your area are under threat of extinction.;
, Think about the issues that concern you the most and if you haven't done so already, join a local group that undertakes activities to help protect the environment in your area. Earth Day is a great day to start getting involved. In almost any community, you'll find local groups that do the following:Host clean-ups of local bodies of water and their shores
Fight air and water pollution
Plant trees and install community gardens
Protect habitats under threat of getting developed
Can't find a group? Consider starting your own.

, Everyone has environmental knowledge they can share with others. Just talking about the environment with people who may not think about it that much is a good way to celebrate Earth Day. Talk to your parents, friends, teachers, siblings, and anyone else you'd like about the issues you care about most. Here are a few ways to educate others about the earth:


Give a speech at your local library on how to compost with worms

Take a group of children down to the recycling center to show them how things are recycled
Recite nature poems in the park
Offer to teach your office colleagues how to make environmentally-friendly choices at work during lunch hour
Encourage people to respond and if they have no opinions or they seem to not know much, help them learn some more by imparting your environmental knowledge in a friendly and helpful manner.
Get a group of friends to wear green and brown. When people ask you why you're dressed like a tree, take the opportunity to talk about Earth Day.

, Maybe your school, your street, or your local neighborhood is holding an environmental fair. If your community doesn't have one planned, consider starting one yourself. It's the perfect day to get together for a fun and educational celebration of the earth. Money raised can go towards a local environmental restoration project or to an environmental group agreed upon by all the participants running the fair. These offerings are common at Earth Day fairs:


Demonstrations of environmentally-friendly products
Children's earth-themed artwork
Healthy/locally grown foods to eat
Animal care demonstrations (including wildlife rescue)
Games for the children made of recycled products
Musicians and actors performing environmental music and skits
Stalls for recycling unwanted treasures and books
Local environmental organizations presenting their issues and wares.

, There are many Earth Day song lyrics available on the Internet. Most follow well-known tunes so people can easily sing along. These make a fantastic classroom activity and help younger children to become interested in environmental topics. iTunes has many songs about the Earth for downloading: try searching for words such as ""planet"", ""Earth"", ""endangered"", ""pollution"" etc.

, Invite friends and family over for a meal, and plan a menu that uses locally produced foods, is healthy and has minimal impact on the environment. Favor vegetables, fruit and other produce, as these use less resources to grow than mass-farmed meat. If you still would like meat, look for locally produced, organic meat. Try to have organic food completely.


To decorate for the meal, use recycled decorations made by you and your friends instead of buying brand-new decorations.
When you wash up after the meal, use the low-water dishwashing method. Teach those who are helping how to use it, too.

, Anything to help our environment is a perfect thing to do on Earth Day and every day. Don't restrict yourself to just one day a year; learn about how you can make a difference to environmental protection all the time. It's going to take a lot of work to heal our planet. Leading by example will help others remember that the earth is important every day of the year.

Plant trees.,
Plant wildflowers.,
Welcome animals into your yard.,
Talk to your neighbors about going organic.,
Commit to protecting local wild places.,
Clean up litter in your community.",How to Celebrate Earth Day2," As the date of Earth Day roughly coincides with U.S. Arbor Day, planting trees is a popular Earth Day activity. Trees helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clean pollution, secure soil in place to prevent erosion, and provide homes for many birds, insects and other animals. There's almost no more important, long-lasting act you can do to celebrate Earth Day.


Pick a tree that you know can survive in your climate. It's best to find a species native to where you live. If you're unsure about what that might be, ask an employee at your local garden shop, or inside the garden department of a big-box store.
To ensure that the tree grows tall and strong, make sure you plant it correctly. Choose the correct planting spot to meet its needs, dig a properly-sized hole, and water the tree well to give it a good start.

, Choose flowers that are native to your area and plant them in your garden or on nature strips where plants are usually grown. Restoring the local plant life will help attract native bird life, pollinators and local mammals. Here are a few examples of common flowers that will draw wildlife:


If you want to attract Monarch butterflies, plant milkweed, pansies or goldenrod.If you want to attract bees, plant bee balm, lavender or sage.
If you want to attract hummingbirds, plant foxglove, petunias or lilies., You can do a lot for the creatures of the earth starting in your own yard or neighborhood. In their quest for the perfect lawn, many people drive out the insects, rodents, birds and reptiles that need a place to call home just as much as we do. Starting on Earth Day, why not welcome these nonhuman neighbors into your yard? Here's how to do it.


Instead of mowing the entire yard, leave a few sections unmowed. Bees, butterflies, and many other insects will find this inviting. If you're worried about them coming inside, have the unmowed area in the back of the yard instead of right next to the house.
Install a bird feeder, bat feeder, squirrel feeder, hummingbird feeder, or any other type of feeder to attract more wild animals.
Provide a source of water, like a bird bath or a small pond.
Don't try to get rid of snakes, lizards, frogs, moles, squirrels, and the other creatures who want to hang out in your yard. Many of these animals are beneficial; they aerate your yard, eat mosquitoes and improve biodiversity in the area. Live and let live. Tell your neighbors to do the same!

, Pesticides and herbicides can harm wild animals, native plants, trees, pets, and even humans. Make Earth Day the day you stop using chemicals in your yard and try organic methods of weed and pest removal instead. Consider talking to your neighbors about making the whole neighborhood organic.


Getting rid of pests the old-fashioned way can actually be more effective than using pesticides. Try planting native plants to control the insect population. Use water to spray common insects like aphids off of your vegetable plants.
When it comes to weeds, pulling them out by hand works better than any other method.

, Whether you live near an ocean, river, forest, mountain, swamp or lake, wild areas like these need protection. They are home to many plants and animals who rely on them for food and shelter. On Earth Day, commit to protecting the wild places in your community by doing the following:


Join a group working to protect these areas from pollution and developments.
Encourage people to respect wild spaces by not damaging animal habitats, littering, and dumping in the water.

, Many groups use the weekend of Earth Day to clear roadways, highways and neighborhood streets of litter that has accumulated since the last clean-up day.Many companies donate gloves and bags for clean-up groups and villages organize bag pick ups. Once the group has collected the trash and placed the recycled bags along the road, get the village public works department to pick the bags up. It's a wonderful community project that you can do as an individual or with a group.

"
"
Eat food from local sources.,
Plant a vegetable garden.,
Consider a vegetarian or vegan diet.,
Cook from scratch.",How to Celebrate Earth Day3," Eating food that was grown or raised as close to your home as possible is important for a variety of reasons. Locally-grown food doesn't require as much gas to arrive in your town and end up on the shelves in your grocery store. The closer to your home it was grown, the more environmentally friendly it is.Farmer's markets are a great place to find local foods. Most foods available in farmer's markets were grown within a 50-mile vicinity.
Some grocery stores have a section devoted to locally-grown foods. Look for foods that were produced in your state, or better yet, within 50 miles of your town.
Look for foods that were produced on small farms, rather than manufactured at factories.

, When it comes to eating local, you can't get much closer to home than your own yard. You can grow a lot of different vegetables in a relatively small space. Earth Day falls during the perfect time of year to plant a garden. Try clearing a bit of grass away and planting a few different varieties to try out during the summer.



Squash is a great choice, since one plant produces enough to feed a small family for several weeks.

Tomatoes are popular among novice gardeners.

Beans are relatively low-maintenance.

Herbs take up very little room, and can be grown in pots.
Don't have space for a garden? See if there's a community garden in your area where you can start using a plot.

, Most meat is manufactured in an industrial setting under conditions that pollute the environment and are cruel to the animals.Mass-produced meat is normally pumped full of hormones, making it unhealthy for humans to consume. Eliminating meat from your diet is considered a great way to do your part to help the environment. Why not make April 22 your first meatless day?


A vegetarian diet is free of meat and fish, while a vegan diet is free of all animal products (including eggs, honey and dairy products). Choose the diet that works best for your health needs.
If you don't want to give up meat entirely, consider buying your meat products only from local farms where you know how the animals were treated. Look for farms that allow animals space to roam and feed them healthy food., Pre-made, processed foods require preservatives and a lot of packaging to keep them from going bad before you eat them. Check out the list of ingredients on items like frozen dinners, packaged snack foods and other common grocery store items. They likely contain extra sugars, chemical flavorings and other ingredients that aren't good for the environment or our bodies. The solution is to buy foods in their natural form and cook from scratch.


Even if a product is labeled ""natural,"" check the ingredients. If you see words you can't pronounce, you probably don't need to eat it.
Not sure you know how to cook from scratch? Start with easy dishes like omelets, casseroles, smoothies, or steamed vegetables. Once you learn some basic techniques, you'll be able to cook more and more dishes from scratch.

"
"
Reduce, reuse and recycle.,
Buy or make Earth-friendly cleaning products.,
Entertain kids with homemade crafts and toys.,
Sell or donate used items instead of throwing them away.,
Start a compost bin.Instead of throwing out your food scraps, turn them into soil for your garden.",How to Celebrate Earth Day4," Buy as little as possible and avoid items that come in lots of packaging. Start good habits on Earth Day and carry them through all year long. Here are a few ways you can reduce, reuse and recycle:



Support local growers and producers of food and products. These don't have to travel as far and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Take your drink container with you, and don't use any disposable plates or cutlery. Recycle all the things you do use for the day or find other uses for things that you no longer use.
Carry a cloth bag for carrying things in and recycle your plastic bags.

, Try making up a simple vinegar-and-water counter cleaner, or swapping out your bleach cleaner for a less-toxic orange-based one. Making your own cleaning products saves money and packaging. Homemade cleaning products also often work just as well as industrial-strength chemicals.


A solution of half vinegar, half water can be used to clean floors, bathrooms, cabinets, counters, and just about anything else in your home.
To remove stains from carpeting, clothing or other fabrics, make a paste with baking soda and water. Let it sit on the stain for a few minutes, then scrub it away with a toothbrush.

, Instead of using store-bought toys, help kids appreciate the beauty of reusing something old to make it fun and new. Tell kids to get creative and come up with their own ideas for how to make something around the house into a toy. Here are a few ideas:



Build a birdhouse or make a bird feeder to encourage the local bird population, which plays an important role in every ecosystem.

Turn used guitar strings into a centerpiece.

Make a basket from an old orange juice carton.

Convert an old floppy disk into a Starship Enterprise.

Wear a skirt made out of old umbrellas.

, Hold a garage sale, donate, or reuse household items. Many of us take up a lot of natural resources with stuff we don't really need, want or use. Ironically, there's a still lot of people who don't have basic necessities. Plus, a lot of your unwanted clutter can be used by local charities to resell for much-needed cash.


Another idea is to hold a clothing swap. This can be a fun, free way for friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors, and the like to find new wardrobe finds. (You can combine with an Earth Day lunch or dinner, too!)
Learn about product exchange communities like Freecycle and other alternatives.

, This process is called composting. Banana peels, egg shells, carrot tops and avocado skins don't belong in the trash, where they'll just end up in a landfill. To start composting,


Collect all of your food scraps (except for meat and dairy products) in a closed bin.
Add leaves, sticks, grass clippings and other organic items to the mix.
Turn the mixture every few days using a pitchfork.
The compost will break down into a rich, brown soil after several months of turning.

Gather around the dinner table.,
Express your complaints about each other and the world.,
Keep it lighthearted.,
Challenge a guest to wrestle you.,
Get pinned by your opponent.,
Have an alternative competition.",How to Celebrate Festivus," Instead of erecting a tree or displaying a menorah in your home, find a metal pole and place it in a corner of the living room. Festivus is all about low maintenance, so it’s ideal to rummage through your basement, attic, or garage for the metal pole, or for something else such as a tall lamp, that can act as a festivus pole.If you want to buy a Festivus pole, you can purchase one online.
You can also make your own Festivus pole. Head to a local hardware store, buy an aluminum pole and supplies to make a stand, and put it together at home in your workshop space.;
, There’s no need to add any decorations to your metal pole, so leave it bare. After all, tinsel is distracting according to Frank Costanza., You can also go the traditional route and nail a clock to a wall in place of a metal pole. While the metal pole served as the main Festivus decoration in the Seinfeld episode called “The Strike,” the bagged clock represented it in the original real family holiday that Seinfeld writer Dan O’Keefe used as inspiration., In “The Strike,” Festivus dinner consisted of meatloaf on a bed of lettuce. Make this as the main entree to celebrate festivus dinner correctly., Dan O’Keefe’s family always had either turkey, ham, beef stew, or lamb chops for Festivus dinner. You can also celebrate Festivus by serving one of these foods. Also, serve some pecan pie for dessert., If you aren’t feeling meatloaf, turkey, ham, beef stew, or lamb chops, you can also serve any food eaten in the Seinfeld series for Festivus.

Make it easy on yourself and go pick up some food from Arby’s.
Choose from many different foods, including shrimp, pizza, risotto, bagels, home-made sausages, egg rolls and more.
Serve a soup such as wild mushroom or crab bisque and make sure to quote the “No soup for you!” line at least a few times over the course of the meal., After dinner, it’s time to air the grievances. To get ready to do so, keep everyone seated at the dinner table., The airing of grievances is all about getting things off of your chest so that you can feel better. Pick a few things that you’ve been wanting to complain about.Have everyone take turns standing up and talking about what and who has been bringing them down., While Frank Costanza’s directness is pretty humorous in “The Strike,” keep in mind that real life is different than sitcoms. Be considerate and careful if you choose to air grievances about other people., Festivus isn’t over until the feats of strength take place. If you’re the head of the household, it’s your job to select your wrestling opponent at this point in the evening.

The person that you select can decline if they have a good excuse, such as having a broken leg or having worked a double shift at work., The selected individual must pin down the head of the household in a wrestling match in order to break down their authoritative power. This is the final ceremonial stage of Festivus., Wrestling can be a little dangerous, so feel free to have another strength-based competition that everyone can be a part of. Consider doing one of the following:


Arm, thumb, or leg wrestling

Cinco de Mayo celebrates Mexico's victory over France at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The Battle of Puebla was not a turning point in the Mexican and French conflict, as the French invasion succeeded the following year. Mexico was the underdog of the Battle of Puebla.The French Army was considered the greatest military force on the globe, having remained undefeated for 50 years. The Mexican forces were outnumbered (4,500 vs. 6,040) yet after being attacked, they suffered far fewer losses (83 Mexicans died, 462 French died).
The victory in battle is the primary reason for celebration in Mexico, while Cinco de Mayo in the United States has come to be a time to celebrate Mexican culture.
Cinco de Mayo is also a great opportunity to talk to some of the more elder Hispanic members of your community. Ask them where they immigrated from, what they do for a living, and what their Mexican heritage means to them.;
, You can incorporate the colors green, white, and red (the colors of the Mexican flag) into your outfit. Draping the Mexican flag around your shoulders is also another easy way to bring the Cinco de Mayo spirit to a party. You can also wear clothes inspired by Mexican traditions, or actually designed by Mexican clothing designers.Instruments, such as a guitar, or maracas can liven up any chosen costume.
Try to stay away from purchasing or making a typical Americanized version of a Cinco de Mayo costume. These costumes tend to promote cultural insensitivity, and can make others feel very uncomfortable.

, The best Cinco de Mayo party idea is to hire a mariachi band. This is a group of traditionally dressed Mexicans who will play music that accompanies the holiday. If you have some spare money to use for the party, feel free to visit websites to hire a mariachi band near you.


If, however, you do not have a lot of money to spend, you can always create your own Mexican themed playlist for your Cinco de Mayo party. Search on Google for the ""top billboard songs in Mexico"" or ""top billboard songs in Spanish."" This will allow you to search for songs that are popular today.
You can always learn how to play guitar, or the maracas yourself. See either How to Make Maracas or How to Play Guitar.

, This might mean red, white and green streamers (colors of the Mexican flag). Purchase a Mexican flag at your nearest department, or party prop store to hang around your room. Brightly colored tableware can also be purchased to serve food on.


Making a piñata is another great option to add to any Cinco de Mayo party. You can use it as decoration or as a fun activity for the kids. Piñatas can be bought at most party stores, especially around the time of the Cinco de Mayo holiday. For more information on how to make your own piñata, visit: How to Make a Piñata.
Use the colors of the Mexican flag (green, white and red) on your clothing, accessories, or anywhere else you may find relevant.
Luminaries are also another great traditional option. These are tin candle-holders with punched holes in them to create the effect of a starry night. Visit How to Make Luminaries for more information.

, The best known Cinco de Mayo themed dance is the Mexican Hat Dance. However, there are other Latin-style dances such as the salsa, rumba, or folk-lorico. You can hire a professional to teach the partygoers multiple Mexican style dances. There are also numerous videos on YouTube which will teach you some simple Latin dance routines., Grind together 3 tablespoons of chopped white onion, 2 tablespoons of cilantro, 4 chiles serranos, and 1 teaspoon of salt together in a medium-sized bowl. Do so until the consistency is that of a paste.Cut 3 avocados in half longways using a sharp knife. Remove the pits but do not throw them away. Remove the flesh of the avocado with your knife, and toss it into the original mixture. Mash the flesh in with the mixture, and stir with a spoon until the ingredients are consistent.
Chop up 2/3 cup of finely chopped (not peeled) tomatoes. Toss these into the bowl as well, and mix with the other ingredients.
Place your guacamole in a serving bowl. Sprinkle extra onion and tomato overtop of the guacamole. You can add the pits on top for an added visual effect. Serve immediately with a fresh flour tortilla.
For more information on how to make different types of guacamole, see: How to Make Guacamole.

, Preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Get out a 9 inch round cake pan. In a blender, combine 8 eggs (whites and yolks), one 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix these together until the ingredients become smooth.In a medium sauce pan, place 1 cup of white sugar. Place the pan on the stove and continuously stir until the sugar liquifies. Remove from heat when it begins to turn light brown, and place it in the waiting 9 inch cake pan. Pour egg mixture overtop the liquified sugar.
Place your cake pan inside of a roasting pan. Pill your roasting pan up with water, till the point where the water goes about half-way up the side of the cake pan. Then take the roasting pan and put it in the oven.
Cook the flan for about an hour. You can periodically check when the time is almost expired with a knife. Simply stick the knife into the flan. If it does not stick, the flan is done.
Serve the flan. Simply take the pan out and rest it safely for about an hour. When you are ready to serve, place a plate upside-down overtop of the cake pan. Then flip the cake pan over, holding the plate against it. You might have to shake the cake pan slightly, or use a knife to get the flan to come out.
For more information on how to make flan, visit: How to Make Flan


, Purchase about 6-8 medium-sized tomatillos. Take the husk off by hand, and rinse the flesh with some warm water. In a blender or a food processor, combine the tomatillos with 1 jalapeno, 5-6 springs of cilantro (finely chopped), and 1/4 cup of water. Process the ingredients until they have the consistency of a puree (almost a liquid, but not quite). Pour the ingredients into a serving dish.Finely chop a white onion. You will want about a 1/4 cup. Place the onion in a strainer and run water over them. Shake the strainer to make sure the water coats all of the onion. Take the onion and pour it directly into the serving dish, along with the salsa verde.
Stir in about 1/4 teaspoon of salt into the salsa verde. It is now ready to be served.
For more information on making salsa verde, please see: How to Make a Salsa Verde.

, First, you will need to purchase 4 ears of corn. De-husk them by hand, but leave on the core ends so that you have something to grab them with. Preheat your grill or stove to medium-high heat. While your stove or grill is warming up, make the mixture which will be lathered onto the corn.The mixture includes: 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1 and 1/2 cups of sour cream, and 1/4 cup of freshly chopped cilantro. Mix those together in a bowl, either by hand or with a stirring spoon. After you have completed making this mixture, place your corn on the heat.
Make sure to turn the corn continuously so that it heats on all sides. Take your corn off after it starts to turn slightly brown around the edges.
Lather on the mayonnaise mixture while the corn is still hot. Grate parmesan cheese onto the corn. Lastly, squeeze a lime wedge overtop the corn. For more information about this specific recipe, see: How to Make Parmesan Lime Grilled Corn.

, The most important thing to buy is the tequila. The best tequila is 100% agave. A good bottle of tequila will cost anywhere between 30-50 dollars. You will also need to purchase Cointreau, a type of triple sec (orange flavored liqueur). Cointreau does not leave an aftertaste like other brands of triple sec do.Mix together, in a margarita mixing cup, the following ingredients: 2 ounces of tequila, 1 ounce of Cointreau, 1 ounce lime juice. Pour in some crushed ice, and shake well.
Take a cocktail glass and sprinkle lime juice over the rim. Dip the rim of the glass into salt poured out onto a plate.
Finally, pour the mixed ingredients into the glass. Garnish with either a lime wedge, umbrella, etc. For information regarding other types of margaritas to make, see: How to Make a Margarita.

, Combine 3 cups of all purpose flour, 2 cups of warm water, and 1 tablespoon of salt into a mixing bowl. Mix with your hands until a dough begins to form. If the dough seems to dry, add warm water by the teaspoon to the dough until it becomes soft.Lightly flour a table or surface. Place your dough on the surface, and knead until all of the ingredients are well mixed (about 5 minutes). See: How to Knead Dough

Roll small balls of dough out. Each of them are traditionally 2 inches wide. Once you have all of your balls rolled out, press on each of them by hand until they are about 1/2 inch thick.
Heat 1/4 inch oil in a frying pan on your stove at medium to medium-high heat. Fry on both sides until golden brown. You can use tongs or a spatula to flip them (make sure to flip them only once to avoid over-frying them).
Sopes go with almost any dish. You can serve them with cooked vegetables, shredded beef, carnitas, beans, cheese, etc. For more information on cooking sopes, please see: How to Make Sopes


, Mix together in a bowl the following ingredients: 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro, 1/4 cup lime juice, 3 cloves minced garlic, 5 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon dark brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Next, take 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and place them on a flat surface. Pound them with a mallet until they are 1/2 inch thick.Place the chicken breasts in a plastic bag, and pour the mixed ingredients in along with the chicken. Seal the bag, and place it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, allowing the chicken to marinade.
If you use a grill to cook the chicken, turn the heat to high. If you are using stovetop, place a pan on one of the burners. Place a touch of olive oil in the pan, turning the heat to medium-high heat. Place the chicken either on the grill or in the pan. Cook 3-5 minutes on each side, flipping once with either a fork, spatula, or tongs.
Check the internal temperature. Use a meat thermometer to make sure the chicken is at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit internally. Once the meat has been properly cooked, take it off the heat, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Slice the chicken into 1/2 inch thick strips.
Next, Slice 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, and 1 white onion. Place them on the same grill or pan, and cook them until they begin to turn soft. Stir them continuously so that all three ingredients become heated.
Place your chicken slices over multiple flour tortillas. Take the onions and peppers directly off of the heat and put them overtop of the chicken. Serve with a dollop of sour cream. For more information on cooking fajitas, visit: How to Make Chicken Fajitas.

, Begin by taking out a skillet. Place it on the stove, and turn the heat to medium-high. Add a tablespoon of olive oil, or other cooking oil. Once your pan is hot, add in 1/4 cup of diced white onion. Stir with a spoon or spatula until the onions start to become translucent (a minute or two). Then add to the onions, 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 2 teaspoons of cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon of hot paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. Stir the onion and spice mixture.Once you have cooked your spices and onions together for a minute, dump in 1 pound of ground beef. Reduce the heat of your stove to medium, and allow your meat to cook. Continuously stir until your meat is brown.
While your meat is simmering, get out another frying pan, and place it on the stovetop. Pour in about 1/4 inch frying oil. Turn the heat up to medium-high, and wait for your oil to heat up. Then take soft, round taco shells, one at a time, and dip them in the hot oil. As each of the shells is frying, take two forks and lift up each side of the shell as it is frying. Hold the sides up, so that the shell curls and remains that way.
Take out each of your shells once they are golden brown. Place them on a paper towel to soak up any excess grease. Take your meat mixture off the heat as well and set it aside to cool.
To serve, you simply take a shell and pour in some of the meat with a spoon into the curled shell. Then top it off with traditional taco toppings, such as chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and shredded cheese.

, Place a pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Put in about a tablespoon of cooking oil, and allow the oil to heat up. Then add in 1 and 1/2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper. Each side of the chicken breast should get seven minutes. When the chicken is nearly done cooking, sprinkle on top of the chicken 2 teaspoons of cumin powder, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of Mexican spice blend. Once the chicken is done cooking, take it out of the pan and place it aside to cool.In the same pan you just cooked your chicken, saute 1 chopped red onion, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Cook until tender. Then add in 1 cup of thawed, frozen corn, 5 whole green chiles (seeded and finely chopped), and 4 chipotle chiles (seeded and finely chopped). Stir until well combined. Then add in one 28 ounce can of stewed tomatoes. Saute for one final minute.
Pour 1 and 1/2 cups of canned enchilada sauce into a bowl. Dip each of your round, soft tortillas into the enchilada sauce. Spoon about 1/4 cup of meat mixture into each tortilla. Wrap the tortilla around the mixture, and place each of them face down in a baking pan, seam down. Top with a little extra enchilada sauce and shredded Mexican cheese.
Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree Fahrenheit oven. Once they are done, take them out. Serve with a garnish of sour cream and chopped tomatoes. For more information regarding how to make enchiladas, visit: How to Make Enchiladas.

, First, wrap two flour, 10 inch tortillas (or however many tortillas you plan to serve) in tinfoil. Place each of the wrapped tortillas in a preheated, 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put a skillet on your stovetop and turn the heat to medium-high. Place about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the pan, and allow it to heat up.Once your oil is heated, add in: 1 small white, chopped onion, 1/2 chopped red bell pepper, 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, and 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno peppers. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then pour one 15 ounce can of black beans (rinsed and drained) into the pan as well. Cook for an additional 3 minutes.
Dish out 3 ounces of cream cheese. Cut it into small cubes using a knife. Add the cream cheese to the skillet, along with a pinch of salt. Make sure the cream cheese is spread out. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. You can stir in 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro if you like as well.
Spoon mixture of black beans into the middle of each flour tortilla. Serve immediately. If you would like some more information on black bean burritos, visit: How to Make Burritos.

Consider buying a carbon offset.,
Ride your bike.,
Conserve water in your house.,
Save electricity.",How to Celebrate Earth Day5," This is designed to make up for the greenhouse gas emissions you create on the other 364 days of the year.Carbon offsets fund reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through projects such as wind farms, that displaces energy from fossil fuels.

, Use your bicycle or other forms of human powered transportation to commute to work or school and to run errands. This is a lot more environmentally friendly than relying on cars to get wherever you're going.


If your school or work is too far to bike, look for a form of public transportation you can take. A bus, train or shuttle is better for the environment than driving alone in your car.
Or consider carpooling with a few friends who are going in the same direction.

, Do you tend to use more water than you need while going about your daily chores and business? There are little things you can do that make a big difference in how much water you use. Plus, conserving water will keep your water bill down.Try adopting these habits:


While brushing your teeth or washing your hands, turn the water off when not in use. Turn the water off when you are brushing.
If you are washing your hands, turn the water off when you are scrubbing your hands with soap.
Take shorter showers every day from Earth Day on.
Install a grey water system in your home. Recycle water from the house for the garden.
Wash your car using a bucket rather than the hose. Drive the car onto grass for cleaning, so that the water you do use also waters the grass.

, It's one of the first ways many of us are taught to be environmentally friendly, yet we all need help remembering how important it is to do things like turn off the lights when you leave the room.

Be good luck-oriented.,
Think positively all day.,
Test your luck.,
Organize something fun to do after work, studies, or other duties.,
Think about how lucky you are.,
Dispense with the superstitious nonsense and take responsibility for the things that happen to you.",How to Be Lucky on Friday the 13th," There are a few superstitions aimed at bringing you luck that you might like to try:


Get out of the bed on the right side (that is, not the left side). This side is guaranteed to make your day luckier according to some superstitions. If you can't get out on that side because it is next to the wall or for another reason, just skip this step.
Wear red underpants. Apparently this color will bring you more luck than other colors. Whatever you do, don't choose green underpants or luck might abandon you.
Get your most trusted lucky charm out. Place it in your pocket and wear it all day.
Forget the cleaning. Few need to be told this most days but Friday the 13th is a great excuse because apparently handling a broom is unlucky on this day, as is changing the sheets, flipping the mattress, or doing the laundry. So forget the cleaning and just enjoy your day.;
, Make this the day to put aside bad moods, irritability, and your ongoing petty argument with a co-worker or family member. This is the day for choosing good things, good thoughts, and good outcomes. Indeed, not believing in bad luck is a good approach because research has shown that people who believe in bad luck tend to bring it on!Tell everyone that 13 is your lucky number. Let them know how excited you are that the date has fallen on the 13th again, and that you expect this to be a great day.

, Go out and deliberately do a few things that involve chance and where your luck takes you. Buy a lottery ticket for the next big draw, buy some scratch tickets, play a game at the casino, or place some sports bets. If you're too young to gamble, or dislike it, play some games of chance at home with friends and guess who is going to win, or watch a game on TV and guess who will win.


Apply for a new job you've really been wanting. Realize that the very superstitious don't all think that Friday 13th is a good day to start anything new, not even opening a new packet of cereal. But why not turn that superstition on its head and do something to force Lady Luck's hand? Today could be the day luck sways your way!

, Mark the day by celebrating and having fun with your friends. Go to a concert, eat out, visit a bar, watch a show in the park, etc. Just use the day as an excuse to party!

, Spend a little part of your day counting your blessings. What are all the things you're grateful for in your life? Who are the people in your life that matter most to you? What wouldn't you change about your life for all the world? Remind yourself of all the people, opportunities, and things that make you feel lucky in your life whenever you feel a sense of impending doom about anything!

, If you carry on thinking about luck all day, you're likely to be distracted and possibly something less-than-lucky might happen. Eyes open, head up, and brain in charge! Moreover, psychologist Richard Wiseman who carried out the study on believing in bad luck mentioned earlier, suggested that believing in superstitions can actually be a way of avoiding taking responsibility for your own failings.So perhaps this is as good a day as any to re-examine any loopy superstitions you might have inherited through the grapevine of folk gossip and finally take a stand to let logic rule your concerns rather than fears and half truths.

Decide how you'd like to celebrate.,
Dress up in Aussie colours.,
Watch the fireworks.,
Visit another Australian city to discover their celebrations for something different this year.,
Fly the Australian flag.,
Make Australian food.,
Make Australian crafts.,
Play the didgeridoo.,
Send an Australia Day e-card to friends and colleagues.,
Get into sport.",How to Celebrate Australia Day," There are many ways to celebrate Australia Day and all of them are good because you can catch up with mates. Probably the main ""rule"", if there are any rules, is just don't celebrate it alone! Get out there and enjoy it with lots of other people. Different ideas include:


Attending an official event (concerts, award ceremonies, fireworks, parades etc.)
Attending a local event (regattas, community barbecues, sausage sizzles, face painting, musical events etc.)
Holding a party or barbecue at home
Going to the pub for celebratory drinks
Having a celebration at work
Spend time at the beach or pool cooling down. Do this before an evening of partying - or make this the party too!
Visit museums and learn about Australia's history
Other. If you're stumped for ideas, check out the official list at A to Z of Event Ideas
;
, Use clothes, face paints, temporary tattoos, sunbrellas, jewellery etc. in a range of styles and colours to suit the occasion. For colours, there is a selection of possible colour schemes here:


Red, white and blue to reflect the flag, with some stars thrown in;
Wattle yellow and eucalyptus green reflecting past colour schemes and colours of the land;
The colours of the Aboriginal flag - black, red (ochre) and yellow;
The colours of the Torres Strait Islander flag - green, blue and white. (And perhaps the white dhari (headdress) symbol);
A ""national costume"" of your choosing (hold a competition and award prizes);
Anything goes. Provided you get up in time to make the celebrations, wear anything comfortable and a hat.

, Many cities and towns have fireworks in the evening. Grab a blanket, a picnic basket, some food and drinks and head out at a reasonable hour to get a good vantage point. Take a radio if the radio show follows the fireworks; many stations add music that is timed to the fireworks.

,


Visit Sydney. See the boats in the Harbour by day and watch the amazing fireworks display at night.
Visit the capital. Go and celebrate in Canberra, the heart of the nation. Here you can watch Australia Day awards ceremonies, attend picnics, see fireworks displays, enter a triathlon (or just watch it) or watch the Chief Minister's sailing regatta.

, Hoist an Australian flag up in the front yard, hang it from your car or wear it emblazoned across a t-shirt. You can choose from the Australian National flag, the Aboriginal flag, the Torres Strait Islander flag or other Australian flags.

, Bake up a feast of lamingtons, pavlova, koala shaped biscuits and meat pies. Make a cake in the shape of Australia. Make a pie floater or two for the 3am munchies.

, Make craft items with the kids that reflect Australian themes, such as platypus masks, koala stuffed toys, kangaroo cut-outs and gumnut keyrings.

, If you know how, play it for your local community (but note that in traditional Aboriginal culture only the men were allowed to play the didgeridoo). Donate funds to a local charity. Give them away as gifts, sell at craft stalls to enthusiastic Aussie celebrators or wear them - whatever takes your fancy.

, Look online for sites that provide this resource and wish your fellow Australians a very happy Australia Day.

, Play it, watch it or humour those who can't get enough of it. This is the season for cricket and tennis - when too much sport is barely enough. One time-honoured tradition is to catch a cricket game in the day and the fireworks by night.

Pull over in a safe manner.,
Search for loose change in your car or wallet.,
Identify a live representative.,
Drive up to the toll booth as you normally would.,
Inform the toll booth operator of your situation.,
Stay calm and ignore pushy drivers behind you.,
Listen to the operator's instructions.,
Thank the operator and exit safely.,
Fill out required paperwork and pay the toll.,
Follow up with the tollway if you don’t receive a notice.",How to Cross a Toll Bridge Without Money1," If there's a generous shoulder on the side of the road, and you can reach this zone without impeding other drivers, pull over before entering the toll booth in order to search for change.If there's nowhere to pull over safely, skip this step. You can look for change once you're stopped at the toll booth, or you can just move on with the procedure.;
, Check your pockets, dashboard, and center console to make sure you don't have any change handy for the toll. If you scrape together enough change, you won't have to go through the longer process of mailing in your payment later.

, Many toll booth zones have several booths, only one or a few of which are inhabited by a live representative. Since you need to speak with someone about your situation, scan the available toll booths and select one where you can see an employee inside.


Occasionally—often at night or in isolated areas—you will encounter a toll zone with no live officials at all. In this case, drive through automated toll booth locations and allow the automated system to take a picture of your license plate. The citation/bill will be mailed to you.

, Rather than obsessing over your lack of money and worrying about what the operator will say, concentrate on steering safely and pulling up to the booth. Studies have shown that there are more accidents on toll roads, so it’s much more important that you pay attention and stay safe in this scenario than worrying about finding change and avoiding embarrassment.Keep an eye out for specific safety bulletins and speed limits posted at the toll zone. Some places stipulate very low speed limits in these zones, while others are less strict, so you should always approach them on a case-by-case basis., Speak clearly and concisely so that neither the toll operator nor fellow drivers feel unduly delayed by your problem.


Being a toll booth operator can be a difficult and monotonous job, so be sure to address the toll booth operator with a polite and apologetic tone., Once you’re dealing with the official toll booth operator, you are in their hands and have no choice but to wait patiently until the process is completed. Impatient drivers might honk their horns or shout, but you should stay focused and attentive to the toll official.


This probably won’t take long, but it all depends on the operator and specific circumstances. The toll booth operator may need to exit the booth in order to record your license plate and ask for your driver's license, but they might instead just make a quick note and wave you through.
You might be asked to pull over to a nearby shoulder so that you don’t continue to block traffic. In this case, the operator will walk over to your car once they have filled out the requisite forms., The operator will let you know what you need to do in order to pay at a later date.


Sometimes the operator gives you Deferred Toll Payment Request Form to take home and fill out.
If the attendant doesn't give you a form to take with you, you should keep an eye out for a notice in your mailbox. A bill for the toll price should arrive within a few weeks, and you should pay as soon as you receive it.

, Just as you entered the toll booth zone following normal protocol, you should exit the booth as if you had paid the toll. Observe all posted speed limits and cautions while keeping a careful eye on surrounding drivers.

, If the attendant gave you a Deferred Toll Payment Request form, you can pay the missed toll as soon as you get home. You can pay by posting a check or credit card payment to the indicated address, or via an online payment portal. Just make sure to do so in a timely manner, as late payments will incur an additional fee., If you were expecting a ticket in the mail but haven’t received one after two to three weeks, contact the agency."

Note the county in which you received the citation. A California Highway Patrol ticket is payable only to that county's court.
Look out for correspondence from the county court by mail. Most counties will send you information about paying or contesting a traffic ticket. You will also be told if traffic school is an option.;
, You must wait a few days for your citation number to be entered into the system, so wait at least 2 business days after you got the ticket, and at least 2 business days before it's due.


Be sure to pay by the due date. Most counties in California will not accept payment online if a traffic ticket is past due.

, You will see a list of 58 counties. Click on the one where you were ticketed.


Each county has a different website, and a different way of handling online payments.
A few counties, like Kings, for example, do not allow you to pay your traffic ticket online. However, most of these counties provide a number that you can call and pay your citation with a credit card.

, In general, there will be a button that says ""Pay a traffic ticket,"" or ""Paying your traffic fine,"" or similar words.


Most have links to pay a ticket, request a court date and possibly request traffic school.

, Enter your name, address, and driver's license number. Enter your citation number as listed on your ticket.

, Most payments must be made by either credit card or electronic funds transfer.


If you choose to pay with a credit card, enter your credit card number, expiry date, security code, name and billing address, as required.
If you choose to pay with an electronic funds transfer you will need to enter your bank routing number and account number as well as your name, address and bank. The routing number and account number are listed on the bottom left of most personal checks.

, Check the box to plead guilty or no contest to the citation. You may also have an option to choose traffic school. Finalize the process using whatever button means ""Submit,"" and look for a confirmation that your citation has been paid.


A no contest plea means that you will not admit to guilt but you will receive the same punishment as if you plead guilty. A no contest plea is often used to avoid admitting guilt in the case of future lawsuits.

Find out if your state offers a permanent toll pass.,
Purchase the pass or device.,
Install your device.,
Keep a sufficient balance on your account.",How to Cross a Toll Bridge Without Money2," In many states, you can purchase a permanent pass or transponder which affixes to your car’s dash or bumper. This pass gets scanned electronically every time you pass a toll, and the charge is deducted from your running account. Not only do you not have to stop to hand over money, but you also don’t have to worry about keeping change in your car or wallet.


You should be able to find this information quickly and easily online. If you’re having difficulty, contact your local DMV or traffic authority and they can refer you to the proper administrative department.
Some passes function in multiple states and can be purchased at variable rates in different areas. For example, the E-ZPass used on New York highways can be used in fifteen states and is cheaper to purchase in certain states like Massachusetts., Some states or metropolitan areas allow you to purchase a pass online, while others require you to visit a licensed retail location.No matter what your area’s protocol is, the transaction should be relatively quick and painless.


Most toll agencies charge an initial fee of $30.00-$80.00 for the device or tag, and then you are responsible for loading sufficient funds onto the pass via your online account., Check enclosed instructions to make sure that the transponder or pass is displayed clearly on your dash or bumper, as you can incur additional fines if your device is displayed improperly., Once you’ve purchased your device, you’ll need to register online and add funds to the account. Some states offer a pay-as-you-go option which links a credit card or bank account to the device and charges tolls to this account. Other states require you to charge a certain amount to your device ahead of time and then automatically refresh this balance once you get down to $5.00 or $10.00 in remaining funds.Some areas also allow you to load funds with cash, so check out your options ahead of time.
If your credit card is linked to your pass, keep the expiration date in mind and remember to enter a new card or account once this date arrives.

Do you have the time to prepare a defense? You can’t go into court and “wing it.” Instead, you will need to request documents and take the time to read them.
Are you comfortable talking in public? To be persuasive, you need to be somewhat comfortable making an argument in front of a judge and asking a police officer questions. If you dread talking in public, then you might want a lawyer.
Is your case complicated? You might not understand the regulation you violated. If so, you should consult with an attorney.;
, If you think you want legal help, then you need to find a qualified attorney. To find a lawyer, you should visit the Washington Bar Association, which has helpful information.In particular, they have links to the following:


Your county bar association, where you can find private attorneys to hire.
Information on qualifying for reduced fee legal help.
Pro bono representation, where a lawyer works for free.
Other helpful legal information.

, Although you want to fight your traffic ticket, you should also consider the option of asking for a “deferral.” In this situation, you admit to being “guilty” but the court defers actually finding you guilty for one year. If, after a year, you don’t have any more traffic citations, then the court will dismiss the ticket.However, if you get another citation in that year, the judge does not dismiss the ticket and you are found guilty.


You can only get a deferral once every seven years.You may not get a deferral if you hold a commercial driver’s license, even if you were ticketed while driving your personal vehicle.
If you want a deferral, then you must request it before your contested hearing. It is not automatic. Instead, the judge has discretion in certain situations, which may differ by the court you appear in. You can talk to your attorney if you have questions.

, With mitigation, you essentially plead guilty but give the judge an excuse for why you committed the violation. The judge then has the power to lower the amount of your fine.If you want to mitigate, then contact the court clerk and ask how to request it.


Mitigation is still a conviction, and it will go on your driving record.
However, you can request a deferral as part of mitigation.

, After receiving a ticket, you have three options. You can pay a fine, request mitigation, or request a contested hearing. If you want to fight the ticket, then select a contested hearing.You have to check “contested hearing” on the ticket and then return it to the court within 15 calendar days. If you’re late, your license can be suspended.
Be sure to keep a copy of both sides of your ticket for your records.

, You need to understand exactly what you were charged with. For example, you might have been charged with speeding. Alternately, the officer might claim you didn’t have certain functional lights working on the vehicle.


Once you identify the charge, you should look up the violation online. Find out what elements the prosecutor needs to prove at a contested hearing.Remember, if the prosecutor fails to prove one required element, then you can win.

, If the officer didn’t sign your ticket, then the ticket can’t be introduced at your trial. Take out your ticket and check to see if it was signed., As soon as possible, you should sit down and write out your memories of what happened when you were stopped. In particular, note the following:


Were there other cars on the road along with you? If so, then radar or laser technology might have picked up a different car’s speed.
Was the weather overcast? If so, the officer might not have been able to see well.
Was your speed measured on a flat, straight portion of the road? Generally, radar works best when the road is straight. If you were clocked on an incline or on a winding road, then you can raise these factors.

, You can request a copy of all documents the prosecutor wants to introduce at trial. You should file a letter with the court clerk and serve a copy on the prosecuting attorney. You must request discovery at least 14 days before the hearing.You will be sent the following information:


the citing officer’s sworn statement
video or photographic evidence which the prosecutor intends to introduce
names of witnesses not identified in the officer’s sworn statement

, You should go through each document you receive and analyze it. Look for ways the evidence helps you prove you aren’t guilty of the traffic offense. For example, look for the following:Was the report filed with the court? Under Washington law, the officer must file the citation within five days of issuing the ticket. If not, then you can get the case dismissed.Did the officer identify your car as the only one targeted by the radar? If not, then you can claim the officer took a speed reading of a different vehicle.
Did the officer calibrate the radar gun with the tuning forks? Read the officer’s sworn statement.
Did the officer state that he or she was qualified to operate the radar or laser device? This should be in the sworn statement. If not, then you can challenge the speed reading.
When did the officer check whether the radar or laser was working properly? Did they check the device after stopping you?

, Washington state’s traffic court rules are available online.You should download them and read a copy.


There may also be local court rules, which you must follow. You should check with your court clerk or look on the court’s website.

, If you are representing yourself without an attorney, then you need to learn the state’s rules of evidence as best as you can. You can find them online.With a few exceptions, the court will follow these rules.In particular, learn what “hearsay” is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of what the statement says. For example, a witness might get on the stand and testify that her father told her that you were speeding. This out-of-court statement (“I saw the defendant speeding”) is offered in court to prove you were speeding.
If hearsay is offered at trial, you need to stand up and say, “Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.”

, In some courts, you might have to attend a pre-hearing conference. At the conference, the judge might offer you deferral. The judge might also ask you if you want to go to mitigation instead of a contested hearing.At the conference, you may have to fill out some paperwork, which will differ by court.


You will be given the option of waiving your appearance at the conference in writing.You must make sure the court receives the waiver before the day of the pre-hearing conference. Contact the court clerk and ask if there is a waiver form you must fill out. Some courts have particular forms, and you should always use the court’s form if one is available.

, If you attend the prehearing conference, then the judge should tell you the date of your contested hearing. If you waived the prehearing conference, then you will receive notice of your contested hearing date in the mail.You should receive the hearing date within 21 days of requesting a contested hearing.

, A subpoena is a legal request to show up at court on a certain day and time in order to deliver testimony. You should identify witnesses who you want to testify on your behalf and send them a subpoena. You may also request that the citing officer show up to court by sending a subpoena. Generally, in Washington, an officer does not need to show up at your contested hearing unless you subpoena him or her.


You can ask the court clerk to issue the subpoenas.Remember to issue the subpoena at least seven days before the contested hearing.

, According to Washington law, you must be sent written notice of your contested hearing date within 21 days. The hearing must also be scheduled at least 14 days from the date notice was sent and also be within 90 days of the pre-hearing conference (when one is scheduled) or 120 days of the infraction (if there was no pre-hearing conference).If you didn’t receive notice within these dates, you need to file a “Motion for a Speedy Trial” with the court. You also must serve a copy of your motion on the prosecutor. Your notice setting the contested hearing date may explain how you can go about doing this. If not, then call the court clerk or meet with a lawyer.
You must file and serve this motion within 10 days of receiving the notice of your contested hearing date., The best preparation is to sit in on a contested hearing before your own. You can call the court clerk and ask when “contested infractions” are being held.Sit in the back with a notepad and pay attention to how the proceedings go.

, You want to look good for your contested hearing. Wearing neat, clean clothes will signal to the judge that you are a serious person. In no circumstances should you wear shorts, flip flops, ball caps, tank tops, crop tops, see-through clothing, or jeans (unless jeans are your only long pants).Men can dress “business casual.” Wear dress pants and a long-sleeved button up shirt. You can also wear a conservative tie if you have one. For footwear, wear dress shoes with dark socks.
Women can wear dress slacks with a nice blouse or sweater. Women can also wear a dress or a skirt, but they must not be too short or tight. Wear flats or shoes with a low heel, but not open-toed sandals.

, Before the contested hearing begins, you should bring to the judge’s attention anything that warrants having the case dismissed or evidence suppressed. This is called a “pre-trial” motion.For example, you can raise the following:


The ticket wasn’t filed in time. The ticket must have been filed with the court within five days of the date of the infraction (excluding weekends and holidays). If it was filed too late, ask the judge to dismiss the case.
Ask the judge to suppress the sworn statement if you didn’t receive it at least seven days before the contested hearing. At the same time, ask for dismissal for lack of evidence. You will have to show that you were prejudiced. For example, you learned about a new witness in the officer’s sworn statement but you haven’t had time to talk to the witness.
Request that the evidence be suppressed if you never received it, and also move for dismissal for lack of evidence. Here, you don’t need to make any showing of prejudice.Request dismissal based on your “Speedy Trial Motion.” Explain to the judge how the hearing does not comply with the timing requirements of Washington law.

, Hearings differ around the state. In some courtrooms, there might not be a prosecutor. However, if there is one, then he or she should go first. The prosecutor will introduce the officer’s sworn statement into evidence. If the officer didn’t sign the statement, object to the judge.


If you subpoenaed the officer, then the prosecutor should question the officer first. If the officer didn’t show up despite the subpoena, then you should ask the judge to dismiss the case.
You also can cross-examine the police officer. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.

, You also can have witnesses testify. For example, a person riding with you might testify that you weren’t speeding. You will also probably have to testify. Remember the following tips:Listen closely to the question and try to answer only the question. Don’t provide information that hasn’t been asked.
Speak loudly so everyone can hear you.
Stay calm. Don’t get into an argument with the prosecutor. This can make you look less believable.
Tell the truth. You are testifying under oath. Also, truth is your best defense. When you tell the truth, it is hard for the prosecutor to trip you up.

, In your closing argument, you need to sum up all of the evidence you think shows you didn’t commit the infraction. Try to draft a list of bullet points. You won’t get a lot of time to talk and should try to summarize the evidence in under 20 sentences.


For example, you could say, “Your Honor, the evidence doesn’t show that I was driving 60 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone. Instead, the evidence shows that Officer Pinkerton didn’t know whether or not he actually measured my speed. For example, Mrs. Smith testified that the traffic was heavy. If you recall, she was riding in the car with me, and she said that several larger vehicles were passing us at the time Officer Pinkerton said he clocked me going 60. Also, Officer Pinkerton himself admitted that he didn’t check to see if the radar gun was working properly either before or after stopping me.”

, To be convicted of the driving offense, the state must prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that you committed the offense. This is less than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Instead, the prosecutor must show it is “more likely than not” that you committed the offense.


If you win, the judge will issue an order dismissing the case.If you lose, the judge will impose a fine on you.

, As the defendant, you may appeal any judgment against you.You can appeal to a superior court. Contact the court clerk with questions about how to appeal.

Relax yourself before driving.,
Leave earlier so you don’t rush to your destination.,
Pay close attention to the speedometer.,
Use the cruise control option to set a speed.,
Drive a little bit under the speed limit.,
Burn off your need for speed in a safe setting.,
Drive less often.,
Learn manual transmission.,
Figure out the cost for speeding.",How to Stop Speeding1," Being anxious or angry can make you drive more erratically. Maintaining control is key to resisting the urge to speed. Before you start your vehicle, relax by taking some deep breaths. As you drive, try listening to light music such as classical instead of tense-sounding music like hip-hop or hard rock. Focus on the road and let go of negative, emotion-laden thoughts.It’s okay to stop on the side of the road or in a parking lot if you need to reorient yourself. Start over by breathing and shaking out the tension. It can take a while before this becomes second-nature to you.;
, Many people speed because they feel like they’re running late. Don’t put yourself in a situation where you feel pressured to get to work or an appointment on time. Take care of tasks at home, such as preparing breakfast or choosing an outfit, ahead of time. Give yourself plenty of time to get to where you need to go., Occasional glances at the speedometer will keep you in check. Take a quick look down to see how fast you’re going. Adjust your speed accordingly. The act of looking forces you to stay engaged instead of zoning out and driving by instinct. Remember to keep your glances brief so your eyes stay focused on the road., Cruise control is useful for straight, open roads that many people are tempted to speed on. Find the “Set” button on your car. Accelerate to the speed you wish to go, then press the Set button to maintain that speed automatically. You may use accelerate and decelerate buttons in your car to adjust the speed.The cruise control setting differs between car brands. Consult your owner’s manual for instructions on how to engage cruise control.
Cruise control is not appropriate for winding roads, city roads, or rainy weather. In addition, the car’s speed is affected by hills. Watch out when you go down hills, since you’ll pick up speed. Braking usually stops cruise control in addition to slowing you down.

, Dropping 5 mph (8 km/h) won’t significantly decrease your travel time. Staying aware of the speed limit and choosing to stay below it reduces your chances of accidentally going over it. Even if you notice a big difference at first, you’ll adjust the more you drive at the reduced speed., Racing games give you a chance to go fast without putting everyone at risk. Find these at arcades or on home computers and game consoles. You may also try joining autocross events or club racing with the SCCA. Get your speed fix before you have to head out onto the road.

, Find ways to cut down on your driving. Check your area for bus routes. Sometimes you can park near the bus station and use the bus to travel the rest of the way to your destination. Biking or walking are also options for shorter distances. Is your office right around the corner? Take the opportunity to refresh yourself with some exercise., Your car may not have manual transmission, so you’d have to consider switching cars. With manual transmission, you have to shift up a gear using the gearstick to go faster. This is an easy way to limit your maximum speed. You’ll also learn to identify how fast you’re going by the sound of your engine., Mentally calculate how much that ticket will cost you. Tickets in the USA can set you back hundreds of dollars. Going faster than 65 mph (105 km/h) burns more fuel and causes more wear and tear to your vehicle. In addition, an accident you are at fault for can cost you much more.


Even if money isn’t an issue, think of the cost in lives. Your speeding is a risk to yourself, your passengers, and everyone else on the road. Remember what will happen if you, for example, hit a child who runs out into the street. Now think of how you’d feel if that was your child.
The time you save by speeding doesn’t make up for the costs, so don’t rely on that as an excuse.

Make everyone in your home responsible for car insurance.,
Install speed monitoring.,
Raise speeding awareness with signs and pledges.,
Ask the city for a police presence.,
Petition your city for road barriers.,
Install video surveillance outside your home.",How to Stop Speeding2," Don’t take care of car insurance for someone else. When you pay it automatically, they don’t see the costs associated with speeding. Instead, make them responsible for the insurance price increase as well as any tickets they get. They will feel the full effects of any bad driving they do., A speed monitoring system fits in a car’s diagnostic port. It then relays GPS coordinates and speeding details back to a website. You can set boundaries for how far someone can travel, when they break certain speeds, and when the device is unplugged. These systems can be bought in electronic stores or online and maintained monthly for a small fee.Examples of these systems include MOTOsafety, Mastrack, and MobiCoPilot.
Make sure you have the person’s permission before tracking them.

, The simplest idea you can try to prevent speeding in your area is to raise awareness. Plant a sign in front of your house that notes the speed limit and that “90% of people obey it.” Have your neighbors help, and have them pledge to reduce their own speeding.

This will reduce speeding for a short period of time as people read the signs. Eventually, this effect wears off as the signs become part of the background.
Many times residents of the area are the ones likely to ignore signs and pledges.

, Seeing a police cruiser is enough to slow people down. Think about when there’s a large number of speeders in your area or when it’s least safe for them, such as when children are walking home from school. You may need to pester the government a bit before they send a car.

A police presence costs the government money and the effects are temporary. As soon as the police leaves, people will start speeding again.
The government may also install speed detection signs. These signs display your speed as you pass them. They may shame some people into slowing down, but many others will ignore these.

, Speed bumps are the most obvious road barrier. People must slow down to avoid damaging their car. However, better results come from narrowing the road, such as by making the sidewalks larger, adding stop signs, or adding chicanes (artificial narrowing).

Speed bumps can help, but they can also damage cars and feel annoying to you and your neighbors.
If you are permitted to park on the street, you can use your car as a barrier. Otherwise, you should not attempt to block the road on your own.
The city may also be able to install yellow hazard signs with a message like, “Deaf children at play.” People who see this may take more caution as they travel along the street.

, A continuous surveillance camera will allow you to monitor traffic near your home. Record yourself driving at and above the speed limit so you have a frame of reference for what’s too fast. Then, capture clips of speeders.Once you have the clips, you can send them to people or their employers. For example, you may see that your mailman is speeding and send the clip to their boss at the post office.
You can also use these clips to prove to your city government that speeding is a problem.

Review the citation.,
Ensure that your name, address, license information, and vehicle information are all correct.,
Research the violation online.,
Acknowledge your options.,
Remember that you have ten (10) calendar days to respond to the magisterial district court with your decision.,
Make your decision and contact the magistrate court.,
Relax.",How to Respond to a Pennsylvania Traffic Citation," Read through each section to make sure you understand the violation you allegedly committed, the fine and additional court costs, and all of the additional comments.;
, Contrary to common belief, just because a part of a citation is incorrect does not mean it will be automatically thrown out in court. However, it is still crucial to check all of these fields on the citation.

, Pennsylvania has various forms of the vehicle code offered online, including on the Pennsylvania legislature's website. The statute section for your violation will be located in box 27 on the right side of the citation. Enter this number, along with ""Pennsylvania Title 75"" into a search engine to read exactly what that specific section of the motor vehicle code says. A copy of the motor vehicle code (Title 75) is in the sources below.

, Pennsylvania allows individuals to either plead guilty and pay the fine and additional costs or set up a preliminary hearing with the magistrate court where the citation was issued.

, If you do not respond within ten days, you may face additional penalties including a driver's license suspension and additional fines. Also, a traffic warrant could be issued for your arrest for failing to respond.

, The information for the magistrate court is listed at the top left of the citation in box 1. If all that appears in this box is a long number with a few dashes in it, this is the number that identifies the specific court office. You can look this number up online to find the address and phone number for that specific court office.


If you choose to plead guilty, pay the fine as required by law. Once the fine is paid in full and any points are added to your driving record, the citation is complete; you do not have to do anything else.
If you choose to set up a preliminary hearing, receive the date and time for your hearing from the magistrate court. You may have to send the citation into the court, along with the payment in the amount of the total fine plus a $7.00 administrative fee, as your bond. Continue to research your violation and prepare any defenses that you may offer to the court. When your court date arrives, ensure that you are at the magistrate court earlier than your scheduled time. If the court is running ahead of schedule, they may take your case prior to your scheduled time.
At the end of your hearing, you will be told whether you were found guilty or not guilty and any associated penalties. If you are found not guilty, you should receive your monetary bond back.

Scout out the red light cameras on your route.,
Avoid the intersections with cameras when possible.,
Ease off your accelerator as you approach lights, even if they're green.,
Make quick decisions.,
Remain calm if the camera does flash.,
Go to court if you want to fight it.,
Know your options if you've received multiple offences.",How to Safely Avoid Red Light Traffic Fines," This may be as simple as looking out for the red light cameras at the intersection, or you may use technology based methods such as using a GPS to warn you of red light cameras. You may also be able to look up the location of the cameras on your local road authority website.;
, There will usually be another route to get somewhere to avoid the red light camera. However there will be locations and situations where there may be several cameras in the area and only a few available roads, so you must cross an intersection with a red light camera on it. In those cases, read on.

, If you have seen the green from a long distance away and feel it may turn orange soon, it is always advisable to slow down a bit to give yourself more decision time. Equally if the light turns red, you can safely slowdown and gradually stop from a distance to avoid the situation entirely.

, The hardest part of avoiding a red light fine is the situation where you are driving the limit nearing a green traffic light, which turns orange, prompting the split second decision weather to run the orange, or  put the brakes on and stop. It is important this decision be made immediately, as any time wasted will either result in a harder and more violent stop, possibly resulting in a ""rear-end type accident"", or a delayed run through the orange light, by which due to wasted time, will turn red and you will be fined.


To avoid this, your split second decision will be either sop or run. If you choose to stop, you must stop quickly, but as gradually as possible given the distance ahead of you. If nearing a green light, slowing down can also give you a little more decision time.
If you choose to run, however, it is advisable to go the maximum speed limit through the red light. Any slower and you will not have time to cross the orange light in time, resulting in a fine, Any quicker, and you risk getting fined for speeding, of which some red light cameras also dual function as a speeding camera.

, It is not something to get too upset over, the fine should arrive in the mail in 2- 4 weeks depending on the location, time of year, country, etc. Many people at least a few times in their life do encounter the orange situation in which they ran the light and are fined; however it is not a huge offence and the fine is usually the only downside.

, You may have to go to court depending on your situation. With multiple offences, you may have your licence suspended for a few months, to a year, to worst case licence cancellation. However, with red light fines licence cancellation is usually a rare occurrence.


Contesting the fine can be as simple as writing a letter to the fines authority (usually on your fine letter), or all the way up to going to court with traffic law lawyers. Many claim they can help you keep your licence; however, you will need to pay an considerably higher fine amount, in combination with the lawyer fees.

, If you're at risk of losing your license because of repeat offences, in some countries and states, they may let you keep your licence based on an ""option notice"" agreement, provided you do not commit any road offences within a 12 - 24 month period. The downside to this is if you do commit further offences during the ""option notice phase"", your licence will be suspended for a much greater amount of time than if you chose to voluntarily let your licence be suspended.


Also in some countries and states, even if your licence has been suspended or cancelled, you may be eligible to apply for a Special Conditions Drivers Licence, allowing you to drive for only certain special conditions, such as work tasks, medical requirements, or other conditions deemed by the authorities. You must use caution to not use the licence for driving elsewhere, as the condition may be connected to your number plate, causing police to pull you over frequently and ensure you are compliant with the licence conditions.

Research the schools you are considering.,
Register for your course.,
Take the course.,
Identity verification.,
Take the final exam.,
Verify how your certificate of completion needs to be processed.,
Follow up.",How to Take Online Traffic School," You will want to verify that the particular school you choose is approved for the State and Court that is handling your citation. Some schools do not make this clear on their website, so you may want to call them to verify. You will also want to compare the total cost of the schools you are considering.

Be wary of online traffic schools that do not include the cost of certificate processing or identity verification in their advertised price, and make note of what they are actually charging you before you process your credit card payment.
Some schools offer price-matching so you can get a better deal.



 

;
, For most states, this is an easy process. The school will need to collect your personal information (name, address, phone number) as well as your driver's license information and citation information

Have this information handy when you fill out the registration form. Some schools allow you to begin the course with minimal information and without making payment, but all of this will be required from you at some point before you complete the course.
If you received your ticket in the state of Arizona you will also be required to submit a copy of your driver's license and a copy of your ticket in order to register







, Almost all online traffic school courses will allow you to take the course at your leisure, as long as you complete it before the due date given to you by the court. This means that if you are in a hurry you can get it done all at once, or you could do just a little bit each day until you are finished. Depending on where you received your ticket, you may see ""page timers"" in your course that are there to ensure that you have met the minimum time requirement for your court.

, Some courts require that your identity be verified before you take your final exam. If this is the case for your court, there are a few different identity verification options you will be offered.

These may include online identity verification questions (based on public or credit records), using a web cam to verify your identity as compared to your driver's license, taking the exam at an in-person testing center, or taking the exam in the presence of a notary.







, Most states require you to take a final exam in order to complete traffic school. The number of questions and amount of re-takes you are allowed vary by court.

, Many courts allow the traffic school to electronically send your certificate to them, but some courts require your signature on a paper certificate (meaning this has to be mailed to you by the traffic school, and then you are responsible for mailing the signed certificate to the court).

, About 2 weeks after your certificate has been sent to the court, it is recommended that you contact the court to verify that your case was dismissed. Some courts have a website that allows you to search by driver's license or citation number and then shows you the status of your case (for example, Los Angeles County and Pima County).

If your certificate was submitted to the court electronically by your traffic school, the school will likely be able to tell you if the court has dismissed your case as well.

Commit to driving the speed limit.,
Check your speedometer regularly.,
Recognize your speeding triggers.,
Take a defensive driving course.,
Keep track of speed traps.",How to Avoid a Speeding Ticket1," The simplest and most reliable way to avoid a speeding ticket is to drive within the speed limit. Driving cautiously and adhering to the law is both a sound way to avoid tickets and an exercise in public safety; speeding is recognized as a major contributing force in the quantity and severity of automobile crashes.Making the choice not to speed means being mindful and adjusting your driving habits accordingly.;
, It is difficult to accurately “feel” what speed you are going at in most modern cars; this is especially true when switching from a high speed road to a lower speed one.To get a real sense of how fast you’re going and to keep yourself from speeding, check your speedometer regularly, especially when switching between speed zones. Doing this might also improve your ability to gauge your speed over time by providing an accurate representation.

, While it might be your intention to avoid speeding, there are certain triggers on the road that may cause you to accelerate. Isolating these triggers in advance and preparing for them can help you prevent an erratic reaction when they do come about. Some potential triggers are:


being tailgatedovertaking other carskeeping up with traffic, Defensive driving means being prepared and driving safely to avoid accidents at the hand of other people’s bad driving.Defensive driving classes are available online and in person, and are often sought after by employers with employees who drive a passenger size company car for their work; when company drivers are involved in a crash, company insurance rates skyrocket, so this precaution is worthwhile.Some lessons from the courses that may help you be a more cautious driver are:


Prioritize safety when driving.
Prepare for the worst with regard to other drivers.
Be aware of your surroundings.
Cut out distractions.

, To be as cautious as possible about avoiding a speeding ticket, steer clear speed traps- areas with lower speed limits where police set up with the sole purpose of catching speeding drivers.Ask around for places others have noted as police hot-spots, and keep your eyes peeled for police cars. Look into phone apps that give warnings about nearby speed traps and cameras.

Be respectful and friendly.,
Delay paying a ticket.,
Always contest a ticket.",How to Avoid a Speeding Ticket2," If you get pulled over, present all of the identification requested of you and resist any urges to be antagonistic to the officer involved; do not give them any more reason to want to give you a ticket.Ask for as much information as possible, including where they first saw you and how long they paced you.While this scenario is a stressful one, being agreeable and friendly may get you out of a speeding ticket..


If you’re feeling bold, try asking the officer if they will consider giving you a warning instead of a ticket.

, Paying a speeding ticket right away is essentially an admission of guilt; you generally have 90 days to either enter a plea or pay the fine, so delay paying to explore your options. In many cases, fighting the ticket will not mean going to trial.Take the time to inspect your ticket for any errors in information (e.g. citation number, location of where you were stopped and the time of day you received the ticket)., In addition to being costly, speeding tickets can raise your insurance premiums for several years.Whether or not you're guilty, always contest your ticket; you have the chance of at least reducing the fine. Cases are often thrown out if the officer in question doesn't not show up to court, if they go to court at all."

",How to Reduce the Odds of Being Ticketed During a Traffic Stop," Officers have a lot to worry about when they pull someone over; you can defray a lot of these worries by taking the following steps.
, Find an area that will give the officer plenty of space to walk up to your window without being close to oncoming traffic., Do this as soon as you pull over. Turn on your overhead interior light unless it's very bright outside. This gives the officer a chance to see more clearly that there aren't any threats in the car., Don't move around, and don't reach for your license and registration. Any movement can make the officer nervous that you're reaching for a gun or trying to hide something., say ""No. I'm sorry, but I don't,"" and leave it at that. You might feel tempted to confess, but if you do, the officer can write that on the ticket and you'll have a hard time getting away from that later., This will help put the officer at ease. The officer will probably go back to the police car to run your information; wait patiently with your hands at 10 and 2 on the wheel. Don't rummage, fidget, make phone calls, etc., Don't argue. Your best chance of fighting this ticket now is for the officer to not remember you, so don't do anything that might make you stand out in his or her mind.

The type of citation you received, if you received one at all, was at the discretion of the officer.The reason you likely received the citation you did likely depended on:


Whether you were friendly to the officer (e.g., did you treat the officer with respect and dignity)
What caused the officer to pull you over (e.g., do you have a warrant out for your arrest or was your taillight not working)
How expired is your license (e.g., did it expire two days ago or two months ago);
, At the end of the traffic stop, the officer will hand you a piece of paper. This piece of paper will either be a warning or a citation. If it is a warning, you do not need to prepare for court. If you received a citation, read through it thoroughly to understand what you have to do to prepare for court.


In most states, citations will have boxes that can be checked by officers indicating whether the citation is for an infraction (i.e., violation), misdemeanor, or felony. Find this area of your citation and see what box is checked.
If you were written up with an infraction, you most likely will not need to prepare for, or attend, any court hearings. The penalty for an infraction is a small fine. For example, in California, the fine is a maximum of $250.In Delaware, the maximum fine is $100., If you were written up with a misdemeanor, you will need to prepare for court. A misdemeanor is much more severe than an infraction. One of the most important factors officers will consider when deciding whether to cite you for an infraction or a misdemeanor is your driving history. If this is your first offense, the officer will usually only cite you for an infraction. However, if you are a repeat offender, you may be written up for a misdemeanor.


If you were cited for a misdemeanor and are found guilty, you may have to take part in probation, spend time in jail, pay large fines, and/or have your car impounded., The citation you receive from the officer will contain other important information you need to know. The citation will include the officer’s information, a reference to the law you are alleged to have violated, the amount of the fine, and the date of your first court appearance. Make sure you make a note of all this information so you can use it to prepare for court.

, After you receive a citation from an officer, that officer will submit a report to the prosecutor’s office in your community. The prosecutor will review the evidence submitted and decide how to charge you. For minor legal violations such as driving with an expired license, the prosecutor will generally agree with whatever the officer did. However, because the prosecutor has the autonomy to choose how to proceed, he or she may choose to reduce your charge or even dismiss it altogether.


Once a charge has been filed by the prosecution, the court will have a record of your alleged violation.
When you arrive for your first court appearance, which is indicated on your citation, the judge will have all the information in front of him or her.

, The choice to hire a lawyer will largely depend on the citation you received and the facts surrounding your case. If you were charged with an infraction, the case can usually be handled on your own at your initial court appearance. However, if you were charged with a misdemeanor and the case seems complicated, hiring a lawyer may be the best option. Most criminal defense lawyers will take on these cases for small flat fees (usually a few hundred dollars).


To hire a lawyer, contact your state bar association’s lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions about your case, you will be put in touch with qualified lawyers in your area.
Make sure your lawyer knows about the intricacies of handling citation-based cases. These cases are usually resolved at the very first court appearance, which means your lawyer will need to be prepared.

, Whether you hire a lawyer to help or not, it is important to understand the law so you know how to defend yourself. In general, state laws make it an offense to drive a motor vehicle on a road without a valid license. One form of invalid license is one that is expired. If the prosecutor wants to prove you are guilty of this offense, he or she will need to prove (1) that you drove on a street and (2) that, at the time you drove, you did not hold a valid license.


The first element will usually not be at issue considering you were most likely pulled over by an officer while driving a car on the road.
The burden of proof in these cases is different from most criminal offenses. The prosecution does not bear the burden of proving both elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the prosecution simply has to allege that you weren’t properly licensed when you drove. After that, if you want to beat the allegation, the burden will shift and you will have to prove that you were licensed., If you did indeed drive with an expired license, the first step in preparing for court is to postpone the proceedings long enough so you have time to obtain a valid license. Most prosecutors and courts will allow you to postpone so you have enough time to do this.To ask for a postponement, you need to send a letter to the court and prosecutor asking for more time. This is generally called a “continuance request.”


When you draft a continuance request, you need to tell the court why you are asking for one. In addition, you need to tell the court whether the prosecution is okay with the postponement.

, If you can get the proceedings postponed long enough to get a new license, most courts and/or prosecutors will reduce a misdemeanor charge to an infraction. If you were charged with an infraction, a lot of courts will reduce the amount of your fine or even dismiss your case.To get a new and valid license, get a ride to your local DMV and apply for a renewal. Do not drive. Because your license has already expired, you will probably have to pay late fees when you get a new license., The best legal defense to driving with an expired license is to show that you actually did have a license when you were stopped. Remember, the burden of proof will be on you to do this.Therefore, you need to collect as much evidence as possible to help you prove your case. If you had renewed your license prior to getting pulled over, bring DMV paperwork to the court showing this. If you renewed your license in between being cited and going to court, bring your new license to court.


While it is ultimately your responsibility to know when your license expires, you may be able to argue that you had moved recently and did not get your renewal notice. If this is the case, bring documents that prove your move. Be careful, however, because it is also a fineable offense to not change your address promptly with the DMV.
You might also be able to argue that you did not have the documents required to renew your license. In some states you need to show birth certificates, Social Security cards, and even two bills that prove your current place of residence. If you do not have access to all these documents, gather evidence that proves that (e.g., bills that show that your roommate’s name)., On the day of your initial court hearing, arrive at the courthouse early. Do not drive to the courthouse if your license is still expired. Leave yourself enough time to get through security and find your courtroom. You will not be allowed to bring in any weapons, drugs, or anything else that could harm an individual.


Once you find your courtroom, sit quietly until your case is called.

, Once your case is called, move to the front of the courtroom and sit and the appropriate table. The judge will preside over the hearing and will ask you questions. Stand up when you address the judge. When you get started, tell the judge that you would like the charge dismissed. The judge will ask you why and you will need to explain yourself. You will have a pretty good argument for having the charge dismissed if you can show:


Your license was valid when you were pulled over
Your license was expired but you have a valid excuse (e.g., did not get the renewal letter or do not have the documents necessary to renew)
You were charged with an infraction and you went and renewed your license

, If the judge does not allow the charge to be dismissed, ask that the charge be reduced. This should be your alternative argument when you were charged with a misdemeanor. If you were charged with an infraction, the charge itself cannot be reduced any further. To make a convincing argument to have the charge reduced from a misdemeanor to an infraction, you will need to provide the following:


Evidence that this is your first offense and that you truly are remorseful
Evidence that you have corrected the expired license
Evidence that you do not plan on having this happen again

, If the judge will not or cannot dismiss or reduce your charge, you should alternatively seek to have your penalties reduced. If you do want to reduce your penalties at this stage of the case, you will usually have to plead either guilty or no contest. This is the case because if you plan on pleading not guilty, you would be arguing that no penalties should be imposed at all.


If you do not have any great defenses to driving with an expired license, this is the best route for you. Apologize for your actions and show the court that you have corrected the problem (i.e., you have renewed your license). If you do this, the court will likely work with you.

, These cases are usually resolved at the very first court appearance. If the charge is dismissed, make sure you get paperwork showing that. If the misdemeanor charge was reduced to an infraction, or if your penalties were reduced, you will usually be required to plead guilty or no contest in exchange for the reduction.


To plead guilty or no contest, tell the judge that you will agree to the reductions in exchange for the plea. Tell the judge that you plead guilty or no contest. The judge will then wrap up the case and tell you what your final penalty will be.

, In very rare circumstances you may choose to go to trial to resolve the charge of driving with an expired license. This is usually advised against because the cost of going to trial will far outweigh any fine that could possibly be levied against you. However, if you have the money and you are confident in your case, you may choose to plead not guilty and go to trial.


At trial you will present evidence of your innocence in the form of witness testimony and documentary evidence.
The judge will review your case and make a determination. If you win, the charge will be dropped and your case will be over. If you lose, you will have to pay the fine and/or suffer the other penalties levied against you.

, If you were charged with an infraction for driving with an expired license, you will not need to attend any court hearing so long as you pay the fine in a timely manner. In a lot of situations, the court will have the ability to reduce fines, especially if you are a first time offender. This is often the case because state statutes offer a minimum fine amount and a maximum fine amount. For example, in Delaware, the minimum fine is $25 while the maximum is $100.The officer will usually put the maximum fine amount in an attempt to solicit the most money possible.


If you call the courthouse, they will usually reduce the fine automatically without having to show any evidence or explain yourself. The fine will be reduced and you will be given a new total to pay.
While some infractions cannot or will not be reduced this way, it is always worth trying. If court administrators say they are unable to reduce the fine, you can either pay the full amount or go to court and ask to have it reduced.

, Once you have settled on a fine amount with the court, you need to pay the fine. Your citation will have detailed instructions regarding how to pay. In most cases, you will either mail in your payment and citation or pay the fine online.


If you pay through the mail, do not send cash. Send a check, which should be attached to your citation so the court knows how to process the payment. The address you send your paperwork to will be located on the citation.
If you pay online, visit the website indicated on your citation. Follow the onscreen instructions so your record can be accessed. When you are prompted to pay, you will usually have to do so using a credit or debit card. Type in the information and submit your payment.

, After your payment has been processed, make sure you get a receipt from the court. This receipt will need to be kept in case the court mistakenly thinks you haven’t paid. If you paid online, the receipt should be emailed to you or it will pop up immediately after paying.


If you paid through the mail, obtaining a receipt could be more difficult. After the money has been withdrawn from your account, call the court and ask to have a record of the payment sent to your email address. If they are unable to do this, stop by the courthouse in-person to work it out.

Car A attempts to put the front quarter of the car next to the rear quarter of Car B.,
At speeds greater than 70 mph (110 km/h), Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A.,
After Car A gives the initial tap, Car B's back-end will slide out if enough force was applied.,
Be prepared for Car B to try to drive off as soon as it has slowed enough to regain control.,
Additional aspects of the maneuver can be added to help Car A.",How to Use the Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT Maneuver) in a Car,"


It is usually performed while the two cars are almost touching each other. A starting distance which is too great can cause danger to Car A.;
, At speeds closer to 40 mph (64 km/h), Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.

,


Car A will need to straighten out, so as to not follow through too much and lose control. Car A then needs to slow down immediately to avoid broadsiding Car B.
For two comparable cars, Car A should always be able to slow down faster than Car B, due to efficiencies of braking in a straight line.

,


An experienced driver in a FWD vehicle could recover and drive off in the original direction at surprisingly fast speeds.
An experienced driver in a RWD vehicle will, once the vehicle is slowed most of the way, likely try to accelerate in the opposite direction of the initial pursuit.
AWD vehicles may be able to go either direction.

, For example, before the tap into Car B's rear quarter, easing off the throttle (or even using the brake a bit) at the same time as the turn-in, will increase front tire down-force and increase traction for a very short period of time, which can add lateral velocity into Car B.

Set the ride height of the chassis.,
Check the caster to make sure it is at the proper specification.,
Check the camber to make sure it is at the proper specification.,
Set the toe in/out of the front suspension.,
Adjust the cross weight to achieve the proper percentage of weight on the right front and left rear wheels.",How to Set Up a Race Car in the Shop Before Racing," Set it to the proper racing weight including all fluids such as fuel, coolant and oil (this weight is usually the minimum weight required by your home track).;
, Install a set of tires that will give you this setting with the proper air pressure in the tires. (Don’t overinflate or under inflate a tire to obtain proper stagger.) Set the air pressure in the tires to the pressure they will achieve at racing temperature. Notice that when the tires take on heat when racing they also tend to gain two pounds of air also. So, add two pounds to each tire once you set them to the pre race pressures.

, Pick a point between the wheels and as close to the wheels as possible. It is preferable to have the measuring point on a common surface such as a frame rail. If the ride height is not to specs, turn the weight jack bolts or shim the springs to achieve the specs. Also do the same for the rear also.

, Caster is the forward/aft (longitudinal) tilt of the steering spindle/McPherson strut. Remember a positive number means that the top of the spindle/McPherson strut leans to the rear of the vehicle. If the caster is not correct, then adjust it to the proper specification.

, Camber is the left/right (lateral) tilt of the steering spindle/McPherson strut. A positive number means that the top of the spindle/McPherson strut leans toward the outside of the vehicle. If the camber is not correct, then adjust it to the proper specification. When adjusting the upper a-arm of an a-arm type suspension, make sure to keep the front and rear a-arm pivot points equal to avoid changing the caster. In other words if the a-arm uses shims to adjust it, make sure to use or remove the same thickness of shim in the front adjust bolt that is used or removed in the rear adjust bolt. When adjusting a McPherson strut, make sure the strut upper mount moves laterally only and does not move longitudinally. After adjusting the caster and camber settings, it is a good idea to recheck them to make sure they are at the proper specs.

, This is usually done with toe plates. A basic set up has the suspension toed out 1/8th of an inch.

, The easiest way to do this without changing the ride height is to determine the percentage of cross weight that is in the vehicle now. Multiply the percentage by the total vehicle weight. This is the amount of weight on the right front and left rear wheels. Determine the percentage of cross weight desired and multiply it times the total vehicle weight. This is the amount of weight desired on the right front and left rear wheels. Subtract the cross weight desired from the current cross weight (this is the weight difference and could be a negative number), then divide by 8. This number is how much weight on each wheel needs to be changed. Subtract this number from the left front wheel weight and adjust the weight jack accordingly. Add this number to the left rear wheel weight then adjust the weight jack. Subtract this number from the right rear wheel weight and change the weight jack. Finally add this number to the right front wheel weight and adjust the weight jack. An example of how this works is here. If your tracks rules don't allow weight jacks, there are spring rubbers and metal spring spacers that will raise and lower the ride heights of the car.

, Heating the glow plugs takes up to 15 seconds. The ""wait to start"" light won't go out until the glow plugs are ready. During cold weather, the glow plugs will take longer to heat.

Check the glow plugs or intake heater before the cold weather season to ensure your truck will start during cold days. A glow plug is a device with a heating element that heats up the air in the diesel truck to start the vehicle. Another method of heating the air is to use an intake heater. In cold weather, your diesel truck won't start without the assistance of 1 of these 2 parts.






Get new batteries if necessary. Have 2 good batteries in the truck at all times. Diesel trucks have 2 batteries to start the engine and heat the glow plugs. If the batteries are in poor condition, the extra cranking of the engine to try to start it will affect the quality of the glow plugs, flood the engine and run down the batteries to the point that the engine won't start.







, If the truck doesn't start within 30 seconds, turn the key to the off position.

Race.,
If both cars break out, the car closer to their dial-in wins.",How to Shift in a Drag Race," The various strategies used in drag racing begin with the car itself. Performance enhancements must comply both with NHRA/IHRA rules and restrictions based on the class the car is running in. Some common enhancements include the use of slicks (smooth, soft tires that grip the track), methods for introducing more air into the motor such as turbochargers, superchargers, and nitrous oxide (N2O), specialized fuels (higher octane gas, methanol, etc...), improved suspensions, and a multitude of others.;
, When approaching the starting line (also known as the staging area), most racers will apply water (formerly thought to be bleach by spectators but was always water in old bleach bottles) to the driven tires either by backing into a small puddle (the ""bleach box"" or ""water box"") or having it sprayed on. The car then exits the water and does a burnout to heat the tires, making them even stickier. Some cars have a mandatory ""line-lock"" which prevents the rear brakes from engaging when the brake pedal is depressed (which can be toggled on and off). This allows the car to remain stationary (with the brakes applied) without burning up the rear brake pads while doing a burnout. Cars in street classes (which must be street legal) are the only exception to this pre-race ritual, as the grooved tires tend to retain some of the water.

,


After the burn-out comes the ""staging phase"", where the cars pull up to the starting line. Each lane has its own string of lights on the ""Christmas tree"", with two small yellow lights on top. These are the ""pre-staged"" and ""staged"" lights. The two cars will slowly creep forward until the first (pre-staged) orange light is lit. This means they are very close to the actual starting line (a mere 7 inches). Then the cars will nudge forward until the second (staged) light is lit. This indicates they are at the starting line, this is the point where the driver will apply the ""line-lock"" to prevent the car from rolling while he uses the clutch and gas pedals. When both cars have lit both bulbs, the starter will engage the Christmas tree. If the racer moves too far the top bulb will go out and the driver is said to have ""deep staged"". While some drivers prefer this technique, some tracks and classes prohibit it. An advantage can be had, by deep staging, in gaining a quicker reaction time (RT) but at the expense of the elapsed time (ET) and MPH achieved at the top end of the track; there is also a higher risk of ""red lighting"". A loose etiquette is followed when staging. The driver to illuminate the first light will wait for the second car to light both bulbs before advancing to the staged light.

,


Once the competitors have both staged, the starter presses a button to start the race. There are two types of tree used. A sportsman tree, used for bracket and handicap racing, consists of each amber lighting 0.5 seconds after the one above it. The green comes on 0.5 seconds after the last amber is lit. If the race is a handicap race each side of the tree will have its own timing. A pro tree consists of all three ambers being illuminated at the same time, but there is a random delay of 0.8 to 1.3 seconds between the second staging light and simultaneous ambers, which are followed by the green 0.4 seconds later. This type of tree is used for professional and heads-up racing. It should be noted that some tracks run a Pro-style tree for bracket racing during special ""Street Racing"" bracket events.

,


Several things are important on the way down the track in drag racing. The first is not to cross into the opponent's lane, as this will result in disqualification. In case of a double disqualification in which one driver commits a foul start and the second driver crosses into his opponent's lane, the driver who committed the foul start wins. Another important consideration is when to shift gears. Most drag cars are shifted manually by the driver, and there are optimum times for shifting that vary with each car. Typically, power will increase as the engine RPMs (revolutions per minute) increase, but only up to a point before power begins to taper off. The ideal time to shift is when the descending power curve for the lower gear crosses the ascending power curve for the higher gear. Most drag racers use a tachometer to judge shift points. In Fuel classes especially, ""pedalling"" the car (adjusting the throttle) to prevent loss of traction is often important and one measure of how good a driver is.
Strategies for crossing the finish line usually only involve bracket racing (see above). If one car has a huge lead, it may slow down before crossing the finish line to prevent a breakout. Especially in bracket racing, it is not uncommon to see the leading vehicle's brake lights come on briefly before the finish line. The term ""sandbagging"" is used in races where the driver in a bracket race puts a slower ""dial in"" (the predicted E.T.) that he/she could run and then at the finish line tap the brakes lightly or lift of the gas pedal (also known as pedalling) to reduce the E.T. to run as close as possible to the dial in.

, In N.H.R.A Junior Dragster racing, however, there is a minimum elapsed time where a car which posts a time less than the minimum permissible time is ejected from the entire race. This is faster than the official break out elapsed time

Check your mirrors before parking.,
Give yourself plenty of space.,
Park slowly and brake early.,
Pull in to wide open spots.,
Avoid overshooting or undercutting your turn.,
Straighten your vehicle with a three-point turn.,
Pull into your spot evenly out of your three-point turn.",How to Park a Truck or Large Vehicle1," Poorly adjusted mirrors could result in you losing perspective while parking. This can hurt your ability to gauge the distance between your vehicles and obstructions. You’ll want as clear and complete a view of the area around your vehicle as possible.


Even if you are more confident in your parking skills, you should always double check your blind spots to ensure you don’t back into kids, pedestrians, or moving objects, like strollers and shopping carts.
Larger vehicles may have additional mirror mounted to the body of the vehicle to improve visibility. These additional mirrors can be easily forgotten by casual large vehicle drivers. Check these regularly when parking.;
, The more space you have to pull into your spot, the more space you’ll have to maneuver and make adjustments while parking. You might give yourself more space by parking in an empty part of a parking lot, or you could also choose a spot that is surrounded by smaller, more compact vehicles.


Smaller vehicles on either side of your large truck will take up less space in their own parking spot, giving you more leeway as you park., The increased weight of a large vehicle will require you to brake sooner than you would for a normal car, especially if you have a heavy load you are transporting. Taking your time when parking your large vehicle can prevent costly errors, like damaging cars around you or hitting a parking barrier., This is perhaps the safest route if you are less confidant in your large vehicle parking ability. Choose a location of the parking area that is free of other cars. Cut your wheel in the direction you are turning to move into the spot.


You may notice your front end swinging over the parking spot lines into the spot beside you. This is due to the fact that larger vehicles require a wider turning radius to complete turns. You may need to adjust your vehicle in your space after pulling in. Put your vehicle in reverse, check your mirrors and blind spots, then back up.
When you pull back into your spot after backing out, adjust your wheel to straighten out your vehicle as you pull into the spot again.

, The length of your large vehicle will require more space spent turning for you to straighten it out and pull it evenly into its spot. Turning as you would normally in a regular car can lead to over or underturning, potentially into other vehicles. To prevent this you should:Maneuver your vehicle as far away from the parking spot as you are able. The more space you have to approach, the easier it will be for you to straighten your back end and pull into the spot.
Cut your wheel hard in the direction of the spot you are parking. You’ll want the front end of your truck to enter the spot as straight as possible.
Check your mirrors constantly while pulling into your spot. The side of your vehicle may still be straightening, and you’ll need to keep a careful eye to ensure you do not bump or scratch other vehicles., The more aligned your back end is with the spot you are aiming to park in, the less turning you will have to do and the easier your parking job will be. A three-point turn is where you turn in one direction as far as you are able, put your vehicle in reverse to straighten your front end, and then finish your turn by continuing it.You can use this while parking by:


Pulling your front end close to one of the vehicles next to the spot in which you are parking.
Putting your vehicle in reverse and straightening it to line up with your spot as much as possible. Be sure to check your mirrors and blind spots so you don’t hit any pedestrians or cars parked behind you.

, Now that your car is more lined up with the spot, it’s likely you’ll only have to make slight adjustments to your course as you pull into it. Executing this move in tight spaces is a valuable skill when driving a large vehicle, so you may want to practice how to make a three-point turn.

Identify your backing up maneuver.,
Understand the mechanics of backing up.,
Pull ahead of your spot.,
Check your mirrors and do a walk-around.,
Swing out wide with your cab.,
Straighten out your cab.",How to Park a Truck or Large Vehicle2," There are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving: straight back, offset back, alley dock, and parallel parking. Each of these can be identified by the following characteristics:



Straight back spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular (L-shaped) angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area.

Offset back spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid. These meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle.

Alley dock spaces are almost always for semi-trucks. These require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading/unloading dock, which is usually at a right angle (L-shape) to the passage.

Parallel parking spaces are on the side of the road, with either traffic, obstacles, or empty spaces before or after the spot. These require you to back your vehicle in, and can be especially challenging. New drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible., This is going to be slightly different for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer versus large, normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab. While large, attached-bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving, these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn. Semi-trucks/vehicles with trailers will turn backwards opposite the direction you turn your wheel.Getting the hang of backing up a semi-truck/vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice. You should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning.
If you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space, you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles, like a cheap folding chair, in an empty parking area. This way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer/rear end around obstacles.

, You'll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn't cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near-side spot, or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far-side spot. The more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear-end before approaching the parked vehicles. This extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident.


Roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle. You want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors. Do this especially it it's raining, as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view.
Ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle. Even well-behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up. A clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others.

, Your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in. However, mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features, like thin metal signs, posts, and so on. Take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle. Then:


Compare your walk-around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view. Note any inconsistencies, difficult to see obstacles, or missed obstacles.
Evaluate the size of the parking spot. If you feel that the spot might not be a good fit, or if you are nervous in your ability to park, you are probably better off finding another parking spot.
Adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle. Now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking, you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into. Your mirrors will normally be situated for straight-traffic driving, so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely., For attached-bed trucks as well, but especially for semi-trucks/vehicles with a trailer, you should swing your front-end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel in the direction of the parking spot. This will allow the rear-end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in. Once your rear-end is angled diagonally into the spot, straighten it by turning your wheel ¼ turn or less in the direction away from the spot.


The more space between you and the already parked vehicles/obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park, the more time you'll have to align your rear end with the parking spot. This will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear-end into the spot.
Outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot, which began the hard turn of your rear-end toward the spot, you should only make slight adjustments while backing up. Large adjustments will likely result in over- or under-steering. If you feel your angle of approach too far off, you should pull out and start again.
You should keep a close eye on the front- and rear-end of your vehicle during these maneuvers. While swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear-end into the spot, it's easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into., Once your rear end is aligned with the spot, your cab will likely still be at an angle to it. Allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot, then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut - in the direction of the spot. This should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear-end. Use gentle steering corrections at this point; oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer/rear-end changing significantly.


Some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt. Even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot.
Adjust your vehicle as necessary. You may need to pull out of your spot, straighten your vehicle one more time, and reverse back into it, nice and even. When pulling out, be careful your rear-end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles."

Make use of designated large vehicle parking.,
Know the legal expectations for large vehicles.,
Signal emergency stops soon after occurring.,
Make a physical check of potential parking spots.,
Use your parking break always.",How to Park a Truck or Large Vehicle3," Many main route establishments, especially rest stops and designated “trucker” stops, will have special parking spaces intended specifically for large vehicles, like semis and moving trucks. Be on the lookout for places such as these, as this kind of parking will make your job much easier. Some semi-trucks can need as much as four times the space used by a normal sized car.You might want to plan your route well in advance so that you know where you can park easily while on your trip. A few popular sites that give comprehensive resources on roadway information are:

, Due to the fact that your large vehicle can block the view of smaller ones and sometimes create a dangerous blind spot on the road, there are laws in place to prevent this from happening. These laws will vary between state and country, but generally you should never:


Park on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph (48 kph) unless your vehicle is disabled.
Park in a way that blocks the view of the road from driveways and other streets.
Park with your vehicle facing opposite the direction of traffic., When you are forced to stop on the side of a road due to mechanical issues or some other problem, you must place emergency warning devices no later than ten minutes after coming to a stop. Different kinds of roads will require different placement of your warning devices, such as:


On or near a one-direction street or a divided highway, you will need to place your warning devices at 10, 100, and 200 feet (3, 30.5, and 61 m) behind your vehicle.
On a two-lane road with traffic that moves in either direction, or on an undivided highway, you should place warning devices 10 feet (3 m) in front of and behind the front and rear corners of your vehicle and 100 feet (30.5 m) ahead of and behind your vehicle.
On bends, curves, and hills that obstruct the view of your warning devices, you’ll need to place your rearmost device so it can be clearly seen before the sight obstruction., Smaller parking lots and residential areas are built with smaller vehicles in mind. The best way you can gauge the space of these places is by stepping out of your vehicle and getting a clear look of your surroundings.If possible, you should make use of a spotter, who can direct you as you move into the spot safely., Larger vehicles are much heavier than your average sedan. If your vehicle were to experience a critical brake failure, its weight would make it even more dangerous to others if it started to roll. You can easily prevent this from happening by always using your parking break as an extra safety measure."

Pay off your old loan.",How to Refinance an Auto Loan," Before doing anything else, check your current auto loan agreement for any language about prepayment penalties. This is rare in auto loans, but if yours has these penalties, you will have to pay them during your refinance. If you can't locate the relevant language in your agreement, contact your current lender and ask them for assistance., The primary reason most people refinance is to lower their monthly auto loan payment. This can be done in two ways. For one, if you applied for a car loan during a time where interest rates were high or when you had lower credit than you do now, you can refinance and get the same loan duration with a lower monthly payment (because of your now lower interest rate). Alternately, you can refinance for a longer duration if you've fallen on hard times. This reduces your monthly payment by spreading out your payments over a longer time period., Refinancing also gives you a completely fresh loan contract. This comes with the opportunity to add or remove a cosigner on the loan. For example, a young person could remove the cosigner who helped them get the loan in the first place now that they've built up their own credit. Alternately, you could add a cosigner with good credit to your loan to secure yourself a better interest rate., Before applying for a refinance, check your credit score to see where you stand. If you're refinancing because you think your credit score has improved since you got the original loan, check and make sure that this is the case. Otherwise, you may find it difficult to get a better rate.You can check your credit score for free by visiting a website like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame.

, In addition to poor credit, several other roadblocks may stand in the way of your refinancing your loan. In general, borrowers will have a hard time getting a refinanced loan for cars that are over a few years old, especially if the car has over 100,000 miles on it. Additionally, it will be very hard to get a refinance if you are ""underwater"" on your loan (if you owe more than the car is worth).These criteria vary by lender. For example, one lender may only accept cars less than 7 years old and those between $7,500 and $40,000 in value.If you owe more on the car than you make in a year, a lender might not offer you a very attractive interest rate.

, Think about your refinancing goals. Do you want to lower your payments by seeking a lower interest rate or by stretching out your loan? Alternately, you can reduce your total interest paid by refinancing to a shorter loan duration and lower interest rate, keeping your monthly payment close to the same but paying less in interest. Define your ideal refinanced loan and then work from there to identify lenders.


Even a small reduction in interest rate, like 1 or even 0.5 percent, can mean big savings over the life of the loan.
For example, a borrower with a 5-year, $25,000 loan at 7.75 percent could save $450 over the life of the loan by refinancing to 6.75 percent after the first year.
You will also need to know the payoff amount you need. Contact your current lender and ask for the payoff amount on your loan. This will be the principal on your new, refinanced loan., Check with your current lender to see if they will refinance the loan for you in-house. If you're looking to switch lenders, start with your local credit unions and banks. Credit unions often offer the best interest rates and are willing to give out auto loans. However, you'll have to open a checking or savings account with the credit union to take out a loan., Check online with an aggregator like Bankrate to see what different lenders in your area and online are offering. Look for the most competitive stated rates and then apply to a few of them to see what you are quoted. Remember to also look at the loan terms for penalties, fees, or otherwise unexpected payment items. , Don't apply to dozens of lenders for refinance quotes. This can have a negative impact on the credit score you've worked so hard to build up. Instead, check for low offered rates and apply to those to see what quotes you get., Don't just accept the first deal that comes along. Wait to hear back from a number of lenders. Even if you have found a great deal locally or with a trusted bank, consider applying to at least one more lender just to make sure you aren't missing out on a great rate.Be ready to give lenders proof of military connections or any other memberships. Doing so might result in a better deal for you.

, Refinance auto loans can typically be applied for online. Visit the website for your chosen lender and apply for an auto loan if you didn't have to apply to get a quote. You'll likely be approved quickly; many lenders approved qualified borrowers in between 15 minutes and an hour. From here, the lender will provide you with a loan agreement and instructions on how to pay off your current loan. Follow their instructions.When you apply, you'll usually need pertinent information like:


The year, make, and model of your car.
The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
Proof of insurance.
The payoff and remaining duration of your current loan., Some lenders give you the opportunity to pay your loan automatically out of your checking account or with your credit card. These lenders often offer incentives for choosing this option, such as a lower interest rate. This choice is made during the application process for the loan.If you choose this option, remember to keep enough money in the drafted account so that you aren't charged overdraft fees.

, Call your previous lender and let them know that you have refinanced. Give them the name and address for your new lender so that they can send over the title for the car., Transferring the title in this way may result in some state fees being charged. You are typically responsible for these fees. These are usually a lien transfer fee, which is usually $5 to $10, and a state re-registration fee, which can be anywhere from $5 to $75., Follow through with your new lender's instructions to pay off your old auto loan. You've now successfully refinanced your auto loan."
"
Pre-qualify.,
Go find the perfect boat!,
Take down full details.,
Factor in the accessories.,
Go home and do your research.,
Learn to read the model numbers, as they can be a little confusing.,
Find out as much about the model number as you can because the factory options, such as the tunnel, can make or break the deal (the T, for instance, can add an extra $1000.00 to the value of a boat).

,
Take care in checking.,
Also take care when you check to see that your boat has a fire extinguisher.,
Make sure you get all the accessories on your boat checked correctly.,
Take all three values, add them up, and see if the asking price is even close.,
Get a hold of the seller and make him or her an offer (your offer should be something around loan value + what you can afford).,
Visit the bank.,
Close the deal as soon as you can.",How to Get a Boat Loan," Go to the bank and tell them that you are looking at buying a boat that you will need a loan for. Tell them you wish to know 2 things: A. How much they are willing to lend you (how much can you afford). B. How much of a boat's value they are willing to lend. In most cases they will not lend the entire value. Don't forget that value and asking price can be two very different numbers.;
, New boats, like cars lose a considerable amount of value when you leave the showroom floor so consider the good used market. A lot of people buy boats and then never use them, or can't afford them.

, Once you find the perfect boat or a couple of perfect boats, locate and write down every identifying number you can find. If it is an outboard, do the same for the engine. If the boat comes with a trailer, get all the info from the trailer as well. Make note of how long the trailer is (usually the same length as the boat), if it is galvanized or painted (big value difference especially in saltwater), and if it has a spare tire/carrier, fenders, steps, winch, etc. If you're really interested in buying the boat, arrange to have a professional boat surveyor appraise her. There will be a fee for this, but it is always money well spent as the surveyor knows what possible problems to look for and advise you accordingly.

, When you or the bank tries to determine the value of a given boat, accessories are the most important aspect. Not just factory accessories either. Add-ons like downriggers, live wells, tow bars etc, add considerably to the base value. Make note of every accessory on the boat, even the seemingly trivial ones. If you do not list all the accessories, the bank will probably come up with a value that is considerably less than the boat is worth, or the asking price.

, Go to NADA.COM and look up your boat by year and model number. If a given year does not list your model number, try the next model year. A boat manufactured in 2003 may actually be a 2004 model. Typically, if a boat was manufactured after June of a given year it is probably the next year's model.

, For example, take a boat with the model number of 1752VST.


The 1752 means it is 17 feet (5.2 m) long, 52 inches (132.1 cm) wide.
The V indicates that it is a V hull.
The T indicates that it has a tunnel.

,, When getting the value form the NADA website, be careful checking options; some are quite deceiving. The options are broken into two categories:


Powerboats (have the engine built in); and
Just boats (typically with an outboard).

, If you check that option in the powerboat category, it will add $1500.00 to the value, and you just know that isn't right. What they really mean is that it has a built-in extinguisher, which most outboards do not have.

, If your boat is an outboard you will need to run the value of the motor separately. You will also need to run the trailer value separately. Again, check all the accessories that are included. Simple finders up the value by $300.00.

, If it is, then you know how much the bank will lend on that boat.

, If the seller is close to the value with the asking price, don't waste his or her time giving a low ball offer. Chances are the owner went through the process of valuing the boat before setting the price. If it is a newer boat, perhaps the seller owes more than the value, in which case he or she probably has no room to bargain. Move on to another boat if you can not afford (or don't want to) make up the difference. Keep in mind that you don't want to be in the same shoes as that seller by owning a boat that is worth much less than you owe. Boats do not depreciate as quickly as automobiles but they do depreciate rapidly in the first few years.

, When you and the seller have arrived at a deal, gather up your values and go to your banker. Make sure you talk to a human. They are going to go through the value process just like you did and you need to make sure they come up with the same numbers as you or you are going to need to beg for more money from somebody else and spouses who aren't convinced can be difficult sources of cash flow!

, In most markets, a boat that is priced anywhere near its value does not stay on the market very long. If you find your dream boat and arrive at an equitable deal, jump on it before somebody else buys it.

Sell your car.",How to Assume a Car Loan," Not all lenders will let someone assume a car loan. For this reason, the person with the car loan should call up the lender and ask., The person trying to assume the loan should check their credit. Your credit score will largely determine whether you can assume the loan and at what interest rate.You can get you credit score in the following ways:Look on your credit card statement. Many credit card issuers provide free credit scores. Also look at your online account.
Use a free online service, such as Credit.com. Some online companies charge, so make sure to use only a free service.
Buy your FICO score from myfico.com.
Meet with a credit or housing counselor. They should be able to get your credit score for free.

, The person looking to assume the loan should fill out an application with the lender.The application will ask for financial information, because the lender must be confident you can pay back the loan.

, Your credit might not be strong enough for the lender to approve you to assume the loan. In that case, you might need someone to cosign for you. This means they will be responsible for the loan if you stop paying.


Of course, if you have a cosigner available, then you might not need to assume a loan. Instead, you can go get your own car loan directly., The approval time will vary. You might be approved immediately, or you might need to wait a couple weeks for a decision.If you haven’t heard anything after a couple weeks, contact the lender to check.

, Make sure you understand everything fully before signing the agreement. Pay particular attention to your monthly payment amount and the due date. Your first payment might be due very soon.Ask about anything you don’t understand and meet with a lawyer, if necessary.
You can obtain a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association: https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx.

, The buyer will sign their contract. The seller will need to sign paperwork to transfer the title and the bank’s lien to the new owner. The lien will stay on the car until the car loan is paid off entirely., You can’t take possession of the car until you get insurance. Contact an insurance agent to find a policy and remember to provide the bank with proof of your insurance.Try to get at least three quotes so that you know you’re getting a competitive rate.


If you’re the former owner of the car, then cancel your insurance policy.There’s no reason to keep making payments.

, Car registration requirements differ somewhat depending on the state. Contact your state’s DMV to find out the process for transferring title and registering the car.You will also have to pay applicable taxes and fees at the time of registration.

, Make timely payments each month, otherwise your car might be repossessed. If you run into financial trouble, call the lender and ask if they can help you., Many lenders are happy to let borrowers miss a payment and add it to the end of the loan. You’ll pay more in interest, but a short break might allow you to catch up on your loan.Find your lender’s contact information on your monthly statement.
Have a reason why you can’t make the payment. For example, you might have had a medical emergency that used up your extra money that month.

, You probably can’t refinance your loan unless you have excellent credit, and you probably don’t if you’ve missed payments before. However, you might benefit from a balance transfer. For example, you can move the balance of your loan to a credit card.This is a good option if you can pay off the loan before the promotional period ends on your balance transfer credit card. Most promotional periods last 12 months or less, after which the interest rate jumps.
Also, you might hurt your credit score by moving an installment loan (like car payments) to a credit card. Nevertheless, using a balance transfer might allow you to keep your car.

, A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is like a credit card. You’re given a line of credit, and you make monthly payments while being charged interest on the balance. You might be able to move the balance of your car loan to a HELOC. This way, you can keep your car.


One huge pitfall is that you put your home at risk if you can’t make payments.However, this might be less of a concern if you don’t owe much money.
Your HELOC’s interest rate is also variable, so you might pay more in interest than you would on the car loan. You should talk to a lender to see if HELOC interest rates would benefit you.

, Buying a new car might be the last thing you want to do. However, it can benefit you if you trade in for a much cheaper car. Try to get the dealership to give you trade-in credit equal to the amount you have left on your loan. For example, if you owe $5,000 on the car, try to get the dealer to give you $5,000 in trade-in credit.


Also check the loan terms for your new car. Ideally, you’ll have a much lower monthly payment that you can afford., If all else fails, you can still sell your car. You’ll need the lender’s permission to sell since they have a lien on the car, which can limit the pool of people willing to buy it. However, if you find a buyer, you can hold the sale at the bank where you have a loan. You’ll pay off the remainder of your loan, and the bank can transfer the title at the same time."

Talk with your dealer.,
Find the right lender.,
Inform your lender if you have a co-signer.,
Demonstrate your payments on a previous motorcycle.,
Make a larger down payment.",How to Get a Motorcycle Loan With Bad Credit1," Not all dealers are as accommodating to low or poor credit scores. You will need to find a dealer that is willing to work with your credit to get you the loan that you want. Some dealers specialize in this and have unique relationships with lenders that are ready to work with you.You will need to speak with the dealer's finance team or department directly to learn if they can help you.
Inform them clearly of your situation. You won't get an accurate picture of how likely you are to be financed if you don't convey your exact credit situation to your dealers finance team.
You may not need to submit an application for financing to learn if you will get the loan or not. A capable finance manager should be able to tell you how likely you are to receive the loan when you do actually apply.;
, It may be tempting to apply wherever you can in an attempt to successfully get your application accepted. However, applying to many lenders at once can actually hurt your credit score further. You should also know that not all lenders are ideal for a motorcycle loan.Apply only to lenders that specialize in personal loansor in motorcycle loans.
Look for key terms such as bad credit, poor credit, no credit, motorcycle financing, or after bankruptcy loans. Remember, though, that bankruptcy will typically not be a factor if it has been discharged for two or more years.
Loans made to people with bad credit may have higher interest rates. Be fully aware of the conditions of your loan before accepting., A co-signer to a loan is another person that promises to take on payments if you are unable. If your co-signer has a better credit score than you, this can help you to obtain the loan you are seeking.Your co-signer should have excellent credit.
Having a co-signer helps assure your lender that they are more likely to receive their payments.

, If you have made payments on another motorcycle, you can demonstrate your consistency on those payments. Despite your low credit score, by showing your previous motorcycle payments were always met on time, you increase the likelihood that you will receive the loan., Try to save up as much money as you can, without a loan, for a down payment. By placing a larger amount of money down on your motorcycle upfront, you show that you are serious about this investment. Lenders will view larger down payments in your favor.By paying off a majority of the cost, you will also save money on interest when you do take out a loan.

"
"
Meet the basic requirements.,
Communicate with your lender.,
Take actions to protect your lender.",How to Get a Motorcycle Loan With Bad Credit2," Regardless of how good or bad your current credit score is, you will need to meet some basic requirements first. The requirements help the lender to gauge your capability to repay the loan.Must have valid forms of identification, such as a driver or motorcycle license, and a social security number.
Must be at least eighteen years old.
You should be earning enough discretionary income to pay the payments. Demonstrating you earn enough to cover the monthly payment will increase your chances of getting the loan.
Have held stable employment for at least six months. Having a stable source of income will show that your payments are more likely to be on time and the proper amount.
If you are self-employed, you may need to be able to prove that you have worked in your industry for at least two years, and provide a profit and loss statement or a gross earnings statement for the past year.

, It may seem like having a bad credit score leaves most of the application process up to luck, but a little communication goes a long way. Discuss some of the following points with your lender:If you had a one time reason for your poor credit, such as a medical emergency, explain this and assure your lender that this expense was unavoidable and is in the past.
Prove your level of income. Showing exactly how much you earn isn't always required, however, doing so will show that you are serious and capable of paying your loan. Bring in the last two years tax returns or your last six pay stubs to share.
Let them know how stable you are. If you have lived and worked in the same place for a period of a few years, let your lender know this. Stability indicates that you are more likely to fully pay back the loan on time.
Explain any filing for bankruptcy. If you did file for bankruptcy you should explain why, especially if it was due to a major life event such as a medical bill.

, Showing that you are willing to work to protect your lender's investment will go a long way in their consideration of your application. Demonstrate that you are willing to work with them by informing them of the following actions you should take:Allow them to automatically take payments from your account. This shows that you are confident that the funds will be there as well as assuring them that you will not miss a payment.
Inform them that you will be purchasing full coverage insurance, extended warranty, and a GAP policy.
Full coverage insurance and GAP policies will help protect the value of your motorcycle in case of an accident or theft.
Having an extended warranty will help protect the value of the motorcycle by replacing and repairing parts covered by that warranty, should they fail.

Check for errors.,
Try negotiating.,
Use your credit cards effectively.",How to Get a Motorcycle Loan With Bad Credit3," The people that work to calculate your credit score can make mistakes. These mistakes may cause your score to appear much lower than it actually is. Check your credit score and dispute any errors that you may suspect.There are a few online services that let you dispute any errors you may have found such as Experian, Trans Union, or Equifax. If you find disputes with one, check all three to make sure they are fully addressed.

Fixing errors in your credit score will increase the score and give you an accurate picture of where your credit is currently.

, Despite having missed a few payments, or made a few late payments, you may still be able to negotiate with your creditors to have these events changed in order to improve your credit score. Try asking about the following when negotiating your delinquent or late payments:Ask your creditors if you can pay off the full amount on a delinquent loan in order to have it labeled “paid as agreed” instead of a missed payment.
If you have only one or two missed payments on an otherwise great payment schedule, write a letter to your creditor that highlights your overall positive payments. They may remove the late payments affecting your score negatively.

, Credit card use is a great way to positively increase your credit score, so long as you use them properly. Try taking the following steps to increase your credit score by best managing your credit cards.If you do not have a credit card, obtain one and start using it. Sometimes you can get a prepaid credit card if you do not qualify for a regular credit card. These will often charge higher interest rates along with additional fees.
Keep the amount charged on your credit card low. Having charges that are maxed out, or close to it, will hurt your credit score.
Don't overuse your credit card. Using 30% of your card's maximum limit a month is acceptable, so take the card limit and divide it by three to get the amount you can spend per month. Try to pay off that balance in full every month. Using your card too much in a month, even if you pay it off, will only give the impression that you are a reckless spender.
Increase your limit. If you do use your card often, increase the maximum limit. You must be careful to not also increase your spending amount. Strive for ten to thirty percent of your card's limit a month.
Don't close any cards. Closing a card will look bad to any credit scoring system. Instead, keep your card working for you by using it to pay for a small monthly bill which is easily repaid.

Wearing the proper safety gear.
Maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.
Keeping within the posted speed limits and following the flow of traffic.
Regularly checking your motorcycle for possible safety issues. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation has a checklist for this purpose called T-CLOCS. T-CLOCS stands for: T - Tires, wheels. C - Controls (levers and pedal, cables, hoses, throttle). L - Lights (battery, headlamp, brake lamp, turn signals, mirrors, etc.). O - Oil (fluid levels and leaks). C - Chassis (frame, suspension, chain or belt, fasteners). S - Stands (center stand and side stand)Download a pdf copy of the checklist here.
;
, Familiarize yourself with your motorcycle’s components and how it will perform on streets and highways. Typical motorcycle components and controls include:









Right side handlebar accelerator control
Right side handlebar brake control
Left side handlebar clutch
Foot-pedal gear shifter
Speed and fuel gauges

, For United States residents, this can be obtained at your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office or through its official website. Familiarize yourself with all the laws, requirements, and motorcycle rider’s rights specific to the state or jurisdiction you reside. This may include the following:









Special insurance conditions for motorcyclists.
Rules pertaining to passengers.
Speed limits and restrictions.
Whether or not your state allows motorcycles to use express lanes.
Restrictions for noise, including requirements for certain mufflers and baffles.

, Most countries and jurisdictions require that you obtain a motorcycle permit. Once you have done all the required reading you should be ready to attempt the written test. If successful, you will receive a temporary motorcycle license or learner's permit. You are now ready to learn how to ride. 







, Before you get too excited and turn your bike on, make sure that you have someone knowledgeable present. Hiring a professional or attending training class can be helpful at this point.








, The first time throwing a leg over your bike may feel awkward. Try following these steps:









Balance yourself by leaning carefully against the tank and placing both hands on the hand grips.
If starting from the left side, place all of your weight onto your left leg. Never mount from the opposite side of the kickstand. If your bike has a center stand, mount from whichever side is most comfortable.
Lift your right leg high up and over the bike. Lifting your leg high will ensure your leg does not get caught before reaching the other side of the bike. Never mount from behind. , Now that you have mounted your bike, take the time to familiarize yourself with the weight and feel of it. Make any needed mirror adjustments and get acquainted with your individual bike’s foot pegs, turn signals, horn, and lights.








, Whether you decide on a professional or an experienced friend, they should be able to walk you through these basic skills: how to start, accelerate, decelerate, shift, brake, stop, park, and start again. Successfully learning these skills requires that you know how the controls of your bike function.








, Your right foot controls the rear brake.









Twisting the right hand grip towards your body will apply throttle (gas/acceleration). Be gentle with the throttle. An excessive rev can be dangerous and lead to an unintentional wheelie.
Pulling the right hand lever will apply the front brakes. Like the throttle, gentleness is key. The two-fingered technique will work for most bikes while some will require the use of your entire hand.
The rear brake is mostly useful for situations with reduced traction or when operating at a low speed. Bikes that carry more weight over the rear wheel, such as cruisers, may find breaking with the rear more effective. , Like the right hand lever, the two-fingered technique will work for some bikes while others will need the entire hand.









The clutch controls the connection between the engine and transmission. Squeezing the clutch lever disengages the clutch and disconnects the engine from the transmission. Releasing will engage the clutch and connect them. When disengaging the clutch you effectively place the bike in neutral regardless of whether it is in gear or not. Engaging the clutch will place the bike into whichever gear is currently selected.
Just as you would with the brake and throttle the clutch lever should be squeezed and released as smoothly as possible.,









Most motorcycles will follow the “1 down, 5 up” shift pattern: 6th gear (if applicable), 5th gear, 4th gear, 3rd gear, 2nd gear, NEUTRAL, 1st gear.
It will take time to get used to so practice finding neutral with your left foot. Look for the green ""N"" to show on the gauges as you move the Lever up or down.
You must shift gears in this order: Disengage clutch (using left hand). Shift gears (using left foot). Engage clutch.
Gradually applying the throttle while engaging the clutch will make shifting gears smoother., Follow these steps to turn your motorcycle on.









First, flip the kill switch to the ""on"" position (your kill switch will likely be a red rocker switch near the right hand grip).
Next, turn your key to the ""ignition"" position. At this point most bikes will perform a self-check.
Make sure that the bike is in neutral. The green ""N"" should be lit on your gauges.
Disengage the clutch. Some bikes will require this to start the engine.
Push the start button (this will likely be marked with a logo of a circular arrow surrounding a lightning bolt and be located to the bottom of the kill switch). If everything is in working order, your engine should begin to run. Some bikes may need a gentle application of throttle to get the engine going.
Be patient as the engine warms up. Once the engine turns over, it may take 45 seconds to several minutes until your bike is ready to go. Unlike a car, ensuring the engine of your bike is properly warmed up is a crucial step for safe riding. , Forgetting to do so can be dangerous. Centerstands require a forward rocking motion to retract. Once your kickstand or centerstand is up you’ll find yourself on your toes and ready to ride.








, Just as before, make sure to have an experienced rider nearby to supervise you.








, Remember, to do this you must:









Squeeze the clutch lever to disengage the clutch.
Move the shifter down to first gear using your foot.
Release the clutch slowly.
Twist the throttle to keep the engine from stalling.
You will feel your bike begin to move forward. Put both feet up onto the foot pegs once you have gained momentum. Congratulations! You are now riding a motorcycle! Before you ride off into the sunset you may want to test the brakes first.

,









While moving at a speed roughly above 10 mph (16 km/h), push the hand grip on the side you wish to turn towards. If you wish to turn right, lean slightly to the right while pushing the right handgrip away from your body.

, Once you have built confidence at lower speeds, you may wish to practice shifting into the higher gears. As with everything else, the idea is to be as smooth as possible, whether it is your clutch, throttle or brake. Achieving this fluidity will take practice and muscle memory.








, Recall all of the laws and proper practices for safe riding you learned in order to receive your permit.

The tank will lurch forward and will require about six to ten feet to stop. Once in motion it will drive something like a car., The drivers hatch cover slides to your right to open. Continue pushing the hatch until it locks in place. The hatch will slide back in a left tilt or a right turn if not locked in place.,

You will notice a big difference between turns in the two gears.– The turning radius is about four times smaller in first gear than it is in second gear.
Lurching and stop and go moves are somewhat normal and doesn't mean you're a bad driver.

First of all change your engine oil or gear oil frequently as it lubricates your gears and engines, and also keeps your engine cool.,
Next is the spark plugs; it is the item which causes a spark which in turn will ignite the petrol.,
The chain which rotates the rear tire should be kept lubricated.,
Also washing the bike is part of maintaining.,
Checking the tire treads every once a week is a good habit.",How to Maintain a Motorbike," Not changing the engine oil will cause further damage to the engine Which can't be noticed early. The owner's manual will specify how frequently the oil should be changed and this schedule should be followed.






;
, This should be changed as specified in the owner's manual (or if a problem is suspected). It is critically important to use the correct spark plug grade and type. If the manual suggests an iridium plug then these can be worth the extra cost, lasting 10,000 miles (16,000 km) or more. Considering that it can take several hours to access the spark plugs on many modern bikes this is money well spent.








, If it's kept lubricated, it should last for a very long time (30,000 miles (48,000 km) is not unusual). If it's not lubricated, it would be damaged due to excess heat and will wear. This cumulative wear on all the separate links makes the chain loose, and more likely to fall off the sprockets. This can be very dangerous indeed. The chain tightening procedure should be detailed in the owner's manual, but bear in mind that too tight is a lot worse than too loose.








, Keeping it clean of dirt (and salt in winter) will not only make it look nice, it has its benefits and it's the key to a bike which lasts long. It also makes it easier to notice missing or loose bolts and nuts.








, You should change the tyres when you notice a change in the way the bike handles, as specified by local legislation, or at the very latest when the tread is worn down to the wear bars. Under-inflated tyres will overheat and may fail. Over-inflated tyres will give less than optimal grip.

Check with your bike retailer for specific trailer suggestions for the model.


Renting a trailer is usually the most common option, since most companies that provide the equipment usually keep it very well-maintained, and in compliance with federal and state law in terms of registration, plates, and lighting.
Size-wise, a 5' X 9' open trailer with a fold-down ramp is ideal for one or two cruisers. It's also good to have tie-down rings in the front corners, on the floor.
Some trailers made specifically for motorcycle trailers have very small tires, which bounce uncontrollably as you drive. If the bike is worth towing, use a heftier trailer.;
, Measure the wheelbase and the ground clearance of the bike, to make sure you get a ramp that's big enough for your purposes. Most trailers should come with a pull-down ramp, but if you're going to rent one, or try to trailer a bike in your truck, you'll want to be sure it'll work. Wheelbase is measured from the center of the front wheel to the center of the rear wheel of your bike.
Ground Clearance is measured from the lowest point of the motorcycle, halfway between the front and rear wheels.
You also want to measure the height of the trailer or the truck bed, in which you're trying to load the bike.

, Laws vary from state to state, so it's always a good idea to investigate any special permits, laws, rules of the road, or licenses that you might need in order to stay in compliance with local law enforcement.


Most rental companies will offer a temporary insurance policy, which may cover only their equipment and which may require you to pay a deductible.
Check with your insurance company to see whether the rental insurance will be sufficient, just to be on the safe side.

, To pull a trailer with weight up to a ton, you'll need something with rear-wheel drive rated to tow two thousand pounds. Crown Victorias or Chevy Caprices work great.


Hitches are rated based on the tongue-weight of different trailers, and you'll need an appropriate hitch for the trailer you use. For motorcycles, Class 1 or 2 hitches are usually fine.Smaller cars can work for smaller trailers, but anything more than a ton needs a heftier vehicle. Trucks and SUVs, from Ford Rangers to Chevy Colorados are usually better than any car.
If you're going to tow a much bigger trailer, in excess of two tons, you'll need at least a half-ton truck like an F-150 or a Silverado. a half-ton truck like a Ford F-150 or Chevy Silverado., There are several varieties of these straps but the ratchet type are easier to compress the suspension than the pull strap type, and they are available at most home centers and discount stores.


Pay attention to the Working Load Limit of the straps you get and choose a strap that has a working load limit of at least half the weight of your motorcycle. For instance if your bike weighs 650 pounds, find a strap with a working load limit of at least 325 pounds each. Most one-inch nylon straps will have this rating.

, A wheel chock is a sturdy material made of metal or hard plastic that is placed around the front wheel of the motorcycle to inhibit it from moving. While the wheel chock is not a requirement to trailer your bike, it certainly makes the chore much easier, especially if you are loading and strapping without the assistance of a friend.


If you do not have a chock then park the bike at the very front of the trailer. If there is a rail on the trailer your front tire should be pressed against the rail.

, Push the bike up the ramp into the bed of the trailer, placing the front wheel into the wheel chock. Place the front wheel of your motorcycle into the wheel chock.

, A general rule for strapping anything is to attach the straps as high as possible on the bike and as low as possible on the trailer for the greatest holding power. Use an ""X"" pattern for maximum stability.


Start with the front left strap (as viewed from a sitting position on the bike). Secure one end of the strap to the trailer and the other to a rigid point on the frame, or triple tree.
Tighten the front left strap until it is taut. Next attach the front right strap in the same manner as the front left strap. Since your bike is on the side stand it will be leaning to the left but in the end we want the bike to be perfectly vertical when secured.
You may want to use some soft loops on the motorcycle end of the strap, to protect the bike, then attach the ratchet strap to the soft loop.

, Secure the other hook end of the strap to a secure spot in your truck or trailer, preferably on an angle. Pull the slack out of the strap and ratchet it a few times. Repeat this same process for the right side. Tighten each ratchet strap so that the bike will sit in the upright position on its own.


You will notice the bike start moving into a vertical position and your front suspension compressing. Once the bike is vertical you will want to tighten the left and right sides equally until the suspension is completely compressed.
Don't strap the handlebars. Most manufactures say that it's not safe to attach ratchet straps to the handlebars because they are simply not designed to take the pressures that will be exerted by the straps and a bouncy road.

, Remember to secure the straps rearward of the motorcycle so that the rear straps put counter tension on the front straps, making your bike an immovable fixture on the trailer.


Do not tie the straps to guards on saddle bags or trunks as it is likely you will pull the guards off during transit. Again you will want to compress the suspension as you ratchet the straps.

, As you ratchet the straps down, you need to make sure the suspension is compressed fully. If it is not compressed it is possible that your straps can come loose as the bike rebounds, bouncing around from bumps and dips in the road.

, You don't want the first time you drive with a trailer to be the first time you've got your prized bike strapped to it, driving at highway speeds in the elements. Practice hooking up your trailer and driving around a bit to get a feel for things.


Practice tight corners, driveways, and backing up specifically. Take it for a test run on a highway, at high speed. Get a sense of how you will need to adjust your regular driving habits to accommodate driving with the trailer attached.

, After securing the bike to the trailer, use a canvas or vinyl tarp to cover it and keep it safe from the elements, or the cover you use for your motorcycle when you park it. The tarp doesn't need to be doing any load-bearing work, so just tie it firmly down to the straps, or to the bike.

, It's important to go back and check all the straps and make sure they are not rubbing any parts on your bike. Also recheck the tension on the straps. On a longer trip, do a walk around every time you stop and re-check the straps again. It's always best to be on the safe side.

Don't neglect your front end.",How to Tow a Trailer," You probably can't tow an 8,000 pound full-size camper trailer with a Honda Civic. Depending upon the particular trailer you need to haul, you need to check to determine the weight limits in the owner's manual and determine the appropriate hitch to have installed.


The weight should be generally specified by the manufacturer and listed in the owner's manual. Look online if you're missing the manual, or check at an auto shop.
You need to find two numbers, the gross trailer weight (GTW), which is the combined weight of the trailer and the gear on it, and the maximum tongue weight for your vehicle to determine the class of hitch you'll need to tow the load.;
, Generally, you'll get a hitch receiver installed that you can use for different size trailer hitches, for class 3 and up. These receivers include a removable draw-bar that you can use to install different sized hitches for different loads you might use.If you get the largest receiver installed on your vehicle, you'll be ready for any sized load your vehicle can handle, classified according to the following specs:


Class 1: 2000 pounds GTW/200 pounds tongue weight
Class 2: 3500 pounds GTW/350 pounds tongue weight
Class 3: 5000 pounds GTW/500 pounds tongue weight
Class 4: 7500 pounds GTW/750 pounds tongue weight
Class 5: 10,000 pounds GTW/1000 pounds tongue weight

, The larger the ball, the more weight it can carry. Basically, the ball of the hitch will come in one of three sizes:



1 7⁄8 inch (4.8 cm)
2 inch (5.1 cm)

2 5⁄16 inch (5.9 cm)

, Use the tongue jack to raise the trailer and align it with the ball. Make sure that the hitch lock is unlocked before lowering the trailer onto the ball and securing the tongue. Cross the safety chains to the hooks near the vehicle hitch or the vehicle frame, making sure there is enough slack in the chains but not so much that they drag on the ground.


Using the tongue jack, try to raise the tongue off of the ball. If you are able to do this, the ball and tongue sizes do not match, or the ball is not locked properly. In this case, replace the ball with the correct size, or lock it properly and try again.
Once the tongue of the trailer is on the ball, you can lock it in place by placing a bolt or padlock through the ball lock mechanism to prevent it from accidentally opening.

, Generally, these employ a simple color-coded connection that makes it easy to hook up the lights to the harness should make it easy to install the connector properly to the tow vehicle's harness.


After you've hooked up the lights, do a quick brake check to make sure everything is functioning properly. It's critical to make sure that your turn signals and brakes work on the back of the trailer to ensure a safe trip (as well as no traffic tickets).To keep the connection from corroding, you might consider spraying the contacts with a small amount of dielectric grease.

, You want the amount of weight resting on the hitch to be roughly 10 to 12 percent of the total weight of the trailer. You can use a regular bathroom scale to place under the beam to check.


If the weight out-weighs your scale (which is likely for 4000 lb. and up trailers) place the scale farther up the trailer to get a smaller measurement. If you go a third of the way up, triple the weight on the scale to get the approximate weight.
Depending on the weight of the trailer, you might consider using an equalizing bar to even out the pressure on the hitch. These are generally long metal brackets that transfer a bit of the weight more toward your vehicle's front axle. If you're hauling at the upper end of the specs, use an equalizer.

, Depending on the load you're hauling, you might need to use a tarp to secure loose objects in boats or refuse trailers, since you're responsible for anything that flies out and causes damage.


You can also take this opportunity to make sure the hitch height is set correctly, your trailer's tires are inflated to the appropriate specifications, and that you haven't overloaded the trailer in such a way as to negate the careful checks you've already performed.

, Before you hit the road, get out your tape measure. Does the trailer make your rig considerably taller? By how much? How much length is added to the back of your car or truck? These will be important considerations any time you're trying to park somewhere you normally wouldn't give a second thought to squeezing into.


If it's your first time towing a trailer, it's best to practice some in a big empty parking lot before taking it out on the road. You want to be as familiar as possible with the vehicle's response time and turning radius.

, You must always compensate for the extra weight, especially when slowing down, and especially when driving on inclines. Play it safe and be cautious. You also need to pay especially close attention to the added length of your rig anytime you're:


Changing lanes
Merging
Exiting the interstate
Parking
Stopping for gas
Pulling over

, Towing a significant amount of weight will negatively effect your fuel economy, so keep a close eye on the gauge. Making frequent pull-offs in crowded gas stations can be stressful for first-time towers, so try to anticipate your fuel needs ahead of time to avoid difficult maneuvers.

, Even if you checked and doubled checked your connections and everything is up to code, there's always the possibility that something in the road will jostle the trailer lose a bit. It's best to stop sometimes, especially on long or especially bumpy trips, to make sure everything's still hooked up. Seeing your trailer careen off the road isn't the time to double-check., It'll probably happen eventually that you'll mis-time a turn, or lack sufficient space to clear a turn like you figured you would. Don't panic. Make sure there isn't traffic behind you and back up slowly and as straight as possible to give yourself the clearance you need. Get a passenger to hop out and watch the trailer from a different angle to give you steering tips, and use your mirrors judiciously.

, No lie: backing up a trailer is one of the most difficult driving maneuvers there is, but it's easy to master with the right technique and a bit of smarts. To get ready, roll down your windows and kick a passenger out to act as a spotter. It might take a few runs before you get it perfect, so it helps to have another set of eyes.

, To get yourself oriented properly, pull more or less straight perpendicular to where you want the back end of the trailer to go, keeping the truck and the trailer straight. Pull past the spot by 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) to give yourself adequate room to back up.


When you've got it lined up, turn your wheel opposite the direction of the parking spot. So, in other words, if you've pulled up perpendicular to a spot on your passenger side, enough ahead of the spot to back up, stop the car and jack the wheel to the left, or the driver's side.

, Basically, to get the back end of the trailer to go right, you need to make your car back up going left and then straighten it back out to avoid a jackknife. Start backing up slowly and quickly straighten the wheel back out by turning it back toward the right. Watch your back end closely and straighten it back out if your angle gets too sharp. This'll take some practice.Go extremely slowly. If you're in an automatic transmission, the idling speed should be plenty fast to make you nervous. Use gas only sparingly and don't make unnecessary or fast changes.
Avoid jackknifing. If, at any point, the angle of the truck to the trailer becomes smaller than a right angle, straight it back out and give it another go. Don't try to force it, because it won't work.

, Make friends with your side mirrors so you can keep an eye on where your front end is at all times, taking special caution to watch out for parking obstacles and bumps that might mess up your approach and be a problem when you're trying to straighten back out. Drive like a pro and use your side mirrors.


Your rear-view will be basically useless in the task. Use the help of a spotter and your side-mirrors to back up correctly.

Two of the most important factors in selecting a trailer hitch are Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) and Tongue Weight (TW).,
Weigh your gross towing weight

The Tongue Weight (TW) is the downward force exerted by the trailer coupler onto the hitch ball and the trailer hitch.,
Weigh the trailer tongue weight

For tongue weights over 300 pounds, place a household scale and a brick that's as thick as the scale three feet apart as shown the figure below.,
How to weight a heavy trailer tongue weight

Your Tow Vehicle:

Find your vehicle's maximum towing capacity by consulting the owner's manual.",How to Select a Trailer Hitch2," First, you should determine the GTW and TW of your trailer when fully loaded. Table 1 shows some common examples of trailer weights. Then, you should determine whether your vehicle is rated to accept the weight of your trailer.
Gross Trailer Weight (GTW) is the fully loaded weight of your trailer in the condition that you would tow it in. If you don't know the weight of your trailer, the best way to measure it is on a vehicle scale. Weigh stations in your area are a good resource for determining GTW.

, Your vehicle's suspension carries this weight. In most cases, the TW is 10-15 percent of the overall trailer weight.

Tongue Weight of up to 300 pounds can be measured on a standard bathroom scale by resting the trailer coupler on the scale. You should make sure the scale is securely propped up so that the Tongue Weight is measured with the trailer coupler at the standard towing height.



, Set a length of pipe on each and rest a beam across the pipes. Re-zero the scale to correct for the weight of the beam and pipe. Securely block the trailer wheels. Rest the trailer jack on the beam as shown, one (1) foot from the brick and two (2) feet from the scale. To obtain the TW, multiply the scale reading by three (3). For greater tongue weights, place the scale and brick four (4) feet apart, rest the jack on the beam three (3) feet from the scale and multiply the scale reading by four (4).

, Contact your local car dealer if you cannot find the information or have lost the manual.

Compare the GTW and TW ratings from your vehicle to the actual GTW and TW measurements from your trailer.",How to Select a Trailer Hitch3," If the vehicle specifications are higher than the actual weights of the trailer, then it's time to select a trailer hitch. Otherwise, you will either need to get a vehicle with more towing capacity or lighten your trailer."
"Determine which trailer hitch type is right for your application by selecting the row and column that best match your vehicle and trailer.,Weight Carrying Trailer Hitches:,
Weight Carrying trailer hitches are typically used for trailers up to 3,500 lbs GTW and 300 lbs TW.,
There are two main types of weight carrying hitches:

Fixed Drawbar - The ball is mounted to a permanent platform that is fixed to the hitch.,
Weight Distributing Trailer Hitches:

Instead of directly supporting the trailer tongue weight on the hitch, the Weight Distribution trailer hitches apply leverage between the towing vehicle and the trailer.,
Weight Distribution

A Weight Distribution system includes a receiver attached to the towing vehicle and a removable hitch head and spring bar assembly.",How to Select a Trailer Hitch4,",, Some vehicles such as pickups and vans have stronger springs to support higher loads. Weight Carrying trailer hitches support the entire tongue weight on the rear of the car. Most passenger car and light truck applications use Weight Carrying trailer hitches., Because of the inconvenience of the fixed drawbar, HitchSource.com does not carry many fixed drawbar hitches.
Removable Drawbar - The ball is mounted on a removable platform. The removable platform is commonly called a drawbar or a removable ball mount.

, This leverage helps to distribute the trailer weight to the front of the towing vehicle and to the rear of the trailer. By distributing the TW, a Weight Distribution trailer hitch allows trailers with greater weights to be towed. The Weight Distribution trailer hitch also results in a more level ride and gives better steering and brake control.

, Most Weight Distribution trailer hitch heads and spring bar assemblies are designed to mount to the receiver of a standard Weight Carrying trailer hitch.

Not all trailer lighting receptacles are the same, so be mindful beforehand to match up what you see on the trailer with what you have on the back of your car or truck.
If they don't match, don't panic, there are adapters for every situation available through your tow rig rental company, auto parts store, and even many department stores with an automotive section.;
, Make sure you have the right hitch and right sized hitch ball before hooking up your dolly, then get it plugged in, making sure that the lights correspond to those on your towing vehicle.

, Park the dolly as close as you safely, reasonably can to the front of the vehicle to be towed, most preferably on flat, level ground. Leave it in park, and secure the parking brake.

, The dolly will have nets, chains, straps or some combination of the above. Take a moment to lay them out so they are either out of the way or in the case of nets, in position to be wrapped around your tire.


Check the instructions that came with your dolly for specific procedures, or consult the technicians at the rental place, if you get it from a movers'.

, If the dolly has magnetic or clamp-on tail lights, be sure to lay those out so again, you don't drive over them. Likewise, if the rig you have is meant to connect to your car's own lighting, keep that connection safe.

, With a friend to help guide you, start your towed vehicle and very slowly drive it up onto the dolly, being sure to get it as well centered as possible. When in the correct position, apply the parking brake, or shift into park, or both.


If the car to be towed is not operational, a winch is your best bet; otherwise you will probably need more help to roll the car into place.

, If there are straps or chains, these will wrap around your axle, and in some cases there may be a hook which will either wrap around the axle as well, or may be connected directly to your vehicle's tow tongue (or 'D' ring), if there is one.

, It is important that you do not attempt to back your car onto a tow dolly, and pull it backwards down the road, especially for long distances.


People have tried, and some have surely made it to their destination safely, but there is a tendency for front wheels, which of course can turn for steering, to cause not just severe wobble but extremely dangerous situations.

, It cannot be overstated that, at this point, your car needs to be well-centered and strapped down as well as you can manage. No reason to try to force things, but neither should you be shy with the amount of muscle you apply.


You're going to go back and check all securing mechanisms in a bit, so for now just pull the straps and work the ratchets as well as you can without throwing your back out.

, Tow dollies will often have lights built in. Sometimes they have a second set of lights meant to adhere magnetically to your towed vehicle or clamp to its bumper.


If you have these, a thin layer of plastic or cloth will help prevent damage to your paint, if you don't have a metal bumper to stick them to.
If they bumper mount, find an appropriate place to clamp or strap them on securely.

, If your dolly has a connection to use your tow car's lights, you will have to consult your owners' manual to find out where and how to plug it in you your towed car's electrical system. You may have to buy an adapter.


It is not recommended you try to patch in without a connection in place for this purpose - so don't try to rig it yourself by tapping into your car's lighting system, unless you know what you are doing.

, Brake lights when you brake, right turn blinker, left turn blinker, running lights - all of these should match your vehicle's lights exactly.


Take your towed vehicle out of park, or release the parking brake, and you should be ready to roll. Start off slow, and take your towed vehicle for a test drive, to make sure everything stays centered and secure. Just a trip around the block should be enough to let you know if there is any glaring problem.
If your towed car sways to one side or another, or back and forth, it's likely just a little off center. Stop somewhere safe and go back and reposition it.

, If no problems are detected on your test drive, just go back and check any and all fasteners for tension. This first little shakedown drive might have allowed the nets, chains or straps to loosen up. Just get them all good and tight, and you're done.


Check that everything is secure each time you stop between your starting point and destination. A cursory check to be sure the lights are all behaving as they should is also a good idea.

, This section is for rear wheel drive and four wheel drive vehicles only. Only the rear axle will need to be disconnected when using a tow dolly.

, Get under your car - raise it up if you must, being careful to leave it in park, or with the parking brakes on and using wheel chocks to keep it from rolling off your jack or ramps.


Bring your ratchet set, or wrenches, some spray lube, and a bungee cord or a ratchet strap or some rope, at least. Also some duct tape or plastic insulation tape to secure the universal joint cups from falling off.

, Find where the drive shaft connects to the differential you want disconnected. Find the u-joint and on the end of that, the yoke, where four bolts can be found that hold the drive shaft to the differential housing.

, Don't use your exhaust pipes or anything loose - just look around to find something solid to connect it to. No reason to make this tight just yet, you're just trying to prevent your drive shaft from landing on your head when it comes loose.

, Remove those four bolts - the wrench or ratchet size you need will vary depending on the make and model of your car, and you might need to knock some dirt off and apply some spray-on lubricant to get them to come loose.


When the last bolt comes loose, the drive shaft is going to try to land right on your head, so you'll soon find out whether you did a good job hooking up that bungee to something. Use the duct or insulation tape to secure the universal joint cups to the uni joint. Be careful not to let these cups come off during this entire process, as they contain thin individual needle rollers which are easily lost or damaged.

, Push the drive shaft up as far as you can get it to go, and adjust your bungee or tighten the strap so there is as little wobble or play as possible.


Don't force anything - you just want it up and out of the way and secure enough not to flop around or fall while you are towing.

, Screw the bolts you removed back into the yoke on the differential housing.


No need to overly-tighten them - this is just a good place to keep them so they don't get lost. You can also take them out and store them in a baggie or something, if you prefer.
Repeat this process for your other axle, if you have one. The main idea here is to get your axles disconnected, and secure the drive shafts(s) well enough that they don't drop and hit the pavement while you are towing.

Extend any landing gear that is built into the design of the trailer.,
Determine the degree of imbalance present after parking the trailer.,
Adjust the landing gear as needed.,
Level the angle from side-to-side first.,
Adjust the leveling front-to-back.,
Recheck the balance of the travel trailer.",How to Level a Trailer," In most cases, the landing gear is operated with a simple hand crank. Making sure the gear is touching the ground before attempting to make any adjustments will add some stability to the trailer and provide a better idea if any adjustments are needed at all.
, This can be accomplished by placing the carpenter's level on the floor of the trailer. Check the leveling from side-to-side first, and then reposition the level to check from front-to-back. Doing so makes it easier to determine which corners of the trailer will require some attention., Doing so will often make it possible to quickly achieve and even balance from all angles, or at least reduce the amount of leveling that must be achieved using additional resources., Use a trailer jack to lift the side that is at an undesirable height. Then slide a section of wooden planking into the gap between the nearest support in the gear mechanism and the ground level. Place a chock under the nearest wheel to prevent any slipping. Lower the jack, and use the level to make sure the angle is now balanced., Start with the end of the trainer that is lower, and use the jack to lift that end to the desired height. Use the carpenter's level to double-check the angle. If the balance from front-to-back is ideal, use short sections of wood planks to build up the area between the ground and the bottom of the gear mechanisms. Secure the trailer tires with the aid of the chocks., Using the carpenter's level, take a second look at the balance from side-to-side and then from front-to-back a second time. Placing the level in the middle area of the trailer floor will make it easier to determine if the overall balance is within acceptable limits. If the balance is acceptable, make sure the planks and chocks are firmly in position."

Do a quick Internet search for the name of your state and “car registration,” and you should find the information you need to get to their website.


For example, if you live in California, you will find the website for the California Department of Motor Vehicles at www.dmv.ca.gov.If you have just moved to New Hampshire, the agency is the Division of Motor Vehicles.In Massachusetts, for example, the office is the Registry of Motor Vehicles.;
, When you move into a new state, you generally must register your car in the new state within a certain time frame. This may be as short as 30 days or less.For example, the website for the Washington State Department of Licensing says that you must register your car in the state within 30 days of moving.
In many states, you must get a new driver’s license within your new home state either as part of registering the car or before you can register the car.

, Each state will have different requirements for registering your vehicle. When you find the website for your new DMV, you should be able to find a list of requirements for registration. Some of the most common requirements include the following:


Your identification. You will need to demonstrate some government-issued identification that shows that you match the owner of the vehicle. This may be your driver’s license, passport, or some other state-issued identification card.Proof of ownership. You will most definitely need to provide some proof that you are the owner of the vehicle. This is most likely going to be the Title Certificate, although you may be able to present your registration from your previous state.If you still owe money on a loan, the lender probably is holding the certificate of title. You will at least want to check with the DMV on how to proceed in this case. You can probably get a certificate or statement from the lien holder to verify title ownership.Odometer disclosure statement. In some states, you merely need to provide the odometer reading on your own. In other states, you may need to take your vehicle to a state-approved location and have an odometer reading certified.Emissions disclosure statement. Several states, most notably California, require that your car must pass an emissions test before you can register it. Even if you passed such a test in your prior state, you must get a new certification if you move into California.Bill of sale. Particularly if you have purchased your car recently, you may need to show some extra proof of purchase.

, Contact either the DMV or your own insurance company to find out what form of proof is required for a vehicle registration. Your insurance company may have a simple form or certificate that they can send you. You may need to have a particular DMV form stamped by your insurance company. Plan ahead, because getting this paperwork may take a few days.

, In some states, you may need a cursory safety inspection, while other states will require a multi-stage inspection that includes both vehicle operation and emissions or smog certification. Find out your state’s requirements and leave yourself enough time to get it done.When your car passes each stage of the inspection, you should get a certificate of some sort. Make sure that you have this available for the registration.

, If you can access the form online, download and print it at home. If this is not a possibility, you would then need to visit the DMV office to get a registration application form. In either case, make sure that you get the correct form. The form that you need to register a vehicle that is coming in from another state might be different than the form for registering a newly purchased vehicle. If you have questions, call the DMV to ask.


For example, if you are registering a vehicle in California, you will need their Form REG 343, which is titled, “Application for Title or Registration.”, Read over the form carefully before you begin, to make sure that you complete the portions that apply to you. In some states, a single form will be used for multiple purposes.


For example, if you are moving into New York and wish to register your vehicle, the form you use is titled, “Vehicle Registration/Title Application.” The same form is used to register your vehicle, renew or change a registration, replace a lost or damaged registration, title certificate or license plates, get a title, or transfer your license plates. Be sure that you mark the correct boxes., If you are completing the form online, you may be able to type your information directly onto the form and then print the completed, typed form. Otherwise, you should print the form and complete it neatly in ink. If you leave out any information, or if your writing is illegible, your application may be denied, delayed, or incorrect., You will need to provide the year, make and model of the car. You will also need to provide the vehicle’s complete Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Be careful to provide this accurately. If you make mistakes on the application form, your final registration may include errors. These can be difficult to correct later.You can usually find the VIN on a small plate just under the windshield on the driver’s side of the dashboard. Be sure to copy all numbers and letters of the VIN carefully.

, In many states, you may be able to apply for registration through the DMV website. This can save you a lengthy visit to the DMV office. In other states, you may be able to begin the process online, but then take care of the rest with a briefer DMV visit.


For example, in New York you can use the “E-Z Visit” service. This service will let you begin your application online. As a result, this will reduce the time you need to spend at the registry office.As another example, Pennsylvania will let you renew your registration online, as long as you meet certain qualifications.You will want to check your own state’s site to learn your options.

, Find out where the nearest DMV office to your home is located. Most states’ websites provide a list of locations. You will want to find the one that is closest or most convenient to you. Some states also allow you to make appointments online. This would reduce your waiting time when you go to register your vehicle.


For example, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has an interactive map of the state that illustrates the DMV office locations. When you select the one nearest you, a pop-up box provides you with the address, telephone number and hours of operation for that office. You can also click on a link for directions.Take your completed forms and payment for all required fees to the office.

, In most states, the registration fee is based on the value of the vehicle that you are registering. You may not be able to plan for the exact amount of the registration fee. Call the office to find out what options you may have for payment. Most DMV offices will accept cash, checks, money orders or credit cards. You should find out which forms are accepted in your new state and try to estimate the amount you will need to pay.


For example, the Nevada DMV provides a link on its website for a fee estimate. If you provide your vehicle’s VIN, make, model and year, the link can give you an estimate of the registration fee. Be aware that even this link is only an estimate, and the final fee will not be set until you visit the DMV office., Each state sets its own limits for vehicle registration. After a few years, you will need to reapply or at least renew your registration. The renewal process is usually easier and quicker than the initial registration. Many states will allow you to renew your registration on line every year or every 2 years.


In Nevada, for example, you can renew your registration online from any computer.You can also quickly renew your registration online in Massachusetts., Some states will give you a temporary registration and mail your plates in 2 to 4 weeks. Other states will have them ready for you immediately. Be sure that you do not leave the DMV office without understanding their process for this.

, Some states will charge you a fee if you do not return your license plates.


New York, for example, requires that you return your old plates when you register the vehicle in a new state. You would need to print and complete the Plate Surrender Application, and then return that completed form with your old plates.Call the DMV or MVA in your old state and find out where to send them. Your old state's agency might also have this information on their website.

Congratulations, you passed!",How to Pass Your Driving Test," Every state has them, and that's where you'll find everything that will be on both the written and the actual driving test.


You'll learn the basic rules of the road, when to pull over for emergency vehicles (always a favorite on driving exams), speed limits in various zones (another favorite), how to handle accidents, and more.
Read it chapter by chapter, make notes if that helps you remember, and have somebody quiz you after each chapter. If you can answer 80% of the questions, move on to the next chapter.
At the end of the booklet, ask to be quizzed on the whole manual. Any chapters you don't do well on, revisit. If you go through the book three times in three weeks, your chances of passing—even acing—your test are very high.;
, Most states have regulations regarding how much experience you have behind the wheel. Some states make allowances for taking accredited driving courses, either through school or professional instruction.


Some states also make allowances for top students. While it won't directly help you pass your driving test, being a good student will often make it easier to meet the requirements.
Student drivers must have a licensed driver with them at all times. In some states, having a license is all your passenger needs. In some states there are age restrictions, or restrictions based on how long the person has been licensed. You will learn these rules and restrictions in the driver's manual that you're going to study.

, Find out in advance where you will be taking the practical test (the actual driving part). While it may be illegal in your state (read the manual), unless you're following specific routes, there should be no problem driving in the general neighborhood.


That's not generally necessary, unless you are such an inexperienced driver that you need an advantage. If that's the case, you're better off not rushing into getting a license.
Practicing all the basic maneuvers—stopping, starting, signaling, backing up, parking, obeying the speed limit and all traffic control signs and signals are all good things to practice.
One of the biggest things the examiner will look for is whether or not you have full command of your vehicle. If you are intimidated by the car, make jerky starts and stops, and generally show a lack of confidence in your driving, that will count against you.
If you speed, run a light or a stop sign, or make other egregious errors, you can pretty much count on retaking the test.

, Knowing street signs, hand gestures, when to pass, how and when to pull over for emergency vehicles will count. Read that manual! Know the rules and you'll be fine.

, The morning before your test, ask them to watch you, and make sure that you check all your mirrors correctly and do all your maneuvers correctly. This will help you gain some confidence.

, Your registration and insurance should be easily accessible. Tires should be inflated properly and in good condition, lights will all need to be working, windshield wipers functional, with the washer reservoir filled, all instruments—especially the speedometer—working and accurate, and turn the radio off when you get there.


There should be no cracks in the windshield.
Make sure your car isn't belching smoke. If the examiner feels like your car might be unsafe, they can turn you away.
Adjust the seat to fit your body height and style. You should sit at least 10 inches (25cm) from the steering wheel and your hands should be bent at approximately 45 degrees, holding the steering wheel at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.
Make sure your feet reach the pedals properly, so you're not stretching to reach them, or bunched up in your seat.

, Bring your completed and signed Driver's Log, Drivers Ed certificate, driving time with an instructor certificate, your learners permit, and any other papers or certificates required, including your Social Security card and birth certificate for identification purposes.

, Relax, and be friendly. You won't lose points for being unpleasant—necessarily—but if your examiner needs to make a judgement call about your driving at some point, ask yourself: would you be easier on a nice person, or a jerk?


Ask any questions that you have prior to the test and in the test if you are confused. The driving examiner will be glad to answer them.

, Note that this does not necessarily mean the speed limit—conditions may warrant a slower speed. Under no circumstances exceed the speed limit.

, Check your mirrors regularly. Make this a little more exaggerated than normal, just so it is clear that you are doing it.


Keep your head moving, looking out the windows for other traffic, pedestrians, kids, little old ladies, etc.
Keep your eyes on the road, not on that good-looking guy or hot girl walking down the sidewalk. Your examiner will see them too, and check to see what has your attention: the road, or the hotness. If you want to pass, the answer needs to be ""the road.""
When you change lanes or turn, turn your head to look behind you. Your rear-view mirrors are useful, but they're not foolproof. A combination of eyes and mirrors are the best.

, Come to a full stop at stop signs. Look all ways before continuing. If there are other people at the stop sign, make sure you yield right of way properly—and take your turn when it's time.


Don't forget to signal all turns, lane changes, and any time your intent is to change direction.

, Practice with your driving instructor or parent before taking the test so that you can do a clean, confident job of parallel parking, backing up straight, and three- or four-point turns.


Parallel park as best as you can. Make sure you turn on your indicators, as not doing so will likely ensure a failure. Try not to bump the curb; go slowly and carefully, looking to the back and sides as you do so.
Remember, it's OK to slightly bump the curb, just not jump it. You will lose some points, but that's better than failing the test altogether.

, When you return to the motor vehicle department, listen to what the examiner has to say. Most likely they will mention what you did wrong, and a little of what you did right.


Then they'll tell you if you passed or failed. Whichever it is, thank them politely. If you passed, you'll be pleased, and it's always nice to be polite. If you failed, you'll have to come back—and you might get the same examiner the next time. If you fly off the handle and call the examiner a ""nail biting old crank who needs new glasses,"" it will probably go a lot harder on you next time!

, If you read this tutorial, and studied the manual, you will almost certainly pass your driver's exam. Be safe out there!

Be familiar with all the procedures and regulations about drivers.,
Schedule a driving test appointment.,
Arrive before your scheduled time.,
Complete your Pre-Trip successfully.,
Finish your Parallel Parking and Reverse Two Point Turnabout maneuvers within three minutes each without jumping the curb.,
Stop completely at the stop signs.,
Conclude the test driving on the public road.",How to Pass the Maryland Non Commercial Class C Driver's Test," Access MVA website to obtain more information about Maryland non-commercial class c driver's license. Read Maryland Driver's Handbook several times to gain more knowledge of driving rules. With all the procedures and regulations in mind, improve your driving skills by getting behind the wheels with an experienced licensed driver on your side as many times as possible.;
, An appointment is necessary in order to take the driving test. Choose a MVA facility close to you to avoid long trip and stress before the test. Select the time and date being sure that you will be rested, relaxed, with no other preoccupation in mind, awake and alert.

, Make sure you show up before your schedule time with a reliable vehicle, proof of updated car insurance, current vehicle registration and a licensed driver. Present yourself inside the branch to check-in and prepare all paper work to the test.

, After your check-in a MVA agent will give you direction where to go. The first part of the test will be a pre-trip inspection of the vehicle. On this part of the test you will demonstrate to the examiner that your vehicle is in good condition to go on the road. You will need to turn the lights on ( low beam and high beam), left and right hand turn signal, brake lights , hazard light, wipers and horn. All these items are going to be checked by the examiner outside your car while you, inside, turn them on. In addition to that the examiner will check the condition of the tires, if all lug nuts are present, if fuel gauge shows more than one-half tank of fuel and if there is no indication light on the dash-board such as ""check engine light."" Remember that everything need to be working properly in order to pass the vehicle inspection and to proceed to the second part of the test. If for any reason your vehicle disqualifies, you will need to schedule another appointment for a new test.

, Do not allow your vehicle to come in contact with a cone or a flag. After the inspection of the vehicle you will be required to perform some driving maneuvers on a closed course to demonstrate your basic driving skills. Examiners will always give detailed instruction before each exercise but if before start an exercise you have any question, do not be afraid to ask. It is much better to clarify instructions with questions before the exercise than do it wrongly and fail the test. Parallel Parking and Reverse Two Point Turnabout are the two timed exercises on the closed course test. In some MVA branches you will perform these maneuvers in this order, first Parallel Park then Reverse Two Point, while in others the order might be different. However, does not matter what order you to these exercises because the rules are going to be same for all MVA branches. Both exercises need to be done within three minutes without jumping the curb or touching a cone or flag. You will also need to observe traffic both sides left and right every time you turn your steering wheel and properly indicate your intention of turning using the appropriate turn signal. Avoid touching the curb during both maneuvers and remember that for the Parallel Parking you will need to park your vehicle within twelve inches from the concrete curb. Be aware of your surroundings, use all your mirrors and watch for the cones, flags and curbs.

, Throughout the test course you will see at least two stop signs. When approaching a stop sign ahead make sure your vehicle comes to a complete stop before the stop sign and/or white stop line painted on the ground. Before proceeding, slowly turn your head to the right and to the left to check for oncoming traffic, pedestrians or animals. If turning, use the appropriate turn signal to indicate your turn. Then, proceed ahead to the end of the test course as instructed by the examiner.

, Immediately after passing on the closed course test you will proceed to the public road portion of your driving test. This will be the last part of the test. The road portion takes approximately twelve minutes depending on local traffic. The examiner will give specific instructions and will direct you throughout the last part of your test. Drive as you would in any other situation being aware of your surroundings, obeying all traffic laws, lanes marking, road signs and speed limit signs. Check traffic constantly by look left and right and using all yours mirror. You will be required to identify road sign during your road test so be observant.

Choose the best towing option for your situation.,
Use a trailer.,
Think about using a tow dolly.,
Try using a tow bar.,
Find out about the other types of tow bars.",How to Prepare Your Car for Towing1," There are three basic options for hauling your car; it's up to you to determine which method best fits your situation. The three options covered in this article are: using a trailer, using a dolly, or using a tow bar.


The other option that is not listed in the following steps is using a strap, rope, or chain to pull your broken down car to the shop. This method calls for someone sitting in the car, working the turn signals, steering wheel, and brake pedal. If it's not an emergency, or if you have further than a few blocks to go, do not try this method, as it’s just not safe.
If you have to tow your car in this manner, just remember to let the towed car handle the brake loads, and be sure to avoid letting your rope, strap, or chain get too much slack. You also need to remember to put on your hazard lights.;
, The first, and likely least difficult, option is to use a trailer that allows you to raise all four wheels of your towed vehicle off of the ground. These are pricey to buy, but your local moving van service might have something you can rent. To use the trailer:


Drive, push or winch your car up onto the trailer. Lock your car down; there are generally strong nets you should place over the front wheels, and chains to ratchet down your rear axel.

, The next option is a tow dolly, which lets you get your front wheels up off the ground, letting the rear wheels roll on their own. These are especially handy for front wheel drive vehicles. As with trailers, drive, push or winch your car up onto the dolly. Wrap your wheels in the nets, and ratchet them down a little tighter than you think you need to. There may be a chain for your front axles, or a hook, even, depending on the dolly.


If you are using the dolly to haul rear wheel or four-wheel drive vehicles, you might want to disconnect the drive shaft, especially for long distance travel.
The other option is to leave the towed car in neutral; for automatics, there is a consensus that this is a bad idea for long hauls, but when speaking of standard or 'stick' transmissions, opinions vary as to the necessity of disconnecting the drive shaft.

, The tow bar is a common, popular choice for RVers and toy haulers. It is often chosen for long distance travel. When using a tow bar, all four of your wheels will be left on the ground. They are much cheaper to buy than a trailer or dolly, and can be left on your towed vehicle (you'll see them on jeeps and buggies a lot) as a permanent part of the car’s setup.


The way you connect your tow bar to your car will depend on the model of bar that you use. Some tow bars connect to the frame of your car, while others hook to the front bumper. When you get to your destination, simply unhook the bar and you’re good to go.

, Tow bars also come in a variety that stays coupled to your towing hitch, and connects to the towed car via ""D-Rings"". It is put on in the same way, but can be removed more easily from the towed car, and you can generally leave the d-rings on without impacting your car's good looks if you are just moving it occasionally.


The third variety, commonly available from a moving company, just uses straps and pads to create a temporary hitch-able connection, which can be completely removed when you are done with your move, and requires no alterations to your towed car. Cushions press up against your bumper, straps wrap around your front axle or undercarriage, which results in a fairly solid, snug connection to your towing rig.

You can begin the course as young as 14, but you won't be able to apply for your learner's permit until you are at least 15.If you are over 18 and have a valid license, or if you have a valid license from another state, you won't be required to take a driving portion of the test, though it could be requested by DPS. Those under 18, however, are required to take the test, even with a valid license.
There are a few different options available for you driver's training. You could learn at a for-profit driving school, a public school driving program, or a parent taught version, too.;
, After completing your classroom hours and passing the written exam for your learner's permit, you'll need to put in some practice time. Before your driving test, you'll need to have had your permit for at least six months, practiced at least 30 hours behind the wheel, and turned 16 years old. When you take and pass the test, you get your provisional license.


Provisional licenses are generally for young drivers over the age of 16 but under 18. These licenses have some restrictions until you turn 18, when you will be issued your official license., Since driving tests are administered by DPS, you'll have to make an appointment at your local DPS office. In most cases, this can be done on the official Texas DPS homepage under the ""More Online Services"" tab.Choose a time of day that you're alert and at your best. For example, if you're a morning person, you might want to schedule your appointment earlier in the day.
You may want to avoid scheduling your test for rush hour or lunch time. Increased traffic can add unnecessary stress to your test.

, Before you begin the test, the testing agent will check that your car is safe and legal to drive. Failing any one part of the vehicle assessment could result in you failing the test, even if your driving is perfect. Be sure your car has:


Two license plates permanently attached to the front and back of the car, excluding out-of-state and temporary plates.
A working speedometer, horn, front and back turn signals, seatbelts, wipers, headlights, brake lights, and taillights.
A minimum of one review mirror, either inside or outside the vehicle, and a front passenger door that opens normally both inside and outside.
Current registration, inspection, and insurance. Be careful where insurance is concerned. You cannot be listed as an ""excluded driver."", You never know when traffic or some other unpleasant surprise might cause you to be late. Additionally, feeling rushed to get to your test on time can make you even more anxious. A moment to calm yourself could significantly improve your test results.When you arrive early, you'll have extra time to do things that relax you, like listening to music, reading a book, drinking a cup of coffee, and so on.

, In addition to your license, inspection, and registration, you'll also have to present a valid form of state issued ID. After these documents have been verified by the agent, your vehicle assessment will begin.Valid forms of primary ID include: state driver's license or ID card not yet expired two years, valid passport, permanent resident card, temporary resident card, unexpired military IDs, and more.The vehicle assessment portion of the test will only involve your testing agent checking that your vehicle is safe and legal. You likely won't be asked questions at this point unless something is wrong.

, Different testing locations may have a different setup, and you may want to inquire with your testing agent about the course or the agent's expectations. However, once you begin the driving test, the agent is generally not permitted to carry on casual conversation., Right when you hop in the car, your testing agent will be watching to see if you perform your pre-start duties. These involve adjusting the mirrors, your seat, fastening your seatbelt, and knowing the car controls.Even if your car is already adjusted to your comfort, make small adjustments to show that you have good driving habits.
Some testing agents can be very strict about the order of the test. Check with your testing agent before getting into your car, making adjustments, and turning it on.

, Your testing agent will evaluate your driving test with regard to control, observation, positioning, and signaling. Failing to do these legally and safely will result in points, and too many points result in failing the test.


Control relates to how well you are able to make the car do what you intend. For example, putting the car in reverse when you meant to put it in drive or struggling to turn cleanly would indicate poor control.
A good score in observation will come from you always keeping traffic in view and responding to potential problems proactively.
Your positioning score will depend on your ability to stay in your lane consistently. Drifting, weaving, or favoring one side of the lane over another will hurt this score.
As long as you always remember to use your turn signals where appropriate, you can expect a strong score in this skill area., This includes many things, all of which should have been covered in your driver's education course. The exact areas you are tested on can vary, though there are some features you can expect on nearly any driving test. These include:


Parallel parking
Backing up your vehicle for 15 feet in a straight line
Defensive driving
Obeying all traffic signs and signals, especially stop signs
Stopping quickly from a speed of 20 mph without skidding the tires
Keeping proper posture, with both hands on the wheel at all times, After your test is finished, the testing agent will inform you whether or not you passed the test. Following this, you can expect detailed feedback on your driving strengths and weaknesses. If you didn't pass this time around, you still have 90 days to try two more times to pass the test.


If 90 days have passed since your last driving test, or if you've failed the test three times in 90 days, you'll have to file a new application and pay the application fee once again., With a few cones or other place markers, like boxes, you can create your own practice driving test in your driveway, yard, or in an empty parking lot. You should especially target trouble areas for practice, like parallel parking.


To create a test spot for parallel parking, set two cones or markers 25 feet apart from each other seven inches away from a curb.

, Nerves from your driving test might make you overly critical of your ability and hurt your performance. When you feel anxiety, confront it directly and mentally encourage yourself. For example, you might say something like:


""It's only natural to be nervous. Lots of people get nervous about tests. I've worked hard and am a careful driver. I can do this!""
""I don't usually feel nervous when driving. I'm going to do my best, and if I need to, I can always take it again."", As long as you are performing your driving maneuvers safely and legally, you don't need to rush to make a turn, merge into a lane, or pull into a parking spot. Similarly, take your time answering any oral questions during the driving test. It's better to take your time and do things properly than rush and get a worse score., When you get nervous or anxious, without realizing it you might end up holding your breath or breathing shallowly. This can make you feel worse. Take deep, full breaths slowly to help calm yourself during the test.


Stress related shallow breathing can cause panic attacks in some people. Stop panic attacks before they start by regulating your breathing with deep, full breaths.
Breathing in and out on a count can also help you calm yourself. For example, you might breathe in slowly and completely while counting to ten, hold the breath for a moment, then breathe out slowly and completely, again while counting to ten."

Plan a day each week when you will take your lessons.
Agree this with your instructor.
Plan how many hours you would like to take each week.
Agree this with your instructor.
After each lesson, keep a diary of your journey.


Don't panic if your learning is slow. Many learners struggle with one or two elements of learning to drive.

, Your instructor should give you feedback at the end of each lesson and offer practice sessions to combat problematic areas. Answer the following questions:


Does your instructor give you feedback during each lesson?
Does your instructor use books and media to help to teach you certain topics?
Do you have a learner log?
Is your instructor thorough with their explanations and advice?
Do you feel you are improving?
Are you happy in your instructor's company?

, It is important to have as much time behind a wheel as possible. You can't put a price on experience. If you are able to drive with a parent/friend or family member, the following advice will help you with your practice sessions:


Drive as much as possible, even if it is for five minutes.
Drive to school, college and work for extra 'real-life' practice.
Ensure you try to follow the advice of your instructor whilst out with mum and dad.
Don't panic if you are shouted at. Remember, your parents don't have dual controls!

,

Don't compare your driving to anybody else's.
Listen to your instructor's advice.
Ensure you are prompt and regular with your lessons––and also that your instructor is also!

, When you are ready, plan a mock driving test with your instructor. Treat it as if it were the real thing. Gain as much practice as you can privately and professionally. The following will help:


Learn to drive independently. The more practice you get, the easier it will be to navigate on our own. This will make your test easier.
Understand what is expected from you. The test is marked in three areas: driver error, serious fault, dangerous fault. Ensure you understand what you could get if you make mistakes.
Practice challenging road layouts and roundabouts. This will help plan your journey and understanding of road positioning and defensive driving.
Watch and evaluate other people's driving.
Practice ensures perfection.
Make sure you pass one mock test before your real test.

, Seek to gain in all weathers. This is useful for when you pass your test. If you never drive in the rain, how will you cope if it rains on test day? Even if you never plan to drive at night or in inclement weather, you never know when you might need to know how, so learning now will embed the memory for any future occasion, so that you can get it right. The following will help you:


Keep an eye on the weather forecast.
Schedule lessons for different days and times of the week.
Drive in the dark.
Drive in rush hour, both morning and evening.
Drive with passengers.
Practice with the radio on.
Have plenty of real-life driving experiences.

, It is important not to restrict the amount of lessons you may need. Many learners fail due to not having enough. Although the DVSA recommend a certain amount, everyone is different. It is always better to have more lessons, than not enough. The following will help:


Do not follow the crowd.
Ensure that you are 100 percent confident in all areas of driving.
Make sure you are not panicking about any areas of driving.
Don't dismiss your gut instinct.
Ignore nerves. When you become a good driver, nerves are a false emotion.

Use your hazard lights as a last resort.,
Figure out whether you need to lock your steering wheel.",How to Prepare Your Car for Towing2," When using a trailer to tow your car, you probably don't have to worry about lights. Make sure before hand that your towing vehicle has a compatible tow wiring receptacle, and have a buddy help you check to make sure all the trailer lights work, including running lights, brake lights, and turn signals. For legal reasons make sure the license plate is illuminated as well.


If your trailer lighting receptacle doesn't match the pigtail on the trailer side, don't fret. Adapters of all kinds and variations can be found through your moving company, or auto parts store.
Tow dollies also have lights as a rule, and will connect to your car’s light in the same manner. Some even have little external lights which can be magnetically mounted to your car's bumper for improved visibility.

, If pulling your car directly with a tow bar, you have a couple options. The magnetic lights mentioned in the previous step can be connected to your tow vehicle's trailer lighting receptacle and placed on the trunk or bumper of the towed car. This helps other cars to see when you are turning or braking.


You can also find wiring kits which let you plug your trailer lights directly into your car, letting you use it's own drive lights to do your signaling. These differ somewhat according to which make, model and year your car is, and can be as simple as plugging in to an available pigtail connector, or may mean some actual re-wiring of your car. Run an online search to determine what kind of lighting your specific car needs.
No matter which method is used, leave your car battery on and leave your running lights on if rolling at night, just for the added visibility. This, however, is not a legal requirement.

, If you can't find or get your hands on external towing lights, or cannot hook up the car's lights to act as trailer lights, leave the battery turned on, and run your hazards. Remember to stop every so often and run the engine on your towed car to keep the battery alive.


This method is fine for a one time emergency day trip but you'll want real trailer lighting if going more than a few miles, and more than once or twice a year.
Sooner or later you will encounter a state patrolman with no tolerance of such shenanigans, and it is absolutely necessary for your safety and the safety of those you share the road with to maintain as much visibility as possible.

, If you are towing your car on a trailer or dolly, all you need to do is lock your steering wheel after you have your front wheels strapped down to the trailer or dolly.


If pulling your car while on the ground (via a tow bar), leave the steering wheel unlocked, so your front wheels can turn a little going around curves. Again, there are some differing opinions, but most people secure the wheel loosely with bungee cords or a bit of rope, to prevent the front wheels from turning too much and getting stuck in a sideways position.
It's also a good idea when towing in this manner to avoid backing up. Front wheels can turn sideways when going backwards and can be damaged in this manner.

Consider using a special towing device.,
Decide to disconnect the axles.,
Get under your car.,
Locate the drive shaft(s), and find where it connects to the differential you want disconnected.,
Use your strap or bungee cord to secure the drive shaft to your undercarriage.,
Remove the four bolts.,
Push the drive shaft up as far as possible.,
Screw the bolts you removed back into the yoke on the differential housing.,
Repeat this process for your other axle, if you have one.,
Tow your car.",How to Prepare Your Car for Towing3," Check with your owners' manual to see what your manufacturer has to say about towing options, to help you decide which methods are compatible and most appropriate for your vehicle. Consider using one of the following devices if you do a lot of car-hauling.


One is a lube pump, which provides lubrication to the automatic transmission, in the same way as normal operation of the car would. This helps to prevent damage to the transmission.
A drive shaft coupling device can be installed on a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Instead of manually disconnecting and removing the drive shaft, this device lets you pull a lever to disconnect your drive shaft without having to get your hands dirty.
An axle-lock is a device not at all dissimilar to the locking hubs found on older 4X4 vehicles, which can allow you to disconnect your wheels from their drive axles, and thus from the transmission.

, This will require getting a little dirty, but if you want to tow your car on its own wheels, it is important to do this. You can also have a mechanic do this for you if you are not confident in your abilities.


The following steps cover how to disconnect the axles by yourself.

, Raise it up if you must, being careful to leave it in park, or with the parking brakes on, wheel chocks or something to keep it from rolling off your jack or ramps. Bring your:


Ratchet set, or wrenches, some spray lube, and a bungee cord, a ratchet strap or some rope when you go under your car.

, Then find the u-joint and on the end of that, the yoke, where four bolts can be found that hold the drive shaft to the differential housing.

, Don't use your exhaust pipes or anything loose; look around to find something solid to connect it to. Don’t tighten this up just yet, but make sure to secure it so that the drive shaft doesn’t fall on to you when you loosen it.

, The wrench or ratchet size you need will vary depending on the make and model of your car, and you might need to knock some dirt off and apply some spray-on lubricant to get them to come loose.


When the last bolt comes loose, use extra caution, as the drive shaft will fall unless it has been properly secured by your bungee chord.

, Adjust your bungee or tighten the strap so there is as little wobble or play as possible. Don't force anything; you just want it up and out of the way and secure enough not to flop around or fall while you are towing the car.

, No need to over-tighten the bolts; you should just put them back in this spot so that they do not get lost in the moving process.


You can also store them in a baggie in your glove box until after you have towed your car to your final destination.

, The main idea here is to get your axles disconnected, and secure the drive shafts(s) well enough that they don't drop and hit pavement while you are towing the car.

, When you get where you are going, use your strap to lower the axle back into range of the yoke so you can get the bolts back in. Check your manual for torque specs, or get those bolts in as securely as you can, and you're ready to drive again.

But the minimum age to apply for your learner's permit is 15 years and 9 months., When you are ready, you will need to take the following information with you to your nearest full-service MVA office:Your parents or legal guardian. This may not just be an older friend. One of your parents must be with you to sign your application.
Proof of identification. You may take a U.S. Passport, or a birth certificate together with a social security card.
Proof of Maryland residence. You need to bring two forms of proof of your residence in Maryland. This could be some combination of utility bills, canceled checks with a printed address, or bank statements to the address.License fee. The fee for a learner’s license is $50. You can pay by credit card, cash, check or money order.
If you are under 16 years old when you are applying for your learner’s permit, then you will also need to have the Learner’s Permit School Attendance Certification Form. You can download this form online at http://www.mva.maryland.gov/_resources/docs/DL-300.pdf or pick one up from the MVA office. You may also be able to get one from your school’s office or guidance office. The form must be completed and signed by someone at your school. You then need to deliver it, in a sealed envelope, to the MVA official when you go for your learner’s permit.

, When you report to the MVA for your learner’s permit, you will take a written knowledge test and a vision test.


Written knowledge test. This will cover information that is in the Maryland Driver’s Manual regarding rules of the road and requirements for driving. The test consists of 25 questions and is administered on a computer. You will need a passing score of 85% in order to pass.Vision test. To pass the vision screening, you must be able to score at least 20/40 eyesight in each eye, and a continuous field of vision (peripheral vision) of at least 140 degrees. A restricted license may be available for people with eyesight of 20/70 and field of vision of 110 degrees.

, With your learner's permit, you may drive only with a licensed driver over age 21 sitting in the seat next to you and you may not use any cell phone, whether hands-free or not, while driving., This may be a class sponsored by your high school, taught by a private company, or taught by your parents. If you parents teach you, they will need to meet all state requirements and submit a statement of compliance. This class must consist of at least 30 hours of classroom training, and 6 hours of on-the-road instruction.You must have your learner’s permit before you are allowed to begin the driving training portion of any class.

, With your learner’s permit, you must have a licensed adult over age 21 in the car with you, and you must keep a log of the hours you drive. At least 10 hours must be night driving, and the MVA recommends that you try to spend at least some time practicing driving in poor weather.If you are over 25, you must still complete a practice log, but you are only required to show 14 hours of practice driving.
The MVA publishes a “Rookie Driver: New Driver and Coach Practice Guide.” This Guide contains a form that you can use to record your practice hours. You will need to take that log with you when you return to the MVA office for your provisional license.

, The purpose of the learner's permit is to give you the opportunity to drive, with a qualified adult in the car, and practice your driving skills before getting a provisional license. You are encouraged to get as much practice as you can during these nine months, so when you go for your driving skills test, you will have had plenty of practice., Because you must drive with a learner's permit for at least nine months, and the earliest you can get it is 15 years and nine months, then the earliest possible age for the provisional license is 16 years and six months old. This provisional license will be the one you use until you turn 18.You must hold the learner's permit for a minimum of 9 months. If you have any driving infractions during this time, your provisional license will be delayed.

, The driving skills test is a test of your ability to operate a car on the public roadways. If you have logged the required 60 hours of practice time, you should be ready for the driving test.


You should come to the driving test with a vehicle that is in good operating condition and has at least a half-tank of gas.
For your own comfort, this should be the vehicle that you spent most of the time practicing in.
You and your parent (or other responsible adult whose car you are using) must complete and sign the Certification of Insurance and Authorization to Operate Vehicle. This form certifies that the car you will be using for the driving test is in good condition and is insured., With a provisional license, the following rules apply:You may only drive between 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m., unless a licensed driver over 21 years old is with you, or you are driving to or from a job, official school activity, volunteer program or athletic event.

Ensure that the person in the photo and the person in front of you are the same.This seems obvious, but many people using fake IDs hope that the person checking them will be too busy to look closely at the photo.;
, One trick of fake IDs is to use another person’s expired ID card or license. Check the card to make sure that it is not expired. Check to see that the type is consistent and hasn’t been tampered with., In many states, driver’s licenses for minors are formatted vertically, while those for people over 21 are horizontal., Microprint is a type style that is so small that it appears as a straight line to the naked eye. It is only visible with a special magnifier. Currently, 48 states use microprint as a security feature., A fake ID is likely to be of poor quality plastic, may show signs of tampering or “splitting,” and is likely to bend or fold more easily than a genuine one., State-issued driver's licenses carry an image that flashes in the light. Fake licenses may attempt to replicate this by printing a dim image in the background with a bright color."

You can find a list of automobile repossession laws in every state at http://www.creditinfocenter.com/legal/auto-repossession-laws.shtml, along with links to each state's law.;
, Unless your lender has a dedicated line for repossessions, you typically can call the lender's general customer service number.If you've previously dealt with a certain individual, you may want to speak with him or her first. Having an existing relationship with the representative may help your case.
Ask your lender for a reinstatement quote. Your lender will send you a written notice with the reinstatement quote and the amount of money you must pay to bring your loan current.
If you live in a state that provides you with the right to reinstatement, you're on better footing – even if reinstatement is not included in your loan agreement. Make sure you read up on your state's law and understand your rights before you call.
Keep in mind that even in states with laws that give you the right to reinstate your loan, you have an extremely short period of time – typically 15 days – after your car has been repossessed to request reinstatement., If the lender is unwilling to negotiate with you, an experienced consumer rights or debt attorney may be able to help you work with the lender to get your car back.To find an attorney, look for a consumer debt or credit attorney who is licensed to practice in your area. Many local bar associations have searchable directories on their websites.
Bar associations also often have attorney referral programs, where you describe your situation and are matched with attorneys who are best able to help you.
Many attorneys are willing to provide a free consultation, so you don't have anything to lose in at least talking to someone, even if you ultimately decide you cannot afford an attorney.
However, keep in mind that an attorney's fees may be outweighed by the fees you would pay to the lender and the repossession lot to get your car back.
In some instances, an attorney may be able to get late fees dropped, get the repossession fees dropped, or work with the lender to adjust your interest rate or refinance your car on terms that are more affordable to you.

, If you don't have enough money to cover the back payments, you may be able to arrange for a partial reinstatement or a new payment plan.When you receive a reinstatement quote, it typically is only good for a couple of weeks. Check the notice for the deadline.
If you are unable to pay the amount required to bring the loan current, ask about a partial reinstatement. This will enable you to get your car back without paying everything you owe.
For example, suppose you haven't made your $200 car payment in three months, so you owe your lender $600. You are able to pay $300 of that. Your reinstatement quote requires monthly payments of $225. If you can pay $275 for six months, you can offer to spread out the back payments and pay them along with your regular loan payment.
As much as you want to get your car back, make sure you're not getting in over your head. Don't offer a monthly amount that you doubt you'll be able to pay on a regular basis.
Keep in mind that even if your state gives you the right to reinstate your car loan, you may lose that right if your car is repossessed a second time., Unless your lender has agreed to an alternate arrangement, you typically must pay all of the overdue payments upfront along with fees to have your loan reinstated.Your reinstatement quote should include the amount of money you must pay your lender to bring your car loan current. There may be late fees and penalties included in this amount.
If you've negotiated an alternative deal with your lender, you may want to ask for another written statement of the amount now due to reinstate your loan.
Make sure you have in writing the amount you have to pay before you send payment to your lender.
Take a hard look at your budget, and make your monthly car payment a priority. After your car has been repossessed once, you may have less leeway if you miss a payment again.
In some cases the repossession fees will be included in the payment you make to your lender. If they aren't, you can expect to pay these fees at the lot when you pick up your car.

, If you are significantly behind on other bills, or are having difficulty budgeting monthly payments, a licensed credit counselor can assist you in making your bills more manageable.The U.S. Trustee Program has a searchable list of approved credit counseling agencies available at http://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111. If you decide to use a credit counseling service, choose one from this list to avoid being charged excessive fees.
The credit counseling service will send you free information regarding the process so you can determine if it would benefit you.
A credit counselor will look at your entire financial situation and help you work with your creditors to create a debt management program that fits in your budget and will help get you out of debt.

, If your reinstatement comes with different terms than applied to the original loan, you may have to sign a new loan agreement.


Read your loan agreement carefully before you sign it, and make sure you understand the amount of your payments each month and how many months are left on your loan.
Also make sure you understand the interest rate being charged and what will happen if you get the loan refinanced or pay it off early.
If you can afford to do so, you may want to set up automatic payments with your lender. The amount of your car loan will be withdrawn from your bank account each month on the due date.

, The address where your car is being kept typically will be on the repossession notice you received.If you haven't received a repossession notice yet, you can probably find out the location of your car by calling your lender.

, You will need to bring identification documents such as a driver's license, as well as documents that prove you are allowed to take back the car.Make sure you have your original retail installment sales contract as well as your new reinstatement contract and copies of all communication between you and the lender.
If you receive any written notices assuring you of your right to reclaim your car, bring copies of those as well. You also should bring proof of your payment.
You typically will need to bring your driver's license and proof of insurance before the lot custodian will allow you to drive your car off the property.
Keep the name and direct phone number of the person you worked with to have your loan reinstated. If you have any trouble getting your car back, you will need to call that person and have them talk to the lot attendant.

, Because auction lots can charge holding and repossession fees that may add up to several hundred dollars, you should call the lot before you go and find out how much you'll be charged.Find out what methods of payment are acceptable. Keep in mind many of these lots will want a money order or cashier's check and won't accept a credit card.
In addition to towing, the lot where your car is being kept will charge a holding fee for each day it sits on the lot before it is sold. If the car had been sold, these fees typically would have been passed on to the individual who bought the car at auction.
In some cases you can get the repossession fees waived. You might want to consider talking to a bankruptcy or consumer rights lawyer about your options – especially if the fees on top of the amount you already paid the lender will put you in a bind.
When you call the lot, ask what documents will be necessary for you to reclaim your car. Make sure you have everything listed so you won't run into any problems.
Write down exactly what you need when you speak to the lot attendant, and repeat the list back to confirm it. Also get the name of the person with whom you spoke.

, You'll typically want to get a friend to drive you to the lot so you can complete any necessary paperwork and retrieve your car.Keep in mind that it may take up to a week for your car to be ready for you. This doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have problems getting your car back, but keep in touch with your lender and with the lot until the car is back in your possession. Don't just wait for a call.
Once you're at the lot, be ready to call your lender if the lot attendant refuses to give you your car back.
When you get your car, check for any personal items you may have kept in the car before you drive off the lot. You have a right to these items, and if they've been removed from the car the lot custodian or your lender should be able to tell you how you can retrieve them.

If other financial circumstances have changed, consider refinancing.",How to Refinance a Car1," Those who are behind on payments for an auto loan may find it more difficult to refinance a car or other vehicle. It sounds obvious, but it's worth stressing: Getting current sends lenders a signal that you're serious about repaying the value of your car loan.;
, Call the bank, dealer or other party who currently holds your auto financing loan and ask for the pay-off amount. This value will be part of the information that you give to other lenders in order to put together a refinancing package.

, If it has improved, apply for refi. In many cases, a better credit score results in better offers for loan refinancing. Individuals with poor credit scores under 600 can have trouble finding good refinancing deals. But on the other hand, some experts say that these are the people who could benefit most from lowering their interest rates.


If your credit score has improved just 50 points from what it was when you agreed to the original car loan, you should attempt to get your loan refinanced.An improvement of 50 points in your credit score can save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.There are many tips on how to improve your credit score, including reducing your debt to credit ratio, paying off other outstanding debts, getting rewarded for seniority, and disputing erroneous charges to your credit card.

, When you borrow money, you're expected to pay back the original sum of the loan plus a little bit of interest for the privilege of being given the loan. Interest rates are largely determined by a federal committee, depending on the current economic climate.If interest rates have come down since you applied for your car loan, it's worth trying to refinance — chances are that you'll pay less money in interest payments if the interest rates have gone down.

, Many people look at their monthly payment as the bottom line when it comes to their auto loan. They neglect to realize that the longer their loan, the more money they'll eventually pay in interest payments, even if their monthly payments are relatively low.Be sure, therefore, to pay attention to the length of the loan in addition to the monthly payments.


If your loan is anywhere from 5 to 8 years long, it's probably a good idea to try to refinance and reduce the length of your loan. Even if refinancing only lowers your monthly payment by $10, paying off your loan two years earlier will result in significant savings over time.

, Lenders are weary of refinancing older cars because the car itself becomes less valuable as collateral if the loan isn't fully paid. For instance, a 2009 Jetta is much easier to refinance than a 2001 Camry, because the value of the Jetta is probably much higher than the value of the Camry. You're more likely to get good terms if refinancing a newer car than you will trying to refinance an older car.

, If you've come on a rough spell lately and cash is tight, trying to refi is worth it. If you think the terms of your original loan make bad financial sense or are predatory, those are other good reasons to refi. Do not refinance your auto loan, however, if:


There are prepayment or other fees associated with paying off your loan early or switching over to a new lender. These fees make it financially onerous to refinance, which is why they exist in the first place.
Refinancing would extend the life of your loan. You may save a little bit of money in your monthly payments, but extending the life of your loan will cause you to pay more money in overall interest payments. This makes refinancing a bad idea if your aim is to save money.

Determine if your credit rating has improved since you took out your original loan.,
Review the information on the credit report to verify that it is correct.,
Take action to improve your credit rating.,
Apply for a refinanced loan.",How to Reduce the Monthly Car Payments You Are Paying1," Lending institutions, like banks, use credit ratings. The rating is used to evaluate the risk of lending to a particular borrower. The rating may also be referred to as a credit score.Your credit rating is determined by information reported to credit bureaus. Your lenders (banks and credit card companies) report information to credit bureaus. That information includes data on your loan balances and payment history. The data is used to calculate a credit rating. The higher your rating is, the more likely that you will get approval for your loan.
Experian, Equifax and TransUnion are three main credit bureaus that are frequently used by lenders.You can get your credit report once a year for free. However, the report does not contain your credit score. This article explains how to check the score itself: Check Your Credit Score.;
, Say, for example, that your credit card company reported a late payment. You actually made the payment on time.


Ask the bureau what documentation they need to correct your credit report.
Contact the lender who reported the incorrect data. In this example, your bank statements would prove that you made the payment on time. The date of the payment will be posted in your bank activity. Ask the credit card company to correct the information reported to the credit bureau. Keep documentation of that correction.
Ask your lender what credit rating they used when your loan was approved. That rating may be in your loan documents. Compare that rating to your current credit rating. If you rating has improved, you may be able to refinance your loan.

, If your credit rating has not improved, wait to apply for refinancing. If you don’t have a higher rating, you may not get your refinancing approved. Instead, make the effort to improve your credit rating.Continue to use credit. Using credit wisely proves to a lender that you’re a reliable borrower who will pay on time. For example, you should use credit cards for some of your purchases.
Make payments on time. It’s critical that you pay every debt on time. The timely payments will build your credit history.
Lenders are not obligated to report all credit transactions to credit bureaus. As you use debt responsibly, make sure the information is reported to credit bureaus. Ask your lender to report the data. Review your credit bureau information to make sure the information was posted.

, In addition to your personal credit rating, another big factor in your loan is the interest rate. If interest rates have declined, you are more likely to refinance your loan at a lower interest rate. On the other hand, if interest rates have increased, you may not be able to lower your car payments by refinancing. Regardless of your credit rating, higher rates may eliminate refinancing as an option.The loan balance you are refinancing needs to be less than the current value of your car. Remember that the car serves as collateral for the loan. If you defaulted on your loan, the lender would take ownership of the vehicle. If the loan balance is higher than the value of the car, the lender would lose money when they sell the car.
Approach several lenders about applying for a refinanced loan. You may be able to lower your interest rate if you check with more than one lender.
Your credit rating is impacted by the number of times you access your credit report. A credit rating is also affected each time you apply for a loan. Keep this in mind as you work on refinancing. Your lender can help you limit this activity.

Pay off your overdue car payments.",How to Redeem Your Repossessed Car," After the lender repossesses the car, it should send you some notices in the mail. One notice should inform you of how you can redeem your car. The notice should also tell you the deadline for redeeming the car and the redemption amount. If you don’t receive this notice within five days of repossession, then contact the lender.You must get the full amount in order to redeem the car. Redemption is not “reinstatement.” When you reinstate a loan, you pay any missed monthly payments. The loan then continues on as usual. With redemption, you must pay the entire balance of the loan.
Note the deadline and commit to getting the full amount before then. You have no right to reinstatement, so redemption might be your only way of getting the car back.;
, It can’t hurt to call up the lender and ask if you could redeem the car for less than the price the lender is asking.The lender will have to sell your car at auction, and there is always a chance that the only buyer will make a low offer. The lender could lose money on the sale.


The lender might be asking for $7,500, but you might only be able to gather together $6,000. If so, you should call and explain your situation.

, You probably don’t have the money to redeem your vehicle. If you did, you wouldn’t have missed your monthly payments in the first place.Accordingly, you need to try and get a loan for the full redemption amount. Your friends and family might be able to forward you some money.


Try to get a loan interest-free or low interest. For example, if the redemption price is $10,000, then your monthly payments on a five-year loan will be about $175 a month with a two percent interest rate. However, if your interest rate is eight percent, then you would end up paying almost $200 a month.
Talk to your family and friends. They might be willing to loan you the money for a low interest rate (or without charging interest at all). If they agree to loan you money, then you should draft a loan document.

, If your friends or family won’t loan to you, then you should seek a low-interest loan from other sources. Look into loans from local credit unions.


Before taking out any loan, make sure that you can make the monthly payments. There is no reason to take out another loan if you will only default on repayments in the future.
To calculate your monthly car payment, you can use one of the many calculators on the Internet. Plug in the amount of the loan, the length of the loan, and the interest rate. You will then get a monthly payment amount., You should promptly notify the lender of your intent to redeem the car. Your right to redeem will end once the car is sold, so you need to reach out to the lender quickly.Typically, lenders hold onto cars for only 10-15 days before selling them at auction.You shouldn’t take too much time.
The notice you receive might tell you how to notify the creditor. For example, you might need to send a letter certified mail. Always follow the method stated in the notice.

, You might need to pay the lender using a certified check or a cashier’s check. These are more secure forms of payment than a personal check. You can get them at a bank.


With a certified check, a bank officer certifies that you had enough money in your account to cover the check on the date the officer certified it.With a cashier’s check, the funds are moved from your account to the bank’s own escrow account. The check is then drawn on the bank’s account.

, You should contact the lender and find out where to take your check. Also ask who you should meet with and the specific process for redeeming the vehicle.


Try to redeem the car a few days before the auction date. Once the car is sold, it’s gone. You don’t want to wait until the morning of the auction only to miss a bus, have your car break down, or get sick.

, You may need to complete some paperwork in order to redeem the car. The lender should let you know. Try to get a copy of any form you fill out.


Also get a receipt for the money you are handing over. This receipt will serve as proof that you have legally redeemed the car.
You may also have to go to the police department and get a “redemption release,” which costs a small fee. You then must take this lease to the repossession agency., Once you have paid and completed all paperwork, you should be able to go to the agency that repossessed your car and get the car back. Show them the paperwork that you got from the lender and the police.

, Go through your paperwork and check to see how much you owe in unpaid monthly payments. You might be able to get the lender to agree to let you keep the car and reinstate the original loan if you cure any default.


For example, if you missed three rent payments before the lender repossessed your car, and each payment was $300, then you would need to pay $900 to get the original loan reinstated. You might also owe late charges and interest.
Once the loan is reinstated, you would then make a monthly rent payment. Reinstatement is usually more feasible than redemption because you can pay the loan off a little at a time each month.

, You will need to pay off all owed car payments. Accordingly, you need to come up with the money—and quickly. Make sure that you have the money in hand before calling the lender to ask for reinstatement.


Pool all available money that you have. Think about selling possessions you need less than the car. For example, you could sell exercise equipment, electronic equipment, or musical instruments. You can take them to a pawn shop or advertise on Craigslist.
You also could get an unsecured personal loan from a bank or credit union. You will need to have a good credit score in order to get a personal loan with a low interest rate.This might be difficult if the repossession has already been reported on your credit report.
You also might be able to get a short-term loan from family and friends. Although they might not have been willing to loan you a huge amount to redeem the car, they might be more willing to offer a smaller loan to help you get the loan reinstated.

, You should call the phone number on the notice your lender sent. Because time is of the essence, you shouldn’t delay. Instead, call the lender and ask if you can reinstate the loan instead of redeeming the car.


Be honest about your past financial difficulties, but explain why you are in a better position to make payments again. If you can convince the lender that your financial difficulties were temporary, you will be more successful negotiating.Offer to show the lender proof of your improved financial position. For example, you might have recently gotten a job. Offer to show the lender your employment letter.

, If the lender agrees to reinstate the loan, then coordinate how you can pay off your overdue car payments. Also ask how you can pick up your car.

If you do online banking, this information can be found under your account summary. Alternately, you can review your mailed monthly statement.;
, You can request this from your financial institution in person or by logging in to your personal account on your lender's website. Speak directly with a loan adviser or review the terms and conditions of your loan to determine if penalties apply for paying the car loan off quickly.


Some banks or financial institutions may charge you fees or penalties for paying off the car loan sooner than the original life of the loan, especially if you cause them to lose money in interest. These are typically called ""prepayment penalties.""

, You can find online loan payoff calculators at Bankrate.com or MortgageLoan.com where you can plug in your loan's interest rate, monthly payment and payoff amount. Then you will be able to compare how much you can save by paying the car off in one lump sum, making payments twice a month, or increasing the amount of your monthly payments.If there are penalties for paying off your car loan early, compare the savings you calculated with the amount of the penalties. Then you will know if you will save money by paying off your loan early.

, Your loan adviser may be able to educate you on the most beneficial way for you to pay off your car loan faster, especially if penalties apply. For example, ask your lender if they can decrease the balance of your car loan if you can pay the remaining balance in one lump sum.In some cases, lenders may lower the remaining balance of your car loan substantially if you can pay off the remaining balance with just one payment.

, Some lenders may only charge you a fixed monthly interest, which can allow you to apply additional payments toward the principal amount. However, other lenders may charge you interest on every payment you make. Ask your lender if you can make additional payments toward the principal amount of the loan without having to pay interest. If so, you can plan to make small, additional payments toward the loan each month and pay less in interest over the life of the loan.


An example of the difference between the kinds of interest you pay is: if you have a $100 payment due every month with $4 interest that means you pay $104 per month. What you need to find out is if that $4 is a fixed amount per month, which would mean no matter how much you might pay on the principal ($100, $200, $300) you still pay just $4 monthly interest. If, however, they charge interest on every payment, you would end up paying 4% interest on whatever you are putting down on the principal -- $8 if you chose to pay $200 instead of $100, for example.
Even if you have to pay interest on each payment, it is usually worth your while to make extra principal payments to pay your loan off faster.

, Use a check or pay online to make an extra payment per month, that is separate from your regular car loan payment. Write “Principal Only” on the check so that the lender will not count it toward your loan payment for the next month.If you are paying online, pay the extra principal amount before you are billed for the next month.

, Instead of making one monthly payment, split it in half and make payments every two weeks. This typically works out to twice per month, but by the end of the year you will have made two more biweekly payments (one full payment) because most months are longer than an exact 4 weeks. In other words, make 26 half payments per year (every other week for 52 weeks) that will equal 13 full payments, rather than the 12 you would've otherwise paid. This means that the total amount you owe will go down faster, saving you interest on the loan., Extra income such as tax refunds, bonuses from your job, or cash gifts from birthdays or holidays could be applied to your car loan, resulting in a faster payoff. You will be paying more in interest on your car loan than you would earn in a savings or money market account., If you have the time outside your normal work hours, consider starting a side business in order to generate additional money to pay down your car loan. Examples of side businesses are:


Rent out a room in your home. This could be for a student or someone staying in your town temporarily for a job. You can advertise this on your local craigslist.com.
Mow lawns and/or shovel snow.
Run errands for elderly people or busy professionals.
Buy china, artwork, tools, jewelry, books, etc. for low prices at estate sales and flea markets and then sell them on eBay.
Offer at-home party sales. Check out Tupperware, Pampered Chef, Longaberger baskets, Silpada jewelry, Mary Kay cosmetics, Cabi clothing and The Happy Gardener. If you organize a sales team you’ll be able to reap a percent of their profits as well.

, If you have paid off one of your credit cards, for example, continue to pay that former monthly amount toward your car loan. Then you won't be tempted to spend it on other things.

, Make a list of your monthly income and expenses, including expenses that occur only once or twice a year. Then you will be able to see if you have extra cash at the end of the month to pay down your car loan. If you don't have extra cash, look for areas where you can cut expenses.Eliminate expenses you do not need such as cable television channels or a landline telephone. The money you apply to costs such as these can be applied toward your car loan instead.
Seek lower rates on mandatory expenses and bills such as auto insurance, internet bills, or cell phone bills by consulting with each of your service providers for bundled or promotional rates. You can get auto insurance quotes online to compare to your current policy.
Lower your food expenses by cooking or preparing meals at home rather than eating out in restaurants. In most cases, a specific meal will cost significantly more if you purchase it from a restaurant than if you buy the meal or ingredients from a grocery store.

, Banks will often have much better deals than car dealerships, so look at the loans offered at your bank. Talk to a bank employee about how the loans work, how much interest and what kind they charge, and if there are prepayment penalties. If you choose to take out a car loan with your bank, make sure to take the information about the bank and the loan to the car dealership so that they have the information.

, Now that you've learned how to pay off a car loan faster, you know how detrimental it is if there are prepayment penalties. There are many choices of where to take out a car loan, so next time make sure you choose a financial institution that does not require prepayment penalties.

, The fastest way to pay off a loan is to not take one out in the first place. If you were paying $300 a month for your car loan and the loan is now paid off, continue to put this amount in a savings or money market account. Then when you are ready to buy your next car you can pay in cash for a large down payment or the entire amount.

, If you have started to make and follow a budget while cutting expenses, keep up these good habits. Put any money you save into a money market account to earn interest. Or if you don't plan on buying a new car for 3-5 years, you could invest this money in a certificate of deposit (CD). Then you will be able to make a large down payment or not have to take out a loan for your next car."

Lease buyout loans are essentially used car loans, and often charge a higher interest rate than a new car loan would. This interest rate increases as the applicant's credit score decreases, so understand that you will pay more if your credit score is low.


Your credit score can be accessed for free one time per year at Annualcreditreport.com.;
, In order to buyout your lease, you will need to qualify for a lease buyout loan. Like with most loan types, you will need to prove your ability to repay the loan. Specifically, you will usually need a FICO credit score of over 650. In addition, you will have to be current on your lease payments and have a good payment history on the lease so far.


You can apply for a lease buyout loan at the end of your lease or before. However, buying out your lease early is typically more expensive than waiting until the end., While you may be able to negotiate loan terms like a down payment or the interest rate, it is unlikely that you will be able to negotiate the ""residual value"" of your vehicle. The residual value represents the purchase price of your vehicle at the end of the lease. This value may be higher or lower than the actual market price of the vehicle. However, this value is typically defined in the lease contract and cannot typically be negotiated., The purchase-option fee is a fee charged when a leaseholder buys the leased vehicle. This fee is usually $300 to $600, but may differ based on the residual value of the vehicle and specific lease terms. The purchase-option fee can be found in your lease agreement. This amount is added to the residual value of the vehicle to arrive at the buyout price.


Unlike the residual value, you may be able to reduce or eliminate the purchase-option fee by negotiating with the lender., Don't call your leasing company about buying out your loan. They will call you before your lease is up to see whether or not you are planning to turn in or buy your leased car. The call means that they are motivated to sell the car and that you will likely be able to negotiate the purchase price and/or the interest rate on a buyout loan., While you are awaiting the leasing company's call, you should shop around for buyout loans. This will allow you to get the best rate possible. Even if you don't go with one of these loans, this will give you a starting point for negotiations with your original leasing company. Look for better rates by contacting local banks and credit unions. You may also be able to get a good rate by using an online financing company. Just make sure that the online company is legitimate first by searching for reviews and complaints from past borrowers.


When you've located low rates, get pre-approved for the loan so that you can show the loan rates to your lender.Work with the lender to apply for pre-approval. You will be asked to provide personal and financial information and the lender will check your credit report. If you're approved, you'll be given a loan limit and interest rate.Make sure to specify that you are seeking a lease buyout loan when applying for loans., When your lender does call, you can increase your negotiating position by saying that you want to buy the car, but are turning it in because the cost of buying it out is too high. It is unlikely, but the lender might be able to lower the residual price.


Try saying something like, ""I would consider buying out the lease if the residual price were lower. I think the car is worth less than what you are charging for it.""Again, it is unlikely that the lender will reduce the residual price. Many lenders refuse to do so as a matter of policy. However, you don't lose anything by asking.

, If you can't get your residual price lowered, you can still reduce the buyout price of the leased vehicle. In many cases, the lender will be able to lower the purchase-option fee, reducing the cost of buying the car.Try telling the lender, ""The purchase-option price is too high for me to justify buying out the lease.""

, If you were pre-approved for a lower interest rate than your leasing company offers, tell them. They want to earn your business and will likely make an effort to lower the interest rate on the buyout loan. If they don't, however, you still have your pre-approval for the cheaper loan and can go with that one instead. Your leasing company cannot stop you from switching lenders when you get a lease buyout., A buy out is just one of your options at the end of a lease. You can also just end the lease by making your final payment and returning the car. If you are ready to move on or don't like the car any more, this is a perfectly reasonable way to end the lease. However, you may also choose to buy the vehicle at the end of your lease. Do this if you want to keep driving it or if you have incurred excessive damages or wear on the vehicle during your lease. Buying the vehicle will help you avoid paying damage or wear fees.You can also break your lease early. See how to break a car lease for more details.

, The leasing company will often calculate your side of the costs based on a ""residual value,"" which is basically the beginning value of the vehicle minus depreciation figures. The total buyout cost is this amount plus your purchase-option fee. You can then determine whether or not the buyout is a good deal by comparing the buyout cost and the market value of the vehicle.


To calculate market value, start with your car's blue book value. Use sites like Kelley, NAPA, Edmunds and more to find real market values for your vehicle.
Then, consider any damage or excessive wear. If the vehicle has sustained a lot of wear during the lease, it may be worth less than its book value., In a lot of cases, the residual value for your vehicle will be higher than its market value. This means that in buying out your lease, you will be overpaying for the car. At this point, you can consider simply ending your lease (either early or on time) and shopping around for a similar car. Because the residual on your current lease is higher than the market value, you may even be able to find a used car that is nicer than your leased car (a year newer or with more options, for example) and still costs less than the residual value., If you've decided to buyout your lease, you still have two options to choose from: an early buyout or a lease-end buyout. The lease-end buyout is simply a purchase of the vehicle at its residual value at the end of the lease. The early buyout, however, is more complicated. The amount that you owe the lender in an early buyout is calculated by the lender as some combination of the residual value and the amount you owe on the lease.


With an early buyout, the lender may recalculate what you owe and have paid such that your lease payments up to the buyout will be applied towards finance charges. This then increases the balance you owe on the lease, which increases how much you will have to pay to buy it out.
In most cases, it is cheaper to wait until the end of your lease to buy it out."

Shop around for refinancing deals.,
Send approval to the appropriate parties.,
Pay off the old loan with a check from the new lender.,
Try this refinance strategy if you can afford paying the extra money.,
Watch out for shady auto refinancing lenders.",How to Refinance a Car2," Ask potential lenders what kinds of interest rates they would be able to agree on if taking over your existing loan. The more lenders you look at, the better your chances of securing a better deal.


Some good sites to poke around on include: LendingTree.com, Eloan.com, Bankrate.com, Credit.com, and Capital One Auto Finance.
Always evaluate fees versus savings. When it comes to a refinancing plan, there may be fees or other up-front costs. The borrower will have to weigh these against the eventual savings that they get from refinancing with a lower interest rate. In general, a refinancing deal should include at least 1 percent less interest in order to be financially beneficial for the borrower. However, this all has to do with the amount that needs to be paid off, the interest rate on that amount and other factors present in the agreement.

, When you have agreed on a refinancing deal with a new lender, get that information to your old lender and any other involved parties. This allows you to get the lien on your vehicle transferred and effectively get free of your old loan.

, Wait for a check from the new lender for the current debt amount of your old loan. When it comes it the mail, use it to pay off the old lender. Now you can begin paying off the new loan, which will be set at the same debt amount.


Pay any associated fees. In order to make the refinancing effective, you'll need to pay any costs associated with administering this deal. These include prepayment fees, especially.

, Say that you close a deal on a refi to lower the monthly payment as well as the life of the loan. Instead of paying the new monthly payment, continue paying the old monthly payment. What this does is shorten your loan, ultimately giving you more savings on your car., Some firms may seek high up-front costs without actually sealing a refinancing deal. Hold your cards close until you see the details of a refinancing offer for a vehicle.

Pay down some of your loan’s principal.,
Consolidate your car loan with other debts.,
Sell your car and buy a less expensive vehicle.",How to Reduce the Monthly Car Payments You Are Paying2," If you pay off some of your loan balance, your total interest costs will decline. You may be able to get a smaller monthly payment, even if interest rates are the same. When you pay down your principal, you can contact your lender about restructuring the loan.Assume that you have a $10,000 car loan and an 8% interest rate. Your loan has 4 years remaining.
You decide to pay down $2,000 of the $10,000 balance. You ask your lender if the monthly payments can be reduced, since your new loan balance is only $8,000.
Even if your interest rate remains at 8%, your monthly loan payments may be lower.

, You may be able to refinance a group of loans with new loan terms. Your monthly payment on one larger loan may be lower after consolidating several smaller loans.Meet with a lender to talk through the pros and cons of a consolidation loan. A consolidation can help you lower the interest rate on your debts. However, you need to consider the risks of a variable rate loan, or extending the term of a loan.Say that you have a $10,000 car loan at 8%. You also have three credit card balances totaling $6,000. The average interest rate on your three cards is 12%.
Two factors may lower your interest rate on these loans. If interest rates have declined, or if your credit rating has improved, you may be able to lower the interest rate for these consolidated debts.
Having one consolidated payment to make each month also simplifies things for you. When you create your monthly budget, you don’t need to account for so many payments.

, A good way to reduce your payments is to make payments on a cheaper car. This is another way to reduce your payment, even if interest rates have not declined.The car you sell must be worth more than the loan balance. If not, you may need to pay for the difference out of your own pocket.
Assume that your loan is for $9,500, and your car is worth $10,000. When you sell your car, you can use the $500 profit as a down payment on a $6,500 car.
The $6,000 loan balance reduces your required monthly car payment.

Use other sources of transportation.,
Take out a home equity loan.",How to Reduce the Monthly Car Payments You Are Paying3," Using a lease means that you are making payments to essentially rent a car for a certain time period. You do not own the car at the end of the lease. The lender may give you the option of buying the car at a specific price.Assume that you lease a $20,000 car for 4 years.
The lease payment will be based on an amount less than the car’s total value. Say, for example, that the payments total $15,000. Since the lease payment total is less than the total value of the car, your monthly payments are smaller.
At the end of the lease, the car will have some remaining market value. You may have the option to buy the car. If you don’t buy it, the lender may sell the car to someone else.

, If you move to an area with a good bus, train or subway system, you may decide not to use a car. You can use the money you would normally spend on a car for some other purpose.Make a judgment about your access to public transportation. Think about how long it takes to get to your subway system, for example. Consider how much longer it will take you to travel.
If you do own a car in a city, you should consider the costs you’ll incur to park your vehicle. That cost can be expensive in a big city.

For this reason, it is important to request your credit report, check it for errors, and dispute any errors you find.  The FTC has found that in about 50% of cases, this leads to an increase in one's credit score.;
, Most banks, credit unions, and other lenders that pre-approve borrowers for financing require a minimum monthly pre-tax income of $1500, as well as a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 45% or less. You may not be able to boost your income in the short term, but you can improve your DTI by paying off credit card debts and the like.

, The various credit scoring models now take into account the practice of ""rate-shopping,"" meaning the submission of multiple applications for the same type of loan in order to compare interest rates from various lenders. Depending on the scoring model being utilized, multiple credit inquiries within a 14-45 day period are only counted as a single inquiry. Typically it is best to start with a bank or credit union with whom you have an existing relationship, then compare the rates offered with other lenders in your area. If you have a credit score of 680 or lower, you may need to consider alternative lenders that fund subprime auto loans.

,  Since you have not yet picked out the specific vehicle you want, many lenders will give you a ""blank check"" to bring to the dealer lot. In reality, this document pre-approves you up to specific, predetermined loan amount. Also, your vehicle will, most likely, need to meet specific guidelines in terms of age and mileage. For some major lenders, the limits are 7 years or 70,000 miles.  Once you choose your vehicle, you give your ""blank check"" to the dealer, and they finalize the lending arrangements with your bank, credit union, or finance company.

,  Just because you were able to arrange your loan ahead of time doesn't guarantee that you were offered the very best rate. This is particularly true if you have very good credit, as many dealers work with ""captive"" finance companies that offer special low rate or even 0% financing. There is no harm in seeing what APR rate the dealer can offer you through its own network of lenders, as long as you keep in mind any added down payment requirements.

, All reputable auto lenders now require consumers to carry a full coverage insurance policy on the financed vehicle. This ensures that the at least part of the loan balance will be recouped in the event of an at-fault accident that totals the vehicle. If you provided a down payment of less than 20%, giving you a high loan-to-value ratio (LTV), you may also be required to carry GAP (Guaranteed Auto Protection) insurance. This covers the difference between the amount the vehicle is worth as an insurance loss and the remaining balance on the loan.

, This is the fun part! With all of the paperwork handled, you can drive your vehicle home. Keep in mind that your bank or lender will have a lien on the vehicle's title until it is paid off, but the car is now, effectively, yours!

One of their suggested options will be to make the payments by automatic withdrawal of the car payment funds from your bank account. They go directly to your loan account at a prearranged date and show that you are paid for the month.
See what the purchase contracts say about payment methods. They should list the varied ways to pay. You will have a payment book with most loans. Start there and look for instructions.;
, While you can make the occasional change, you will probably stick to one or the other each month as a rule of habit.


Send a check to the address shown on your payment coupon. You need to include the coupon, which contains the loan number, with the check.
Call your payment in directly to the phone number given on your loan paperwork. You will need to give your debit or credit card number as payment.
Pull up the loan servicer online and set up a secure account. Most lenders provide a safe page for buyers to make payments. Log in and pay the car payment automatically by inputting your debit or credit card information. You will receive a verification number and email, which should be saved.
Set up automatic payments through your bank so that the payment is sent to the lender at a certain time each month. This method is done through your bank and differs from automatic payments.

To do this, you'll need to figure out what your car is currently worth. For a quick estimate of your car's value, use an online valuation service like Kelley Blue Book or NADA Used Car Guides. These free sites can quickly and easily provide you with an estimate based on your car's make, model, and condition.


You may also want to search classified ads and visit used car dealerships to see what price your car (or similar cars) are fetching.
To get a more precise value for your car, know your car's mileage as well as any optional features (power windows, sunroof, etc.) that it's equipped with. Generally, a higher mileage corresponds to a lower value, while optional features can modestly boost a car's value.;
, Depending on how many payments you've made on your car and/or how your car's value has fluctuated, it may, in fact, be worth more than the amount you still owe on your loan. In this case, you can sell your car and use the profits to pay off the remainder of your loan. You'll be left debt-free, your credit will be untarnished, and you'll be able to pursue a new car without any difficulties.


Contact your lender before selling your car - you'll be closing out your loan with your lender, so it's important that they're informed beforehand. Your lender will be able to give you specific instructions for closing your loan out - you may need to conduct the sale of the car at the lending institution so that you can immediately use the money from the sale to pay off the loan.

, You may still owe money on your loan that can't completely be paid back by selling your car. In this case, you have several options, but you'll need to make decisions about what's most important to you. For instance, if you're trying to get out of your car loan in an effort to reduce your monthly expenses, you may need to make an up-front lump sum payment to cover the remaining balance in the loan after selling your car. If you simply want a new car, you may need to compromise in terms of how much money you'll spend, paying more for longer. None of the following steps will get you out of your loan and get you ownership of a new car and cost you no money and leave your credit history unscathed - they'll get you some of these things, but not all.

, Refinancing is the process of setting a new loan agreement with your lender. This can also be referred to as ""debt restructuring."" If you're experiencing financial distress, it's preferable to refinance your loan, rather than defaulting on it. If your car loan is inflating your monthly expenditures, you may consider refinancing - you'll still have to pay a loan off, but the new loan may be easier on your wallet. Contact your lender to negotiate a refinanced loan - try to drop the interest rate or lower your monthly payments on the new loan to an amount your wallet is comfortable with. If the new loan makes the difference between whether you file for bankruptcy or not, it'll be very beneficial for your credit in the long term.


A good credit score will improve the chances that you're approved for the new loan. If you can, spend some time living ""lean"" - saving money, paying off debts, etc. - as, over time, this will improve your credit score.
Trying to refinance means that your lender will conduct a ""hard inquiry"" on your credit history to decide whether to approve you. The hard inquiry can have a minor negative effect on your credit score on the order of a few points. This usually goes away in several months, though the inquiry will be visible on your credit report for two years., Depending on your bank's regulations, you may be able to transfer your loan to a trusted party and let them assume your payments. This is a good choice if you want to sell a car that's not fully paid-off to a friend, having him or her assume payments. However, you need to be careful - don't simply trust the new owner to send you money every month or to make payments to the lender on your behalf. If the new owner isn't directly, legally responsible for the car's payments, you can still be held responsible if s/he decides to stop paying.


A good policy is to have the new owner get approved for a new loan in the amount of the purchase price of the vehicle. They then pay you directly with this money, which you use to pay off your own loan in one lump sum (additional money may be needed if your loan is upside-down). Once your loan is paid off, you're off the hook and the new owner is responsible for making monthly payments.
Don't forget - the new owner also needs to take responsibility for the car insurance policy!

, If you're absolutely desperate for a new car but you just can't seem to come up with the money, consider leasing rather than buying. Talk to your leaser about rolling your negative equity balance into a new car lease. Because leases come with significantly lower payments than auto finance loans, it is possible for you to drive a new car and lower your monthly payments. If you make your payment every month and complete the full term of the lease, you will have paid off the upside-down loan, too. The downside, of course, is that you won't own the new car - you'll eventually have to turn it back in and either buy it at a residual value or lease a new car.


Leasing has a variety of pros and cons. On the plus side, your up-front expenses will be cheaper due to lower monthly payments. You also most likely won't be on the hook for most major maintenance, depending on the terms of your lease. Finally, you'll get to drive a brand-new car every few years. However, insurance for leased cars is often significantly higher than it is normally. You can also get charged for excessive mileage and/or wear that results from normal operation of your car. Most leases have mileage allowances of 10 - 15 thousand miles per year. If you exceed this, you can expect to pay 10 to 25 cents per excess mile!Finally, leased cars aren't actually yours. If you get attached to your cars or you've made a hobby of ""working"" on your cars, you may not want to lease.

, If there's nothing else you can do - you can't get approved for a refinanced loan, you can't sell your car to help pay your loan off, and you're in too much much financial stress to simply pay your loan off normally - you may, unfortunately, lose the car. Tell your lender you can no longer afford your payments and that you are opting for a voluntary repossession. You will lose your car and give your credit history a big red mark. However, by giving your car back willingly, you avoid being held accountable for the costs associated with your car being repossessed by a repo agency.


The lender will take possession of the car, sell it at auction, and, if the money from the sale doesn't completely pay off the loan, file for collection on the remaining balance. If you do not pay your balance, a judgment will be entered against you for the amount you owe. Pay this balance - if you do, you may be able to get a ""letter of satisfaction"" from your lender, which shows future creditors that you did eventually pay back what was owed.A repossession, voluntary or not, will negatively impact your credit for years, making it more difficult for you to get approved for loans in the future and ensuring that the loans you do be more unfavorable (in terms of interest rates, down payments, etc.). If you can avoid defaulting on your loan, do it.


, Often, the best way to get out of a loan is simply to pay it off. In the long run, this is almost always the simplest and cheapest option. If you have the cash available, contact your lender right away. Usually, they'll be happy to negotiate a series of higher monthly payments or even a lump-sum transaction to allow you to pay off the rest of your loan. This is a great idea if you have enough cash in your bank account and you're looking to cut down on monthly expenses, like if you've recently moved to a big city and plan to use public transit instead of your car.


As a general rule, paying loans off as early as possible is a good idea because it allows you to avoid interest payments which, over the normal life of the loan, can seriously add up. If you don't presently have the cash, seriously consider saving for months or even years to get the money to pay your car off completely. It's never a bad idea to make yourself debt-free.

Keep your cosigner in the loop.",How to Get a Cosigner for a Bad Credit Car Loan," For example, you might need a car loan so that you can purchase a car to remain steadily employed so that you can earn enough to apply for credit, but you need credit to be able to get the car, to get the job....! If you find yourself in this frustrating circle, you may be able to get out of it by finding a cosigner.


If you are young or have just started your work history and have never applied for a credit card or loan before, you are unlikely to be able to secure a car loan by yourself. Applying with a cosigner will make you less of a risk in your potential lender's eyes.;
, Even if you have managed to establish a credit history, your score may not be strong enough for you to qualify for a loan with favorable terms. You may be denied a loan or will only be given one with a prohibitively high interest rate.


Credit scores (often referred to as FICO scores) range from 350 (which indicates that you are high risk and likely to default) to 850 (which indicates that you are a very low risk borrower).Ideally, your credit score should be above 700. The further below that your score falls, the higher your interest rate will be, assuming you will even be granted a loan.

, Even if you have a credit history and a good credit score, you may be denied a car loan. There are many possible reasons for this, just a few of which are as follows:


You may not have a long enough credit history, you may have recently been late on a payment (which won't lower your credit score much, but which could make the current lender see you as a risk), or you could have recently applied for too many other lines of credit.If this is the case then getting a cosigner may be your only recourse if you really need this loan.

, Again, there are various reasons why you may be offered a loan with unfavorable terms, such as a high interest rate. Your credit history may not be long enough, your score could be lower than you think it is, your income could not be high enough, etc.


Your credit risk will be lowered if you have a cosigner—the lender can be more assured that they will be paid because your cosigner is guaranteeing eventual repayment. Thus, you should be charged a lower interest rate than if you had secured the loan by yourself. , Your decision about whether to ask someone to cosign for you will be aided by knowing what your current credit score is. You should also know this before you apply and begin to negotiate the terms of your loan.


You are entitled to a free credit report once every twelve months.See our related wikiHow to learn how to get your credit report for free.
Keep in mind that credit reports summarizes your credit history: what credit cars and loans you have/have had in your name, how much money you owe, and your payment history (whether you pay your bills on time or late).They do not contain your FICO score, which is based on your credit history. The only way to know your score is to pay for it (various companies provide this information for a fee), but so long as you know your history, you can have a good idea of whether or not your score is strong or weak., One of the advantages to having a cosigner is that you can give yourself a bit of breathing room to improve your credit score.Assuming you will make timely payments, you will be in a better position down the road to be able to get loans on your own at good interest rates and with favorable repayment plans.
The cost of securing loans with a bad credit score is high: on a $20,000 loan, people with low credit scores pay an average of $5000 more than those with strong credit scores., Nearly three out of four cosigners end up being responsible for the principal borrower's loan.Another way of understanding this: almost 75% of people who secure cosigners default on their loans and place the burden of repayment upon their cosigners. As you might imagine, this can lead to strained relationships.

, Should you default, late fees and collection costs may be passed on to the cosigner, which increases the cost of what they are now responsible for paying, often beyond the amount of the original loan (remember that interests rates also apply).In some states, lenders are allowed to seek repayment from cosigners without first making efforts to contact you (the principal borrower).Your cosigner could be sued, and/or their wages could be garnished if you fail to make repayments, even if you haven't yet received notices from your lending company or a collection agency.

, Once you decide that you need (or will benefit) from having a cosigner, you'll need to identify an excellent candidate. Deciding to ask a parent or family member with whom you are on good terms could be a smart move.


If you live with your cosigner, this can also help simplify the process, as the correspondence relating to your loan will be sent to the same address.

, If you are married or in a domestic partnership, a natural candidate for a cosigner would be your partner. You may think that you should (or have to) apply jointly for credit if you are married, but this is not the case.Indeed, it's important that you retain your own credit history throughout the course of your relationship. If everything is always in your spouse's name, you will be left with no credit should the relationship end.
Thus, you can apply for a loan as the principal borrower, but have your spouse or partner be a cosigner. It's not necessary, though, that you have your spouse cosign.You may choose anyone you want., You needn't feel as though you must ask a relative to cosign. Indeed, you may prefer to keep your financial and family matters separate.


You want to select someone who knows you well, who trusts you, and who you will be able to contact easily and communicate with clearly.
Additionally, your potential candidate must actually qualify to be a cosigner. We'll explain how you can assess this in a later step.

, Asking someone to be a cosigner is a big favor, and should they agree, they are taking a substantial risk for you. You want to convince them that you are fully serious and responsible, and so you ought to treat this as a serious business matter. One way to do that is to request an appointment with them.


For example, rather than putting your mom on the spot at the dinner table, try the following: “Mom, as you know I've been researching cars and loan options. It looks like I'll be able to qualify for a much better loan with a cosigner. Could we talk sometime in the next day or two about you cosigning for me? I can show you all of the relevant paperwork then and address any of your concerns.”

, You will have better luck convincing them to cosign if you can show them evidence of why you need or would greatly benefit from having a cosigner. Be prepared to show them paperwork which explains either why you can't get credit or would get much better credit with a cosigner.

, You should also be able to show your potential cosigner any information about the details of the loan you are hoping to get: what will the balance be? What will the interest rate be? What will your monthly payments be, and for how many months/years will you be making payments?

, Since how you handle your repayment can affect your cosigner’s credit history, you must do your best to submit your loan payments without delays. Your potential cosigner may be worried about your ability to do this, so you should be willing to present them with a detailed plan or schedule of how you plan to make your payments.


This means that you are going to have to be willing to share personal details about your monthly income and expenses.

, If the person you are approaching doesn't understand the role of a cosigner, be sure to clearly explain that to them. You should also be sure that they understand how their credit may be affected.


Even if your cosigner is never asked to take over payments, the fact that they have signed on as a guarantor for your loan will be included in their credit report. This could bring their score down.Because your cosigner is now responsible for your loan, they may not be eligible to receive other loans for themselves., It's important that you express to your potential cosigner both your understanding of the magnitude of this favor and your appreciation, should they agree to help.


The other person may feel taken for granted if you approach them with the attitude that they have to help you because they are your relative or friend. This may make them question your commitment to repaying the loan and protecting them.
Be sure to conclude your presentation and request with something like the following: “Mom, I know I'm asking you to take on a significant risk, and so I want you to know just how serious I am about handling this loan responsibly. I would be so grateful if you would be willing to help.”

, It may be hard not to take it personally if the first person you approach is not willing to cosign for you. By all means, you may politely ask them if they are willing to share their reasons with you. It's possible that you can then address their concerns and turn things around.


If they remain firm in their denial, though, you will have to accept that. A person's reasons for not taking on a financial risk can be varied, and they may not want to share them with you.
It's not worth destroying what was an otherwise good or important relationship over money matters.

, Your cosigner will need to have a good or excellent credit history to balance out your own bad credit. Similarly, they must be capable of shouldering the repayment obligation in case you fail to keep up with the repayment. If you default on your payments, the cosigner will be required to make the repayments, or your lending company can take legal action against both of you.


Typically, cosigners are required to have credit scores of 700 or above., Because your cosigner will be asked to provide evidence of sufficient income and/or assets to be able to guarantee your loan should you default, they may have to be prepared to show pay stubs, wage vouchers, or income tax returns.They may also be required to provide evidence of stable employment and residency., Once your cosigner has agreed to help you out, you both should be fully aware of the details of the repayment agreement.


Make sure that it's clear when and how late penalties will be assessed, how many payments can be missed before the cosigner becomes responsible, and how your cosigner will be contacted., It may be possible to obtain a contract in which your cosigner will only be responsible for repaying the principal balance of the loan, should you default.Don't assume that this will be the default arrangement; you'll most likely have to negotiate for such a clause.

, It's very important that neither you nor your cosigner miss any notifications from your lender; unfortunately, it can happen that mail can be lost or sent to the wrong address, particularly if you and your cosigner don't share the same address.In the meantime, late fees and penalties could accrue, and both of you could be on the hook.

, Keep copies of all of your loan documents, and also keep copies of your payment information. Avoid making late payments, and inform your cosigner if you do fall behind.


It's also a smart idea to make arrangements at the time of the original agreement to have your lender send written notifications to your cosigner when/if you fall behind payments."

Downshift whenever you're slowing down.",How to Shift a Semi Truck," If you're familiar with a manual transmission, the basic principles of the Eaton-Fuller Transmission shifter–the style used in many commercial trucks today–is similar, but more complex. Basically, it's oriented like a five-speed, but with a total of four different ratios at each position, which you toggle by a combination of switches and positions. This results in a total combination of 18 different speeds.The shift knob has two switches controlling air-actuated gears. One is the range switch, which needs to be set on ""Low"" for gears Lo-4, and the other is the high/low splitter, which is used to toggle between the low and high setting at each gear. Your index finger operates the range switch, which allows you to flip between high and low at each gear position with your thumb.;
, Most gear shifts have a diagram displaying the shifting pattern, which will help to clue you into the organization of the gears. The low gears are usually differentiated from the high gears by color, and reverse is indicated by an ""R.""


Gears 1-4 should all be straightforward, but then to shift into fifth gear, you shift back to the first position, and the pattern repeats. First gear is in the same position as fifth, second in the same as sixth, and so on.
Remember, at each position, you also have a total of four different speeds, though only two will be accessible, depending on where you shift from. In first gear, you've got 1L and 1H, as well as 5L and 5H.

, This allows you to become familiar with the gear pattern so you can shift up and down without looking. This will help you keep your eyes safely on the road while driving.


Grip the gear shift so that your index finger is available to work the range switch, and the middle and thumb can work the high/low splitter.
If you don't have experience operating the clutch and driving a manual transmission vehicle, shifting a semi truck is going to have a much larger learning curve. Operating the gear shifter by itself is challenging enough, so you need to be very comfortable operating the clutch on a regular vehicle before you attempt to drive a semi. Practice on a regular car.

, Hold the clutch pedal to the floor, as you would to start a normal manual transmission vehicle. This stops the transmission gears from turning, which allows the shifter to slide into gear. Select “LoL” by moving the shifter into the Lo-gear position, usually left and back.


Check to make sure the range switch is in the low position (down), and the splitter is also on ""L"" and you'll be ready to start the vehicle.

, As you might guess when the vehicle's got 18 different speeds, getting the truck into Lo gear on Low setting will get you going about one mile per hour, if that. Once you've slid into it, release the clutch and you'll probably be ready to shift into Lo-H.


To shift into Lo-H, you'll change the splitter to High gear to shift into high. You need to depress the clutch slightly, but not all the way to floor, then let it out to shift into Lo-H.

, Depress the clutch again slightly (not to the floor) when the RPMs reach first-gear range, and switch the splitter back to ""L,"" then pull the gear shift into the neutral position and release the clutch. Depress the clutch again, all the way, and push the gear shift into first, as you release the clutch.


This is called double-clutching, and it's necessary because you can't split between low and high on the splitter while you're in neutral, meaning that you have to toggle from ""H"" back to ""L,"" then shift into neutral, then operate the clutch again to get it into first. It's a lot of work.

, After you shift into 1-L you can flip the high/low switch up into the high position, continuing to accelerate and continuing this basic pattern through the upper gears.


Repeat the previous steps through 1-H, 2-L, 2-H, 3-L, 3-H, 4-L, and 4-H. To make the half steps, continue pushing the splitter button, releasing the accelerator, pushing in, and releasing the clutch.

, With the splitter switch in “L,"" flip up the range selector to 5-H, which will allow you to avoid grinding gears when you switch back into the first position. This is absolutely essential. Switch the range, then double-clutch-shift back to where 1 was before, and it will be fifth gear., The basic principles now repeats itself. Continue shifting and toggling between ""L"" and ""H,"" shifting up through 5-H, 6-L, 6-H, 7-L, 7-H, 8-L, and, finally, 8-H.

, Most RPM gauges should be color-coded, with 1500 rpms at about the top (12 o'clock) of the gauge, which is typically colored green. This is the ideal place to shift between gears.

1700-2100 is typically beyond the point where you should be shifting, with the exception of going downhill. This region is typically colored Yellow, with anything above colored red.
If you're less than 1200 rpm and try to shift, the engine is likely to splutter and possibly stall., After a while, you'll be able to familiarize yourself with the general positions that you need to shift, but in instruction school, you learn a few basic rules of thumb.


Be in top gear at 50 mph (80.5 km/h) or greater. Generally speaking, if you're traveling at highway speeds or greater, you should be at top gear always.
Be in fifth or sixth gear for sharp turns in city conditions. To avoid stalling, it's good to be switched over into the upper gears.
Other general speed guidelines will vary from transmission to transmission, for different trucks. You'll need to ask your instructor or other experienced drivers for tips.

, To downshift, you need to slow down to the rolling speed by hitting the brake, then select the gear for that range. Typically, you need to rev up to 1400-1600rpm, then slip the transmission into the proper gear for that speed range.

Peek under the wheel well.,
Write it down somewhere!,
Identify the chassis number.",How to Find the Chassis and Engine Number1," If you do not have access to your vehicle or if you do not want to go looking around the vehicle for the VIN, there are several different pieces of paperwork that should include the VIN. Some of the documents that you can check include:title
registration card
owner’s manual
insurance documents
body shop repair records
police reports
vehicle history reports;
, The easiest place to find the VIN on your vehicle is right on the lower left corner of your dashboard. You should be able to read the number by looking through your windshield on the driver’s side of your car., The VIN might also be located in the driver’s side doorjamb or on the doorpost. Open your driver’s side door and look around the edges of the doorjamb for a little white sticker.If your VIN is on the doorjamb, then it should be on the area of the doorjamb just below the level of the rearview mirror.
The VIN number may also be on the opposite side of the driver’s side doorjamb, near where the driver’s side seatbelt latches., If you haven’t found it anywhere else, then you can pop your hood and look at the front of the engine block. The VIN number may be written on the front of the engine block., Sometimes the VIN is written on the front of the vehicle’s frame, somewhere near the windshield washer fluid container. Go to the front of the car, pop your hood, locate your window washer fluid container, close the hood, and then inspect the vehicle’s frame near this area of your vehicle for the VIN., If you have a spare tire in the back of your trunk and you haven’t found the VIN anywhere else, it might be back there. Pop your trunk, remove the spare tire, and look in the space where the spare is usually kept. The VIN may be written in this area., Another place you can check is under your rear wheel well. Go to the back of your vehicle, get down on the ground, and look up at your wheel well. Check both sides to see if the VIN is recorded here.You will probably need a flashlight to see the VIN if it is written here.

, After you have found your VIN, make sure that you write it down and keep it in a file for easy access the next time that you need it. Keep the VIN number in a physical file, save it to a file on your computer, or email it to yourself.

, Remember that the chassis number is made up of the last six digits of the VIN.Look at the VIN that you have written down and circle the last six digits of the number to identify your vehicle’s chassis number.

Use your license to land a job.",How to Drive a Tractor‐Trailer," To start the truck you let the gauges reset and the glow plugs warm up by turning the key to the first ""click."" You'll learn more about starting a truck from an instructor in truck driving school.;
, Driving a semi requires shifting gears more often than driving an automatic car does. Each truck is different, so plan to learn how to shift using the type of truck you intend to drive professionally.

, Driving such a large vehicle requires a higher level of mindfulness about making right turns and left turns, backing up, and parking. Again, it's important to take a training course to learn how to properly maneuver and park the specific tractor-trailer combination you intend to drive.

, Check your local Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) website for listings of reputable truck driving schools near you. Look for programs that have been approved by the Professional Truck Driver Institute (PTDI). Attending truck driving school is the best way to learn how to properly drive a semi truck.


You can also take CDL classes through a community or technical college in your area.
Some schools offer several driving courses with only one that has been approved by the PTDI, so do research before deciding which one to sign up for., Truck driving schools offer programs designed to prepare you to get your class A or B commercial driver's license. If you want to be a professional truck driver, plan to complete about 350 hours of training over a period of several months.


You can take training courses with fewer hours, but these are generally meant for people with some experience under their belts who need a refresher course.
Training programs that have been approved by the PTDI average $4,200, in addition to the cost of books, license fees, and other expenses., During the training program you will learn how to inspect a semi truck to ensure that it's safe to drive as well as how to operate a semi truck and handle real-world situations. Skills you will learn include how to:


make controlled turns without putting cars and other vehicles in danger.
shift gears.
stay in your lane or switch lanes.
manage your speed on the highway.
deal with traffic congestion.
handle obstacles in the road.
navigate narrow city streets.
back up and reverse the semi truck.
park the truck.

, In addition to learning how to operate the vehicle, you will also learn how to be a responsible driver. Here are examples of specialized knowledge you'll gain to prepare you to get your commercial license:


How to keep a logbook to record your hours on the road.
Knowledge about Department of Transportation requirements you must follow.
How to safely transport hazardous materials.
How to operate air brakes.
Other behind-the-wheel instruction.

, There are federal physical qualifications you have to meet before you can get your CDL license. You must be 21 years of age to drive a semi used for interstate commerce, but you may received a restricted license at age 18 that limits your use of the vehicle to one state. In addition, you must undergo a federal medical test and obtain a federal medical card before applying for your CDL.

, To get a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) you must pass a series of written knowledge tests. The tests you take are determined by what type of vehicle you wish to drive, and what you will be carrying in your truck.The General Knowledge Test is taken by all applicants, no matter what type of vehicle they will be driving.
The Air Brakes Test must be taken if you wish to drive a truck with air brakes.
The Combination Vehicles Test has to be taken if you want to drive tractor-trailer combinations.
The Hazardous Materials Test is required if you will be transporting hazardous materials.
The Tanker Test is required for hauling liquids in a tanker truck.
The Doubles/Triples Test is required if you want to pull two or three trailers at a time.

, After you pass the knowledge tests, you get a permit - similar to the one you'd get before you're licensed to drive a car - which you can use to practice for the remaining exams you'll need to take to get your CDL for up to 6 months. As with a regular driver's permit, you'll need to have an instructor with a CDL license with you at all times. To get a permit, you must:


be at least 18 years of age.
have a valid driver's license.
pass the knowledge tests.
have a federal medical card.

, After getting a passing score on the knowledge tests, you can move on to the skills tests, which will draw on the hours of practice you underwent during training. In some cases you can rent a semi truck from your training program and take it to the DMV for the skills test. You'll be tested on the following skills, in addition to others that may be related to the specific type of vehicle you will be driving:



Pre-trip vehicle inspection - This mandatory tests determines whether you understand how to check to make sure your vehicle is safe to drive. You'll perform a check in front of the examiner.

Basic vehicle control - For this test you'll get inside the vehicle and operate it in front of the examiner. You'll be asked to move it forward, backward, and to make turns without veering too far from your lane or hitting cones or barriers.

On-road driving - For this test you'll be asked to drive your vehicle on the road through a variety of traffic situations. You'll make turns, move through railroad crossings, shift to go up and down grades, and navigate city streets and highways.

, Once you have your CDL, you can start applying for jobs with trucking companies or operate as an independent agent. If you want to start driving a different type of truck, you may have to take additional exams.

Look for the VIN at the steering neck.,
Check the motor.,
Inspect the front frame.,
Remember to circle the last six digits.",How to Find the Chassis and Engine Number2," The steering neck is the most common place to find a VIN on a motorcycle. You can locate the VIN by turning the handles to one side and looking at the steering neck, which is a metal cylinder that runs down from the handles. The VIN should be etched into the metal.You may have to check both sides of the steering neck to find the VIN.

, Sometimes the VIN is located on the motor for motorcycles. If you could not find the VIN on the steering neck, then check the motor. The VIN should be near the bottom of the motor’s cylinders., For ATVs and some motorcycles, the VIN may be on the frame, but it is not always easy to find. You may need to look around a bit and use a flashlight to locate a VIN that is printed on the inner frame of a bike.


Check the outside of the frame first. The VIN may be located just below your bike’s shifter on the left side of your bike. If you can’t find it on the outside of the bike, start looking on the inside of the frame.Some manufacturers stamp the VIN on specific areas of the frame. For example, Honda stamps the VIN on the right side of the steering head as well as on the area of the frame just above the motor on the left side of the bike.Check with your manufacturer to see if there are specific areas where you should look first.

, The last six digits of your motorcycle’s VIN number make up your motorcycle’s chassis number. Circle the last six digits to identify the chassis number.

Find a company you are interested in and go directly to their website for a quote.,
Do not automatically go with the lowest price.,
Research the transport companies you are considering.,
Make a decision about which company to use and book your transport.,
Prepare your vehicle for transport by removing all personal or valuable items.,
Make sure the carrier inspects your vehicle.,
Inspect the car to ensure there are no additional dings, dents or scratches.",How to Choose an Auto Transport Company," One way to find a reputable firm is to use ""transport"" as a key word search in the online forums of collectible car owner websites. You're likely to find reputable movers but not cheap ones with this approach. (Do not put your information in a multi-quote website. You will receive unfavorable email and phones calls by 20 different companies.) Another source of rated companies is Angie's List. You must enter all information correctly to receive the most accurate rate. Most automatic quotes that you will receive are for operable, standard passenger vehicles. Cars with modifications (i.e. lift kits, lowered suspensions, bigger tires) and cars that do not run cost additional money for the size, weight and conditions for the carrier.;
, Many companies lure unsuspecting customers with the lowest bid. They then need to locate a carrier to physically move your vehicle. If the carrier does not accept the low price (and generally they don't), then your vehicle will not be moved. A lot of companies low-ball customers into using their company.

, Learn from others experiences using the wealth of information available on the Internet. You can start with simply doing a search on your favorite search engine for the company's name in quotes. You can also repeat the same search along with the word ""complaints"". Avoid using a review website as the most popular ones are not always accurate. Call multiple companies, ask friends if they have ever used a transport company. Review quotes, terms & conditions, reviews posted on the Internet, and finally, make sure they have been in business at least a few years. This is a highly unregulated industry, and many less than desirable companies pop-up with new names every few years to strike unsuspecting customers again and again. Make sure the brokers are bonded and that the carriers they assign are licensed and insured. Whichever company you decide to go with, familiarize yourself with their dispute resolution procedures, such a delays or even damage as well.

, Make sure to have a confirmation via fax or email. Read everything a company sends you before signing it. Be aware that if you place a reservation via Internet, your e-signature is binding once you click send or submit.

, Don't fuel up. Auto carriers prefer you have less than a quarter tank of fuel because it greatly decreases the weight they carry and the less weight they haul the better the fuel economy while driving from point to point. The less it costs them the less it will continue to cost you!! It is a good idea to wash vehicles before the inspection report at pick up. This ensures the car’s condition and any damage can be easily identified before and after transit. It's also a good idea to disable any alarm system before transport.

, At pick-up, the driver should inspect the car for any existing damage with a form called ""The Bill of Lading"". They will footnote the damage on a vehicle condition report. They will ask you to sign it and will hand you a copy of the report for your records. If they do not give it to you insist on asking for a copy. Keep this with you until the car is delivered.

, This is your only opportunity to claim damage, so please take your time. If any damage is claimed, note it right on the condition report (Bill of Lading) and make sure the carrier signs the condition report and again retain a copy for your records.

Remove your carpet.",How to Body Drop or Channel a Truck1," Front seats are usually held in by four bolts on each corner of the runner (the bar at the bottom of the seat that contacts the floor). Once you remove the bolts you can tilt the seat forward or backward, whichever is easiest, and unplug any wiring connected to the seat. Once the seat is loose you can simply lift it out of the vehicle., This can be tricky depending on what kind of vehicle you are working on. You will need a flat head and Philips screwdriver. It is also ideal to invest in a clip puller, a tool designed to remove plastic clips without damage (prices start at around $10.00), and to work carefully so that you do not scratch any of the textured plastic. This texture cannot be repaired.

, Disconnect the pedal assembly from the linkage on the other side of the firewall or underneath the vehicle. This will need to be done for the accelerator, parking brake, regular brakes, and if you drive a standard the clutch pedal will need to be removed as well.

, Once you have the seats and dash out of the way,replacing your carpet should be easy. The carpet should be held in by plastic clips or twist tabs. Remove these fasteners and pull the carpet up away from the floor.

Advance in your career.",How to Become a Truck Driver," Your salary will vary based on the type of trucking work you do, the company you work for, and your level of experience. That said, most truck drivers earn starting salaries around $30,000 per year.After five to seven years of experience within a specific field, your salary will usually increase to around $55,000 per year. The likelihood of seeing an increase in your salary also improves if you stay with the same company.
Note that some trucking jobs pay more than others. Typically, drivers who work with hazardous chemicals, gas transport, or other dangerous fleet earn more than those whose work does not involve such materials.;
, As with most careers, truck driving has various pros and cons. Review both to help you determine whether or not this is the right job for you.


On the plus side, trucking jobs require a short amount of schooling and offer high starting pay rates with decent benefit packages. It's usually relatively easy to find work, especially if you go through an established trucking school, and there's considerable flexibility regarding the type of driving you'll do.
On the down side, trucking jobs can be very demanding. Expect to be on the road for 12 hours a day, if not longer. You'll need to meet tight delivery deadlines, and the job can be dangerous, especially if you carry hazardous materials.

, If you have the opportunity to do so, try talking with a few established truck drivers. Ask them about their experiences and explain your interest in the field.


Find out if anyone in your social circle knows of someone with a career in truck driving. If you cannot make use of any personal connections, consider talking with a few truck drivers at a truck stop.
Depending on how things go, you may receive a few referral cards. Save them for later if you do; these cards may make it easier to attend school or find work.

, Visit your nearest DMV office and ask for a copy of the state commercial driver's manual. Many state DMV websites also have digital copies available online.


This manual will tell you all you need to know about obtaining your commercial driver's license (CDL) within your state. Review the information about fees, classes, and restrictions. Study its contents to learn about the various traffic and safety laws associated with commercial driving.
Since traffic laws can change, you'll need to make sure that you study using the most recent edition of the manual. New editions are typically printed on a yearly basis.

, Before you attend school or earn your CDL, you'll need to meet several basic physical and legal qualifications.In most states, you must be at least 21 years old. You must also be legally eligible to work within the country and within the state.
You'll need to have a clean driving record. Schools and employers may overlook minor traffic violations, like parking tickets, but you probably won't qualify if you've been busted for reckless driving or if you've been convicted for DUI.
Many schools also want you to have a diploma or GED before applying, and some truck driving companies won't hire you without one.

, Contact nearby truck driving schools and sign up for an appropriate program. Good schools will provide both classroom and practical education.


Check your phone book or an online directory of truck driving schools. For instance: http://www.truckingtruth.com/schools/

Each program has its own tuition and fees, but many schools also offer tuition assistance. The timeline of each program can also vary. Some intensive programs may finish within 30 days to 10 weeks, but more in-depth programs can extend out to a full year.
Within the classroom, you'll learn about laws and regulations related to truck driving. During practical, hands-on sessions, you'll gain guided practice driving commercial vehicles.

, After you complete truck driving school, you'll need to take the state CDL exam. Each state has its own exam procedures, but typically, you'll need to pass both a written test and a road skills test.The written test will evaluate your knowledge of the various laws and safety regulations involved with truck driving.
The road skills test will require you to briefly drive a commercial vehicle under the supervision of a state licensed examiner.
Note that you can take the exam or more than one type of commercial vehicle endorsement. The ""combination vehicle"" endorsement will allow you to drive semi trucks, but other endorsements include: passenger, school bus, air brake, tank vehicles, doubles triples, and hazardous materials.

If you choose to get the ""hazardous materials"" endorsement, you'll also need to pass a background check with the TSA.



, The FMCSR exam includes both written and physical components. The written portion covers federal traffic law, and the physical portion includes brief hearing and vision tests.Once you pass the written portion, you'll never have to pass it again. You must take and pass the physical portion of the exam every two years, however.

, The vast majority of truck driving schools offer job placement services, so you should check with your school when looking for your first job.


Established truck driving schools that have been around for several decades often have close connections to trucking companies at the national, regional, and local levels. In many cases, those who graduate from a truck driving program with job placement services can find work within 30 to 60 days.
If your program does not offer job placement services, contact the trucking companies directly and ask about openings. Apply for the entry level positions that fit with your qualifications and career goals.

, Once you're hired by a trucking company, you'll usually need to undergo an orientation lasting three to five days.


Each company will vary, but typically, the orientation will each you about the company and its various policies.
During the orientation period, you may also need to fill out paperwork, pass a drug test, and/or pass some type of basic physical exam.

, After completing your orientation, expect to undergo an official training period. In most cases, one experienced driving will be responsible for training you according to company policy.


You'll usually work alongside your trainer for several weeks to several months. This individual will be responsible for teaching you about company routes, paperwork procedures, and other related information.

, When you finish your training, you'll likely need to pass the company's trucking exam. This exam usually centers around the road test, but it may also include a written portion depending on the company.


After passing the exam, the company will probably assign your own truck to you. Expect to receive your own delivery route along with it. You'll be responsible for completing this route on your own, without the assistance of a trainer or partner.

, Most beginners start in the field of long-haul trucking, regardless of how many endorsements they received while taking the state CDL exam. You can usually advance to better positions after gaining several years of experience, though.


Local and specialty trucking jobs usually require experience. You will also need experience before you can earn a better salary as a long-haul trucker and before you can qualify as a driver trainer for others.

, This will help you later when you have to weld these areas back together. You should only weld bare metal, and it is easier to grind the paint off now than after you make your cuts., Use a plasma cutter or a reciprocating saw (sawzall) to cut out a section that is one inch less than you would like to drop the cab (i.e. if you want to drop the cab 3"" then you would cut out a 2"" section). This leaves 1/2"" tabs on the top and bottom of the cut. You will now be able to roll the those tabs so that when you weld them together it will be more stable than welding flat sheet metal together.

, Cut out a section the same size as the section you cut from the back wall. You will use the extra 1/2"" on the top and bottom of this cut the same way.

, Your floor should be completely separated from the rest of the cab at this point. The only thing left preventing the cab from dropping is your frame horns.

, The frame horns should be the last support holding the cab in place. Once they are removed you can lower the cab to the desired height.

, The tabs you rolled on back wall should be welded together so that they provide structure and stability for your vehicle.

, As with the back wall, you will need to weld the tabs you created on the firewall back together. Your cab should now be secured in it's new lower position.

, There will be gaps created around the door openings after you drop the cab. Measure these gaps, and any others created during the body drop, and cut out a patch plate that is the same dimensions.

, Be sure to spread seam sealer on any weld you make (after it cools). This helps to protect the weld from rusting.

, A ten or twelve gauge sheet metal should work well for boxing in your frame horns.

, You will want to prevent your cab from rusting, so it is necessary to prime all bare metal.

, It will be necessary to repaint your cab after cutting, welding, and patching.

, Reattach any parts that were removed to do the body drop like fuel lines, brake lines, etc.

, Reinstall the seats, dash, carpet, etc.

, This will allow the cab to slide down lower over the frame rails, effectively dropping your truck.

, You will need to box in the channels you cut out for safety and to make the inside of your truck look great again. Weld the sheet metal boxes to the floor of the truck directly covering your channels.

Keep your truck cleaned and shined.,
Paint the engine bay.",How to Make Your Truck Look Cool," There are several options you can look at that will radically change the truck's appearance. Here are some:


Lift kits. These may be simple blocks that fit between the axle and leaf springs to raise the back end, and spacers for the coil springs to raise the front. This may give your truck a more aggressive appearance.
Low rider effects. By reducing the leaf springs and installing shorter coil springs at the front, and using low profile tires on wide rims, you can make your truck appear to hug the ground.
Upgraded tires and rims. This is an area where the cost may really hit your pocketbook, but some chrome spoke rims, spinners, or white spoke steel rims will instantly change your truck's appearance. Adding white raised letter tires, very wide whitewalls, or large ""mud"" tires can change it even more.
Chrome accessories. Chrome bumpers, trim packages, running boards, grill guards, and bed rails can liven up the appearance and add significant ""shine"" to your pickup.

Tonneau covers. These will help transform your truck into a sleek road machine, especially with a drop kit to make it a low rider. An added benefit would be having a dry cargo area in the truck bed.
Window tinting. Here, you can get the benefit of a slightly cooler air temperature, as well as the look of bronze tinted, or even artistic looking mural window tinting. Some states have differing laws as to how dark the tinting can be, so check before you invest in this.
Brush guards, grill covers, and winches. For what may be the ultimate in ""rugged"" effects, look at grill covers and brush guards, as well as winches that fit into them, or on custom built bumpers.;
, This can be accomplished by making your own with a thick rubber mat , a knife and some creativity. The best size to use depends on your preference. Generally, the bigger, the better. When you are done making them, collect a few of your favorite stickers to add some class to your mud flaps.

, This step is a little more involved because it requires wiring. Pick up a set of cab lights at your local auto parts store and some red lights to mount in the space under your tailgate.

, They can be chromed, with fancy covers, or plain painted ones, and will help with visibility when driving in poor weather.

, This is the cheapest modification but definitely gets you noticed. The easiest way is to sawzall it off and just leave the pipe unhooked. Or, you could connect it back up using flexible pipe. Check the noise level laws for your state, and make sure you do not disable the catalytic converter if you make this modification.

, There are many manufactured, self adhesive striping kits available, from ""death's heads"" to flames, that can be installed on your truck.

, This is an area that can have a surprising effect on appearance with little investment but elbow grease and time. Wash it regularly, and wax it with a good automotive wax. Use a buffing compound if the finish is very dull or scratched up to remove the oxidized paint and old wax before applying new wax.

, Painting the engine and engine bay gives it a mean look when you show up to parties and people will think its aftermarket and upgraded. Also you can paint the visible rust with black spray paint and make it look brand new and professional.

Decide on a bank or lender for your financing.,
Make a down payment.,
Provide financial documentation that is needed.,
Settle the payment terms of the loan.,
Provide all of the required information on the dealer you will be purchasing the used commercial truck from.",How to Buy a Used Commercial Truck2," Most used commercial trucks cost between $30,000 and $250,000, depending on the truck. Use a lender you have worked with before, or a company you know is reliable and respected.

, Most lenders will look for at least 20 percent of the purchase price as a down payment.


Balance your down payment size with the cash needs of your business. While a larger down payment will mean a less expensive loan, it will also take extra cash out of your daily business operations.

, This will include your CDL license, proof of income, financial statements and a good credit report.

, This will include the amount of your monthly payment, the length of the loan and how much interest you will pay until the loan is paid off.

Determine Which Type of Truck You Need.,
Choose the Right Dealership.,
A Quality Used Garbage Truck.,
Stay Within Your Budget.,
Using Financing to Buy Your Truck.,
Dealership or Private Seller?.,
Ask Lots of Questions.",How to Buy the Right Used Garbage Truck for Your Business," The first thing you will need to do is decide what kind of garbage truck you are looking to buy. This will be based primarily by how you will be using the truck. If you are doing commercial waste removal you will likely need either a front loader or rear loader to be able to accommodate the large volume of trash. If you will be using the truck for residential waste removal, a side loader will serve you best because of its ability to quickly pick up a large number of relatively small containers of trash from the curbside.;
, The next thing you must decide after choosing the right truck is the right dealership you want to purchase the truck from. Find a dealership that has a large selection of the type of truck you are looking for and try to find references or reviews for the dealer. Reading reviews and speaking to people who have worked with dealers before is a good way to find a reputable source to buy your next truck.

, You really don’t want to buy a used truck that you will constantly need to be fixing and spending money on just to keep it on the road. Buying a used refuse truck can become a bad investment if you don’t look for quality used garbage trucks for sale. It is a general rule that a truck that has low mileage and is well maintained will be a better truck. The location where the truck was used is also critical due to rust and corrosion concerns. Trucks from dry and temperate locations are typically in better condition. Some dealerships also provide complete reconditioning and painting options for their customers.

, Never spend more than you can afford. It is imperative that you remain within your budget regardless of what you are being told by the dealer. It is in your best interest to stay within your financial means when looking to buy a truck. A good dealer will be able to accommodate your needs without having to break the bank.

, Financing a garbage truck purchase can make great financial sense. It frees up capital that can be used in other aspects of your business. With interest rates at historical lows, keeping your down payment and monthly payments low is easier than ever.

, A big mistake that buyers make sometimes is purchasing a vehicle from a private seller. Private sellers generally do not have to follow strict laws and regulations that licensed dealers must adhere to which can mean that you will not have any recourse if you make a bad purchase. Dealerships are able to offer warranties and have financing programs in place that you will simplify your buying experience and give you peace of mind.

, It is imperative that you understand everything throughout the process of purchasing a used garbage truck. Make sure that all of your questions are being answered so that you can make an informed purchase. Take your time and do your homework. If you follow these tips, you can find a great used truck that will serve you well for years to come.

Tighten all clamps.,
Install final components.",How to Install a Tonneau Cover," Bed liners, bed rail caps, and other additions can be incompatible with some covers. Check with the tonneau cover manufacturer if possible, or follow these rules of thumb:If a bed liner gets in the way during installation, just cut a notch where you need to fit a clamp or other cover part.
If the bed liner wraps over the rails and your tonneau cover lies between rails (instead of above them), the two parts might not both fit on your truck.
Most bed rail caps won't affect installation, but diamond plate bed rail caps will prevent some covers from fitting, or from forming a weather-tight seal.;
, A closed tailgate can interfere with installation.

, Most tonneau covers come with two side rails, which fit onto the top or side of the truck's bed rails. Place a side rail flush with the front of the bed rail, next to the cab. Hold it in place temporarily with a spring clamp, or have an assistant keep hold of it.


If your cover does not come with rails, the cover itself should have clamps that swing down from the underside once the cover is in place.These covers are less stable and not weatherproof, but easy to remove and reinstall.
If you have a retractable tonneau cover, which comes in a canister, you may need to position this before you place the rails. Put the canister on the edge of the bed rails, next to the cab. Center this perfectly before you attach the rails to the canister., Your installation kit should come with several toothed clamps. Take one of these and fit it onto the underside of the side rail, near the cab. Line up the teeth of the clamp with the grooves, then tighten by hand. Tighten a few times with a wrench or socket wrench, just enough to feel it pressing against the bed rail., Look at the underside of the rail. If there is any gap at all between the truck, place shims evenly along the bed rail to close the gap. These are plastic or rubber spacers that stick directly onto the bed rail.


If there's a large gap (more than about ⅜ inches / 10mm), you might need shim brackets instead. Unclamp the rail, slide the shim brackets onto the end, space them out evenly, and reclamp the rail.Your kit may not come with shim brackets, or may have shim brackets that attach with a slightly different design.

, Most installation kits come with eight clamps (four per side), but a short bed may only require six (three per side). Attach these the same way you did the first clamp, spacing them evenly along the rails.


Some soft tonneau cover instructions recommend skipping this step until the end, so you can make final adjustments more easily. Don't try this for a hard cover, which needs a firm

, Install the second rail the same way.

, The two rails should be perfectly parallel with each other, in line with the bed rails, and as far back as they can go. If necessary, loosen the clamp slightly and adjust the rails, then reclamp. If a rail is tilted, lower or raise the position of the clamp, or push down on the raised end of the rail while tightening the clamp.Take your time over this step. The cover will not install properly if the rails are out of position.


If there is a gap between your bed rails and the cab, the side rails should not extend into this gap.
The rails will not necessarily be level with the closed tailgate.

, Once you are certain the rails are properly align, finish tightening the front clamp of each rail with a wrench. Repeat with the other clamps, moving toward the rear of the truck.

, Weatherproof covers should come with a rubber seal to fill the gap between the cover and the cab. Wipe down this area with rubbing alcohol to make a good bonding surface.Peel off the backing paper and stick it onto the cab between the two side rails, starting from the driver's side. Cut off the excess and discard.


Some tonneaus come with additional seals for the sides or tailgate, and/or larger corner plugs to weatherproof the rear corners.

, Some installation kits have components that may be easier to install before you position the cover. Check your kit for the following:


Storage straps, fed through holes in the cover.
Tension adjuster screws, for hand tightening of the cover. These usually attach to the side rails, and may come pre-installed.
Hinged covers and some hard folded covers include a rod to prop the cover open. This should snap or screw into place somewhere on one of the side rails, with the other end resting on a small cradle.

, This will be much easier with two or more people, especially if the cover is a hard cover or your truck is lifted. Place the rolled or folded cover at the end of the rails, next to the cab. It should fit perfectly onto the rails, although you may need to push down to get it in place. This must be perfectly centered and slotted onto the side rails before you continue.


If you cannot center the cover, place it back on the ground and readjust the rails.
Hinged hard covers (one solid piece without folds) are extremely heavy. They cannot be installed safely by a single person. Use a forklift or several helpers., Shut the tailgate. Carefully unroll or unfold the cover until it reaches your tailgate, keeping it in the rails along its whole length. Make small adjustments to cover positioning until it is flush with the tailgate and the cab end of the side rails.


Look for a small hand-tightened screw on the rail to adjust cover tension. It should lie taut across your bed, completely covering it.

, Depending on your model, the cover may have already snapped onto the rail as you unfolded it. Most covers also come with elevator bolts or other large bolts for additional securing. Align the bolt holes on the cover with the bolt holes on the side rails, and tighten securely with the washers and nuts included in your kit.


Some covers have clamps or levers on the underside, which lower to brace the cover against the bed side.

, Check all clamps on the cover rails and tighten them securely. Check all other attachment points to make sure the cover is firmly in place and cannot shift or come loose.

, Some tonneau covers come with drainage tubes to divert rain, bump stops to protect your cab from dings when a hard cover is opened, or various other optional components. If you have any parts you cannot identify in your installation kit, contact the manufacturer or a mechanic.

Tuck up and secure the wiring.",How to Install Spotlights on Your Vehicle," Before working with the electronic system in your vehicle, it’s important to disconnect the battery to avoid shocking yourself or doing any damage. Open the hood and use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the nut holding the black ground cable on the negative terminal on the battery. Once loose, pull the cable off and tuck it to the side of the battery to avoid allowing it to come back into contact with the terminal.The negative terminal can be located by looking for the letters “NEG” or the negative symbol (-) on the battery.
You will not need to disconnect the positive cable.;
, There are a number of places one could feasibly mount a spotlight, so choose a location that’s best for your purposes. Some common locations include on top of your side mirror or on the roof of the vehicle.You will need to identify the location you intend to mount the spot light first in order to cut the proper lengths of wire.
Remember that if you install the spotlight on your roof, you will have to drill through it, which may cause leaking.

, There are a number of options on the market for spotlights and installation kits. The three common types of spotlights you can purchase are halogen, LED and HID. Each style of light has its own strengths and weaknesses and should be chosen based on application and budget.Halogen lights will be the cheapest and usually the dimmest. However, the bulbs are less expensive to replace when they blow out.
LED lights can be extremely bright and cost more than most halogen spotlight applications.
HID lamps are the most expensive, but offer the longest lifespan and often the brightest lights.

, You may decide to install a button or switch inside your vehicle to turn the spotlight on and off. On many spotlights, the switch will be on the light itself and will require no further wiring. If you opt to wire the light to a switch on your dashboard, however, the installation will be a bit more in depth. If you decide to run a switch for a light that has one on the light, leave the switch on the light set to “on.”Even if the light has a switch, you may still choose to run a switch into your vehicle.
Determining where you want the switch will help you establish how much wire the project will require.

, If your spotlight did not come with an electrical relay, you will need to install one. Most stoplights should not be wired directly to a power source without being run through a relay. If your kit did not come with one, purchase a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) Relay from your local auto parts store. Mount it inside your engine bay somewhere along the body of the vehicle.Try to avoid mounting the relay too close to the exhaust manifold, as the heat may damage the relay.
You can use heavy duty double sided tape, an adhesive, or drill holes through the metal to mount the relay.

, Run a short length of black wire from the relay to a bolt on the body or frame of the vehicle. Expose a length of wire at the end and make a loop with it, then loosen the bolt and loop the exposed wire around it below the head. Twist the wire around itself to secure it to the bolt, then tighten the bolt again.This wire will provide the ground for the relay circuit.
Whenever possible, use black wiring for grounds to make them easy to identify.

, Purchase an in-line fuse holder and connect it to the positive post on the relay. You may need to run wire from the positive post to the in-line fuse holder if it can’t connect to it directly. Make sure there is a fuse in the fuse holder rated to withstand the amperage required to power the spotlight.This fuse will protect the spotlight and the relay from surges if there is an issue with your electrical system.
The fuse will blow out if too much power flows through it, cutting the power and preventing a fire.

, Run a length of wire from the fuse holder to the positive terminal on the battery. You may choose to wrap a length of exposed wire around a bolt on the battery cable, or you may choose to purchase a new Positive cable end. If you do so, insert the end of the positive cable as well as the wire from the relay’s fuse into the end, then use pliers to compress the cable end until the wires are held securely in place.








This wire will provide the power to the relay, and then the spotlight itself.
Ensure the cable to securely fastened to the positive terminal. If it jostles loose, the spotlight will fail to function.

, Run a wire from the relay to the positive post on the spotlight itself. You may choose to twist the wire around the positive post or solder it into place. Regardless of how you connect the wiring, be sure to wrap it in electrical tape or a shrink wrap sleeve to protect the connection from the elements.Soldering the wire is the strongest and most permanent way to connect the wiring to the spotlight.

, Run a wire from the last open post on the relay to the switch in your vehicle if you choose to mount one. This will enable to the switch to cut the power to the spotlight. You may be able to run the wire through a hole in the firewall of your vehicle on the driver’s side. This will make the wire come out near the pedals inside the cabin.If you are unable to run the wire through the firewall, tuck it through the corner where the hood, fender and driver’s side door meet.
Be careful not to run the wire through anything that may melt or break it in the regular use of your vehicle.

, Use the hardware supplied in your spotlight kit to mount the light in the location of your choosing. If it was designed to be mounted on your roof, it may have come with a strip of weather proofing material to prevent water from leaking through your roof where the holes are drilled. If it did not, you may want to put silicone in and around the holes as you bolt the light into place to create a waterproof seal.If you choose to mount the light on your mirror, you will not need to use any weather proofing.
Mounting a spotlight on a light bar or otherwise attached bracket will also require no drilling or weather proofing.

, Secure the switch on your dashboard in place by drilling a hole through the trim and sliding the switch through it from behind. This will leave only the switch visible, with the rest behind the trim. Place the screw on cap over the switch, with the switch itself sticking out through it, then screw it in place to hold the switch against the trim.








If you choose to use a button instead of a switch, it will mount in the same way.
Ensure the switch is someplace easy to access without looking to be able to use the light while you drive.

, Run a black wire from one of the three prongs on the switch to a bolt on the body or frame of the vehicle just as you grounded the relay under the hood. Make a loop with the exposed end of the wire and wrap it around a bolt. Tighten the bolt back into place once completed.








The switch needs its own ground and power source to function properly.

, Locate the fuse box on the driver’s side of the cabin of your vehicle. Identify a fuse that powers an electronic device that only functions when the vehicle is running, such as the radio, headlights or turn signals. Remove the fuse and insert and “add-a-circuit” or standard blade fuse holder with a wired pigtail hanging off that you can connect the wire from the switch. This will prevent the spotlight from working when the vehicle is not running.Be sure to put a fuse in the fuse holder to power the switch.
Check the instructions for the spotlight and ensure you use a fuse rated for the amperage needed for the light to function.

, With everything wired, reconnect the battery and tuck the wiring away so it isn’t visible. Use zip ties under your dashboard to secure any extra wire up beneath the dash so you can’t accidentally catch it with your feet or a pedal. Run any wiring on the exterior of your vehicle along edges until you can tuck it under or between panels of the body to keep it from being visible.Reconnect the battery and test your new spotlight.
If the light fails to turn on, ensure none of the wires have been pulled off their terminals or been crimped to interrupt the flow of electricity.

Choose the configuration.,
Decide whether to go for a pit-style or above-ground foundation.,
Know some of the factors that make a truck scale reliable.,
Search for vehicle scales that use superior construction techniques to maintain scale accuracy.,
Look for software solutions that include features best suited for your type of business.,
Take into account the kind of service and maintenance that a truck scale will require before making your final buying decision.",How to Choose the Right Truck Weighing Scale," Weighbridges come in many different configurations. However, there are three main categories from which to choose, with the first one being full-length vehicle scales. These scales usually have 6-10 load cells joined together on a single platform. They are designed to measure the entire weight of the vehicle at once. As a result, full-length truck scales are the best for industries that charge for cargo by its weight, such as recyclers and cement transporters.Single axle scales usually measure the weight of one axle group at a time. These scales are not approved for commercial trade where transporters charge for cargo based on weight. With multi-axle vehicle scales, it is possible to get the aggregate vehicle weight along with individual axle weights for greater flexibility.
, With the first option, the ground is excavated and the scale is installed in a pit so that it is level with the road surface. While this type of vehicle scale foundation takes up little space, you still need to install a drainage system to prevent underground water and debris from causing damage.As the name implies, above-ground scales remain on the road’s surface. These scales are easier to maintain and service, but they take up more space, since ramps are required on either end to allow trucks to drive onto the weighing platform., For instance, be on the lookout for scales that protect cell load connection cables with stainless steel braided sheathing. Additionally, cell load systems that operate with quick disconnects instead of cables are easier and faster to service. Scales with this technology can save you time and money during servicing downtimes., Truck scales lose accuracy over time and will eventually require recalibration. However, the time between calibrations largely depends on the technology used by the scale manufacturer to maintain accuracy. This enables transporters that charge by weight from overcharging customers inadvertently or giving away product when the scale makes overweight errors., Cargo load may be measured for a wide variety of reasons, some of which include:It is possible to process these tasks using a scale that is integrated with data management software. Truck scale utility applications vary from those designed with basic functionality to advanced ones. Important features include:

Checking compliance with traffic safety regulations
Inspecting proper axle balance while loading trucks
Verifying stock balance after dispatch of orders
Calculating costs when charging by weight

Determine your main purpose for adding a tonneau cover to your pickup truck.,
Decide between a hard or soft cover.,
Think about how often you need access to your truck bed and to what extent.,
Consider your budget for a tonneau cover.,
Determine who is installing the tonneau cover.,
Think about whether you want to have the tonneau on your truck all the time or just occasionally.,
Consider how the height of your truck will affect the usage of the cover.,
Check the kind of bed liner your truck has.,
Consider whether you're planning to use the top of the bed rails.",How to Buy a Tonneau Cover for Your Truck," Are you looking for function, security, looks, versatility or easy removal?;
, Hard tonneau covers traditionally cost more and offer more security. Soft tonneau covers generally are less expensive but are more versatile.

, Do you need quick access to the entire truck bed on a daily basis or just occasional access? Both hard and soft tonneaus are available in folding, retracting and hinging designs. Most offer easy tailgate access and select hard tonneau covers also lock the tailgate when the cover is locked. A hard retracting or soft roll-up cover can quickly be opened for virtually full truck bed access, without needing to remove the cover. Soft and hard hinging tonneau covers can be lifted open but require some extra effort if you need to fully remove them. Soft folding tonneau covers can easily be totally removed or folded forward for bed access, whereas hard folding tonneau covers can be folded forward for bed access but are more difficult to fully remove.

, Soft covers generally cost $150 to $550 whereas hard covers start at about $500 and go up to over $2,000.

, Most soft tonneau covers can be installed in 30 minutes to 1 hour by someone with limited mechanical skills. Hard tonneaus generally can be installed in 30 minutes to 2 hours by someone with limited mechanical skills. However, most covers work best only if they are properly installed. If you don’t line up a rail correctly on a roll-up tonneau if may be more difficult to close. If you missed the correct seal placement on a hard tonneau it may not be as watertight. Soft tonneau covers tend to be more forgiving on the installation than a hard tonneau.

, Most tonneau covers are a clamp on style installation. This generally requires a hand tool or two. However, soft tri-fold tonneau covers install with hand clamps which allows this style of tonneau to be installed or completely removed in seconds.

, If you have a lifted pickup, a roll-up, snap, folding or hinging cover will be harder to use since your truck is so tall. A hard tonneau, which is heavier, compounds the situation more. If your truck is lifted you may need to get onto the tailgate to operate the cover.

, There are 2 basic designs of bed liners; under the rail and over the rail. A pickup truck equipped with a under the rail bed liner will not have any issues installing a tonneau cover. A pickup truck with an over the rail bed liner, (this bed liner is wrapped over the bed rails of the truck bed on each side and protect the top of the truck bed), can be very difficult to install. Especially if it’s an inside the bed mounted tonneau, it squeezes the width of the tonneau. If you have an over the rail bedliner, than most over the rail mounted tonneau covers will work, but the installation will be trickier. If you have an over the rail bed liner, its best to check with the tonneau cover you want to buy to make sure it will can be installed with an over the rail bedliner.

, Will factory or aftermarket bed rail caps limit your choices? Some tonneau covers are mounted inside the bed and some are mounted on the top of the bed rail. Most roll-up covers mount on the inside of the truck bed and this allows you have access to the top of truck bed rail to add tie downs or bed rails (provide your truck has stake pockets). Other tonneau covers mount to the top of the truck bed rails and cover your stake covers if you have them. As for bed caps, all tonneau covers will work with factory bed caps and most aftermarket bed caps. For aftermarket bed caps, if they are smooth stainless steel or molded abs you won’t have too many issues. However, diamond plate bed caps can make it harder to install any style of tonneau whether it’s an over or inside the rail mount. As this kind of bed cap is generally thicker and effects the tonneau seals and tonneau cover fit. If you have bed rails, bed caps or tie downs installed in your truck bed its best to check to make sure the tonneau you are looking to buy with work for you.

Know what manual pallet jacks are.,
Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks.,
Learn to recognize walkie stackers.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts1," Although not always considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries.

Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised.;
, Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries. 

Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.

, Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are not usually considered a forklift. However, they still closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms/mini warehouses, small scale warehousing, etc."
"
Know what standard counterbalance forklifts are.,
Consider how different standard counterbalance forklifts are powered.,
Be familiar with how many wheels standard counterbalance forklifts have.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts2," Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift., These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.

, They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces."
"
Get to know reach forklifts.,
Know what double deep reach forklifts are.,
Familiarize yourself with order picker forklifts.,
Recognize the disadvantages of picker forklifts.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts3," Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high shelves. Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type.

Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift.
Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.

, Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks., Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. This requires a forklift operator to replenish ground level product pallets if they run out. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air., The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of it tipping over."
"
Know what a heavy duty forklift is.,
Understand how heavy duty forklifts operate.,
Learn about container handling forklifts.,
Learn about reach stackers.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts4," A heavy duty forklift is an umbrella term used to describe a counterbalance forklift with a high lifting capacity. Most standard counterbalance forklifts in warehouses and manufacturing plants will only have a lifting capacity of 1.5-3 tons, whereas heavy duty forklifts have a lifting capacity of 5-50 tons!, All heavy duty forklifts will require significant space to be able to maneuver around. The higher the lifting capacity the forklift has, the larger the rear end (counterweight) of the forklift will need to be. The vast majority of heavy duty forklifts will be powered by diesel fuel, though some lower end heavy duty forklifts (with lifting capacities of around 5-8 tons) may still be powered by LPG/propane gas bottles or petrol fuel., Container handling forklifts generally come in two types: Laden and Unladen (i.e. for handling full or empty containers, respectively).

Laden container handling forklifts are usually capable of stacking full shipping containers 4-5 high, with lifting capacities ranging from 35-50 tons.
Unladen container handling forklifts are able to stack as high as 8 or 9 shipping containers high, but with a lifting capacity of only 7-10 tons (empty shipping containers generally only weigh 3-5 tons). For these reasons, an unladen container handling forklift cannot be used for handling laden shipping containers, as it will be extremely overloaded. (full shipping containers can weigh anywhere from 10-30 tons).

, Reach stackers are technically not forklifts at all; instead, they operate with a heavy duty boom that extends from the rear to the front of the reach stacker. Reach stackers often are highly sophisticated machines with on-board computers and other technologies. Their load capacity usually ranges from 40-50 tons. However, due to the extending boom feature, overloading is still possible."

Learn about articulated forklifts.,
Identify an all terrain forklift.,
Learn about side loaders.,
Learn about telehandler forklifts.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts5," These are also known as Bendi or Flexi Forklifts, Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve/put away stock in narrow aisles)., Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is all terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - no traction, get ""bogged"", etc...All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor., A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads., Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be reduced significantly"
"
Get to know what attachments are on offer.",How to Identify Different Types of Forklifts6," The use of these attachments sometimes results in forklifts being mistaken for a different type. Forklifts can actually be fitted with a wide range of attachments for many different tasks. Some popular forklift attachments include:

Carpet spike - Used for handling roll type loads such as carpet, textiles, steel, etc
Drum clamp attachment - Often has to be manually clamped to move around individual drums, attachments may also rotate (manual or powered).
Drum beak attachment - Used for transporting individual drums, the beak and jaw mechanism is designed to mechanically close and grab the drum when weight is placed on the jaw from the drum lip.
Fixed jib attachment - Used for lifting loads where a crane type attachment is needed, e.g. lifting a heavy steel grate out of the ground.
Fork positioners (not to be confused with sideshift) - Used to move the forks- widen or narrow, via the hydraulics while the forklift is in operation; useful for heavy duty forklifts or when many different pallet sizes are in use
Sideshift - Has become a standard attachment on the vast majority of forklifts; allows the moving of the forks and carriage left or right to increase accuracy in load placement or retrieval
Multiple tynes - Usually twin tyne or triple tyne; these attachments allows for handling of two or more loads at the same time
Fork slippers/fork extensions - Like the name suggests, slips onto the fork tines for extended fork tines to handle large loads (e.g. plasterboard) or handling two pallets at the same time.

Check your personal or your company's insurance policy to verify coverage.,
Transport to the job site.",How to Rent a Forklift," How much weight is the forklift required to lift and carry? An average forklift has a weight capacity of 5,000 lbs. Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot do the job. Also, how is the product packaged? Is it on pallets or sitting on the floor? Is it uniform in size or irregular? Is the product secured i.e. shrink wrapped or strapped? Make note of this information because you may require special fork attachments.;
, The next factor to consider is reach height. Similar to weight, measurement must be as accurate as possible. Not only do the forks need to reach a certain height (as determined by your facility), but it must have the ability to lift the weight of your load to that height. A forklift that cannot tolerate the amount of weight or lift that weight to the proper height is not only a waste of time and money, but it is very dangerous.

, Will the forklift operate in a warehouse, factory, construction site, lumberyard, ship’s dock? The environment makes a difference in determining the type of tires the forklift will need. Additionally, what is the required turning radius and what is the minimum aisle width, if any? You need to be able to maneuver the forklift through the space in which you are working.

, It is not inexpensive to rent a forklift, especially on a daily or weekly basis. Be prepared to spend at least $100 per day for a standard 5,000 lb forklift. In addition to rental rate, there are also operating costs such as fuel (LP or Diesel). Refer to the ""Tips Section"" for Estimated Rental Costs.

, Do you need the forklift rental for a day, week, month or more? Do not make the mistake of walking into or contacting a dealership to rent a forklift the very day you need one. Make your plans in advance once all your notes and measurements are complete. The per-day rate is less when you rent for longer periods of time. Ask about overtime charges, too. The costs for most forklift rentals are based on a regular 8-hour day/40-hour week/160-hour month. If you require more hours then overtime charges will usually apply.

, Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. Arrange for the rental at least one week in advance to ensure the type of forklift you need is available.

, Renting from a dealership ensures reliable equipment and a qualified professional to help recommend the appropriate equipment for your situation. However, just like when you rent a car, it is your responsibility to examine the forklift for signs of damage before you rent it. Make notes on the contract or attach a separate sheet of paper before you leave. When you use the forklift, treat it as if it were your own. Dealerships will charge extra for forklifts that are damaged upon return.

, The forklift rental agreement will provide all the particulars on the terms and conditions of the contract. Ensure you agree with all aspects of the rental agreement and keep a copy for your own documentation purposes.

, The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift.

, How will the forklift be transported to the job site? It is best to let the dealership do it if they have delivery service available. (Another cost to add to your budget.) This machinery must be loaded and unloaded carefully, so it really is worth the extra cost to let the professionals do it.

Keep all moving parts well lubricated.,
Check fluid levels regularly.,
Keep your forklift charged or fueled.,
Keep Forklift Gauges Functioning Properly.,
Keep Forklift Tires in Good Shape.",How to Maintain a Forklift," Most moving joints, or parts, of the forklift are greased. This is done to prevent the harmful effects of friction. Ensure that all these fittings are greased on a regular basis, making sure to remove all worn out ball bearings.;
, There are various fluids that help the engine and other working parts of the forklift to run efficiently. These include the transmission and hydraulic fluids, coolants, as well as motor oil. Check these fluids regularly, albeit depending on how often the forklift is being used. Daily checks are necessary if the forklift is used on a daily basis.

, Forklifts may be powered by battery, liquid propane (L.P.) gas, diesel fuel or gasoline. If your machine uses a battery, then make sure to ensure that the battery is fully charged always. Also, make sure the tank is always full, if your forklift uses gas or fuel.

, Gauges and lights found on the instrument panel of the forklift give an indication when some part is malfunctioning. Therefore, attention must be paid to these instruments and the appropriate measurements taken, when they indicate any faults. Doing so will forestall more expensive repairs.

, In the process of forklift maintenance, another important aspect that should be checked daily is the tires. If the tires use air, ensure that the correct air pressure is maintained in them. In case the tires are solid rubber ones, make sure that there are not any gashes present. Failure with the tires could lead to an unbalanced ride, potentially leading to damage of the goods being carried.

Make sure the gas bottle is empty.,
Wear PPE.,
Turn off the gas valve and disconnect the gas bottle from the forklift's gas connection hose.,
Undo any strapping/gas bottle securing latches and put away the gas bottle.,
Get a new bottle, restrap, reconnect, turn on and start!,
Start the forklift.",How to Change the Gas Bottle on a Gas‐Powered Forklift," Often you will know the forklift gas bottle is empty when the forklift's engine suddenly dies out or stops working. However, a common mistake is to start with the gas valve turned off; this will often let the forklift for a few minutes before the engine stops, giving you a false impression that the forklift has run out of gas, when in fact the valve is simply turned off.

An empty gas bottle is not necessarily checked by the fact the gauge reads ""empty"", as this gauge is often inaccurate and will not correctly measure the amount of fuel left in the bottle (e.g. a gauge reading ""empty"" may still be driven for up to 30 minutes or more!).
To know if the gas is actually empty, note whether the engine dying out and stopping when the valve is ON and everything is connected, and, once disconnected, the empty gas bottle will be extremely light on its own. A full bottle will usually weigh almost twice as much as an empty one.;
, Although in many countries and companies, this is not enforced at all by legal, work safety, or company policy, it is highly recommended to wear the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) consisting of glasses and gloves, as a minimum, when changing the gas bottles on gas powered forklifts. Even when everything is done correctly, faulty seals, faulty gas bottles, and other factors can contribute to significant ""gas leaks"" when removing or replacing the gas bottle to the forklift.

Even when the valve is closed, gas can still violently ""spray out"" and cause significant cold burns or even blindness. In any case, caution is always preferable when removing or replacing the forklift gas bottle.

, Once you are ready to change the bottle, ensure the forklift is in neutral and the handbrake applied, turn off the gas valve and slowly unscrew the gas bottle from the forklift's gas hose, thus disconnecting the gas bottle connection from the forklift., Depending on the forklift model, this may be a simple snap latch system, or it may be a custom built strapping system. Ask for assistance if you are unsure.

Similarly on any worksite, you will need to ask your supervisor/other co-worker where the empty forklift's gas bottles are kept. Some workplaces will have a separate cage or area for them; others will have the empty bottles turned upside down with the other bottles.

, Once you have your new/full gas bottle, you can replace it back on to the forklift. As full gas bottles are almost twice as  heavy as empty bottles, you may want to ask a passing by co-worker to assist you lifting the gas bottle onto the forklift. Restrap the bottle, and always ensure it is turned OFF before reconnecting the forklift gas hose to the bottle.

If the gas bottle does happen to be turned on while you are connecting it, this is certain to cause a spray of gas/gas leak leading to possible cold burns!

, Once the forklift has been properly reconnected (make sure it's moderately tight, and not cross threaded), you may turn the gas on and start the forklift. The forklift should start within seconds; you can ""rev"" the forklift to be sure the gas has been correctly changed.

Now the forklift driving begins!

Be sure the charger is correctly matched to the battery.,
Be sure the charger cables are not damaged or heat worn.,
Keep a watering log in case of a warranty claim.,
Charge the battery no more than 300 times a year for 5 years (1500 cycles) to not void the warranty.

,
Allow the battery to charger a full 8 hours through the gassing stage.,
Equalize charge your battery once a week.",How to Charge a Forklift Battery," This means that the charger has the correct output voltage (12, 24 volt, 36 volt, 48 volt, etc). Also, the output Ampere Hour rating on the charger is closely matched (within 10%) of the AH rating of the battery.;
, The connectors should be in good shape, not damaged or cracked. Also, the connectors should not be burned or pitted and they make a good electrical connection with each other.


If the lift truck consumes greater than 40% of the battery's charge at the end of the workday, the battery should be placed on charge for a full 8 hours.
Batteries are watered after they are fully charged. The water should be distilled or free from heavy mineral content and the levels in each cell should be raised to just above the perforated grid. Do not overfill. Do not water an uncharged battery - it can overflow.

, The manufacturer will want to see your watering records.

,, This helps recombine the electrolyte (acid) throughout the battery and keeps the battery running optimally.


The gassing phase or charging a battery produces oxygen and hydrogen. Never inspect a charging battery with an open flame. Never smoke around a battery. Charge the battery in a well ventilated area, never in a small room.

, This is a longer charging cycle and is often performed at the end of the week.

Determine what type of forklift you need.,
Contact used forklift dealers and other possible sellers.,
Visit sellers and compare potential used lifts.,
Make the purchase once you are satisfied that you have found a used forklift in good operating condition.

",How to Buy a Used Forklift," Forklifts vary in brand, size and purpose. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.


How much weight does the forklift need to lift? Always purchase a lift that can handle at least the heaviest load, even if you rarely lift that much weight.
What is the maximum height the load will be lifted? Forklifts vary in how high they can lift a load. Again, think in terms of at least your maximum height.
Will the forklift be used outdoors or indoors? Engine forklifts are typically used outdoors and electric lifts are used indoors.;
, Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.


Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in.
Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale.
Local businesses that recently purchased a new forklift may be selling the used model directly.

,


Ask the seller how many hours the lift has been used. Most machines have an hour counter that keeps track of its running time. The hours of operation are more important than the year model when it comes to buying used forklifts.
Look over the maintenance records. Has the forklift been maintained and serviced on a regular schedule? Check to see if any parts have been replaced during the service.
Inquire about the factory warranty. If it is expired or soon will expire, it may be possible to pay a fee to extend the warranty. Equipment with a warranty is your safest purchase.
Have a qualified forklift operator view and test-drive the lift.
Ask a mechanic to check the forklift for potential problems that you have identified or might have overlooked. Add the cost of needed repairs into the selling price when making comparisons.

"
Practice.,
Complete the pre-operations checklist.,
Familiarize yourself with all controls and meter readings.,
Note the size and shape of what you are lifting.

,
Make sure the fork you are using is set to the proper width.

,
Lift an object only to the height needed to move it, so as to balance the weight.

,
Observe your working environment, make sure it’s clean and clear of obstacles.

,
Start the forklift using the key and start button.,
Practice driving the forklift in an open area.",How to Drive a Forklift," Driving a forklift is nothing like driving a car. Forklifts are steered by their rear wheels, have unwieldy weight distribution, and often have counter-intuitive controls. Depending on where you operate, you may need a license or specialized training.;
, Look around the vehicle for any damage or malfunction that might prevent the forklift from operating as it is intended. Pay special attention to hydraulic mechanisms and tire conditions. This is very important!

, This can be done by reading the operator’s manual.

,,,,, Move it through basic operations. There will be knobs and levers that move the forks up and down, steer the vehicle and control the speed.

, Try lifting empty pallets or bags of sand to get used to the controls. Once you are comfortable, you can begin your intended chore.

Get a shallow drain pan and slide under the forklift.,
Run the engine until the oil is warm to very warm; then stop the engine.,
Use a proper sized wrench to remove the drain plug from the oil pan.,
Wait for the oil to drain.,
Move the oil pan under the oil filter.,
Take the new oil filter and put some oil, either new or used, on the rubber seal of oil filter.

,
Screw the filter back on until the rubber seal makes contact and turn the filter 1/4 to 1/2 turn more.,
Refill the engine with 4 quarts of oil and dispose of your old motor oil in a proper way.

,
Start the engine.",How to Change Oil on a Forklift,";
, This will make drainage quicker and stop excessive thick oil from sitting on the walls of the engine.

, Approximately 4 quarts of oil will come out on a standard 4-cylinder engine forklift.

, Check the plug sealing washer for damage or to much squash, replace if required. (Fiber washers should never be used as they can crack in service, Copper washers should be annealed to bright red and quenched in water to soften and clean.) Then put the plug back in but do not over tighten, you should feel the washer only start to squash or tension to specifications.

, Get the proper sized oil filter wrench.

,, Don't over tighten.

,, Check for leaks immediately and after 1 hour of running.

Find axles.,
Buy wheels, if your axles did not come with them.,
Build a trailer frame.,
Make a trailer tongue.,
Weld a hitch that is compatible with the vehicle you will use for towing to the tongue of your trailer, where the 2 tips meet.

,
Attach the axles.,
Cover the frame with heavy gauge metal plates cut to size and weld them in place.

",How to Build Trailers," You may use 1 axle or 2, but it is recommended that you use 2, as 2 axles will carry the most weight and give you the best shock absorption. You have some choices when it comes to searching for axles for custom trailers, so keep the following things in mind:


A junkyard is a great place to find inexpensive axles.
You can make a trailer out of old truck axles or mobile home axles.
The axles you choose should have springs and brakes.
When shopping for axles, keep in mind that you will want to build a trailer that is approximately 100 inches (254 cm) wide. If you buy axles that are wider than that, you will need to cut out the middle section of them and weld them back together, to the appropriate dimension.;
, Use only tires specifically made for trailers. They should be 15 inches (38 cm) wide and made of bias-ply nylon.

, Use 4 inch (10.16 cm) by 4 inch (10.16 cm) steel bars.


Weld sections of steel bar together to make a rectangular frame in the size you desire.






Verify that the frame is a perfect rectangle by checking the corner angles and the cross measurements from one end to the other.
Cut 5 steel bars to the width of the frame using a chop saw with a blade specifically made for cutting metal.
Lay the axles underneath the frame for reference. They should be 16 inches (40.6 cm) past the center mark, toward the end of the trailer.
Weld the width bars to the frame to provide stability. Start with the center bar, which should be placed in the middle of the 2 axles. Weld the next 2 bars at either end. The remaining 2 should be welded at the spring hanger mounting points.







, Use 4 inch (10.16 cm) by 4 inch (10.16 cm) steel bars.


Use the chop saw to cut 2 41 inch (104 cm) lengths of steel bar.
Position the steel bars so that half of them lie underneath the frame and the other half of the extends out the front of the frame.
Weld them to the front of the trailer frame, 1 on each side, angling them so that their ends meet, forming a triangle.
Use the chop saw to cut the tips where the steel bars meet, at the front of the trailer, and weld them together.

,,


Flip the trailer frame over so that its underside is facing up.
Lay the 2 axles on the underside of the frame, lining them up so that they are on either side of the center crossbar of the trailer frame.
Weld the spring hangers of the axles to the frame.
Flip the trailer over and finish welding the axles on from the top of the frame.

Devise a strategy.,
Practice in an empty space such as a parking lot.,
Get a spotter.,
Adjust your mirrors.,
Try to set yourself up so that you’re backing up towards the driver's side of your vehicle.,
Place one hand on the steering wheel and turn your body and head to look behind you and at your trailer.",How to Back a Trailer1," Recognize that backing up a trailer requires preemptive motion of the towing vehicle to move the trailer in the correct direction. A pre-planned route is required, keeping in mind the direction of the trailer, the direction of the towing vehicle, any object in the immediate vicinity of the driving path, and the relative motion between all involved objects.;
, Buy some small orange cones to help spot you. Try learning with a long trailer, and then attempt a small trailer. Whenever you are learning be sure to take it slow. Short trailers are more maneuverable and responsive, thus more difficult to reverse. Longer trailers are more forgiving of mistakes, but will take more work to get around a corner.

, A spotter may be helpful as another pair of eyes behind the trailer will be able to see things you (as the driver) cannot. You can even invest in a set of short-range 2-way radios. This will make communications a lot easier than yelling and/or trying to watch a spotter.


The spotter needs to remember to look up! It's easy to become so preoccupied with obstacles on the ground that you forget to check overhead for tree limbs and wires. Always watch for leaning trees you may miss the base of the trunk just fine, but if that tree is leaning toward your trailer, it will take a bite out of your rig high up on the roofline!

, It’s going to be very important that you can see behind you, since you’re going backwards with a big rig attached to your truck. Make sure that the mirrors are adjusted so that you can clearly see the rear of the trailer. , You will be able to see the rig and the site much better in your driver's side mirrors and can also glance back over your shoulder and see the rear of the rig. If you need to drive a loop around the campground to be able to approach the spot on your left side, then do so!

, Put place your right hand on the bottom of the steering wheel (6 O-Clock position). That way when you’re ready to move you’ll simply move your hand in the direction that you want the rear of the trailer to go! Try it! If you use this hand position, it will all but eliminate turning the wheels the wrong way while backing up.

"
"
Turn the wheel to the right to make the trailer go left (as you are looking toward the front of the vehicle).,
Back the trailer to the driver's side (e.g.,
Pull past as you approach the space and turn right to the middle of the road.,
Place your hands at the bottom of the wheel.,
Back up and pull forward as often as necessary until your trailer is in place.",How to Back a Trailer2," Another way to look at it is, the bottom of the steering wheel directs the trailer. Facing backwards tends to help the backwards feel of steering the trailer. If you need to turn the trailer around a corner, steer the trailer toward the corner. Then you must steer slightly in the opposite direction to maintain the turning angle.

, to the left in a left-hand drive car) not the passenger side, which is harder to see. The most common backup is a right angle.

, This is assuming that you are attempting a left-hand drive. Now turn the vehicle sharply left, so that you are positioned at an angle. You should be at less that 180 degrees on the left hand side as if you have been driving forwards around a left hand bend.

, As you reverse adjust the steering wheel to keep the trailer traveling in the right direction. Remember to go slow. Don't be afraid to step out of the vehicle and check out the progress you've made. There's not use trying to do it in one try to keep your pride if you end up wrecking your trailer. It is important not to get the truck and trailer jackknifed, so do not let the turn go too far. Ideally, you can back into the space in one smooth motion. You almost always will have to stop, pull forward to achieve a more straight reverse.

, Sometimes the hardest part of the process is having many people watch you. Try not to stress out if there are a lot of people checking out your progress. They aren’t invested in the outcome, and you are. Keep your focus.

Fill the differential with 75w90 gear oil, adding the friction modifier between the first and second quart of gear oil.,
Remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle back to the ground.",How to Service a Dana Posiloc 9.25 Differential," You will want to decide if it is time to tear down the differential, and there are a few ways to decide if a tear down is needed.
, Make sure the vehicle is supported if you use a jack, use solid blocks or jack stands designed for this purpose., Remove the filler plug, and use a clean screwdriver or other slender object to dip inside the differential to check the fluid level. If the fluid is very low, continue with other diagnostic steps before filling it, since a tear down will require draining and refilling the differential, and any gear oil you add will soon be discarded., The tire should move freely a few inches before the opposite wheel begins to turn. If one of the clutch packs has failed, metal parts will cause a grinding noise when the wheel is turned. Bearings and shims can also produce noises if they are substantially worn or damaged., If there is, an axle bearing has failed, and the differential will need to be disassembled for a repair to be made., Vibrations and noise while driving can be caused by a universal joint or pinion gear bearing failure. From underneath the truck, with the vehicle out of gear, rotate the driveshaft forward and backward while feeling for and listening for sounds or loose play in the universal joints. From near the tail end of the drive shaft, any noises produced by manually rotating the pinion assemble should be easy to locate., Lower the truck to the ground, and prepare for a road test. You will want to locate a wide, flat, smooth area to road test the vehicle: a large, empty parking lot would be ideal. Drive the truck slowly across the pavement, making sharp turns both to the left and the right while listening through an open window for grinding noises. Since the wheels turn at different speeds from each other on a tight radius, this extreme turning may produce sounds indicating a problem., Otherwise, top off the gear oil with a mixture of 75w90 gear oil and friction modifier and continue driving the truck as you normally would, paying attention to any sounds coming from the rear end while driving., You will need to get the back wheels as high as you can so you will have room to work underneath it. Make sure the emergency brakes are in good working order and, if possible, do this work on a concrete driveway or on a garage or shop floor. If you have to work on dirt or grass, it is a good idea to lay plastic sheeting down and then place two sheets of plywood beneath the truck so parts won't be lost while you work., You will also want lots of clean rags or paper towels on hand., If you cannot find one, you won't be able to remove the carrier and disassemble the differential. One can be made by welding a 1½ inch nut on the end of a 30 inch (76.2 cm) long piece of 1 inch (2.5 cm) steel tubing, and grinding the flats on a taper down to 1¼ inch., It helps to have a workbench with a solid wooden surface, a bench vise, and bearing pullers, as well. For removing bearing races from the axles and differential, you will also needs a heavy (3 or 4 pound) hammer and a length of 1½ inch steel pipe., You can wait until the tear down is complete if you like, but since some parts will require special ordering, it is better, if practical, to locate them before beginning the actual rebuild. For a complete rebuild, you will need:

Axle bearings and seals
Clutches and clutch retaining clips
Differential bearings and races
Pinion bearings, crush sleeve, and seal
3 quarts 75w90 gear oil and 4 ounces of posiloc friction modifier

, There should be four bolts, requiring a 15mm socket or wrench, holding it in place. You will need to pry the drive shaft toward the front of the truck to allow it to drop down, then the rear end can be swung around out of your way. Make sure you keep track of the bolts you have removed., You may have to lock the emergency brakes to prevent the pinion gear from spinning while you break it loose. To remove the nut, you will need a 1¼ inch socket and a breaker bar., A screwdriver or small pry bar may be used to pry out the oil seal., The bolts fastening the cover in place are 13mm (½ inch), and two should have tags on them, identifying the gear box ratio and assembly information. When all of the bolts are removed, position a large oil drain pan underneath differential cover, then pry the cover off slowly and carefully. When the cover breaks free from the gasket adhesive the oil will dump into the catch pan., You may want to spray an engine degreaser or use mineral spirits to clean the differential carrier after the oil has been drained. You will now be able to see the spider gear set, wrist pin, ring gear, and the back of the pinion gear. If you look closely, you can also see the clutches, behind the axle end gears. Look into the oil remaining in the bottom of the differential for metal parts or residue, and on the magnet located in the lowest part of the bottom for accumulated parts/metal residue., It will have a 5/16 head and be located on the right side of one end of the pin. Remove the lock pin by turning it counterclockwise until it is free of its threads and then pulling it out. Only the shoulder of the pin is threaded, the rest slides through the wrist pin lock bolt., Make sure it is rotated so that there is enough room to slide it far enough to clear the axle bolts without it binding on the pinion gear or the differential housing. If the wrist pin is pushed too far out, the spider gears may drop out of the carriers. This isn't really desirable at this point, but if they do, simply collect them and their shims and place them in a safe, clean location., Make sure you have released your emergency brakes. You may want to remove the wheels and brake drums to make the axle assemblies lighter, although this isn't absolutely needed., They will be coated with gear oil, so set them down on a clean, level surface to be prepared for reinstallation later. You can inspect the axle bearings and seals once you have removed the axles, but this is optional, and not a part of the differential rebuild. Still, if you suspect wear and tear on these parts, now is the time to deal with them., This will keep the axle end gears and spider assembly together when the carrier is dropped out of the differential housing., These are located in the center of each cap, and will require a 12mm wrench. They do not have to be completely removed, but only loosened enough so that the internal preloading nuts can be rotated. Taking them all of the way off will, however, make cleaning these parts a bit easier., You will turn these counterclockwise until the bearings are free, about 3 to 4 turns each. If you are not going to take time to set up the rear end later, you need to count exactly how far you back these nuts off so they can be returned to the same position during reassembly., These hold the bearings which in turn support the carrier, which weighs nearly 50 pounds, so you may want someone to help support the carrier when these bolts are removed. Place each carrier cap with its bolts in separate places on their respective sides so they will be reinstalled the same way they came out.

These are cast iron clamps, with one side and one surface machined to fit, and should not be reversed.

, Lay it on some clean rags and place it on a workbench or in a convenient place to do the bearing/clutch replacement later. Look at the ring and pinion gears for signs of significant damage now, to determine if their condition will allow favorable results in a rebuild. If there are severely damage teeth on either, or if the spider gears are damaged, it might be time to consider a complete replacement, rather than a rebuild., The assembly should slide out without too much trouble, but if a heavier force is required, take care to use a wooden block or other protective method to prevent damage to the threaded end and splines., You will want to be able to inspect the rollers in the bearings, the splines in the axle end gears, and the mating machined surfaces for obvious damage or signs of wear before continuing. Any serious damage to machined surfaces or gear teeth will require replacement parts not covered in detail in this article., This will allow you to roll the spider gears out of the carrier, and to remove the axle-end gears. When removing the axle-end gears, keep the clutch plates and clips together. The flanged clutch plates fall in an alternating order between the grooved discs, and the clips keep everything in position. If there is no obvious damage to these parts, you may choose to reinstall them, but replacement kits are available from several different sources., A bearing removal tool makes this easier: You simply slip half the tool over each side of the bearing, then install the bolts, and tighten them with their tapered edges forcing the bearing away from the mating surfaces. You can also tap the bearings off with a large cold chisel, rotating it and hitting it in different places to prevent it from binding as you go., It should slide off easily, but may require light tapping with a hammer and punch. Set the pinion gear on a flat, solid surface and tap or press the bearing off the assembly., You can use a section of steel pipe that fits through the housing from behind the race, or a solid bar, but make sure your tool fits squarely against the edge of the bearing race, and not on part of the housing. Tapping with a hammer as you move around the race should bring it out of the housing without too much trouble., You can use engine degreaser, or mineral spirits to accomplish this, but be careful since these are flammable. Use a container to catch the washout and dispose of it properly., Since gears are forged, then machined, they may have manufacturing imperfections like nicks in non-contacting surfaces, but the smooth faces of the gears should not have cracks, chips, or discolored areas that show evidence of over heating or binding., If not, you can order a replacement (usually paired with a matching ring gear of the same drive ratio as the original)., If you do not have access to an installation tool, you can use the old races as a driving tool when you tap the races into place, or use a very large socket that is slightly smaller than the outside of the race. Tap the race around its circumference by working on opposite sides and keeping it aligned with the machined surface of the housing. If the race becomes off-centered, it may bind or even break, so proceed carefully., Again, use care, since hitting the roller bearing cage or the bearings themselves will damage the assembly. After each bearing is installed on its respective shaft, lubricate it lightly with 75w90 gear oil., You may find it helpful to have a helper hold the pinion in place inside the differential housing while you install the crush sleeve and outer bearing. Once the pinion is installed, place the crush sleeve on from the outside, then set the outer bearing into position. It should slide onto the shaft with little resistance., Tighten the nut enough to hold the pinion assembly in place. If you have access to a wrench that will hold the flange to prevent it from turning, you can tighten the assembly enough to compress the new crush sleeve (it requires between 380 and 410 foot-pounds of torque, so it is very difficult to set the crush sleeve with ordinary tools). If not, you may have to wait until the carrier assembly is installed to lock the pinion in place while tightening it. Do not install the oil seal on the pinion shaft until final assembly (later on)., If you are using a torque wrench and torque multiplier, use the above mentioned torque specs, otherwise, tighten until there are two or three threads showing outside the pinion nut with the flange pulled all of the way into the front of the pinion gear housing., You will need to set the bearing preload, this should be between 12 and 20 inch-pounds of torque. This is the force required to rotate the pinion gear, and the tighter the bearings, (hence, the pinion nut), the higher the preload torque. Setting the preload too high will cause the bearings to overheat, and subsequently fail, whereas, too loose will cause whining when the vehicle is driven., 15 inch (38.1 cm)-pounds of torque is generally sought, but a torque in the 12 to 20 inch-pound range is acceptable., You can press these into place if you have a hydraulic press and suitable dies, otherwise, you can simply tap them in, using the same technique as with the pinion bearing. Make sure the taper is set with the larger diameter toward the carrier housing., Once they are in place, you will need to hold the carrier in a level position while installing the spider gears and shims. Using a sturdy table with a cloth to hold the assembly may help., Make sure the shims (concave washers that fit between the smooth face of the spider gear and the housing) are in position as you rotate both gears in opposition to each other so they mesh with the axle end gears. When the spider gears rotate so they are aligned with the holes in the carrier, you can reinstall the wrist pin., Set the retaining pin into the hole and thread it a short distance to hold the spider gears in place., Not setting up the gears may cause the ring and pinion interface to be out of tolerance, since new bearings and wear can change the dynamics of the ring and pinion gear's contact. Since you have a preload reference for the gear assemblies, you may decide to take a chance replacing the carrier in its original position.—That choice is up to you., You will want to get it into position facing the bearing sockets resting on the housing bottom before installing the outer races. Otherwise, they will fall off while it is being handled. Slide the races on the bearings, then shove the carrier into position., You won't need to fully tighten the bolts yet, if you are going to set up the ring and pinion gears using the gear marking paint mentioned earlier., If the bearings fit too tightly to allow the full number of turns on each side, decrease each side the same amount so that they are near the same center as before. This would be unusual, but is possible if the new bearings are slightly wider than the original equipment., If you can pry the carrier from left to right and right to left, there isn't enough preload on the assembly, so you will need to tighten the preload adjusting nuts more, going the same amount from each side. A small amount of end play may be tolerated when the carrier is set., This will let you know if the ring gear or carrier has been warped, and, after the true-ness of the ring gear is established, you can use the dial indicator to measure the gear runout or distance from side to side it can travel., This will ensure the pinion gear is set in properly and that its teeth engage the ring gear correctly. You can use an online chart or a reference guide to compare the wear pattern to determine if your gears are contacting correctly., If the teeth of the pinion gear are sticking out past the end of the ring gear teeth, the crush sleeve hasn't been tightened sufficiently. If the pinion gear teeth do not reach the toe end of the ring gear teeth, the sleeve has been crushed too far and will have to be replaced., The preload on the combined ring gear bearings and pinion gear bearings should be about 45 inch-pounds. If it is higher, you can back off the preload nuts on the carrier slightly, if it is lower, tighten these a bit., If you haven't torqued the pinion nut to crush the sleeve, you will have to install the axles to lock the pinion gear shaft in place to do so, then fall back to earlier steps in order to preload the pinion bearings and set up the ring and pinion gear., Slide the wrist pin out far enough to allow the axles to be installed far enough for the axle retainer clips to fit the groove at the end of each axle., If the clutch spines are not perfectly aligned, you may have to twist the axle back and forth as you apply a steady pressure to get everything engaged properly. Do not tap or bump the axle, as this can warp or damage the thin clutch discs., Some people use thread locking compound on the retaining pin but if you tighten it sufficiently, it shouldn't be needed., Check the torque specifications in the service manual for specific torque pounds for each bolt., Use a silicone gasket adhesive, and reinstall the cover. Tighten the cover bolts uniformly and allow the adhesive to set., Install the pinion shaft oil seal by tapping it into place. Put a little grease on the rubber sealing surface to protect it during installation of the pinion flange., Use red thread locking compound on the pinion nut to make sure it doesn't back off during driving. Tighten it to specified torque (80-90 foot-pounds), then turn the pinion to make sure the assembly rotates at the previous preload setting., Tighten them securely., The capacity of the differential is about 2⅔ quarts, total., You can now test drive it to see if your set up is correct. Grinding, roaring, or other noises from the rear end of the vehicle indicate an incorrect gear set up or bearing preload. If you hear these, cut the test drive short and disassemble the differential to look for problems."

Purchase a replacement part.,
You will also need:

Phillips-head screwdriver
Torx drivers #15,20,25
5/8 and /or 15mm open/closed end wrench
10mm socket
5/8 and /or 15mm socket
Ratchet and 6"" extension to fit your sockets
Torque wrench

,
Once the part arrives, you need to go to your local auto parts store and borrow a steering wheel puller.,
Open the hood and remove the terminals from the battery.,
This is a view of the steering wheel from below in the drivers side.,
Remove the tilt lever by turning it counterclockwise.,
Next remove the bottom cover which is held by 3 Phillips-head screws in the bottom and maybe a 4th screw in the right lower corner (as seen from the driver's seat).,Using a 10 mm socket and ratchet, remove the 4 nuts that hold the airbag in place

,
Pull the airbag gently and lay it down to expose the wires you need to disconnect.,
After disconnecting the wires, loosen the center bolt which holds the steering wheel and back it out until there are only 2 or 3 threads engaged.,
Remove the steering wheel and remember how the wires were routed through the steering wheel.,
Take the new clock spring and locate it on the steering wheel column and attach it loosely with the torx head screws.,
Re connect the battery terminals under the hood and test the horn button and see that the airbag light is no longer blinking.",How to Replace the Clock Spring in a 1987 1996 F150 Truck," You can find these in Amazon.com, eBay or your local auto parts store. No matter which way you go, you'll have to order it and wait for it as they generally do not keep them in stock. You can expect to spend $50 ~ $70 for this item.

Do not touch or disturb the new clock spring until later in the installation process.;
,, Advance Auto Parts lends those tools in Atlanta. Check in your area with the various Auto parts store. If they have one be sure to ask them to reserve it for you so you don't drive just to find it gone. Expect to leave a deposit for it with your credit card or cash. It should be around $20 which you'll get back when you return the tool. Then, park your truck in a safe place where you can work and if you don't finish you will not block anyone (including yourself)

Do not touch or disturb the new clock spring at this time

, Start with the negative post (black, on left)

, Note the 2 holes in the back of the steering wheel where the nuts are that hold the airbag. Also note the tilt lever right below the turn signal, windshield wiper stalk.

, There is a little wrench flat area just under the knob. If you find a wrench that fits it, use that to help turn it, otherwise use pliers or a small adjustable wrench.

,


you'll need a Phillips-head screwdriver

,,


The black wire is the cruise control (upper left)
The yellow wire is the airbag (lower center)

,


Use 2 of the bolts supplied with the wheel puller that will fit the 2 diagonal threaded holes to the upper right and lower left of the center bolt to attach the puller block.
Push the center bolt provided with the puller against the center bolt, but use a wrench to hold the center bolt so it does not turn.
After a few turns of the puller center bolt, the steering wheel with pop loose from the spline
Mark the position of the spline and the steering wheel so you will install it in the same place.
Remove the center bolt that holds the steering wheel..

, Now you see the clock spring exposed.


Look at the wire that connects to the ignition switch and pay particular attention at it's location.
Pull away the wire clip from the ignition switch.
With a torx driver remove the 3 screws that hold the clock spring to the steering wheel column. Save these screws, you'll need them later
Follow the yellow and black wires to the connections to the harness under the dashboard.
You can pull the connectors out of the metal bracket to make it easier to disconnect the plugs. You'll get new connectors that will snap back into the holes in the sheet metal bracket.
Notice the routing of these wires so you can route the new wires in the same way.

, Do not remove the 3 pronged white center piece yet!!


Route the wires back to the connections under the dashboard
Re-connect them as they were and fix them in the sheet metal bracket, be sure to route them as they were before.
Replace the clip and connector onto the ignition switch. This could be a bit of a problem. You might want to try reinstalling the old one back in to give you an idea of how it goes in, before forcing or breaking the new one.
Tighten the torx head screws that hold the clock spring in place
Remove the 3 pronged white plastic center part but take care not to rotate, move or spin it in any way.
replace the steering wheel on the spline routing the wires from the clock spring the same way they were before.
Replace the center bolt that holds the steering wheel and tighten it until it's seated. Torque the bolt to the correct tension using the torque wrench. Do a search for the correct torque value for the size of the screw (the size of the body, not the head).
Connect the cruise control wires to the steering wheel.
Bring the airbag and position it in the correct relative position to the steering wheel so you can re-connect the yellow wire to the airbag.
Replace the airbag onto the steering wheel and fasten it using the same 10mm nuts that you removed from it.
Replace the bottom plastic cover under the steering wheel using the Phillip-head screws you removed earlier.
Replace the tilt lever by turning it clockwise into its bracket. You might need a wrench or pliers to tighten it.

, You are done."

Determine the type of trailer you'll need.,
Decide the method of construction.,
Confirm your level of ability.",How to Build a Utility Trailer1," A utility trailer should be customized to your specifications. You will need to decide on the length, the weight capacity, and whether or not it will be enclosed. For example:


If the utility trailer will be used for lumber or building materials, it may need stronger suspension and larger wheels. For ease of loading and unloading—especially lumber—you would probably not want it enclosed. You would also want to make it long enough to hold lumber and sheeting.
For machinery and valuable tools, you would not only want it sturdy, but also enclosed and secure to prevent theft.
The vehicle that you will use to pull the utility trailer will also help determine the dimensions. For example, a utility trailer to haul groceries behind a bicycle will necessarily be much smaller than a utility trailer for a Suburban, built to haul a table saw.;
, You may choose to build a utility trailer from scratch or assemble a kit. Either way, the right tools and materials are essential. Search online websites for utility trailer kit plans or visit a home improvement store, or tractor supply dealer for ideas.

, In the planning stages, it's important to be aware of your construction and mechanical expertise and capabilities. Building a utility trailer from scratch will require welding skills, an aptitude for carpentry, and electrical knowledge to install taillights. It also helps if you're comfortable with heavy lifting.

"
"
Decide what type of trailer you want to build.,
Build the main body.,
Find 16"" wheels (preferably recycled ones).,
Attach a trailer arm.,
Construct the hitch.,
Screw a piece of appropriately sized and precut plywood to the top of the frame.,
Test drive your trailer carefully.",How to Build a Bicycle Cargo Trailer," Their advantages and disadvantages are as follows:

Two wheel trailer: greater load capacity, but only stable at fairly low speeds. The connection is also more complicated, as the coupling must allow the bicycle to move both left and right and to tilt. The cost is also higher, due to the trailer requiring two wheels and tires (usually the most expensive parts)
One wheel trailer: greater high speed stability but restrictive load capacity. The connection is easier to make -- the trailer tilts with the bicycle. One wheel trailers are also cheaper to build as you only need one wheel and tire.

, Use 4 pieces of 1 X 2 lumber. Make a ladder type frame by using 90 degree brackets and screw everything in.;
, Attach them to the frame using electric box cover plates bent into shape as shown. You can use bigger wheels if you want to get the trailer even height with the bike so nothing falls off.

, Use a malleable metal bar (e.g. from a used, cheap car bicycle rack). Bend and cut the piece into shape. Flatten and drill holes at each end. Bolt the finished arm to the frame tightly.

, Fold an electrical cover plate in half. Make a hole and bolt it onto the wheel and frame of the bike. Then bolt an eye bolt on that bracket. (Put some electrical tape over the eye bolt to soften or remove the clanking noise that is inevitable with this set-up.) Use a U-clamp (also called a shackle) to connect the trailer arm to the eye bolt.

, Add some eye screws along the edges for bungee cords to hold your cargo in place, if need be.

, Start with no cargo, then work your way up. Practice turns and acceleration. Inspect all the screws and bolts to make sure they're staying in place. The best way to avoid loose bolts use lock nuts.

Remove the steering wheel and turn signal assembly.,
Remove the ignition lock cylinder.,
Disassemble the lock cylinder.,
Re-key the cylinder.,
Re-assemble the cylinder lock and install.,
Re-assemble the steering column or tilt wheel.",How to Rekey a 1973‐1991 Chevy Truck Ignition Cylinder Lock," To re-key the lock cylinder you must remove the assembly from the steering column.  If it is a tilt steering wheel it will be much more difficult to work on as it requires a special tool to remove and install the horn ring and retainer clip, but there is a way around it.  Whether it is a standard or tilt wheel, the steering wheel needs to come off. 

First, and a must, disconnect the vehicle horn or battery then remove the center horn pad, then unscrew the locking nut until it is flush with the center shaft.  Mark the shaft and steering wheel with a marker or paint to help align the two when reinstalling. 
Using a steering wheel puller, gently tighten the puller until the steering wheel pops loose.  If you don’t have a steering wheel puller then a brass hammer will do the job.  Again with the nut flush with the center shaft apply upward pressure to the steering wheel and tap gently on the nut/center shaft with a brass hammer.  This may be accomplished by placing your knees under the steering wheel and flexing upward or by having someone else hold the steering wheel with their hands and pull upward.  After several taps with the hammer the steering wheel should pop off. 
Remove the nut and the wheel.  There will be a retainer holding the horn ring in place, remove the retainer and lift the ring out.  Next remove the three screws holding the turn signal assembly to the column as well as the screw holding turn signal lever.  Lift the assembly out of the way.;
, Look at the inside of the column housing just above and to the right of the center shaft and you should see a small vertical slot.  This is where the ignition lock catch is.  Insert the key to the ignition lock and grip the bezel of the lock assembly. Using a flat blade screwdriver gently press down into the vertical slot to release the catch.  The lock assembly will easily slide out. 

Place the lock assembly on a clean work area so as not to lose any of the small pieces that will be removed from the lock.

, The following applies to both the old lock assembly being removed and the new lock being re-keyed for replacement.

At the end of the lock cylinder is a pressed on retainer that limits the amount that the key can be turned in either direction.  Carefully remove the retainer and set aside. 
On the other end is the key slot and grip/tab bezel.  Behind the bezel is a spring washer and an indexing washer that aligns the detents to the brass pins in the housing.  Insert the key and rotate the cylinder to the accessory position. Pull back on the index ring and look at the upper part of the housing to see the tip of a brass pin against a nub cast into the cylinder. 
Using a very small screwdriver or paper clip, push the pin in while applying a small amount of turning force counter-clock wise on the key.  Turn the cylinder about one eighth of an inch and stop.  The cylinder will pop out a short distance. 
Back to the other end of the cylinder, look inside to see a brass pin with a black plastic piece in the center of the cylinder next to the brass pin.  Press slightly on the brass pin and then using a sharp pointed object slide the black plastic piece over the pin.  The cylinder will now slide out, but be careful not to let the two brass pins and their springs in the housing fall out. 
Now remove the key and locate a rectangular sheet metal cover plate on the cylinder.  Using a small flat blade screwdriver lift each end of the plate slightly alternating each end until it easily lifts off.  Be careful not to drop the small springs under the cover. 
In each slot is a brass plate, there are six, sometimes five but with six slots.  Insert the key and tap on the cylinder causing the brass plates to fall out. Each brass plate has a notch on its side that lines up with a ridge on the under side of the locking block on the opposite side of the cylinder from the spring cover plate.

, Unless you have a key chart and number guide for the brass plates you will be setting the plates by trial and error.  Insert a plate in the first slot and insert the new key.  Place a small amount of pressure on the plate using a small screwdriver. If the locking block drops down flush with the cylinder, great you have the right one. If the locking block stays above the cylinder then you will need to try another plate. Make note of were the notch in the brass plates are so that it will help in fitting the next one., Now that all the plates are set in order place one of the springs that you took out earlier over each plate.  Then carefully slide the spring cover down into the slots at each end.  Make sure that it is completely flat, then “stake” the ends by putting a short handled flat blade screwdriver on the edge of the metal next to the spring cover and tap with a hammer to form the cylinder metal down onto the edge of the spring cover.  If this is not done, the cover may work its way loose and lock up the cylinder making it useless. 

Check the cylinder housing to make sure that the brass pins and springs are in place.  Slide the spring washer and index washer onto the cylinder bezel, then line up the locking block on the cylinder with the slot on the housing and slide the cylinder in. 
If you feel resistance, it may be the plastic catch on the side near the back of the housing blocking the cylinder.  Just lift it out of the way and the cylinder should slide in the rest of the way. 
Check the lock for rotation and the removal of the key, several times.  Now gently press the limit retainer back on the cylinder and install in the steering column by gently sliding the assembly into the opening until it snaps in place.

,

For the steering column, put the turn signal assembly, horn ring and steering wheel back in by reverse order.  It should be noted that the horn ring and steering wheel have small teeth or ribs that are cut so as to line-up on the center shaft a specific way.  Do not force these pieces on.  Install and tighten the locking nut and set the horn pad in place. Reconnect the horn or battery.  Job complete.
For the tilt wheel, if you do not have the special GM tool to install the snap-ring for the horn ring then follow these instructions.  With the horn ring set over the bearing compression spring and aligned, place the snap ring over the center shaft loosely.  Now place the steering wheel locking nut on the center shaft until fully threaded. 

Place an 11/16” open end wrench under the locking nut, then place a piece of wood or soft metal, less that 3/4” thick between the open end wrench and the horn ring.  Using the open-end wrench as a lever push down on the horn ring slightly.  Use your thumb to press down on the opposite side of the horn ring so that it will move down over the shaft evenly.  #** Repeat this process until the horn ring is below the snap ring groove cut into the center shaft.  While holding the horn ring down with one hand, push the snap ring down the shaft evenly using a flat blade screwdriver until it snaps in place. 
Release the wrench, remove the locking nut and place the steering on the  shaft.  Install and tighten the locking nut then set the horn pad in place.  Reconnect the horn or battery.  Job complete.

Gather the materials and tools.,
Construct the trailer frame.,
Attach the axle and tires.,
Finish out the other parts.",How to Build a Utility Trailer2," Working according to a utility trailer plan will help you gather the right components. Once you have located a source for the materials, check with the customer service representative to arrange delivery. If you are a skilled welder and have the equipment you'll need, follow the manufacturer's recommended safety and procedural instructions.


Most designs consist of a bed, a hitch, a ""tongue"" (the wedge shape that extends from the front), an axle with wheels, taillights, and a license plate frame.
Many of the components for utility trailers (tongue, hitch, axle, jack, and taillight assembly) can be purchased fully assembled, allowing for easier construction.

, The frame will consist of 4 steel angle iron rods, 2 for the sides, and 2 for the front and back. Depending on the established length of the trailer, the sides might be longer than the front and back.


Weld the angle iron rods together for the bed frame. Assure the corners are squared.
Weld support beams made of flat iron across from side to side.
Bolt pressure-treated 2x6 inch (5.1 X 15.2 cm) boards to the frame, parallel with the sides inside the lip of the angle iron.
Cut lumber with a circular saw. Drill holes in the angle iron with a variable speed drill and drill-bit designed for metal.
Attach boards to frame bed.

, Use a hydraulic jack to raise up the frame. Block all 4 corners to keep it elevated. Weld the axle under the framing. On a rectangular frame, the axle should be attached with 60 percent of the frame in front and 40 percent in back to distribute the weight of the bed.


Using the lug bolts and nuts included with the axle kit, install the predetermined sized tires on the axle.

, Weld the hitch to the tongue and attach the assembly to the front of the frame. Attach the jack behind the hitch on the tongue. Route electrical wires from the front to the rear for the taillights. Assure the taillight connector is in front.


The taillight assembly will consist of a combination of park, brake, and signal lights. The wiring harness should be secured under the trailer and the lights attached to rear with bolts on either side.

Spilled drinks and food particles are a typical sight inside a vehicle. Keep your vehicle interior mess free with durable floor liners that are easy to clean.
, This important truck accessory allows summer adventurers to safely mount sport equipment and neatly organize different kinds of cargos., Shield your truck bed from damage by providing this protective cover. They come in the form of outdoor rubber mats, carpets, drop-in liners and spray-in liners.

Spray-ins are more popular these days. As the name suggests, it is a spray-on polyurethane coating that can also be used to protect side steps, bumpers and fenders. It provides the truck bed an anti-skid surface that prevents your cargo from slipping.

, They are also known as running boards and side steps. This truck accessory doesn’t only give your rig a tough look, it also allows passengers to conveniently get in and out of the truck, particularly those that are outfitted with lift kits., They keep the truck bed protected from getting wet and the relentless summer heat. It also secures cargo keeping it covered and hidden from the sight of thieves., These added auxiliary lighting can be mounted on top of your truck. It provides superior lighting for off-roaders who love to go on night adventures., Consider which kind of road condition that you will be often travelling to this summer. Whether you choose to go off-roading or simply go on a joy ride with your friends, it is best to equip your truck with a good set of tires that will meet your specific needs. Tires come in different types such as mud tires, all-terrain tires, highway tires, just to name a few., Your truck is exposed to different road elements when you travel. It is best to protect your truck’s exterior by installing mud flaps. Vehicles outfitted with mud flaps have cleaner fenders and paint surface because the mess is contained in the wheel well. It also minimizes the chance of damaging nearby vehicles by preventing the tires from hurling rocks, sticks and other elements during an excursion."

Understand what causes jackknifing.,
Understand that jackknifing is different from trailer slew or trailer swing.",How to Avoid Jackknifing1," Jackknifing occurs when the towing vehicle skids. If the driver is unable to correct it in time, the trailer pushing from behind will continue to push the towing vehicle until it spins around.;
, Here's the difference:

"
"
Be wary of light loads.,
Spread your braking over the longest possible distance, braking progressively and reducing your speed gradually.,
Avoid having to brake or even decelerate on a curve.,
If you ever need to take avoiding action, don't brake and swerve at the same time.,
Be very cautious about using your engine brake or retarder (exhaust brake / Jacobs brake / Telma / Voith etc.),
Jackknifing starts as a skid, so do your utmost to avoid skidding.,
Keep both tractor and trailer properly maintained.,
Modern anti-lock braking systems, first developed for aircraft to stop them skidding on the runway, are now fitted to heavy vehicles.",How to Avoid Jackknifing2," A heavily laden vehicle is unlikely to jackknife. Jackknifing usually occurs with empty trailers or when the weight of the load is badly distributed, providing too little traction where it's needed. The vehicle and trailer brakes are designed for a full load, and are far too powerful for an underweight trailer. When strong brakes are applied, the wheels could lock up, and cause skidding., It helps to drive a safe distance behind other vehicles and to try to anticipate what may happen ahead, allowing yourself plenty of time to pull up, especially on slippery roads and when you're going downhill.

, Apply your brakes while the vehicle is traveling in a straight line as you approach a curve. Slow down a little more than necessary, then release your brakes before you begin the turn. Apply a little power as you turn. This should prevent the drive wheels from losing traction. If you approach slowly enough, you'll find that you'll be able to speed up as you negotiate the curve.


Downhill turns are especially prone to jackknifing. If you're going down a steep hill and wish to turn off to the left or right, don't assume that the trailer will follow you. The trailer tries to continue straight on down the hill due to its momentum and gravity. You must slow it right down or even come to a halt before turning. When you're satisfied that you've checked the trailer's momentum, then you can pull it around the corner.

, Brake first to slow the vehicle down as much as possible, then release the brakes in order to swerve. In this way, you'll remain in control of the vehicle. Once you've swerved, you can re-apply the brakes if necessary.


If you ever need to do an emergency stop, for example, if a child runs into the road in front of your truck, don't stamp on the brake pedal. You should press it. Then press the clutch pedal to prevent the truck from traveling further. Hold the steering wheel with your hands in the 10 minutes to 2 position, keeping your thumbs out of the wheel. Press them against the rim, and lock your elbows inward.

, on a slippery surface. This could lock up the drive axle and cause jackknifing. An engine brake or retarder only acts on one axle, whereas the brakes act on all of the wheels. If you need to use the retarder to descend a hill, but the road is slippery, slow the vehicle down by braking gently first, then apply the retarder carefully. The same would apply if you were to engage a low gear.

, If, however, your vehicle starts to skid, take your foot off the brake immediately and correct the skid as you would with a rigid vehicle . If it isn't corrected, it will be aggravated by the trailer pushing from behind and the vehicle will jackknife.

, Uneven brakes, worn tires and faulty suspension components increase the risk of losing control.

, They can sense tire skid and automatically adjust braking force to prevent wheel lockup.

Park the truck in a place where you will be able to work on it efficiently.,
Remove the positive battery cable so any electrical short circuits will be avoided.,
Jack the truck up at the front end.,
Remove the front drive shaft, if it is 4wd.,
After you have removed all of these components, you need to drain the fluid from the transmission.,
Remove the shifter linkage cable.,
Remove the rear drive shaft.,
Remove the starter from the engine and remove the bolts attaching the transmission bell housing to the engine block.,
Use jack stands or a jack to support the rear of the transmission (and the front must not be allowed to drop, either).,
Remove the transmission, keeping it continuously supported, while sliding it toward the rear of the truck -- keeping the unit in line with the engine.,
Lower the transmission to the floor, and slide it out from underneath the truck, keeping it as level as possible and in an upright position.,
Install it in reverse order from the removal process.

,
Get the spline and input shaft to insert into the torque converter and pilot bearing.",How to Remove and Install a Transmission in a 1998 Chevy Truck," An ideal place is a roomy garage, but a concrete driveway, or at least a firm, smooth, level surface is needed to facilitate jacking the truck safely.;
, Failing to do so could result in damage to the wiring harness.

, You will need to lift the front wheels at least six inches above the floor so the transmission can be removed from underneath the vehicle when it is dropped down.

, Then remove the exhaust flange from the exhaust manifold. Remove the electrical and transmission oil cooler lines.

, After the fluid has drained out, you need to reinstall the fluid pan back on the transmission.

, Once removed, tie it up out of the way. Also, remove the speedometer cable and the vacuum hose from the shift modulator valve.

, This should give you the room you need to remove the transfer case from the rear of the transmission, if the truck is four wheel drive. Remove the six bolts and remove it.

, The front of the transmission will now be supported by the splined input shaft and mounts, so do not allow the rear of the transmission to drop in the following steps, or this could damage the shaft, seals, or torque converter assembly.

, Remove the two bolts holding the transmission to the cross member, and the four bolts connecting the cross member  to the truck's frame. Remove the cross member.

, You will need to slide it backward about 7 inches (17.8 cm) to clear the torque converter.

, You can now remove the bolts that attach the torque converter to the flywheel if it is to be removed for repair or replacement.

,, It's tricky. It has to be straight in line both ways with the insertion point, and preferably supported on its balance point (balanced from fore and aft, and side to side), securely strapped (for example) from falling, not dangling or flopping around. But, it must be angled the same as the car is (if the front of the car is raised for instance). It would be easier, if the entire car were lifted, level, not angled.


Gravity will fight your getting it in all the way in the spline-socket and into the bearing on the end, unless it is supported at its balance point and lined up perfectly.
Lifting the trans unsecured, or off balance, can cause chaos, wobbling, rolling, falling,...
The spline grooves must align both ways, vertically and horizontally.
The input shaft can hang-up on the pilot bearing edge, instead of proceeding in -- if the transmission is angled more than a few hairs -- if not balanced and aligned.
Do not allow the spline, alone to support the weight of the transmission.

It's usually free or low-cost and can be a great tool to help you find a rate that's in your budget. You usually enter the distance you're transporting your motorcycle, as well as its type, weight, and other details. The website may give you a rate right away. For bigger companies, however, you may have to wait a few days to get an e-mail with a rate estimate.Keep in mind rates may change depending on whether you're renting the trailer to transport the motorcycle yourself. If you're renting the trailer in addition to a UHaul, which you're having driven cross country for you, rates will generally be higher.
Some companies may not have online rate estimators. In this case, most companies will be willing to give you a quote if you call in their customer service line.

, If you have a flexible schedule, try playing around with dates. If you can move your motorcycle between September and May, rates will tend to be lower. Moving companies are very busy during the summer months, when many people move, and the cost of renting all moving-related equipment, including motorcycle trailers, will be sky high. If possible, rent a trailer sometime between September and May.If you need to move during the summer, consider if you could wait on transporting your motorcycle. If you can store it with a friend or family member, consider having the motorcycle transported a few months after your move to cut down on costs.
Even if you have to move during the busy months, try playing around with dates. You may save a bit of money on rental costs if you're renting starting on, say, a Monday rather than a Saturday. Fluctuations in rates based on small changes in dates are common with moving companies. Using an online estimator, see if you can shave off $30 or $50 by slightly tweaking your rental timeframe.

, You may be entitled to certain discounts or specials depending on certain factors. There may be a military discount with the company you're renting from, and most rental companies offer discounts to members of Triple A. Browse a company's website for discounts, as well as specials. If you rent during a certain month, for example, you may get 10 to 20% off your total., Many motorcycle transportation companies offer door-to-door shipping. This generally means your motorcycle will be picked up at your current residence and transported to your new home. While this may seem like a good deal, keep in mind door-to-door shipping services are not always possible depending on your location.Check local regulations before agreeing to door-to-door shipping. Trucks used to transport motorcycles can be up to 75 feet long. This may mean they're not allowed on residential streets. You may find, after paying for door-to-door shipping, you actually have to pick your motorcycle up at a nearby grocery store, school, or large business parking lot.

Consider purchasing or borrowing a trailer.,
Ask if your company will cover your moving costs.,
Get a tax deduction.,
Consider driving your motorcycle part of the way.,
Eliminate other moving-related costs.",How to Save Money on Motorcycle Trailer Rentals2," If you can find a good price, it may actually be cheaper to purchase your own trailer and transport the motorcycle yourself. You can browse sites like Craigslist and eBay, where you may find unexpectedly cheap rates. Just make sure to examine any trailer you purchase ahead of time to make sure it's in good condition. If you move a lot, you may want to invest in simply buying your own trailer.


If you're friends with other motorcyclists, see if anyone is willing to lend out their trailer. This will eliminate all the costs of renting and buying. If you're a trustworthy person, and have a solid relationship with someone who owns their own trailer, this may be a good alternative to renting.
It may be a good idea to do some research into what to look for in a motorcycle trailer. If you've never transported a motorcycle before, there may be specific requirements you should be aware of before making a purchase.

, If you're moving for a job, you may be able to get some of the costs covered by your new company. About 50% of companies will fund a new employee's full move, and about 97% will pay for at least some of the costs. If you can get your company to fund your move, some of this money could go towards your motorcycle trailer., If you're eligible for a federal tax deduction, this can save you 25% on your total moving costs. If you're moving for business reasons, you can usually deduct some costs from your taxes assuming certain conditions are met.For a tax deduction, you need to be moving at least 50 miles from your old home. You also must be working full time for at least 39 weeks of the first year in your new house or apartment. If you're a member of the US Army, however, you're eligible for a tax deduction on moving costs without meeting these conditions.
Save all receipts from moving. These will help you when you file your taxes.

, It can get costly to rent a trailer for a long trip. If you know anyone along the route to your new home, consider driving your motorcycle halfway. You can leave the motorcycle at the home of a trusted friend or family member, and then have it transported from this closer location. If rental rates are particularly high for the time of year you're moving, this may be worth the effort.

, If you're transporting your motorcycle due to a big move, try to cut back on other costs. You can save money by making small changes to your moving routine, which you can put towards your motorcycle rental.


Find free boxes for a move. If you're packing up all your belongings, box costs can get high fast. You can save some money by getting boxes for free. Ask neighbors, family members, and local businesses to pass along any empty boxes to you.Try to do as much of the moving on your own as you can. Avoid hiring movers or hiring someone to clean your home or apartment. Put in as much work yourself as you possibly can."

Budget for the cost of the trailer.,
Have a moving sale.,
Consider insurance coverage.,
Factor in additional fuel costs.",How to Save Money on Motorcycle Trailer Rentals3," Make sure to include the cost of a trailer in your moving budget. As you get ready for a big move, take a look at your finances. Figure out about how much you can put towards the move, and write down things like gas, UHaul rentals, and other expenses. From here, see how much you can reasonably afford to put towards a trailer. When making your rental decision, keep this figure in mind.

, Motorcycle trailers can eat up a lot of your moving budget. If you want more money to put towards a trailer, consider having a moving sale. You probably have a lot of old items you no longer need or want. Things like old furniture, books, movies, electronic equipment, and other items not making the journey with you can be sold for cash.You can have an old fashion garage or yard sale, selling items from your home. However, with the stress of moving, organizing a garage sale can be stressful. Consider selling things online. Post for sale items on Facebook. Create an account on eBay. Post ads on Craigslist.
When selling things online, you may end up selling to a stranger. If this happens, make sure you meet in a public place to make the sale.

, Most rental companies have insurance policies that protect them against theft or damage to your motorcycle. Make sure you look over this policy carefully before signing an agreement. Many companies offer insurance at additional cost and will reimburse you for any damages that occur during transport. It's a good idea to put any extra funds you have towards an insurance. A motorcycle is an expensive vehicle and it would be costly to pay for repairs or replacements out of pocket., Trailers add considerable weight to your vehicle, and as such, use up more fuel. Factor in the added fuel costs when totaling up the expenses. Make sure you don't go over budget with fuel costs.

Unhook the loose side.,
Pry off the plastic cover.,
Remove the screws.,
Slide off the visor.,
Fit the visor into its designated position.,
Secure the visor with screws.,
Snap the plastic cover into place.,
Check the visor.",How to Remove a Sun Visor1," Flip the sun visor into its down position and unhook the detachable side from the ceiling hook.


Push the loosened sun visor forward, moving it as close to the windshield as possible without breaking anything.;
, Wedge the tip of a flat screwdriver beneath the plastic cover of the main assembly. Carefully use the screwdriver to pry the cover completely off.The main assembly is the area where the sun visor remains fastened to the ceiling, and it should lie opposite the hook side. The plastic cover you need to remove will hide the main assembly from sight initially.
Look closely at the plastic cover. There should be a slit running down a portion of the top surface. Insert the screwdriver into that slit from the side, easing the tip beneath the cover as you do. Gently wiggle the screwdriver around until the plastic cover pops off.
You do need to work carefully since forcing the cover off with too much pressure can cause it to crack or otherwise break.
After the cover pops off, pull as much down as possible. If the back gets stuck, move the sun visor around to free the stuck portion so that you can remove it cleanly.

, Identify the mounting screws located in the main assembly. Use a flat screwdriver to remove all of these screws.


The number of screws will vary depending on the make and model of the car. In most cases, you'll need to remove two to four screws. Check all sides of the main assembly to locate all the screws.
Some of these screws will likely be torx screws, but you should be able to remove them with a flat screwdriver if you do not have a specialized one for this screw type.Work carefully. If your hand slips while you apply too much pressure, you could accidentally puncture the ceiling with the tip of the screwdriver.

, Once the screws are gone, the sun visor should be loose enough to pull out.


There might be a tab on the visor stem that hooks into the visor placement hole on your car. Carefully slide and twist the visor to clear that tab from the hole while pulling the visor down and out.

, Insert the visor stem into the visor placement hole in the car ceiling.Make sure that the blank side of the visor faces the windshield. The interior side (usually marked with mirrors, warning labels, or other features) should face you.
If the visor has a tab on the stem, hook that tab into the placement hole from the side. Once you hook the tab into place, the rest of the stem should slide in easily.
The main assembly surface should already be attached to the stem of the visor. Line up the screw holes in this surface with the screw holes located in the visor placement hole.

, Insert the same screws into the screw holes of the main assembly. Use a flat screwdriver to tighten them into place.


You may need to hold the visor with one hand while attaching the screws with the other. If this is too difficult, hook the detachable side of the sun visor into place to keep the visor steady while you work.
Ideally, you should save and use the original screws when re-attaching the sun visor. If you lost the screws or the screws are unusable, note that most vehicles use T20 or T30 screws for the sun visor. This can vary, though, so it's best to verify this information with another source, like the vehicle's user manual.

, Slide the opening of the plastic cover around the newly attached stem. Line up the perimeter of the cover with the perimeter of the main assembly, then push up on the cover to snap it back into place.


Replacing the plastic cover is usually easier than removing it, but you should still work carefully to avoid snapping or cracking the cover while bending and twisting it over the visor stem.

, Move the visor back and forth. Hook and unhook it. If the visor has its full range of motion and seems secure, then the process was successful.


If the visor seems loose, you may need to tighten the screws more.
Conversely, if the visor sticks, you may need to loosen the screws a quarter turn or check the placement of the main assembly to verify that nothing has jammed into the wrong position.

Lower the visor.,
Release the connecting tab.,
Repeat on the other side.,
Pull the visor away.,
Keep the visor lever down.,
Slide the visor into both side tabs.,
Rotate the visor into the helmet.,
Check the visor.",How to Remove a Sun Visor2," Rotate the sun visor as needed to drop it into its down position. Lift open the face cover to provide full access to the visor.


In most cases, the sun visor is controlled by a slide button located on the side of the chin or the side of the temple. Push the slide back to lower the visor.

Do not attempt to lower the visor manually if it is controlled by a slide button. You should only lower it manually if no such button exists.


Sit down and hold the helmet in your lap as you work on the visor. Alternatively, you can keep the helmet steady on a flat work surface while sitting or standing.
If the helmet has a separate chin section, you should open the chin and lock it into place before working on the visor.

, Locate the connecting tab on one side of the sun visor. Lift or bend the tab to loosen the visor on that side.This tab fixes the sun visor to the mounting pin on that side of the helmet.
Continue bending the tab outward until it snaps completely open and frees that side of the sun visor.

, Locate the matching connecting tab on the opposite side of the sun visor. As before, lift or bend the tab to free the visor.


Both sides of the sun visor should be very loose at this point.

, Lift both sides of the sun visor from their respective mounting pins. Pull the freed visor down and out to remove it from the helmet.


To prevent accidental scratches or fingerprints, you may wish to grab the visor with a soft, clean cloth instead of using your bare hands. A microfiber cloth is ideal.
Try to avoid scraping the visor against the inner shell as you remove it. If it strikes or slides across the shell, it may become scratched.

, The sun visor holders must be in the ""down"" position as you re-install the visor.


Check the controlling side button located at the side of the helmet. If necessary, push the slide back to lower the visor holders.
Keep the face cover and chin section open while inserting the visor, as well.
Hold the visor in your lap or on a flat work surface with the visor holders tilted up toward your face. This will usually be the easiest angle to work from.

, Carefully insert the sun visor in between the connecting snap tabs on both sides of the helmet.


If you cannot slide the visor into both tabs simultaneously, you may snap it into place one side at a time.
Hold the visor with a soft, clean cloth to avoid scratching or smudging it while you work. Guide the visor carefully into position while avoiding the inner shell, too, since it could easily get scratched on the hard surface.

, Once the sun visor locks into place, use the operating slide the rotate it back into the helmet.


Verify that the visor slides in between the inner and outer shells of the helmet. If necessary, use your fingers to guide it in between both shells for this first rotation.
This first rotation should help secure the visor into its proper position.

, Use the operating slide button to rotate the sun visor down and up several times. Check the visor each time to verify that it remains secure.


This step is crucial. If the visor isn't secure and you attempt to use it while riding, it may partially or completely fall off, blocking your vision in the process.
If the visor does seem loose, it's possible that you did not secure it back into both sockets correctly. Remove the visor and try re-attaching it again.

Know your terminology.,
Know what you will be towing.,
Determine the best hitch.,
Make sure you have the right tools.,
Plan your position.,
Perform any prep work.,
Position the hitch and tighten.",How to Attach a Trailer Hitch," There are some basic references you should be aware of if you’re going to decide to purchase a trailer hitch, and if you’re going to be driving a vehicle pulling a trailer. Acronyms such as GTW, TW, GVWR and GCWR will come up in descriptions and comparisons so make sure you know the basics to know what you’re talking about and what you need.;
, There are multiple hitch classes available that determine both what can be towed and the vehicle suitable. A Class 1 hitch for instance is good for just about any pulling vehicle and can be used to tow up to 2,000 lbs. In real terms this would be the equivalent of a jet ski or a cargo box. For anything heavier, you may need to go up a class. A Class 5 hitch is great if you want to pull something bigger and heavier, like a large recreational vehicle, but this hitch is designed for trucks so it won’t work with your car or minivan.

, Part of the decision, beyond class, is understanding whether a general hitch will suit your needs, or whether you should be looking at other options. If, for instance, your potential towing list is varied, or the conditions under which you’ll be towing may change, a standard hitch may not fit the bill. A curt hitch may be more what you’re looking for because it is more advanced and offers high mobility, flexibility of use and great durability. Although perhaps not a definitive guide to everything, Wiki can be a great resource in covering the basics in terminology, classes and variations.

, Some basic tools you’ll want to ensure you have ready include a wiring kit that includes a stripping and crimping tool, electrical connectors, and either electrician’s tape or heat-shrink tubing. You’ll also need a set of box/ open end wrenches in a variety of sizes. A good wrench – either a ratchet, air impact or torque – will make the work easier as well. Before you start, read through the instruction guide to be sure nothing else is required.

, Installing the hitch is going to require lifting and holding it in place. If you have a lift to raise the car, you’ll have clearance to get under and may even decide to enlist help holding the hitch in place. If you don’t have a lift, you’ll want to be sure you can lay under the vehicle safely so you can achieve both tasks. If you need extra clearance a sturdy jack system may work. Either way, you want to ensure the car is high enough to allow you to do the work and secure so you’re working safely. You’ll also want to be sure it is well lit so you can properly see what you’re doing.

, Before you move the hitch into place, perform any prep work that needs to be done. This might include drilling if you need holes and are comfortable taking this on, removing the spare tire if it is in the way, or completing any trimming that may be required.

, Whether you have a helper, a lift to hold the hitch, or you’re doing it yourself, you first want to position the hitch in its final place. Next, you’ll put bolts into place, at least one on either side, not tightened yet, but just to hold the hitch in position. Next you’ll want to tighten all of the nuts and bolts using the installation guidelines for recommend torque. It may also be a good idea to use a product like Loctite or some other thread locker to ensure the bolts don’t slip during later use.


If you’ve followed all of these steps, you’ve selected the right hitch for the work you have planned, you’ve properly installed it and now you’re ready to hit the road.

Allow the engine to cool off completely before beginning to remove parts.

,
Disconnect the battery cables, removing the negative cable first to avoid shorting.

,
Remove the serpentine belts or vee belts from the front of the engine if necessary.

,
Remove any accessories necessary to access the water pump(see Step 1), tying items you don't want to disconnect like alternators and power steering pumps out of the way.

,
Drain the radiator by placing a catch container underneath the pit-cock or drain plug at its bottom, then opening the drain.,
Remove the fan and fan clutch if they are attached to the water pump, making sure to keep bolts, nuts, and washers separated for re-installation later.

,
Remove the radiator hoses from the water pump.,
Remove the bolts that attach the water pump to the engine, making sure, once more, to keep these from getting mixed up with other bolts and fasteners.,
Pull the water pump off the engine.,
Compare the old water pump to the new one you have purchased to make sure it is exactly the same, including bolt positions, and shaft length.

,
Remove all remaining gasket adhesive and material from the mounting surface of your old water pump.,
Apply a thin, uniform coat of gasket sealer to the mounting surface where the new gasket will fit, making sure no excess sealant is inside the water pump chamber itself.,
Place the water pump gasket on the sealant on the water pump, pressing it firmly in place while making sure it is aligned correctly.

,
Position the water pump in place, being very careful the gasket stays in the proper position.,
Reinstall the water hoses on your water pump, making sure all the clamps are tightened snugly.,
Reinstall the rest of the components you removed during the tear down process.,
Fill the radiator with coolant (if you suspect you may have a leak, use clear water to test the system prior to use of expensive coolant).

,
Replace the battery cables after all the other components are reinstalled and secured, then crank the engine and check for leaks.",How to Fix a Truck Water Pump," Cars and trucks vary greatly, depending on the engine and accessories it is equipped with. You should find the water pump, then look at how much equipment must be removed to access it. Here are some things to look at to help you identify your water pump.


Many water pumps have the cooling fan mounted on the front. They may also have a fan clutch attached to the fan itself.
Most water pumps are mounted on the drive belt end of the engine. For conventional engines, this would be the front most area, for transverse engines, it would be the left side, facing the engine compartment from the from of the vehicle.
The water pump will have at least two coolant hoses attached to it, usually between 1- 1/2 inch and 2 inch (5.1 cm) diameter, and may also have the heater core supply hoses (about 3/4 inch) attached as well.;
, These include the following.


Air conditioning compressor. This device shouldn't be removed by inexperienced individuals, since accidentally discharging it can cause serious problems. Compressors are often mounted above the water pump, and can be difficult to work around.
Power steering pump. This item should be located in a position that doesn't cause difficulty accessing the water pump.
Alternator. This device is often above the water pump and is usually fairly easy to navigate around while working, but it is also not too difficult to remove if needed.
Fan shrouds. This metal or plastic device funnels the air through the radiator to increase the efficiency of the cooling system, and must often be removed to access the water pump. It may be held in place with clips or machine screws, and shouldn't be too difficult to remove.

, If you are fairly sure you can get to all the bolts, both to remove and reinstall them, continue, but if you have doubts, you may want to reconsider this project.

, Cooling systems can fail to perform properly for a number of reasons, including leaking hoses, clogged radiator vents, and low coolant levels caused by other factors. The following are common symptoms of potential or present water pump failure.


Water dripping from the weep hole in the water pump shaft.
Grinding or screeching sounds coming from the water pump indicating a bearing failure.
Wobble or loose play in the front shaft of the water pump.

, Auto parts stores sell rebuilt or new replacement parts, but some may require special order and may take several days for the part to arrive. Some exotic vehicles may require purchasing or ordering a dealer only replacement part. BMW(s), Jaguars, MG(s), and other cars are examples of this.

, Basic wrenches, included end wrenches, sockets, and ratchets are a must have, and you may find you also need screw drivers, nut drivers, pliers or other tools for removing compression clamps, and a gasket scraper. You may also find a torque wrench is needed to properly tighten the bolts when you reinstall them.

, You will need:


A water/oil proof gasket sealant suitable for moderate high temperature use. Aviation Form-a-Gasket or RTV Silicon are examples.
Gasket material if the pump doesn't come with a replacement gasket set.
Antifreeze/coolant suitable for your vehicle.
Replacement parts like radiator hoses, clamps, and belts if you want to replace these while you have them off.
Hand cleaner, rags for cleaning parts, and other sundry items.

, Unexpected delays may mean the care will be in one place for several days, so make sure you are not blocking your driveway or garage doors.

,,,,, Loosening the radiator cap will speed this step up considerably.

,, Some hoses are attached with spring type compression clamps, others are held on with high-gear screw type clamps. Use a screwdriver to pry off stubborn hoses.

, Notice if the threads of these bolts have a blue or red plastic-like material on the threads, and if so, make a note of their position since they may require thread sealant when they are reinstalled. Also note, often there are different length bolts on water pumps, and using a bolt that is too long for the hole may result in damaging your engine.

, If the water pump refuses to budge, recheck to make sure all bolts have been removed, then use a screwdriver or pry bar to break it loose. Often, a water pump installed with sealant can be stuck fast and require substantial force to break it loose.

,, Leaving even a small amount of debris will cause the new assembly to leak, requiring a complete disassemble to correct this problem.

, Also, apply a similar coat to the water pump base.

,, Install a couple of bolts (again, making sure any bolts that require thread sealant are coated before proceeding) to hold the water pump in place. When all the bolts are started in the water pump, tighten them in a criss-cross pattern so the gasket seats properly. Note that many service manuals call for specific torque requirements for the installation of your water pump, so if you are in doubt of your ability to properly tighten the bolts, invest in a good torque wrench for this step.

, You may want to replace these items, as noted earlier, if they appear to be deteriorated or damaged.

, Make sure all belts are tensioned properly and the drain plug is reinstalled or tightened as required.

,, You will want to top off the coolant after you have determined you don't have any leaks and the engine has heated up to normal operating temperature, since the engine block cooling channels will have to fill when the thermostat opens.

It will make the task easier and effective in reaching tight corners where hands or regular brush can’t reach. Leaving this part dirty and muddy, can accumulate rust over time, which can destroy the metal parts of your vehicle.;
, Make use of a car shampoo that is mild and safe for all types of paint finish. It’s not a good idea to using a dish washing liquid as a substitute. Dish washing liquids tends to cuts grease and dirt, so once you apply this on a protected paint, the wax or sealant that is in your paint will be removed. For regular car wash maintenance, it's best to use a non-abrasive car shampoo.


That being said, in some cases, using a dish washing soap can be good, if you are going to clay down or polish the paint after washing a vehicle.

, Start from the wheels and tires before heading to the paint finish. The logic here is to avoid getting the dirt back to the paint and maintain the cleanliness in the whole process. Use an all-wheel cleaner, to save time and energy in removing stubborn dirt and dust from the brakes. It will also soften the dirt and grime. Make sure to use a soft bristle wheel brush, especially for delicate and expensive wheel finish. Gently brush the grime and rinse after the process.

, Make sure to use a micro fiber mitt in the process. Rinse the mitts every time you clean a new panel. Move the mitts in a straight forward direction to avoid scratching the paint finish. Start from the roof of the vehicle, going down to the pillars and stop at the windshield. Rinse the mitts and continue going down to the bonnet and trunk. Make sure to rinse again before cleaning the bottom part of the vehicle.

, Make sure to adjust your garden hose pressure to low in order to produce a stable flow of water. This is called the sheeting method. It can help you dry the whole vehicle faster. To perform the process, start from the roof going down to the bonnet or to the trunk that goes the same with the windows and doors.

, Drying is the most time consuming process in cleaning the truck. However, there are some ways to make the task faster, with the help of some tools. You can air dry the whole car by using a leaf blower or pressurized air. After air drying, you can use a microfiber towel to wipe the excess water.

, Applying either wax or sealant on the truck's paint to retain the shine and preserve the paint finish, would be the last step on of the process. You can choose either a pure wax or sealant or combination of both. Just be sure to use a non-abrasive wax or sealant. To make the application faster, make use of an orbital polisher in applying the protection of choice. Spread the wax or sealant residue using a soft microfiber towel. And don’t forget to all apply some of it on the wheels and some tire black for your tires for a sleek looking finish.

, Start by removing all objects stored in the truck bed. If the truck bed is outfitted with a detachable carpet or a plastic liner, remove that. Use a broom to sweep the dirt and debris. This is also applicable to trucks with unlined truck beds and those with spray-in bed liners. Sweep every nook and cranny.

, Use a pressure washer to remove any excess dirt that was not removed from sweeping. Spray the water to the direction of inside of the truck bed up to the tailgate. Don’t forget to spray the water side to side, across the truck bed and its corners.

, Use a car wash mitt to scrub the bed. Do not use a brush to clean the area because its bristles can scratch the truck bed’s surface. Again start scrubbing from innermost part of the truck bed to the tailgate.

, Make use of a pressure washer to remove all the soap from the truck bed. Again, spray the water from the inside of the bed up to the tailgate, back and forth. Do it until the remaining lather washes off.

, Use a chamois to dry the entire bed. Wipe it until the entire area is dry. Apply a wax on the entire surface. Waxing it will keep it shiny just like the entire exterior of the pickup truck.

, Especially if you just washed the outside of the truck, it’s a good idea to also wipe dry the inner panels especially the doors cracks and crevices. To do this, open all doors and use a new set of microfiber towel to wipe it clean and dry.

, Use a suede towel or a clean chamois to wipe them. Their fabric doesn’t leave any marks after wiping and drying.

, Who wants to drive a shiny vehicle, but dusty or muddy in the inside? Vacuuming the seats and flooring will make the process faster and efficient. Start by removing the floor mats, you can either vacuum or wash it. Have it air dried if you choose to wash it. Vacuum the car seat's head rest, going down to the floor. In this way, you are assured that all dirt is removed. Reinstall the floor mats afterwards.

, After you have cleaned the interior, you will surely want to keep it clean, right? Using an interior cleaner would be the best solution. Just make sure to choose the right product. Using a foam applicator pad can help spread the product evenly and effectively.

, Since the accumulator contains a desiccant to remove moisture from the refrigerant, if the system has been discharged and improperly recharged or needs recharging, changing the accumulator will help ensure the system works efficiently after recharging. It is also recommended the accumulator is replaced whenever a compressor is replaced as well., You can order a new accumulator from suppliers online, your local auto parts dealer, or from your vehicle manufacturer dealership parts store. Buy a replacement expansion valve (also known as an orifice tube) if you plan to replace it as well. The expansion valve is located in the refrigerant tubing at the bottom of the evaporator coils, and as with the accumulator, they can collect debris which impede their performance if the system has been compromised. Also, when changing the compressor, replacement of the expansion valve is usually a requirement for warranty coverage of the new compressor.

, It is better to have this done at a shop that has a refrigerant reclamation machine, but if the system is already discharged, this step can be skipped. Simply loosen the schrader valve on the low pressure (suction) charging fitting and listen for escaping refrigerant to determine if the system is still charged.

, This can usually be unplugged, but be careful, as there may be a clip that needs to be depressed or pried up to release it., Use the correct wrenches, and make sure the fittings do not allow the refrigerant lines to twist. You may to need two wrenches, one on the fitting and another on the compression nut that secures it to prevent damaging the refrigerant lines.

, You can now completely remove the couplings and lift the accumulator out of the engine compartment. Make sure to keep it upright, as refrigerant oil and other nasty liquids may be in the bottom of it.

, Be sure to use a wrench on both nuts, since one is soldered onto the line and allowing it to twist will damage it. After the coupling is completely loosened, you can pull the two pipes apart.

, You can grip this with a pair of needle nosed pliers to pull the expansion valve (again, also called the orifice tube) from the tube. Note that refrigerant oil may leak from the tube if any has accumulated in the evaporator coils.

,, Check to see if the o ring in the refrigerant line coupling is still in good condition, then reattach the fittings that connect this pipe.

,, You can either buy a new one, or remove the one from the old accumulator and reuse it. If reusing your old one, it is generally a good idea to use a new seal or o ring when reinstalling it.

, You should now be able to either charge the system with new refrigerant or have it done at a licensed auto repair shop. Continue reading for basic instructions if you plan to proceed yourself.

, Allow the pump to hold a vacuum for at least 90 minutes before recharging the system.

,, Open the charging valve and allow the refrigerant to enter the system. This can be a very slow process depending on the ambient temperature, do not rush it.,"

Before you change your oil you should run your truck and get the oil warm so that it will gather all the dirty particles.,
Make sure you set the parking brake.

,
First you must obtain a floor jack and jack stands.,
Get a wrench that fits your drain plug, an oil filter, an oil filter wrench, a bucket to catch the oil, and the oil.,
Slide under the vehicle.,
Drain the oil from the oil pan, and clean the bolt with a rag and screw it back in with your fingers.,
Use the oil filter wrench to unscrew the oil filter which is to the right of the oil pan.,
Dispose of old filter and the new filter can be screwed in place.,
Take fresh oil and rub it around the rim of the filter.,
Hand tighten the filter.,
Gather the tools and move from under the vehicle.

,
Remove the two jack stands and lower the floor jack.

,
Pop the hood of the vehicle and unscrew the oil cap which is located on the left side of the engine.,
Pour the recommended amount of oil into the vehicle.,
Dispose used oil properly.

,
Run vehicle for ten minutes, then check oil levels with dipstick.",How to Change the Oil in Your Truck," It will also be easier to drain.;
,, Jack the truck up using the floor jack. Place the jack in the center of the front brace between the front tires. Make sure that the surface you are parked on is level and stable, so that the jack doesn't move(if not make sure blocks are placed under back tires). Jack the truck up so the front tires are off the ground. For safety purposes, you should also place a jack stand under the brace just inside of the two front tires. This is to make sure the vehicle does not fall on you if the jack fails. Blocking the rear tires will also help eliminate the risk of the jack moving.

, Be sure to know what type of oil your vehicle requires. If you do not know, you can find this information in your vehicle manual, as well as the oil capacity.

, Locate the oil pan and loosen the bolt located on the end of the oil pan. The drain plug. Before you loosen the bolt place bucket under the bolt to catch the oil.

, After, take the wrench, and tighten it another quarter to half rotation. This will ensure that the bolt it tightened enough, but not so tight that it is going to pinch the rubber seal.

, Before the filter is completely screwed out, again place the container under the filter to catch any oil that is still in the filter.

, Be sure that you have purchased the correct filter, as sizes will vary depending on model and type of motor you truck has. Also check to make sure you have removed the O-ring from the old filter off of the filter housing. To ensure that the new filter gets installed properly.

, This is to ensure that there is a good seal once the new filter is screwed in.

, Then take the oil filter wrench and tighten another quarter turn.

,,, Be sure to remove any debris that could potentially fall into the oil.

, Screw the oil cap back on and close the hood of the vehicle.

,, Top off oil if needed. Do not forget to release the parking brake before the vehicle is driven again.

Have your truck regularly serviced and tuned.,
Change old spark plugs.,
Replace the spark ignition wires when changing the plugs.,
Have a regular oil change.,
Use a fuel system cleaner on your truck every 3 months.,
Own a good set of tires and keep them in proper air pressure.",How to Improve Your Truck's Performance1," Your mechanic can check if there are components that need to be replaced and fixed. A well-maintained vehicle runs efficiently.;
, Replacing this essential car component promotes fuel efficiency and performance providing the optimal spark to ignite the most air/fuel mixture, boosting engine combustion and reduces unburned fuel waste emissions. This should be changed regularly because they wear out after some time. Most recommend replacing them every 50,000 miles.


Experts recommend using iridium spark plugs. They last longer than regular copper or platinum spark plugs.
Always check with manufacturer or your truck service book for the recommended spark plugs. Although iridium spark plugs do last longer than cooper or platinum spark plugs, copper metal is a better conductor for electricity and creates a bigger ignition spark.
Inspect each spark plug for the correct electrode gap. Manufacturers package spark plugs with gauge already adjusted and protected with a small plastic or carton cylinder around the thread protecting the electrode from impact.
Use a spark plug gauge to check and adjust gap if you drop the spark plug. Most auto parts stores have spark plug gauge key-chains on display at the counter along with single electrical grease packs.

, It is recommended to use a high quality wiring harness set with silicone isolation. Silicone has superior heat tolerances and are more flexible and higher tensile strength.


Worn or cracked wiring can reduce performance or break off when pulling the booths making plug removal more difficult.
Inspect contact connection plugs on ignition coils and spark plugs for a solid connection grip and use electrical grease to prevent arcing short-circuit damage on the cables.

, It extends your vehicle’s lifespan and keeps it running smoothly by having the parts of the engine clean and well lubricated.


Using synthetic oil is highly recommended. They perform better in extreme weather and lubricate engine components better than regular oil.
Use the recommended thickness/Viscosity S.A.E oil rating for your vehicle's mileage and weather season.

, It keeps the fuel system clean by removing dirt and carbon buildup in the engine's valves, cylinders and fuel injectors. This is a proven way to maximize fuel efficiency and boost engine performance.


Pour the recommended treatment bottle on the empty tank before topping with fresh fuel. This helps mixing the fuel additive evenly.
Refill after the entire tank is used up.

, Performance tires or lower resistance tires offer a better traction and handling than regular tires. The engine works harder with less inflated tires because of increased road friction.


Read customer reviews on tire websites before making a decision.

Install performance fuel injectors and throttle body.,
Polish the inside walls surface of the intake manifold.,
Install high-quality shock absorber (dampening) struts.,
Upgrade to performance air filters.,
Install cold air intakes.,
Install aftermarket exhaust kits.",How to Improve Your Truck's Performance2," It is a sure fire way to improve the horsepower and engine life of a truck. A larger throttle body paired with performance fuel injectors, efficiently maximise fuel delivery to an engine and provide the vehicle with improved horsepower, throttle response and torque.


A larger throttle body allows more air volume to enter and performance fuel injector nozzles spray a finer and stronger mist of fuel that improves combustion power and efficiency.
Not all vehicles can be outfitted with a bigger throttle body. It would be best to consult a mechanic or your dealer.

, Use a small high-speed rotary tool and a flexible drill bit extension to reduce air/fuel drag.

, They improve the ride quality of the vehicle and last longer than cheap brands. A good set of shocks perform better in a variety of road conditions. These vital components, control the suspension system of a vehicle. It also provides the tires with improved road contact which is essential for better handling, torque and safe vehicle steering.

, They are proven to be more efficient than the typical factory air filters. Air filters improves the airflow by filtering dirt and other air contaminants from the engine.


They are available in two types: The traditional paper air filter which is disposable and the replacement air filter that is reusable and washable. The second type is more expensive because it is made of a long-lasting material that can handle all types of driving conditions and less wind/air resistance.

, This popular aftermarket assembly is the easiest way to improve a vehicle’s efficiency. It allows your engine to breathe better by converting warm air into dense, cold air. By enabling the natural flow of air in the engine, a vehicle is able to move faster, with less effort.

, It’s time to replace the stock mufflers with larger aftermarket exhausts that will for sure improve the airflow of the vehicle. These performance exhausts have pipes that are typically bigger in diameter and are proven to increase torque and boost the sound of the engine.

Locate the problem hose.,
Assess how many components must be removed to facilitate replacing the damaged hose.,
Determine if the hydraulic component the hose serves, or any other hydraulic components which must be removed have a live load, or weight on them.,
Make sure any attachments which are supported by the hydraulic cylinder the hose operates are lowered to the ground or blocked or chained up.,
Get the tools you will need to perform the job of removing the hose.,
Remove all clamps and attachments which will interfere with removing the hose.,
Loosen the fitting that attaches the hydraulic hose to the hydraulic system, either at a coupling, a cylinder, or the valve spool itself.,
Pull the hose off of the equipment when both ends are unfastened.,
Plug the fittings that remain on the machine to keep debris from getting into the system during the interval the fitting is open.,
Wipe excess oil from the hose, and take it to an equipment supply store to have a new one ordered or made.,
Clean all the fittings on the equipment before reinstalling the hose.,
Plug the ends of your new hoses with a special cap or a clean rag before routing it through the equipment to where it goes.,
Make sure the hose is in the correct location, and it has the proper amount of slack where needed when it is installed, then thread the fittings back on the cylinder or other component where they were removed.,
Replace any clamps, guards, or other components which were removed to accomplish the task.,
Check the fluid level in the machine, crank it up, and check for leaks.",How to Replace a Hydraulic Hose," This may be obvious if the hose has burst, since they typically handle oil at over 2000 PSI pressure, and one that bursts will discharge a large amount of oil in a short time. If the situation is a small leak, though, you will need to observe where the oil is dripping, and follow the wet trail it leads to the source. Never use your hands or body parts to find the leak. Use cardboard, paper or hydraulic leak detection fluid so no oil injection is accrued. A good hydraulic shop stocks leak detection additives that assist on location the leak safely.

, Always label the component removed by number and letter so replacement of parts can be reinstalled with ease. This may include housings, guards, clamps, other hoses, hydraulic cylinders, and more. Follow the hose from one end to the other, noting the route you will use to uninstall and reinstall it. Putting a number and letter on the ports and hose ends.
, If the oil in the system you are disconnecting is under pressure, it may blow out forcefully when the fittings which hold it are loosened, causing oil to be discharged under pressure. Relieve the pressure from these cylinders or components before proceeding.
, The weight of an attachment can crush a mechanic if it suddenly falls when pressure is relieved in the cylinder that is supporting it.
, The fittings on the each end of the hose will be removed with a wrench, which may vary in size from 9/16 to over 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm). Many of these fittings are designed to swivel or turn as they operate, so two wrenches will be required to remove each of them. Hold the stationary side of the coupling with one wrench to prevent it from turning, and possibly damaging an O-ring while turning the other to separate the coupling.
, Often, the hydraulic cylinder itself will need to be removed or supported so that fittings can be accessed. Hydraulic cylinders are either bolted directly to the boss or fixture which it operates, or is anchored with a steel pin, such as the one in the illustration.
, Make sure the fitting turns at the threaded connection, and does not twist any other part. If needed, you may have to hold the fitting the hose is attached to with a separate wrench.
, Be aware that some hydraulic oil may leak from either or both connections, and the oil that is remaining in the hose will also dump out, so having a bucket handy to catch this spillage is a good idea., If you do not have oil dripping from the fitting, and do not have a plug with the correct threads on it, you may tie a clean rag around the fitting to protect it, but be careful if rain is in the forecast, since a rag won't protect the system from being contaminated with water., After market manufacturers and OEM dealers supply replacement hoses and fittings which can be assembled while you wait, and are less expensive than ordering an original equipment manufacturer's product. Make sure the hydraulic shop that makes the hose will clean the hoses inside with a proper cleaning system not just shop air. A proper hydraulic hose shop like ASAP hydraulics will use an ultra clean system and install end caps to make sure no contamination will enter into the system. The end caps will keep the line clean until the line is routed throughout the system and ready to install.
, Make sure there is no dirt in the tubing or fitting which will end up in the hydraulic system when you are finished.
, This will keep dirt and debris from being forced into the hose while installing it. Remove these temporary plugs immediately before installing the fittings where they mate up with their counterparts.
, Tighten these connections snugly. You may have access to a specification book which recommends a torque to apply to each fitting, but failing this, tighten them as much as you can without risking damaging the seals or stripping the threads which hold them., Align any cylinder pins which were removed, and reinstall them, and return any split or snap rings which hold them in place.
, If you have had a chance to clean all surfaces that were soiled by the initial leak, any leaks that occur now will be much easier to spot. Keep in mind some hydraulic circuits will require bleeding to remove air from the system prior to using the machine. This usually applied to steering and brake systems, but there are other situations where air can become trapped, such as a single action cylinder where the hydraulic supply is at a low point in the cylinder."
