Take pictures of your car parked in the location where you received the ticket. Also take pictures of any relevant signs, markings on the road or curb, or parking meter. You will attach these photos to your letter., On the ticket you received, you may find instructions on how to appeal the ticket. This address will most likely be the court clerk’s office or the agency that issued the ticket. The address may be a specialized department for appeals or correspondence.


If there is no address on your ticket, contact the court clerk in your county and ask where to direct your appeal letter.

, Your ticket will state what vehicle code section or sections you have been charged with violating. Search online for your state’s vehicle code and look up the specific violation sections relevant to your case. From the text, you should be able to determine whether you violated the law, or whether the citing officer misinterpreted the law or the facts of the situation.

, Begin the body of your letter by briefly and clearly recounting the facts of the incident. To make your letter easy for the reader to understand, keep your facts in chronological order. Include details about when you arrived, where and how you parked your vehicle, and when you returned.


Mind your tone as you write. Although you may be feeling angry or frustrated, keep those emotions out of your letter. You may be tempted to use sarcasm or emotional language, but you should endeavor to sound logical and clearheaded. Do not give the reader a reason to assume that your emotions have clouded your recollection of the facts.
For example: “On November 11, 2015, at 5:50pm, I parked in a metered space in front of the grocery store at the intersection of 12th and G street. I paid for fifteen minutes before going into the grocery store. At 6:00pm, I returned to my vehicle. Although there should have been 5 minutes left on the meter, the meter read zero, and an officer was writing me a ticket. I tried to explain to the officer that the meter was incorrect, but he ignored me.”

, The second portion of your letter should explain why you did not deserve the ticket you received. This is the place to explain how the officer misinterpreted the law or the circumstances of the incident, or if you believe you had a valid excuse for violating the law, such as breaking down in a loading zone and being unable to move your vehicle.


Again, keep your tone professional as you make your explanation. Even if the ticketing officer was mistaken in writing your ticket, do not insult the officer in your letter.
For example: “I should not have received a ticket because I paid for fifteen minutes of parking time and returned to my vehicle after only ten minutes had passed. The meter must have malfunctioned, because it failed to accurately monitor my parking time.”

, Conclude your letter by telling the reader what you would like him or her to do. In this case, you should ask the reader to repeal the ticket and waive the fine.If you have not yet paid the fine, also ask the reader to extend the due date of your fine until after your appeal has been addressed., Include any evidence that might help prove your claim that the ticket is invalid. Your evidence can be any of the following:


Photographs of the scene of the incident;
Signed witness statements from anyone who confirm what you have written (such as a passenger who can verify that you did not park illegally); or
A receipt for vehicle repairs (if you received a ticket as a result of your vehicle being disabled and you not being able to remove it)., Send your appeal letter via certified mail and request a return receipt. This way, you can verify that your letter was actually delivered, and you will receive a return receipt proving that you sent the letter prior to any deadline to submit an appeal.

, If you do not get a response from the clerk or citing agency within a few days, call the office to confirm that they received your letter. If the office did not receive your letter, mention that you have a return receipt that states when your letter was delivered. Ask the office when you can expect a response.

, The clerk or agency may schedule a hearing to resolve your case.On the date of the hearing, arrive early, dress professionally, and wait for your case to be called. Be prepared to state the facts as clearly and concisely as you did in your letter, and bring copies of any evidence you submitted. The judge will ask you to clarify any details about your position before making a decision.

Remove brake fluid as needed to prevent it from spilling into the engine compartment and onto the floor., Lubricate the pins to make sure they slide easily inside the caliper casting. This is very important! Binding calipers are the cause of uneven pad wear and premature failure of the brakes., These bushings and screws were the ones you loosened to remove the caliper. They have some rubber bellows type seals over them. You might want to lubricate these bushings before reassembling the caliper onto the brake assembly., If you have done this to both sides of the truck, you are done with the brakes., Make sure the rotors spin freely and there is no noticeable play in the rotors. Replace the cap on the brake fluid reservoir and make sure the level appears more or less right (more about this later)., If you are using an impact wrench, make sure not to over-tighten., Now you can properly tighten the lug nuts.

File your declaration or affidavit.",How to Write a Letter Pleading Not Guilty," Your traffic ticket includes important information regarding your procedural rights and how to respond to the ticket.


You may need to go to the court's website or call the clerk's office to get additional information about pleading not guilty. Often the ticket will provide instructions on how to pay it, but you may have to dig a bit deeper to find information on how to fight it.;
, If you have any photos or if there were any witnesses to the incident that led to the traffic citation, you should review that evidence before you make a final decision to plead not guilty.


Whether you decide to plead not guilty should depend on how strong your defense is and how likely you think you are to win your case. Avoid pleading not guilty just for the sake of fighting a ticket when you know you have no valid defense – it will only cost you additional time and money., Due to the costs of pleading not guilty, it's worth reviewing your ticket and your driving record to determine whether it would be easier for you to just pay the ticket.


If the ticket is your first offense, you may be eligible to attend traffic school and have the infraction removed from your record after successful completion. Before you decide to fight the traffic ticket, find out if this option is available.If you aren't eligible for traffic school, or have no interest in attending, pleading guilty to the ticket or simply paying the fine could result in higher insurance premiums and other costs to you. If you have a strong argument that you should not be held liable for the violation, you should consider pleading not guilty and fighting the ticket.If you got a ticket as a result of your involvement in an accident, you probably should consider consulting an experienced traffic attorney for guidance on how to proceed. Being found guilty after a trial could result in civil liability to the other drivers for damages they suffered in the accident.Keep in mind that you have the right to plead not guilty, regardless of whether you actually committed the infraction.When you plead not guilty, you are forcing the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the infraction. If the state doesn't have enough evidence to do this, you cannot be found guilty in a court of law., Typically, your ticket will include a deadline by which you must enter your plea if you intend to plead not guilty.


Figure out if the date on your ticket is the date by which you must respond or the date you must appear in traffic court. That first date probably is an arraignment – not the date of the hearing itself – but this varies widely among jurisdictions.Typically if you want to plead without appearing at arraignment, you must do so several days prior to the date the arraignment or first appearance is scheduled. You may have to go to the court's website or conduct additional research to find out exactly when the court must receive your plea if you want to avoid appearing in court., Many jurisdictions have a form you must fill out to notify the traffic court how you intend to plead in response to a traffic ticket.


Typically this form will be included with your ticket. If not, you should be able to find it by visiting the traffic court's website or contacting the clerk's office.
In some jurisdictions you must send a check for the amount of the fine as bail when you send your letter pleading not guilty. This amount will be returned to you if you win your case. Check with the court's website or call the clerk if you are unsure., If no specific form is available for pleading not guilty, you may be able to enter your plea by writing a letter to the court.


Keep in mind that if you choose to write a letter pleading not guilty, you typically must also include a statement indicating that you understand you have a right to an arraignment and are waiving that right.Typically there's no specific format required, and you don't have to indicate or explain your defenses – you simply can state that you plead not guilty, just as you would if you attended an arraignment in person.Type your letter in standard business format using a basic, legible font such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. Single space your letter with a double-space between paragraphs. Make sure you include accurate contact information in case the clerk needs to contact you regarding your plea., Your traffic ticket may include a list of the information required to accurately process your plea.


At a minimum, you should include the date of your traffic ticket and the infraction with which you were charged. If the traffic ticket includes a case or reference number, that number should also be included in your letter for identification purposes.
Typically the officer will write your name and address as they appear on your driver's license, but that information may no longer be accurate if, for example, you recently moved or changed your name due to marriage or divorce. Regardless, you should provide your full name and address in your letter as they are listed on the ticket, even if they are incorrect.
You may consider making a copy of the front and back of the citation itself and attaching these to your letter.

, Depending on the seriousness of the offense, you may want to discuss your plea with an experienced traffic attorney.


It is especially important that you consult an attorney if you received the ticket as a result of your involvement in an accident. Your decision may affect your civil liability for damages incurred by other drivers., Once you're satisfied that you've included everything necessary, you can submit your letter pleading not guilty to the traffic court.


Before you mail your letter to the court, make a copy of the letter you've written as well as any attachments, so you have it for your own records.
You should be able to find the address and department to which your letter should be mailed on your traffic ticket. If the information isn't there, you may have to call the clerk of court to find out where to mail your letter.You might consider sending your letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested, just so you know when the court has received your letter. This could be essential evidence later on if the court tries to say that the deadline had already passed before your letter was received.

, Some jurisdictions allow you to mail in a written statement rather than appearing in court for a trial.


Even if trial by declaration isn't specifically allowed in your jurisdiction, the judge may permit it anyway to save court time and resources. If you can't find any information about it, you can always ask the clerk if the option is available.A trial by declaration is especially beneficial if you got your ticket in another state or a location far away from where you live, because it saves you the time and costs necessary to appear in court and fight the ticket.Even if the jurisdiction has a procedure in place for a trial by declaration, this option may not be available for certain infractions. For example, Oregon does not allow a trial by declaration for photo radar or red light tickets, speed racing, or reckless driving with accident or injury., Typically you must request a trial by declaration or affidavit in advance of the date your trial is scheduled.


When you submit your request, you also may be required to pay the amount of the fine as a bail. If you win your case you'll get this money back.By requesting a trial by declaration, you waive your right to appear, to testify in person, and to subpoena witnesses., Before you complete your declaration or affidavit, organize the evidence you want to present that supports your argument that you are not guilty of the offense for which you received the ticket.


Keep in mind that if you request a trial by declaration, the officer who issued the ticket in your case will have to present written testimony as well. Typically you won't have the opportunity to review the officer's statement before you prepare yours, so you have to do your best to anticipate any points you think the officer will raise., Once you've properly filed your request for a trial by declaration or affidavit, the court clerk typically will send you a packet of forms and instructions.


Most jurisdictions with a formal procedure for trial by declaration have specific forms that you must use to present your testimony.If you have witnesses, you typically can get them to submit affidavits as well, which you will submit together with your own declaration as evidence in your defense.If your jurisdiction doesn't have any forms available, you can write an additional letter to the clerk containing your declaration. As with your letter pleading not guilty, use standard business format. Include your citation number and your case name and number in the subject line of your letter.Your form typically will include a statement that you have waived your right to appear in person at trial and submit your evidence to the court personally.You usually may attach any documentary evidence you want the court to consider, such as photographs or written testimony from witnesses. This includes anything you would present at trial. For example, if you have drawn a diagram that demonstrates the officer who issued your citation did not have an unobstructed view of your car before he pulled you over, you could include that with your declaration.You also may be required to include a long-form written statement in which you describe the incident that led to your citation in your own words., Affidavits contain sworn testimony and often must be signed in the presence of a notary public.Even if you're not required to sign in the presence of a notary, any prepared forms typically will include a statement that you are signing the document under oath and represent under penalty of perjury that the statements it contains are true and correct to the best of your knowledge.After you've signed your forms, be sure you make a copy of everything you plan on submitting to the court so you have it for your records. Once you send the originals to the court they will not be returned.

, Once you've completed all your forms, you must send them to the clerk of court together with any evidence you want the court to review.


Although you can always file your declaration or affidavit by taking it to the clerk's office personally, you typically also have the option of mailing it. You should use certified mail with returned receipt requested so you have notice when your paperwork is received.Pay attention to the deadlines included in your instructions for a trial by declaration or affidavit. There will be a date by which you must file your declaration and evidence with the clerk, typically no later than 24 hours before the date your trial is scheduled.The judge will review your testimony and evidence as well as the testimony and evidence from the officer who issued your citation and render his verdict. In some jurisdictions you will receive written notice of the judge's decision within a few weeks after your declaration packet is received.If the judge ruled in your favor, the notice may include a check refunding you the amount of the fine you posted as bail.In other jurisdictions, it remains your responsibility to contact the court and learn of the judge's decision after the trial date you've been assigned."

In some cases, if someone else was driving your car at the time, you may not be aware of the reason at first, but you (as the owner) are probably still responsible. There are a number of typical reasons that a car could be impounded:involvement in illegal activity
outstanding tickets or parking fines
lack of insurance
improper or expired registration.;
, A car can be impounded if it was being used for one or more illegal activities, such as driving while intoxicated, carrying drugs or firearms, fleeing from police, or some other illegal activity. For some of these reasons, you may not be able to retrieve the car, especially if the police need to hold it for evidence.Even if you were not driving the car when it was impounded for one of these reasons, you probably need a lawyer to help get it back. You may just need to pay a fine, or you might have to appear in court.

, Different jurisdictions will have different limits about how many tickets they will tolerate before they tow away a car and impound it. You will need to contact the police department and find out exactly what you owe in order to recover the car.Make sure you find out:


how much you owe
what additional costs there may be (such as late fees)
if there is a towing fee
if there is a storage fee at the impound lot
what form of payment they will accept.

, In some cases, the police may notice that your car is improperly registered, or that their records show that it is not insured. In order to recover the car in this instance, you would have to take care of the insurance and/or registration, and take proof of the correction to the police station to recover the car., Depending on the reason for the impound, bringing a payment may not be enough. You will probably need to bring proof of ownership, proof of your identification, proof of registration and insurance.After you have corrected the problem that led to having your car impounded, collect these documents and take them to the police to show that the problem has been resolved.

, Once you know why the car has been impounded, you need to learn how much it will cost for you to recover the car. Usually, you will have to pay several costs in order to get your car back.You can usually figure this out by speaking to someone at the police station. Alternatively, the police may refer you to the city clerk's office instead. Ask them if you have to pay any of the following charges:


the initial problem (tickets, insurance, fine, etc.)
a towing charge
a storage fee at the impound lot (this number will probably increase each day that the car is held in custody), You don’t want to show up to collect your car and then find out that they won’t accept your personal check. Call ahead to verify the form of payment that will be acceptable.Cash
Credit
Money order

, In some cases, you may need to report to the police station first, in order to clear up the reason that your car was impounded, and then report to a different lot to collect the car. Be sure that you get a report or a release from the police station, so that the impound lot will know that they can release the car to you.

, Be sure that you get receipts for whatever you pay and some form of release from the police to show that you have satisfied any outstanding tickets, warrants, insurance or registration issues, etc.

, Sometimes, you will be aware that your car was impounded - especially if it happened while you were driving it. But sometimes you just walk out where you left it and it's gone. Probably the most common reason for a car to be impounded is that it was simply parked illegally. If you walk out to where you thought your car was, and find that it is missing, check the parking signs in the area. If you were in a “No Parking” or a “Tow Away” zone, that’s probably your answer.

, If your car was in an area that is marked as a tow zone, there will often be a sign in the vicinity that will identify the towing company. Look for that sign and take down the number. Give them a call to find out if they have your car.

, If you cannot figure out why the car may be missing for one of the first two reasons, call the local police department. You can call the main intake number for the police department, and then explain the reason for your call. Alternatively, you may look online to see if the police department has a special number for impound information.Some police departments may have an online resource that allows you to search for your car using either your license plate number or VIN.In some cases, it may take a few days for information of the car to be entered into the police department’s computer system, so you may need to check back a few times. For example, the Arizona law on impounding vehicles requires the police officer to make a formal record of impounding the car within three business days., If needed, someone other than the owner of the car may be able to retrieve the car from the impound lot. However, the person retrieving the car must take care of paying all the expenses that the owner would have had to pay. This includes all the fines, tickets, storage fees, towing, or whatever other charges there may be. In addition, you must be prepared to prove that you are authorized to take the car.

, If you hold a lien on a car that has been impounded, and you are listed on the title as a lien holder, then in some jurisdictions you may be entitled to retrieve the car from the impound lot. You will need to be prepared to pay the same fees that the owner would be responsible for (fine, tickets, storage, towing, etc.). In addition, you must provide a copy of the title that shows that you hold a lien that has not yet been satisfied., In some states, the owner may designate another person as ""agent"" to collect an impounded car. Some examples may be if the owner is incarcerated, is injured, is out of state at the time that the car was impounded, etc. In such cases, the owner will need to provide a letter of authorization to the agent, which should include the following information:


Owner's name, as it appears on the title or registration
Identification of the vehicle, including make, model, year, VIN, license number
Name of the agent. The person designated as agent will have to show identification when collecting the car. The agent does not necessarily have to be a relative of the owner.
The agent must be able to demonstrate that he has a valid driver's license and insurance to drive the car away from the impound lot.In some states, the letter authorizing the agent to collect the car must be notarized. To find out the requirements of your specific jurisdiction, call the police department to ask their requirements.

, In some jurisdictions, if the owner is deceased, then a relative may collect the car with a copy of the death certificate and proof of relationship.Alternatively, in some places, the executor of the will may be able to retrieve the car., If the car has been leased or is owned by a dealership, a representative of the agency may be able to recover it by showing proof of ownership for the company."

Research your state’s lemon law.,
Determine whether your type of vehicle is covered by your state’s lemon law.,
Check your car’s mileage.,
Verify the time you have owned your car.,
Review your car’s repair history.,
Keep records of each repair attempt.,
Notify the dealer where you purchased the car.,
Allow the dealer a “reasonable” opportunity to correct the problem.,
Provide the dealer with written notice that you believe the vehicle is a lemon.,
Select a replacement or refund, if the dealer assents to your lemon law claim.,
Be prepared to proceed further if you and the dealer do not agree.,
Consult with an attorney.,
Take the matter to an arbitration hearing.,
Sue the manufacturer and dealer in court.,
File a complaint with your state’s Attorney General.,
Notify the Better Business Bureau.,
Contact your state’s Office of Consumer Affairs.",How to Learn How the Lemon Law Works," The term “lemon law” applies generally to a series of individual state laws that protect people who buy cars or some other consumer items. Each state has its own law or laws and its own requirements, but in general they are similar. You will need to check with the Attorney General, Department of Motor Vehicles, or some other state agency for the lemon law or consumer affairs laws in your state. For instance,


in California, the lemon law is described on the website of the Attorney General.for Texas, you can find information about the lemon law on the website of the Department of Motor Vehicles.the Massachusetts lemon law is outlined by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation.;
, In some states, the lemon law includes only new cars, while other states include used cars. For some states, leased vehicles are included. There are also differences about including motorcycles, trailers, all-terrain vehicles, vans, trucks or other motor vehicles. You will need to check your state’s law carefully.

, One element of lemon law eligibility is the number of miles that you have driven the car since purchasing it. The range is about from 12,000 miles (19,000 km) up to 24,000 miles. However, there are some states that do not set a mileage limit as a condition.For example, South Carolina allows the first 12,000 to determine whether your car is a ""lemon.""
In New York, you may make a claim within the first 18,000 miles.
For Alabama and Georgia, you can drive the car up to 24,000 miles before making your claim.
In Delaware, Michigan and Colorado, there is no mileage condition. They set limits based on time only., In most states, the lemon law applies based on a combination of mileage and age. Some states are more expansive, and some are more restrictive. You need to check your own state’s requirements for both mileage and age.


For example, Delaware covers cars for one year from purchase, regardless of mileage.In Illinois, cars are covered by the lemon law for one year or 12,000 miles (19,000 km), whichever comes first.The lemon laws of Florida, Alabama and Georgia cover cars for up to 2 years., The lemon law applies to cars that need too many repairs in a short time after purchasing. Again, keep in mind that each state has its own regulations, but most states’ lemon laws include some or all of the following elements:You need to have it repaired from two to four times for the same problem while under warranty.
You need to have the car repaired at least twice for a warranty problem that could result in death or serious injury (i.e., brakes, gas tank, or some major operating component)
The car is out of service for 30 days or more due to warranty repairs.

, It will be important, if you have to proceed with a lemon law claim, to have proof of your repairs. If you do not have the original repair receipts, you may be able to return to the mechanic and get a copy from the mechanic’s records.


The mechanic who performs the repairs on the car does not have to be an official dealer service station. You may use any service station to try to get the car repaired.

, Whether you initially had your car repaired at the dealer’s service station or elsewhere, when you believe your car meets the standards of a “lemon,” you must notify the dealer directly. Take the car in to the dealer’s service station and inform them of the problem. The dealer has the opportunity, by law, to correct the problem., Before you proceed to the final stage of the lemon law, you need to allow the dealer to correct the problem. Most states define a “reasonable” opportunity to mean one of two things:at least two, or up to four, attempts to repair the vehicle, OR
such repairs that take the car out of usable service for 30 days

, According to most states’ lemon laws, when you reach the point that you believe your car qualifies as a lemon, you need to give the dealer written notice, by certified mail. Include in your notice:A statement that you believe your car falls under the lemon law
Identification of the car, including its vehicle identification number (VIN)
A description of the mechanical problem
A list of the dates when you had the car repaired, and the length of each repair effort

, If the dealer has completed the “reasonable” repair efforts, and the car cannot be repaired satisfactorily, the dealer may offer you either a replacement vehicle or a refund. In most states, it is your option to accept the replacement vehicle or the refund.If the dealer offers a replacement vehicle, you may be entitled to be reimbursed for transfer of registration fees, any towing or rental costs you incurred, and any sales tax related to the replacement vehicle.
If the dealer offers a refund, you may be entitled to the full costs incurred in your purchase, included taxes and registration. Depending on your state law, the dealer may be entitled to reduce the refund by a percentage to account for the time or mileage on the car at the time of the refund. Each state will have its own formula to calculate this reduction.

, If you have made your written lemon law demand, the dealer may disagree. The following are some typical points of contention:


The dealer may disagree that you are within the time limit of the lemon law.
The dealer may believe that the repairs have resolved the problem.
You and the dealer may disagree on whether the offered replacement vehicle is acceptably similar to yours.
You and the dealer may disagree on calculating an acceptable refund amount.

, If the matter is going to go beyond the basic level of making a demand, you should consider meeting with an attorney. An attorney can help you review the strength of your claim and can assist in further negotiations with the dealer or manufacturer.

, Arbitration is a system that is quicker and cheaper than a full trial. You have the opportunity to present your evidence and argument to a neutral party, who will hear from both sides and then make a decision. In many states, the attorney general’s office, secretary of state’s office, or Better Business Bureau will have an arbitration office just to deal with lemon law claims., If you cannot resolve your dispute directly with the dealer, and if you are not satisfied with the decision that comes from arbitration, you can file a complaint in court against the manufacturer and dealer.


You will need to find out if your state requires you to attempt arbitration before you are eligible to file a complaint. If this is the case, and you file a complaint without going to arbitration first, your case will likely be dismissed.
If you decide to take the matter to court, it is a good idea to consult with an attorney, if you have not already retained one sooner.

, Most states’ Attorney General’s offices will have a number or address to take formal complaints. If your lemon law dispute did not get resolved to your satisfaction, or if you believe you were not treated professionally for any reason, you may wish to file a complaint.

, The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is a nationwide business organization that provides notices and support to consumers. The BBB has an online complaint form accessible here that you may use if your dispute was not resolved properly.


After you submit your complaint, the BBB will notify the manufacturer and ask for a response. If the manufacturer provides no response, the BBB will make a second attempt. The BBB will share with you any response they receive, or notice that they received nothing.

, This is an agency that exists in many states that records complaints and concerns with businesses. While the Office of Consumer Affairs may not take part in your dispute, they do keep records and can take action if a number of complaints are received against a single business.

Pay a fee.,
Discuss how much your premiums will be.,
Get the certificate even if you don’t own a car.,
Maintain your coverage.,
Determine how much you need.,
Gather required information.,
Obtain quotes.,
Tell an agent you need an SR-22.,

Purchase the policy upfront.",How to Keep Your License with an SR22 Reporting Requirement," Your state will require your insurer to file this certificate in a variety of situations. Although the precise situations might differ by state, the following are common:You were convicted of DUI/DWI.
You were driving without insurance.
You were involved in an accident that caused serious bodily injury.
Your driving record has a large number of points.;
, An FR-44 is like an SR-22. However, the SR-22 only states that you have bought your state’s minimum required insurance. An FR-44 certifies that you have bought a level of insurance higher than your state’s minimum.For example, in Florida, you’ll need to purchase at least $100,000 in liability insurance if you must file an FR-44.Look at your court order to see which one you are required to get. You can also check with your state’s DMV office.
You will still get an FR-44 the same way you get an SR-22.

, You need to have an insurer issue your SR-22. You can’t do this yourself. Instead, the insurer must send the certificate directly to your state. Accordingly, call up your current insurer and tell them you need an SR-22 filed.


Some insurers don’t file SR-22 certificates. In that situation, you must shop around for new insurance and buy a policy with an insurer that will issue the certificate.Avoid keeping your current insurance but shopping for an insurer that does provide SR-22 certificates. This type of dual insurance is illegal.Don’t think that you can avoid telling your insurer because you are moving out of state. Your current state will still record your license suspension in a national computer system. Before you can get a license in another state, they will check to make sure you have followed your former state’s rules. This means you must still file an SR-22 certificate with your former state., Insurers will charge different amounts to file the certificate. However, you generally will need to pay $15-25.Check with your insurer about whether you get a copy.


An SR-22 certificate isn’t like an insurance card that you keep with you. What’s important is that the certificate be noted on your driving record. Nevertheless, your insurer might send you a copy if you want one. Call and check.
Confirm that it was sent to your state’s office. It can generally take up to 30 days to be sent and processed.

, You can probably expect your insurance costs to increase because of the DUI or serious accident.Many people who need an SR-22 filed are considered high-risk drivers. Accordingly, talk with your insurer about whether your premiums will rise.


Whatever you do, don’t turn around and cancel your coverage because the premium is now too high. If you cancel your coverage, then your insurer must report this fact to your state’s DMV office.You could lose your license if you don’t pick up another insurance policy.
If you want to switch policies, then make sure you have another policy in place before cancelling.

, Your state can require that you file the SR-22 certificate even when you aren’t a car owner. You will need non-owner SR-22 insurance, which you may have to shop around for.Don’t get a non-owner policy if a vehicle is still registered to you or if someone lets you drive a car regularly. Only purchase non-owner’s insurance when you have no car and no regular access to one.
If you choose to purchase a car, then contact your insurer immediately. They will change your policy to an owner’s policy.

, You need to carry the SR-22 for several years. The exact amount of time differs by state, but many states require it for at least three years.Check with your state’s DMV office.


The amount of time might differ depending on your offense.You should also check if you can be relieved from filing. Call up your state’s office and ask if they can review your record. In some situations, they might relieve you of the requirement to file an SR-22., Each state has minimum insurance requirements. If you have to shop for a new policy because your insurer won’t issue an SR-22, then you need to know these minimum requirements. You can check with your state’s DMV office.


Generally, states will require that you have liability insurance to cover injuries to all people in an accident as well as property damage.
Your state’s requirements might read 25/50/25. This means that you need at least $25,000 of coverage for injuries to one person, $50,000 of liability coverage for injuries to all people, and $25,000 of coverage to property damage.Remember that you’ll need to get more than your state’s minimum if you need an FR-44 certificate issued.
You might also decide to purchase more than the minimum to protect you in case of an accident. For example, you could purchase insurance to cover your own injuries if the other driver doesn’t have insurance.

, Insurers will request common information, so you should gather this information ahead of time to speed up the process. Gather the following:the type and amount of liability coverage you want
your car’s make, model, year, and vehicle identification number (VIN)
age and sex of the drivers
number of drivers
where you park your car for the night

, You can get quotes online or by calling insurers. National insurance companies have agents all over the country, which you can find in your phone book. Also look for smaller insurers, who may advertise in the phone book or online.


You can also use online aggregators. They will take your information and then request quotes from many different insurers at once. You’ll need to follow up with an agent, but these aggregators are a good way to check at a glance how much each insurer will charge you.
Nerdwallet with allow you to compare insurance quotes from many different insurers., If you talk to an agent, make sure to mention that you need an SR-22. You need to know whether the insurer will issue one. You should also call if you got online quotes.


If an insurer doesn’t issue SR-22 certificates, then cross them off your list.

, Once you have quotes, compare the prices and the amount of coverage offered. You might want to purchase the cheapest insurance, but make sure it is equivalent to the others. For example, the cheapest insurance could offer the least coverage.Analyze whether the policies have deductibles. This is the amount of money you will need to pay before your coverage kicks in. Generally, the higher your deductible the lower your premiums.
Also compare coverage limits. The more coverage you get, the higher your premiums.
Consider the insurance company’s reputation. Visit your state’s Department of Insurance and check the number of complaints consumers have lodged against the insurer.

, Check that it includes all the coverage you requested.If anything seems wrong, then contact the agent to change the policy. Only sign the policy once you agree with everything in it.


Ask your insurance agent questions if you don’t understand anything in the policy.

, An SR-22 is proof that you have insurance, now and in the future. Accordingly, you might not be able to continue to pay monthly premiums. Instead, you might need to pay the entire premium upfront.If you don’t have the money in your checking account, think about paying the premium with a credit card.
Even if you don’t have to pay upfront, it might be a good idea to. If you miss a payment, then your coverage could be cancelled and you might lose your license. By paying upfront, you protect against any missed payments.

Make sure you familiarize yourself with the specific requirements for applying and testing for a driving permit where you live. The information in this article will mostly deal with how to get a learner's driving permit in the United States.


You can usually find information about laws and licensing where driver testing is administered in your area, or online through the website for the department of motor vehicles that governs your locale.;
, Find a Department of Motor Vehicles office near you where you can go to apply for your permit, pay the necessary fees and take your written driving theory test. Most states have several DMV locations to make getting your permit more convenient. Check online to find the DMV office closest to where you live.The official website of the DMV has a search feature that maps out where all the offices are in your area.
The lines at the DMV can be quite long. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time when you go in case you have to wait., Before you can take the test to earn your learner’s privileges, you’ll need to inform the state of your intent to receive your permit. Fill out a permit application with your personal information and return it to the DMV. Once you’ve taken care of the application process, you’ll receive your study materials for the written driving test.The permit application will ask for basic information, such as your full legal name, date of birth, home address, hair color, eye color, etc.
Apply for your learner’s permit online to save yourself a trip to the DMV office.

, The DMV will ask you to supply them with at least two forms of personal ID. This usually means a birth certificate, social security card, passport or other recognized form of photo ID, although many different ID forms are accepted. Providing identification proves that you are who you say you are and confirms that you meet the minimum age requirement to test for your permit.In most states in the US, you have to be at least 15 years old to get a driving permit. Only a handful of states, including Alaska, Arkansas and North and South Dakota, issues permits to prospective drivers as young as 14.Bring your original birth certificate or social security card along in case the DMV in your state doesn’t accept photocopies.

, You’ll be asked to sit for a brief eyesight exam when applying for your learner’s permit. The exact nature of the exam will vary, but you might be instructed to read letters of different sizes off a chart or identify gradually smaller shapes and details from a distance. The eye exam will let the DMV officials know that your eyesight is good enough for you to learn to operate a vehicle.If you don’t perform satisfactorily on your eye exam, you might have to get corrective eyewear like glasses or contact lenses. A note will be made on your permit that you have to be wearing this eyewear while driving.

, While at the DMV, go ahead and pay whatever fees are required for testing and certification. There are sometimes separate fees involved for submitting an application, taking an eyesight exam and sitting for the written test. After all fees have been paid, you’ll be able to schedule a date and time to take your test and receive your study materials.Fees, along with testing requirements, may be different for each state.
It’s not cheap to get your learner’s permit. Make an effort to pass your test the first time so you won’t have to pay to apply and take it again.

, The DMV provides a handbook for teen drivers to review that contains up-to-date listings and explanations of their state’s driving laws. Look over the handbook carefully and try to memorize as much as you can. Pay close attention the sections on basic skills and etiquette, along with what the different signs and symbols on the road mean. This is the same information you will be expected to know for the written test.Try learning the contents of the handbook one section at a time to make it easier to digest the information you’re presented.

, If possible, spend some time with a parent or other licensed driver going over the different parts of the car inside and out. They’ll be able to explain how the car works and what each component does, including important features that you’ll be tested on, like the headlights, turn signals, parking brake, and windshield wipers. Studying the workings of a vehicle yourself will give you some practical, firsthand knowledge that will be useful when it comes time to take your test.The written test you take will likely include questions about how to operate a vehicle.
There’s a lot to learn about operating a car before you even put it in gear.

, Enroll in a driver’s ed course at your school to help educate and prepare you. Most public schools offer special classes for students who are nearing the age where they can receive their driving permit. In these classes, you’ll learn more about traffic laws, how cars work and safe driving techniques that can help you avoid an accident.You will get an opportunity to practice hands-on skills like handling and parking in driver’s ed.
In some cases, passing a comprehensive exam at the end of a driver’s ed course can stand in for the theory test given at the DMV.All but a handful of states in the US (excluding Alaska, Arkansas, Missouri, Oregon and Tennessee) require some form of driver's education., On the day you’re scheduled to take your written test, make sure you arrive with plenty of time to spare. Bring whatever materials you need with you—it’s possible that you might be asked to present an ID once more or pay your fees the day of the test. Stay relaxed and don't let yourself get too nervous. Remember everything you learned and give it your best shot. Try to answer each question correctly.


For the most part, testing is done on computers these days, but it might still be wise to bring a number 2 pencil and/or black ink pen.
Get plenty of sleep the night before and eat a hearty breakfast the morning of the test. You’ll feel more alert and ready to go., Not everybody passes their learner’s permit test the first time around, and that’s okay. It’s a difficult exam that contains a lot of complex information. But don’t worry. If you don’t make a passing grade, just schedule a new testing date before you leave the DMV. You can retake the driving permit test as many times as you need.You may not be able to retake your test on the same day. Try to schedule a new date within the week so you don’t forget what you’ve learned in the meantime.
Do your best to pass the test the first time. Certain states like California only give you a limited number of chances to sit for the written exam., After you’ve passed your test, the staff at the DMV will take your picture and send off your information to be printed on your permit. It may take anywhere from a few business days to a week for your to receive a physical copy of your permit by mail. Once it’s in your possession, you’re free to begin learning how to drive!


Your driving permit will look much like an actual driver’s license, with your photo, personal information and any special provisional notes displayed on it beside your state seal.
Be sure to keep your permit close at hand in your purse or wallet so you don’t lose it.

, In addition to passing a written exam, some states require new drivers to record the number of hours they’ve spent driving under the supervision of another licensed driver. If this is a requirement in your state, you can get started right away after your permit arrives. Try to drive a few hours a week at least to gain experience. In most places, you’ll have to keep your permit for six months to a year before you can test for your driver’s license, so you’ll have plenty of time to practice.Beginner drivers are often expected to meet a minimum number of road hours that must be completed before they can test for their driver’s license. A certain amount of driving hours may have to be logged at night.The number of mandatory driving hours varies from state to state. Kansas, for example, only requires you to log 25 hours behind the wheel after receiving your permit, whereas in Delaware it is a minimum of 50 hours., Your driving permit will only stay valid for a certain amount of time. The expiration date will vary based on your home state and the date on which you received your permit. In the event that your permit expires before you get your driver’s license, you will need to fill out another application, pay the associated fees and pass the written exam a second time.In some states, like New York, driving permits are valid for up to 5 years, while in other states they may expire after as little as 1 year.
You will usually have to hold your permit for 6 months or longer before you’re eligible to receive a driver’s license.

, Just because you’ve earned your driving permit doesn’t mean you’re being turned loose to burn rubber on the streets. Depending on where you live, you may still have to log a certain number of hours of supervised driving before you’re able to drive on your own. Additionally, the laws in your state may limit some privileges, like driving at night or with unlicensed individuals in the vehicle. Make sure you go by the book and practice safely so that when the time comes for you to test for your full license, you’ll be ready., After you've held you permit for a specified amount of time, you'll be able to test for your full driver's license. This test will usually consist of two parts: a written exam and a practical portion where you actually drive a car with a testing official present. Draw upon everything you learned while studying for your permit test. If you've been logging your driving hours, you should have enough experience to help you pass the hands-on portion of the test.


There is typically a separate set of requirements for obtaining a driver's license. Before you schedule a testing date, know what paperwork you need to complete, what ID you're expected to present, etc.
Some states in the US, like California, require that you fulfill multiple levels of driver certification before you're able to receive an unrestricted license."

If you obtain a learner’s permit over age 18, you must drive with the learner’s permit for at least 30 days.
If you are over 18, you may apply directly for an intermediate license.

, You will be accompanied by a driver’s license examiner and will have the opportunity to show general driving skills.The best preparation for the driving skills is the practice that you will get during your 50 hours with the learner's permit.

Read the driver manual handbook.,
Take the written test.,
Get your permit.,
Get behind the wheel.,
Choose your passenger.,
Pick a comfortable place to start driving.",How to Get Your Driver's License in the USA1," It's not very long and it's packed with useful information that will not only help you pass, but will also make you a safer driver. Yes, it's dry as a bone and can be preachy, but if you devote an hour to go through it and highlight all the important parts—especially speed limits, following distances, and right-of-way rules—you'll pass your test with flying colors.;
, Before a state will let you slip behind the wheel, they want to know you're not going to be a menace to society. If you read the manual, you'll do fine. If you fail the test, there is usually a waiting period before you can retake the test. Use that time to dig into that manual and commit to learning what you missed on the exam.


Check your state's DMV website—they often have sample written tests so that you can practice before you set foot inside the DMV.

, Most states require you to have a permit before you practice driving. Getting a permit takes some planning. The requirements vary, and your state's DMV website will spell them out, but there are some general qualifications to know:


Be sure you reached the minimum age. Depending on what state you live in, you must be 14, 15 or 16 to drive and to get your license, but law enforcement recommends drivers be at least 16.
Provide your Social Security number. Some states require your actual SS card.
Proof of identity. This can come from a state-issued birth certificate, state-issued ID card, adoption papers, marriage certificate, or other official documentation.
Proof of citizenship or lawful residence—which can include an official birth certificate, passport, tribal ID card, or DHS documents.
Proof of residential address—this includes any of the above documents, or may simply be the statement or authorization of somebody who lives with you.
Some states require that you prove you are attending school, if you are under 18.
For applicants under the age of 18, the signature of the parent/legal guardian, along with the license number or SSN of the responsible person, must be listed on the application.
Pass a vision screening test. If you wear glasses, bring them. If you need them, or contact lenses, to drive, that will be noted on your licence.
Have your picture taken. Looking good!
Pay the testing and permit fees. Note that DMV's don't generally take credit cards, so bring your checkbook (or have your parents bring their checkbook)

, The best way to become a safe driver is to get plenty of practice. Keep in mind that as long as you have a permit, you must drive along with a licensed driver in the front seat of the car.Most states have a minimum number of months you must have a learner's permit, plus a number of hours you must be behind the wheel before you can actually get your first driver's license. This number may be lowered if you take an accredited driver's education course.

, While you may not be able to pick who your passenger or instructor is (especially if you take a driver's education course), try to drive with someone you're comfortable with. If you drive with a friend in the car, make sure she has had her license for the legally required amount of time and is old enough, according to your state's laws.


Be patient with your friend/parent/driving instructor. Sure, their panicked squealing is annoying, but they'll get over it as you get more practice.

, If you've never driven before, it will probably start awkwardly as you learn to coordinate your feet, hands, and eyes. Some prefer an empty parking lot for those first few few lurching starts and stops—especially if you are learning with a standard transmission.


Build confidence and driving skills before practicing in advanced driving situations, such as on highways or heavily trafficked city centers.

"
"
Read the manual—again!,
Schedule a driver's license test appointment, optional.,
Be prepared to test.,
Fill out an application.,
Pass a written test.,
Pass a vision examination.,
Take the driving test.",How to Get Your Driver's License in the USA2," Sure, you read it before and passed the test, but the big test is coming up: your driving examination. Every rule or procedure you flub is a checkmark in the wrong column, so take the time to really study the material.

, In order to save time, call your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office and make an appointment.


Some DMV's do this, some don't. If they don't, ask when would be the best time to come for the practical test. They'll be happy to have you come when it's most convenient for them—which means a shorter waiting time for you.

, It's vital that you feel confident in your driving abilities before testing, since you are liable for any property damage you may inflict during your test. You'll most likely be required to sign a statement assuming financial responsibility before you test.Bring the necessary documentation with you or you may not be able to test. This documentation generally includes:


Your permit. They'll check your driving record and make sure you've not been suspended, which is what happens when you've had any traffic citations during your permit time.
Proof of driving time. In most states you are required to clock a certain number of driving hours, many of which must also have been driven at night.
Proof of identity, address, and legal residence. As listed above, bring the required documents to prove you are who you say you are.
Proof that you're of legal age. Legal age for a restricted license is usually 16 years old, though some states go as low as 14 or as high as 17. (A state-issued birth certificate will do nicely here.)

, You must have a parent or guardian sign this, though this requirement may be waived if you are married or are an emancipated minor.

, This may or may not be required by your state and may be waived if you have a valid permit. You did read the manual again, right?

, It will be just like the last one. Unless your vision changed drastically since you got your permit, you can expect the same results.

, This is it—make or break time! You've studied the books, practiced many hours, and are generally well-prepared, so don't be nervous. Be confident, be safe, and treat your tester with respect.


To take the driving test, you'll need to bring your own vehicle. It must be in safe operating condition, and you must show proof of insurance in order to test.
Bring a licensed driver to the DMV with you, in case you do not pass.

"
"
If you passed, surrender your learner's permit.,
Know your state's point system.,
If you failed, determine why you didn't pass.,
Reread the manual and practice more.,
Retake the test.",How to Get Your Driver's License in the USA3," It served you well, but it's not needed now. They will issue you your first official driver's license. Congratulations! All your work paid off and you're now a licensed driver. You earned it with all your training and studying. But the process isn't quite over yet.


For persons under the age of 21, a distinctive “Under 21” license will be issued. The “Under 21” operator’s license is generally valid for ninety days beyond the 21st birthday.

, As a licensed driver, you'll be subject to your state's point system. A driver under the age of 18 is generally held to a higher standard, and if you get any points against you, you could have your driving privilege suspended, so drive safely.


All drivers under the age of 21 are subject to “Zero Alcohol Tolerance.” Yep, even one beer will wreak havoc on your driving record. Obligatory preachy part: Don't drink and drive, and avoid this issue altogether.

, It may have been a single incident (what do you mean you can't drive 60 in a school zone?) or it might have been a series of small mistakes, like driving over the curbs, doing a rolling stop at stop signs, knocking over all the cones during the parallel parking maneuver, or generally driving poorly. You should figure out what you need to work on before retesting.

, Yes, again. No, it's still not exciting. But you must know the rules that they expect you to follow during the test, or you will not pass next time, either. You should also continue to practice driving some more. If there was a specific problem during the driver's test, be sure to really focus on it.

, Practice during the required waiting period, then go back and do it again. Only this time, you're ready!

Practice driving with an experienced school bus driver.",How to Get a School Bus Driver's License," Federal law requires all commercial drivers, including school bus drivers, to carry a Department of Transportation medical card, which requires a DOT physical. You’ll have to pay a fee for this exam, which you must get before you apply for a commercial learner’s permit (CLP). Your CLP allows you to practice your driving skills with an experienced commercial driver.The physical evaluates whether you are medically qualified to transport students safely. Your state’s CDL manual should have a list of approved physicians to perform this exam.
After you’ve filled out the top of the Medical Examination Report with your personal information and medical history, the physician will fill out the results of the examination and determine whether you meet federal physical requirements for commercial drivers.
Generally, commercial drivers should not have any impairment of hands, arms or legs that would interfere with their ability to grasp the steering wheel or operate a vehicle. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or arthritis will render you ineligible to become a commercial driver.
Commercial drivers also must have natural or corrected vision of at least 20/40 in both eyes and the ability to differentiate between red, green and amber traffic lights.
You also will be tested for drug and alcohol use. Commercial drivers cannot use amphetamines, narcotics or other habit-forming drugs, with or without a prescription.;
, Although the federal DOT sets minimum CDL standards, some states have additional regulations.


You need to bring one or two forms of legal identification, such as a passport or birth certificate, depending on your state’s regulations. Each state also requires proof of state residency and provides a list of documents you can provide as proof to satisfy that requirement.
Your state driver’s license office will check your driving record for the past 10 years, including every state in which you’ve had a license. Many states require CDL holders to have fewer than four points on their licenses.You must be at least 18 years old to get a CDL, but in some states you must be at least 21 years old to drive a school bus., In addition to meeting the general eligibility requirements, you must pass written knowledge tests to earn a CLP. If you want to drive a school bus, you have to pass the general commercial driving test as well as additional tests for the passenger vehicle and school bus endorsements.


Each knowledge test consists of at least 30 questions covering 20 general areas outlined in the federal CDL regulations. You must answer at least 80 percent of the questions correctly on both the general and endorsement tests to pass.Areas tested include procedures for inspection and repair, safe vehicle operations, safety control systems such as lights and horns, vehicle control such as shifting, backing, and skid control, and basic vehicle control and safe driving skills.If you plan to drive school buses with air brakes, you also must pass an additional knowledge test on air brake operation.
The S endorsement written test includes questions on loading and unloading children, proper operation of school-bus specific signal devices, and emergency exits and procedures.You must pay a fee to take the written tests, regardless of whether you pass.

, Before you take the skills tests to get a full CDL, you must have a CLP for at least two weeks.


You may have to pay an additional fee for your CLP. Some states charge a combined fee for the written tests and the CLP. You’ll find a breakdown of all the fees involved in getting a CDL in your state’s CDL manual.
While you have your CLP, practice all of the maneuvers and activities you’ll have to perform on the skills tests.
Some states or school districts may have training courses specifically for school bus driver candidates. In other states, additional training is required after you’ve passed the state skills tests for your CDL with P and S endorsements.
You must take your skills tests before your CLP expires.

, The three parts of the skills test cover vehicle inspection, basic controls and driving. You must pass all three parts of the test to get your CDL.As with the written tests and the CLP, you must pay to take the skills test regardless of whether you pass. Some states charge an additional fee for the CDL itself, while others combine these fees together.
The pre-trip inspection portion of your skills test will evaluate your ability to correctly point out and evaluate monitoring and warning devices, accurately assess brake system condition and evaluate low pressure warnings, and run an operational check of all required alarms and emergency devices.
You'll also be tested on your basic skills in controlling the vehicle, including your ability to start, stop and move your vehicle around in a safe manner.
The third part of the skills test evaluates your safe driving skills. You'll be tested on your visual search methods, the appropriate use of signals, your ability to control the vehicle's speed depending on weather or traffic conditions and appropriately position the vehicle when turning or changing lanes.

, Some endorsements have additional skills that are tested beyond the general skills required to earn a CDL. However, for the passenger vehicle endorsement, all you have to do is take the general skills test in the same class or type of vehicle as that you plan to drive when fully licensed.


Since you want to be a school bus driver, you’ll take your test in a school bus. This means you'll be tested for your CDL with P and S endorsements all at once.Once you’ve passed the skills test, take all of your documentation to your driver’s license office and pay the required fee. In some states you’ll receive your CDL right then, while others mail it to you., Many states require school bus drivers to be certified in basic first aid. Even if it’s not required, the additional certification might improve your chances of being employed as a school bus driver.


First aid certification can be obtained through the Red Cross, or at a local school or other community organization. There normally is a fee to take the certification course and test.
Your local high school or district office will have information on whether this is a requirement in your area, and when and where you can take the appropriate course., Most states require all potential school bus drivers to undergo a criminal background check with the FBI or a state investigative bureau., Federal and state law in all states require pre-employment testing, as well as random testing during employment or immediately after an accident.

, Some states require school bus drivers to train and pass a test evaluating their agility and ability to assist children in emergency situations., Before you can start driving a bus on your own, some states require you to drive a certain number of hours with an experienced driver observing your performance.

Focus on the terms and not on the monthly payments.,
Refinance your loan.",How to Get a Car Loan With No Credit or Bad Credit1," Having your credit reports can give you a detailed picture of where you stand, and can help you pinpoint any errors that may appear on the reports. You can then address these errors before you approach lenders. The three major credit agencies offer free reports once a year.


Pay for your credit scores. Seeing your credit score will cost a few dollars, but it can be worth it to get an idea of how the lenders will treat you. Your scores will likely vary slightly between the credit agencies.;
, Before you go loan shopping, make an effort to pay all of your other bills on time for at least six months. While this won’t have a major impact on your credit, it will show the lenders that you have been responsible lately, and may help get you the loan.

, Check with your financial institution before going to the dealership or other lenders. Your bank may be able to give you favorable terms, and will usually help their customers more than they would a stranger.

, Some insurance companies offer financing as well. Check with them because, like financial institutions, they are more likely to treat their own customers more favorably.

, Don’t take the first loan you are offered, especially if the terms aren’t very good. It will be harder to find a loan with bad credit, and most will come with high interest rates. Try to get your financing before approaching the dealership, as dealership loans are likely to be more expensive.


Try well-known institutions before trying loan shops. Go to reputable banks and other financial institutions before trying lenders that specialize in bad credit. Focus on institutions that are known for dealing heavily in auto loans.

, If you get low monthly payments, but have to pay the loan back for more than 7 years, it’s probably not worth it. You want to try to find the loan that will give you the lowest interest rate and the shortest monthly payments.Make sure terms are final. Some dealerships will increase the monthly payments on your car after a few months. Always read the fine print to ensure that you aren’t getting tricked into a more expensive payment situation.

, After a year of making payments on your loan, you can attempt to get it refinanced. This is especially useful if your financial situation and credit has improved since you took on the loan. Even lowering the interest rate by 1% can save you lots of money in the long run.

Choose an affordable vehicle.",How to Get a Car Loan After Repossession," Your repossession has a few effects on your credit. Firstly, all information remains on your credit report for seven years, and this means your repossession will remain on your report for that period of time. Secondly, you can expect a drop in your credit score of between 60 and 240 points.The point drop depends largely on your current score. The higher your score, the closer you will be to the 240 point decline. This is because a large adjustment is required to reflect your new level of risk to creditors, from the very low level of risk suggested by your high credit score.
While the repossession may remain on your report for seven years, this does not mean you will be unable to get another car loan for seven years. Your ability to get a loan will depend on your credit score, and this will slowly recover as both time passes and as you take proactive steps to reduce your debt and make payments on time.;
, Your first step is to examine your current credit situation. This helps you know where you are financially, and it also helps you understand what actions you can take to improve your credit situation. Knowing your credit score also helps you determine how able you are to access car loans, and what you will be paying to access them.Visit annualcreditreport.com to get a free copy of your credit report. There are three credit bureaus that provide credit reports — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — and annualcreditreport.com allows you to get one free credit report every 12 months from each credit bureau.
You should obtain a report from all three so you can compare to ensure there are no inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
Note that U.S. regulations only entitle you to a free credit report, not a free credit score. Your report outlines all your credit history, and your score gives a rating to this history. You will need to pay a small additional fee to see your credit score.
You can obtain free reports, as well as scores, from myBankrate.com.

, It is not uncommon for your credit report to have incorrect or missing information. Compare credit reports from all three bureaus with your knowledge of your credit history to ensure there are no errors. An error can reduce your credit rating.


You should look for things like old debts you have paid off that are still on your report. Negative items cannot stay on your report for longer than seven years, so if they are there, an error has occur. Pay attention to credit inquiries as well. Every time a lender checks your credit report, it damages your credit, but these inquiries should not remain on your report for more than two years.Also check for information that is not yours.
If you notice an issue, contact the credit bureau to have it corrected.

, Once you have checked your credit score and report, it is important to understand what it means in terms of getting a loan. A repossession often does immediate damage to your credit score, and depending on what your credit score was before the repossession, you may not be in a position to get an affordable loan.


If your credit score is 620 or above, typically you will be able to access a car loan, and if your rate is 620 you can expect an average interest rate of 8.18% on a used car.
If your score is between 550 and 619 you can expect an average rate of 14.15%, and under 550 you can expect a very high rate of 18.33%.
If your credit score is under 550 (or even between 550 and 600), you should seriously consider taking time to rebuild your credit before applying for a car loan. High interest rates will seriously increase your risk of repossession again.
Time and good habits can be your best friend in this regard, waiting one year and repaying debt can greatly improve the interest rate you receive.

, Understanding what determines your credit score will help you understand how to repair it. There are 5 major areas that affect your credit score.Payment history represents 35% of your score. To improve this area you need to pay your all your bills on time every time.
Amount owed represents 30% of your score. This is based on how much you owe as a percentage of your total available credit. Lowering your debt (or boosting your available credit) improves this part.
Length of credit history represents 15%. This is why waiting for a period after repossession before reapplying can be helpful.
New credit and types credit represent the rest. The more new accounts you open, the worse your score is affected. At the same time, having different types of credit (credit card, line of credit, mortgage, car loan) is good.

, You will see all your outstanding debt on your credit report. You should start by targeting the most expensive debt, or debt balances that are extremely late. Most often, credit card debt is the first debt that should be addressed because the interest rates are highest.


Consider a balance transfer credit card. A balance transfer card allows you to transfer your balance from a current card to a new card, and pay no (or very low) interest for a period of typically one to two years. You can use this period to put any extra money you have on to the card, and it will be paid down quicker due to lower interest rates..
Rather than spreading payments across many sources of debt at once, make the absolute minimum payment on most of your debt, and apply all extra to your high-interest credit card debt.

, Closing a card account may seem like a good idea, but it can actually damage your credit score more. Remember that one factor determining your credit score is how much of your available credit you use. When you close a card, you reduce your available credit, which can damage your score. If you have difficulty not using your credit card, try cutting up the card or leaving it at home. This will allow you to spend only money you have available. This may be challenging, but learning to live without credit can be the single best move you can make to improve your credit score in the short-term.
Some people freeze their cards in ice and keep them them in the freezer to make their use more difficult. You won't be able to make an impulse purchase if you have to wait for a block of ice to melt before you can use your card.

, Many people do not realize that lenders are far more negotiable than they seem. A lender would prefer to give a customer a reduced rate, or more flexible terms if it means both keeping the customer happy and increasing the odds of them recovering their principal and interest. This is especially true if you have been a long-time customer.


When you speak to your lender, explain your financial situation, and ask if they can potentially lower your rate for a period while you make regular payments. Make sure to suggest a closed-ended period (like 6 months). If the individual you talk to is unable to help, ask to speak to a supervisor.

, During the period you are rebuilding your credit, remember that you need to demonstrate exceptional repayment habits. This means prioritizing paying debts on time and in full at all cost, for a 6 month to 1 year period. Consider how you can make changes to your lifestyle to accommodate a greater emphasis on repaying debt.


Look carefully at your monthly expenses. Some areas, like entertainment spending and food spending can often be reduced by choosing more affordable forms of entertainment, and focusing on preparing more meals at home. Little things like purchasing a coffee everyday can add up significantly.
Also look to your key fixed expenses like your rent, or your phone bill. You could perhaps consider looking to downsize your living situation (if possible for you), or consider downgrading your phone plan to a more basic plan.

, If your car is repossessed and the sale value is less than the current value of your outstanding debt, you may owe money even after the repossession. It is important to pay this off quickly and prioritize this debt, as it will reduce the impact to your credit score, remove an outstanding balance from your credit report, and prevent the balance from growing due to interest charges.


If you have the monthly cash flow to be able to repay the debt, put as much as possible towards repaying it.
If you are unable to repay, consider approaching your lender to discuss a debt settlement or altered repayment plan. A debt settlement involves negotiating a reduced payment amount with your lender. Once paid, this reduced amount should be regarded as ""paid in full"" on your credit report.
Your lender may also be open to a more flexible or adjusted payment plan that involves more time or lower interest charges to reduce your overall monthly payment.
Approach your lender to discuss these options. Debt settlement should be the last option you pursue only after other options have been exhausted, because it can have a damaging effect on your credit score. If you have any questions, contact a local credit counselor for aid.

, Putting down a down-payment can significantly improve your odds of approval and even your interest rate. It demonstrates that you ability to save a down-payment, while also reducing risk for the lender. When you make a down-payment the lender knows that if necessary, they can repossess and sell the car to recoup the amount they loaned, since the loaned amount was less than the value of the car (due to the down-payment)..


How much down-payment should you consider. To start, any down-payment will help your odds of approval, but many experts recommend 20%. Saving this may take time, but it is worth it, since you will not only be improving your credit over that time period, but you will also be reducing the amount you need to borrow, which can help lower your interest and principal payments.

, A co-signer can greatly improve your odds of both approval, and of getting a reasonable rate. Combining a co-signer with a down-payment and months of responsible credit history can help you secure a very affordable loan. A co-signer refers to somebody who can pay the loan if you are unable to.


Approach a parent, close friend, or sibling and ask if they can assist. A co-signer should have excellent credit, but also a good and trustworthy relationship with you.
Do not involve a co-signer unless you are very serious about responsible re-payment -- your co-signers credit could be damaged if you do not repay.

, When you are ready to approach lenders, to not consider just one. You want to ideally go to multiple lenders to compare interest rates. This can help you ensure you are getting the best rate possible.


Remember to be honest and open with lenders about financial history. Never lie, clearly explain why you received a repossession in the past, and what actions you have taken since then to improve your finances.

, Remember that the more affordable of a vehicle you choose, the less you will need to borrow, and the more likely you are to get approved for lending. After repossession you should be looking strictly at used vehicles.


It is possible to find an excellent deal on a used vehicle if you shop at multiple lots as well as online via sites like Kijiji. Compare several vehicles to try and find a vehicle that has the lowest mileage for the lowest price.
Never purchase a car without getting it look at by a mechanic first. You want to ensure there are no outstanding issues that you are taking on when you buy the car. These types of issues can be costly and can add thousands to your purchase price.

Make payments on time.",How to Get a Car Loan With No Credit or Bad Credit2," If you have no credit history, the first step towards getting a car loan is opening a bank account. A bank account will be your first step into the world of credit, and will be the base of your loan. You do not need any prior credit to open a basic checking or savings account.

, A large down payment on a car will make the loan easier to get, and will result in having to pay less for the car in the long run. If you can, try to save up between 10-20% of the total cost of the car.The more you can save for the down payment, the less you’ll have to pay later on.

, You will need a copy of your new bank statement, proof of employment history, and any paid bills such as your phone or utilities. These will show the lender that you are able to make payments on a loan.

, A cosigner will help shoulder the responsibility of your payments. Be very aware of the risk that your cosigner is in. If you don’t make your payments, it falls on the cosigner to do so, otherwise their credit gets damaged. Make sure that you have a good relationship with your cosigner, and treat the loan with respect.

, Your financial institution is more likely to give you a favorable loan than any other place. Banks like to do business with their own customers, so you will be treated more favorably than a stranger.


Check with other reputable banks and lending institutions before moving on to car dealerships. Finding a loan with no credit is usually easier than finding one with bad credit.

, If your bank is unable to get a loan for you, ask the dealership where you plan to purchase your car what kind of loan options they offer. A dealer is very likely to try to get a loan for you so that they can make a profit. Be aware that a dealership loan will usually be more expensive than a bank loan.

, Once you have your loan, always make your monthly payments on time. This will be your first major entry in your credit history, and starting strong will lead to much better credit in the future.

Changes of station, coupled with multiple deployments, make it easy for your credit report to be updated incorrectly, or not updated at all. If you find any issues, you can file a dispute to have them removed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)or other appropriate organisation. This process ensures you have the cleanest credit report possible, ultimately leading to an easier, more affordable lending experience.;
, As a military service man or woman, you are eligible to join a number of different banks and credit unions that cater to members of the armed services. Examples include USAA Bank, Navy Federal Credit Union (FCU), Air Force Federal Credit Union (FCU), PenFed, Armed Forces Bank, Abbey National etc. These financial institutions have long histories of offering military personnel affordable interest rates and solid customer service, and their staffs have experience assisting those dealing with the financial hardships common to military life.

, Approval criteria vary from one lender to the next, so check with your bank or credit union. In most cases you will need an income of $1500 (or equivalent) to qualify for a loan. Fortunately, this income requirement is typically met even as a new private, seaman, or airman. Lenders typically prefer you to be on the job for at least 24 months prior to approval, but they often waive this requirement for military personnel since your contract guarantees how long you will be employed (enlistment duration). The same goes for time at residence. As far as credit score, military-oriented lenders may be more lenient, since the federal government allows wage garnishments of military personnel in case of default.

, Most lending institutions now allow you to submit this online, which makes the process quite painless. Make sure to answer each question as accurately as possible, as your information will be subjected to a validation process, the failing of which could be grounds for automatic rejection. Most banks respond to your application with a decision within one business day, and if you have good credit and income, your approval could be instantaneous.

, Unless you apply for your loan already knowing which vehicle you want, your lender will issue you what's often referred to as a ""blank check."" This term is a little misleading, because in all actuality it only approves you for a set amount. For example, $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, etc. You will give this document to your dealership finance person, and they will work with your bank or lender to finalize everything.

, Your bank or credit union will likely impose a few criteria as far as the age, condition, and mileage of the vehicle you want to purchase. In most cases, they require you to select a car with less than 75,000–100,000 miles (121,000–161,000 km), that's no more than seven to eight years old. Depending on your credit score, you will probably be able to finance six to ten times your monthly income. However, it is typically best to spend no more than 50% of your annual income, or six times your monthly income, including any down payment.

, This is especially important if you opt for dealer-arranged financing, as you could find yourself subject to a ""spot delivery"" or ""yo-yo"" scam. This where the sale is not final, but rather conditional on the dealer finding a buyer for your auto loan. Unfortunately, junior military members are often targeted with type of scam. If you've confirmed that the purchase is final, enjoy the drive home in your newly-purchased vehicle!

, Your credit score is comprised of your payment history (35%), amounts you've owed (30%), the length of your credit history (15%), how many different types of credit you have in use (10%), and how many account inquiries you've made (10%).It will also include a credit diagnosis and a summary of each line of credit you have open.Knowing your credit score can help you negotiate better loan terms, instead of having to accept whatever loan offer you're given.Your credit score can affect the amount of interest that you will have to pay on an auto loan. A poor credit score may result in a high interest rate, while a good credit score may result in a lower interest rate.
Make sure you know your credit score before you ever walk into a dealership.
You can learn your credit score for free by using online sources like Credit Karma, or get your free annual credit score through a major reporting agency like Equifax or Experian.
Visit AnnualCreditReport.com or call 1-877-322-8228 to find out more information.

, Once you know your credit score, you can shop around for a better loan. It's best to do this before going to a dealership, as this gives you a better idea of what your options are.You're not under any obligation to take the loan offer that the auto dealership gives you.
If you go to the dealership with other loan quotes, you may be able to negotiate for a better loan from the dealer. If not, you can simply turn down the dealer's loan and go with the better loan.
You can find loan offers through banks, local credit unions, or even an online lender. Just make sure you research the lender to ensure that they are a legitimate business with good terms and interest rates.

, If you have bad credit, you may be worried about what your options are. Just because you have bad credit, it doesn't mean you have to take the first loan that you're offered. There are plenty of options available for you, if you're willing to shop around.Most credit unions are local institutions that work within your community. Credit unions tend to offer more flexible payment plans and lower interest rates, even if you have bad credit.
You may also want to consider a peer-to-peer lending service like Lending Club. You can get a better interest rate, but the evaluation process is thorough, with only about 10% of applicants getting approved.

, Once you receive a loan offer, you'll want to look into the conditions of that loan and decide if it's right for you. There are plenty of aspects to consider, but the most important are the interest rate, the down payment requirement, and the term of the loan.The interest rate is how much extra you'll be paying for taking out the loan, applied as an annual percentage rate (APR). The term of the loan is how long you have to repay the loan, usually calculated in months.
Some lenders charge a prepayment penalty if you pay off your loan before the end of the loan term, as this loses the lender money in interest. For example, if you took out a 60-month loan but paid it off in 50 months, the lender loses the interest that would have accrued over the remaining 10 months, and may charge you a penalty.It's worth comparing all aspects of the loan. A lower interest rate is good and may tempt you, but if it requires a higher downpayment and several extra months on the loan term, you may end up paying more.

, If you're in a pinch, you can always ask a friend or family member for a loan. Financial issues can create a lot of tension between friends/relatives, so it's important to proceed with caution.Ask politely and respectfully.
Say something like, ""Could we work out an arrangement where I borrow $_____ from you? That way I could pay a lower interest rate than a bank would charge, and I can pay you back a higher interest rate than your money would have accrued in a savings account.""
If your friend/relative is reluctant, you can always offer to put your vehicle up as collateral. But if you do so, be aware that you'll need to pay back the loan or your friend may actually take your vehicle.
Savings accounts usually offer interest rates below 5%. Offering your friend/relative an interest rate on the loan around 5% to 6% would be fair and beneficial to everyone.Determine how long it will take you to repay the loan, and work out a reasonable repayment schedule with your friend/relative.
Put the agreement in writing, including the repayment schedule, and sign it to make it a binding promissory note.

, Depending on your situation, refinancing may be a wonderful option. It can help you get a better loan, but it may only be worth it if certain circumstances have changed since you took out your existing loan.If interest rates have dropped by more than a few points, it may be worth refinancing your loan.
If you've improved your credit score since you took out your loan, refinancing will most likely help you get a better loan.
If your personal financial situation has gone downhill and you need to lower your payments, refinancing can help you get a better monthly rate.

, There are certain restrictions and limitations to refinancing. Not everyone qualifies for a refinanced loan. In order to decide if you're eligible, a financial institution will evaluate your financial situation, the terms of your existing loan, and/or your vehicle.You will typically need a 6 to 12 month history of on-time loan payments to qualify.
Check to see if there are any prepayment penalties on your existing loan. If there are, you'll have to pay that penalty should you choose to refinance.
If your vehicle is past a certain age or if your existing loan is outside a predetermined range (set by the financial institution), you may not be eligible to refinance your loan., Once you've made the decision to refinance and you know that you're eligible, you'll want to shop around to find the best offer. This should require just as much investigative work on your end as you would put into getting a new loan, so be sure you assess all of your available options.Check with numerous lenders to find the best interest rate that you qualify for.
During the application process, if you choose ""auto pay"" for your repayment options, you may get the lowest possible interest rate.
If you're able to pay the new loan off sooner, it may be worth shortening the term of the new loan you receive. This will help you save money on interest rates.

Solicit rate quotes from several lenders before agreeing to a loan.,
Ask the lender with the best rate offer for a pre-qualification letter outlining the terms and conditions of the loan.,
Provide the lender with information about the vehicle you choose.",How to Finance a Used Car1," Lenders will use your credit report and score to determine whether to approve the loan, and if so what interest rate to offer you.


If your credit score is 680 or above, you are considered a prime borrower and are eligible for the best interest rates available. The higher your score, the more bargaining power you have to negotiate a low interest rate.;
,


Many lenders offer 5 year loans, as long as the car you are purchasing is less than 5 years old. Most vehicles older than 5 years are only eligible for 1 to 2 year loans, if the lender will even finance them. Lenders are fearful that an older car will not last for 5 years.
Additionally, lenders often impose minimum mileage restrictions (often 100,000 miles) and will not finance salvage-titled vehicles. Typically they will only fund loans for vehicles purchased through a franchised dealership, not through a private party or independent dealer.

, The interest rates offered on used car loans are generally 4 to 6 percent higher than rates offered on new car loans.

, Bring this letter with you to the dealership when shopping for the car.

, You will need to provide the car's make, model and VIN number, among other things. The lender will then originate the loan.

Apply for financing through a used car dealer.,
Make sure you research competitive interest rates based on your credit score.,
Offer a down payment in cash or trade equivalent to 10% of the vehicle's purchase price.",How to Finance a Used Car2,"


In general, interest rates offered by dealerships are higher than interest rates you can find directly from a lender. Therefore, you may want to apply for a direct loan first.
Dealers will typically finance any used car they sell, regardless of its age. Therefore, you may want to apply for a dealer loan if a direct lender denies you financing.

,


Dealers sometimes ""pad"" the rate from the lender, charging you a slightly higher interest rate than you qualify for, and keeping the additional profits. Therefore it is imperative to know not only your credit score, but the interest rate you deserve based on that score.

,


Vehicles are depreciating assets, which means that negative equity can be an issue. Providing a down payment of at least 10% of the vehicle's purchase price will not only increase your chances of dealer approval, but it will minimize any risk of being ""upside down"" on your new vehicle.

All three calculate scores separately and charge a fee to learn your number score. You are entitled to one free report (not including your score) annually, from each of the agencies.You can request this online or reach out to each company by phone:

, If any of your credit reports record debts, late payments, or anything else that lessens your financial reputation, check against your own records and memories. You are free to dispute any false records or those you deem contestable.All of the credit unions have an option to dispute. Once you have requested a report online, click the ""dispute"" button. Enter any relevant facts and proof about the things you think are false. The source of that information (i.e. credit card companies, electric/gas providers, etc.) will be sent a notice and will verify your info within 30 days., Outstanding payments can take many forms: credit card payments; student loans; electric, gas, internet, phone, and water bills; as well as apartment rental fees. With your credit report in hand, identify the various debts you still have and, ideally, pay them off completely. Of course, you may not have the money to do this. Understanding your own personal budget, pay off as much of your debts as possible. Any progress out of debt will be an improvement to your credit score and make you a more attractive borrower to loan lenders.

, Don’t apply for a loan until you have been living in the same place for at least six months.Lenders check addresses and income for all applicants. Those who appear nomadic (moving often) may seem like a poor choice from their perspective.

, This is a common mistake for recent graduates, but applies to all loan applicants. Showing that you have a consistent source of income for at least the past six months will also make you a more attractive borrower.

, Even if it is in small increments, evidence that you can and will consistently save money offers further proof of your financial responsibility. This in turn promotes your likelihood of receiving a loan, because it shows you are also likely to be able to make loan payments.Take a small portion (5 – 10%) of your monthly income and deposit it in your savings account each time. Over time this will add up and establish your savings history.

, Keep in mind your credit score and your personal budget. Whether your credit is ‘‘deep subprime’’ (500 and below), ‘‘subprime’’ (501 – 600), ‘‘non prime’’ (601 – 660), or even higher, will affect your choice. For example, with deep subprime credit, if your monthly budget is already slim, then most likely you will want to be looking for a used car. Although it is true new cars often come with lower interest rates, with lower credit scores, you will end up with larger monthly payments that you may not be able to afford.Online databases like Craigslist, Auto Trader, and eBay Motors are all a good place to begin your search for an affordable car., Especially for people with subprime credit and below, many loans will entail at least a 10% down payment. It is also possible to trade in other vehicles as down payment, though this may not always be possible. In any case, the more money (or trade value) you present to lenders, the more likely you will be approved., The main things you will be proving are residency and income. Utility bills, rental agreements, mortgage statements, and in some cases cell phone bills are acceptable proof of residency. Pay stubs, as well as official W-2 or 1099 forms, are most commonly requested to prove income. In the case of food service jobs and other similar positions where much of the income is in cash tips, bring bank statements. If you have been depositing that money, their consistent presence on your bank statements will be reassuring to your lender.Make sure that your name is printed on all documents.
Documents that are 30 days old or less are preferred.
If you stop making loan payments, repo trucks will come to the address you provide.

, Credit unions are non-profit organizations owned by the members, and are known for offering competitive loan rates.If you want a car loan with low interest and flexible repayment terms, belonging to a credit union may offer the most attractive option.


Be sure to ask whether they have an approved dealer list. If the car dealer or person you’re doing business with is not included, you will need to look for another lender or perhaps choose a different dealer.

, A car loan from a bank will require better credit and in some cases, a pre-existing banking relationship. Although this option often requires higher credit scores, if you qualify, banks typically offer competitive loan rates.Inspect the terms and interest rates. The higher credit standards often held by banks usually means they can offer better terms. Use a bank loan only if the interest and payment terms are better than what you find through your other options.
Make sure that the car dealership you are working with is on the bank’s list of approved dealers. Otherwise you will have to find a different lender, or choose another dealer.

, Capital One, Up2Drive, Blue Harbor and other financial institutions offer car financing and often partner with specific dealers to offer low rates on particular cars. Applying online has another advantage because it encourages financial institutions to compete to win you over, and likely will produce a competitive rate.Be aware that working through online lenders creates the risk of your personal information being shared insecurely. This could lead to you getting contacted by lenders to whom you have no connection. Be safe and check the website with the Better Business Bureau., You may have money saved up for a down payment, or you could plan to trade in an old car. Only get a loan for the balance of what your new car will cost.

, Before committing to one lender, make sure to contact as many lenders as possible. Compare the interest rates, max amount, and terms of each offer. When looking at loans, you must consider the APR (annual percentage rate) and the term (time period over which it is paid).


Longer terms may seem attractive as they give you more time to pay off a loan. However, depending on the rate you agree upon, a longer term can result in you paying more in interest than you would have with a shorter term.Cars acquired through long-term loans will build equity more slowly than short-term loans.This means that if you decide to trade-in or sell your car earlier than expected, you won’t earn enough money to pay the remainder of the loan. This is called being upside-down., When you show up with financing already in hand, you are in a strong position to get a better price for the car you want.


See if the dealer can beat the terms for the car loan for which you are already approved. Use your loan as a bargaining chip when you negotiate.

, Car dealerships are notorious for taking advantage of clientele who come for financing. Before you consider this option, try getting a loan from banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Beware any offers for “spot delivery.”Dealers offer this before finalizing and signing terms of financing only to force higher rates at a later date. Read the complete wording of any contracts and agreements you sign.


Review state laws surrounding auto financing. In some cases, like Illinois, the dealer is required to return your down payment and/or trade in should they be unable to find financing at the rate stated in your contract.

, Dealers may try to sell cars to you for far more than they are worth. Similarly, they may try to make a profit on auto loans. Talk with your personal bank or credit union for advice on the vehicle’s value. Keep this in mind during negotiations.



Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds both offer helpful search engines as a resource to find used and new cars' true value.

, The first thing the dealer will do when you apply for a car loan is run a credit check. Know where you stand before you apply so they cannot use your ignorance to negotiate a bad deal. Similarly, bring any pre-approved loans you have acquired with you. Your knowledge will be a powerful bargaining tool and protect you against unfair or deceitful business tactics.

, Some dealerships will offer zero percent financing or allow you to skip your first couple of car payments. This will also depend on your credit.

, Getting your car loan from the dealer means you run the risk of confusing the actual price of the car with what you will pay on a monthly basis after the interest and other financing costs are considered. Be aware of how much you can afford to pay each month, but do not tell the salesperson.


Negotiate for the lowest price on the car with the confidence you gained through researching your credit and other loan options.Settle on the price of the car when you are negotiating, not the monthly car payment.

, When you obtain your car loan through the dealer, a larger down payment or a valuable trade-in will help you reach better financing terms.

, Some dealers will use deceitful tricks to gouge more money from people, or try to include attractive but unnecessary costs in the deal. The most common in car dealerships are the yo-yo trap and upselling.


The yo-yo trap involves offering conditional financing so purchasers can take home their car that day. Days or weeks later, the dealer will call and say the financing won’t go through and you now have to pay a higher interest rate. To avoid this, tell the dealer you won’t accept delivery of the car until financing is final.
Upselling focuses on selling you add-ons like extended warranties and rustproofing during the negotiation of financing. You can purchase any of these things after the fact. Be sure to exclude them from the conversation until financing and car cost are decided in print and signed., Make sure you understand the price of the car, associated costs, the amount of your down payment, the interest rate, what your monthly car payment will be, when it will be due and how long until you have the car paid off.

Determine the amount you will need to finance via a vehicle loan.,

Ask the dealership to match the best loan offer you collected from the competing financial institutions.,
Read all loan contract and purchase agreements carefully before signing.",How to Finance a New Car,"


Your total costs will likely be significantly more than the sticker price of the new vehicle including sales taxes, warranty payments, and licensing fees that ultimately make up the total price of the vehicle. Depending on the vehicle cost and dealership requirements, this could add a few thousand dollars to your total vehicle price.
Making a down-payment will help reduce the total loan amount, thus decreasing your monthly payments and interest expenses. Provide as large a down-payment as possible based on your cash reserves and payment ability.;
,


Car dealerships often have a financing department operating in-house. However, they may not have the most attractive loan terms for which you could be eligible. While these in-house financing departments offer the convenience of being tied directly to the dealership, you should seek offers from competing loan providers so you have more than one to consider.
Credit unions are non-profit organizations and may offer members better interest rates on vehicle loans. Banks might also offer a better deal based on other loans or deposit accounts you hold there.

,


If a bank or other private lender offers you better loan terms than the car dealership, ask the dealership if they would be willing to match the best competing offer. Many dealership financing departments would rather match a competing offer than lose your lending business. Never assume that their first offer will be their best offer.

,


Review all paperwork to verify everything matches the terms the salesman or loan officer promised you. It's easy to overlook hidden fees and non-disclosed penalties in the fine print of an agreement or contract.

Know what to look for.,
Check with your bank.,
Consider joining a credit union.,
Talk to your car dealership.",How to Compare Car Loan Rates1," A good car loan rate is based on several factors. The loan amount, the APR (Annual Percentage Rate), and the term of the loan all affect the amount of money you will end up spending or saving after your car has been paid off.The loan amount is the initial total cost of the loan; however, you will end up paying more than the total cost because an interest rate is added to each payment. In addition, there may be additional taxes and fees included in the loan amount.
The APR is a key number to pay attention to when evaluating a loan. It is the yearly interest rate that is added to the total cost of the loan. The higher the APR, the more money you will owe on the loan. For example, a $15,000 loan with an APR of 7% will cost you $500 more than a $15,000 loan with an APR of 5%.
The term of the loan is also a key component. This is the amount of time you are given to pay off the loan. Terms can range from 36 to 82 months. Taking the interest rate into account, the shorter the term, the more money you ultimately save. A $15,000 loan at 6.5% APR paid over the course of 36 months will have a higher monthly payment $460 per month, and a total interest of $1,500. The same loan with the same APR paid over the course of 60 months will have a lower monthly payment ($293), but you will ultimately pay $2,610 in interest — $1,110 more. Longer term loans often have higher interest rates, which means you would end up paying even more interest in the long-term.
Look out for extra fees. Read the fine print. Some loans have extra charges apart from the loan and APR. Ask about such charges over the phone or in-person.
Additional charges vary. Sometimes there is opening cost for the loan. Other loans charge penalties for paying the loan off early.;
, Banks often have competitive loan rates; however, they usually only offer these rates to people with excellent credit. Set up a meeting with your bank if you have a good relationship., With low operating costs, credit unions have competitive rates, but usually only lend to their members. Join a credit union to capitalize on their low rates., Car dealerships usually do not have the best loan rates; however, it is worth it to see what they have to offer. They are often willing to work with people with low credit scores, although the rates may be higher.Once you have checked the APRs and terms offered by banks and credit unions, you will have a better sense of what is available on the market.Do your research before entering the dealership. The dealer sets the price of the car, but you also need to discuss how the car will be payed for. You will have some negotiating power if you know what is offered at other institutions.
Read the fine print. Some dealerships offer good loan rates but will not offer a rebate if you take the loan. If you were looking to get a rebate, consider searching for a loan elsewhere."

Determine the amount of money that you will be using as a down payment on the vehicle.,
Examine the company history of each car loan lender that you are considering borrowing money from.,
Apply for loans at several different financial institutions.",How to Compare Car Loan Rates2," The size of the down payment affects the amount of interest that you will have to pay. A larger down payment may qualify you for lower interest rates, so it is in your best interest to pay as much as you can upfront., If you are considering loans only from banks or credit unions that you are already familiar with and have had dealings with in the past, this may not be necessary.


However, if you are considering using a smaller lender or online lender with whom you are unfamiliar, you should learn about the company history with auto loans. Contact the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to learn about any complaints that have been lodged against your potential lenders and to insure that the company is in good standing with the BBB., Loan applications can be made either on the Internet or in person at financial institutions in your area. When you get loan offers from more than one place, you will have a basis for comparison.


Loan offers may be similar. Still, there are times that a one percent difference can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the long term.
Keep in mind that making loan applications beyond a 30 day period from first to last may adversely affect your credit score.

Use a car loan calculator to calculate monthly payments.,
Calculate rates on your own.,
Compare the total interest cost of each loan.,
Consider perks or inconveniences.",How to Compare Car Loan Rates3," Find a loan calculator that allows you to enter key information including the price of the car, the down payment, the interest rates and the loan term. Websites like allsate.com and bankrate.com have useful calculation tools. These tools can help you see which loans will save you the most money in the long run. , If you are not able to access an online calculator, you can use your own calculations to get a sense of which loan will save you the most money. Prepare to use the total cost of the loan, the APR (interest rate), the term (the time you have to pay the loan) and the any other fees that apply.


Determine how many years you have to pay the loan. For example, a 36 month term gives you three years to pay off the loan.
Divide the total cost of the loan by the number of years you have to pay the loan. For example, if you take out a $15,000 loan with a three year term, the yearly cost would be $5,000.
Multiply the the yearly cost of the loan by the interest rate to see how much money you would pay in yearly interest. For example, if your APR is 5%, multiply the .05 by 5,000 (.05 X 5,000 = 250). Your yearly interest rate would be $250. Instead of paying, $5,000 per year, you would pay $5,250 per year or $437.50 per month.

, The dollar amounts of total interest paid may vary widely, so be sure to do all the necessary calculations.


To determine the total interest costs of each lender, multiply the total monthly payment times the number of monthly payments, then subtract original loan amount from total to isolate interest cost.
Look carefully at the monthly payment for each loan and choose one that you can afford., Think about how and when you will make your loan payments. It may be more convenient to take out a loan with your dealership and avoid dealing with another financial institution. On the other hand, your bank may make paying your loan easier for you.

Find out how much you can afford up front.,
Know your credit score.,
Compare loan rates online.,
Get the necessary materials together.",How to Finance a Car1," If you know the ballpark value of what you want to pay for a vehicle, and how much you can afford to pay in cash, you will know about how much you will need to finance.Maximize your down payment. A smart way to finance a car is to get as much of a down payment as you can. The more you can pay at the beginning of a deal, the less you will have to pay in interest. Even if you have to temporarily sell some assets to buy the car outright, that can be a better deal than financing a major portion of the cost.;
, Much of the financing offer for a car is based on your credit score. Those with good credit will get better interest rates and cheaper car financing offers. This is important no matter who you finance your vehicle through.


Find out your credit score either through the dealer or online at websites like www.annualcreditreport.com, www.freecreditscore.com, www.creditkarma.com, or www.myfico.com.
If your credit score is higher than 680, you are considered a prime borrower and are eligible for the best interest rates available. The higher your score, the better bargaining position you will be in.

, There are many websites that compare deals at no cost. Additionally, it is a great way to get in contact with various companies., Most lenders will want your name, social security number, date of birth, previous and current addresses, occupation, proof of income, and information on other outstanding debts."

Contact certified lenders.,
Solicit rate quotes from several lenders.,
Get prequalified.,
Ask the lender with the best rate offer for a pre-qualification letter.",How to Finance a Car2," Local and national banks, as well as credit unions can give you the terms and interest rates they are offering on used car loans over the phone and online. Shop around and find the best rate for you. You don't have to apply for financing through the dealer, though you certainly can. Oftentimes you can get a fairer deal when you figure out your financing first before you walk into the dealership. Apply for financing through a bank or an app that connects you to lenders (like AutoGravity). Oftentimes, credit unions have the lowest interest rates, especially if you are a member. Check with your employer to see if they have any connections with local credit unions for you to take advantage of.
Many lenders offer 5 year loans on vehicles that are five years old at most. Older vehicles are often only eligible for 1 to 2 year loans. In many cases, the fear is that an older car will break down and then borrowers will default on their loans.
Additionally, lenders often impose mileage restrictions (often 100,000 miles) and will not finance salvage-titled vehicles. Typically, they will only fund loans for vehicles purchased through a franchised dealership, not through a private party or independent dealer. In these cases, you’ll have to get a deal loan. See below.

, The interest rates offered on used car loans are generally 4 to 6 percent higher than rates offered on new car loans. This is because lenders are fearful of financing used vehicles.Be as specific as possible with a lender. Provide the lender with information about the vehicle you choose. You will need to provide the car's make, model and VIN number, among other things. The more detail you can give the lender, the more firm your rate quote will be.
Talk to lenders about any fees or extra charges. Some lenders offer low interest rates and make back the money by tacking on additional fees and charges to a loan deal. You'll want to know about these, as well as any other specific loan agreement aspects like prepayment penalties, which can trigger fees if you pay the loan off early.

, Fill out the paperwork ahead of time. Many banks or lenders will pre-qualify you for a car loan based on your credit score, the type of car you plan on purchasing, and your driving history.

, It should outline the terms and conditions of the loan. Bring this letter with you to the dealership when shopping for the car. When you go to the dealer's lot, you can show them evidence pre-qualification from a reputable lender. This will expedite the car buying experience. It will also tell the car dealer you are ready to buy.


If you haven’t prequalified, you can get financing at the dealer's lot for a one-stop shopping experience, but having other lender alternatives helps you to get the best deal.

In general, interest rates offered by dealerships are higher than interest rates you can find directly from a lender. In many cases, smaller dealerships work with third party lenders to finance your vehicle. Because they play the middleman, they pass off the costs to you. Therefore, you may want to apply for a direct loan first and cut out the dealership middleman.In some cases, financing lenders like local banks and credit unions won’t take a chance on used cars. For used cars, most dealers will finance used cars they sell, regardless of its age. Therefore, you may want to apply for a dealer loan if a direct lender denies you financing.

, Bring interest rates from direct loan lenders, even if you plan on financing with the dealer. Dealers are more likely to offer lower interest rates, if you show them that you know what other lenders are offering. Make sure you research competitive interest rates based on your credit score.

, The larger the down payment, the less money you will have to finance and the less interest you’ll have to pay on that loan."

Negotiate your auto loan.,
Buy auto insurance.",How to Calculate a Down Payment for a Car1," Dealerships make money by offering higher interest loans than other financial institutions.Because of that, you should know ahead of time how much you are willing to spend, and stick to that. Generally, if you have a credit score above 650, you should be able to get financing through a bank or credit union for a much better interest rate than at a dealership.;
, Most analysts recommend putting at least 20% down on your car, although the average down payment in recent years has been only 12%. The danger of putting less than 20% down is that your car may lose resale value faster than you pay off your loan, leaving you “upside down” or unable to pay off your loan by selling the car.


Unless you have practice investing, it is generally smarter to pay for as much of your car as possible up front rather than investing in savings and using the earnings to make monthly car payments. The interest cost on the car loan is generally higher than you can expect to earn on a short-term investments. However, the new zero interest loans might make sense if the price of the car is as low as it would be paying cash.
If you do decide to pay less of a down payment than you can afford, paying at least 20% of the car's cost as a down payment will increase the chances that your car retains its value above the amount outstanding in your loan.

, How much can you afford to spend on your car payment each month? And for how long?


Consider the type of car you will be buying and how long you will drive it as well, when thinking about the life of your loan.

, Use online resources to look at the cars for sale in your area. Use Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds to find the fair value of the car before going to the dealership. Make a list of a few cars at different dealerships you would be interested in.


If you want to trade in your current car, look at the fair value of it using one of the same tools. Most car value calculators include an option to calculate the trade-in value of the car.
Consider buying a used car. New cars are the most expensive and lose their value a lot faster than used cars.You can buy a one- to three-year-old car and save thousands off the price you would pay for a brand new one.

, Once you have an idea of what you want and what you can afford, go look at the cars you wrote down on your list. Test drive them, and if you like one, make an offer. Start by offering less than the fair value for the car based on your research. If the dealer rejects your offer, leave the lot. You can come back later if you want, but physically leaving will signal that you are serious about looking for a bargain.


Don’t be persuaded to test drive a car you didn’t come to look at. Because they are paid on commission, dealers will want you to buy as expensive a car as possible, regardless of your financial position. Make clear that you came to see only a specific car or type of car, and that you won’t stray from that price range.
Don’t tell the dealer about a car you are planning to trade in until after you have made a deal. This will ensure you get the best offer possible from the dealer before offering to trade in your car.

, When you’ve found a car you like for a price that seems right, accept the offer. Then you can negotiate the type of financing you will get. You will have to apply for a loan through the dealership, so they will likely want to see your recent pay stubs as proof of income, as well as identification.

, This is where your down payment comes in — the more you are able to pay in down payment, the less you have to borrow from the dealership. The dealer may try to convince you to borrow everything from them — that’s because they earn interest on the money you borrow. This is also when you should notify the dealer if you are interested in trading in a vehicle.


Think about how long you realistically plan to drive this car as you determine the life of the loan. A dealer will try to entice you with very low monthly payments, but beware as this tactic will keep you making monthly payments for years to come.
If possible, try to get a loan for three years or less. A shorter term with a higher monthly payment will save you a lot of money in total rather than making low monthly payments for a very long time.

, Dealers will be more open to financing a car with a salvaged title, but you will still need to get insurance on the vehicle you purchase. If you have pre-existing insurance, you can likely call your agent and add your new vehicle.

Plan ahead.,
Go to the bank.,
Consider insurance.,
Make a budget.,
Shop for a car.,
Negotiate.,
Make your purchase.",How to Calculate a Down Payment for a Car2," The first thing you should do when you decide to buy a car is decide how much you can afford to pay upfront, and how much of a monthly payment you can afford. You should also consider the costs of borrowing to buy a car, as you will pay interest on your auto loan. Decide how long you are willing to make payments and whether the cost of borrowing is worth it.


Use online tools like Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds to research different cars and price ranges. This way you can get an idea of what you want without having a salesperson pressuring you.
Decide whether you are willing to purchase a used car. Used cars generally offer a lot more value than new ones, as new cars lose about 10% of their resale value as soon as they leave the lot, and about 20% of their resale value within the first year., Before you start shopping for your car, you should go to the bank and get pre-approved for an auto loan. Banks generally offer much lower interest rates on auto loans than dealerships do.Take a copy of your two most recent paychecks, which the bank will want to review as proof of income. Ask about getting an auto loan. The bank will take your information and tell you what amount, if any, you are approved to borrow. At this point, you still need to go shop for a car, so you won’t enter the loan until you choose one and allow the bank to inspect it.


Credit unions also offer auto loans at competitive rates. You should start with whatever institution you already have accounts with, as these are the most likely to offer you a good interest rate.Remember that the amount you are approved for is the maximum you can borrow, so you shouldn’t automatically take the whole thing! Instead, ask the bank to give you payment quotes on different amounts and time periods, and think back to the budgeting you did before.
You may also ask about the cost of an unsecured loan from the bank. On a normal auto loan, the bank holds the title to the car, and you make payments to them until the balance is completely paid. Then the title is passed to you. An unsecured loan means that the bank loans you money without securing collateral. If you are only borrowing a few thousand dollars, the interest rate on the unsecured loan may not be much higher, and you will hold the car title outright.

, If you are borrowing money for a car from your bank, you need to plan to get comprehensive insurance to protect your car from damage while the bank owns the title. (If you take out an unsecured loan this won’t apply.) Make sure you count the cost of insurance in your calculation.


Most banks won’t finance the purchase of a car that has a salvaged title. Salvaged means the car has been totaled in the past, so that the damage to the car would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself. Insurance companies won’t insure salvaged vehicles with comprehensive insurance, which most banks require to secure an auto loan.
If you already have a car under an insurance policy, you can call your insurance company and ask what the cost of adding specific vehicles would be.

, Once you know what amount you are approved for, you can add whatever money you are able to pay as a down payment, and the total is how much you can spend on a car. You should consider spending less, just because the more you borrow from the bank, the more interest you will pay.


For example, say you are approved at the bank for an auto loan up to $10,000, and you have $5,000 in cash to put towards a car. You could combine the two and buy a car worth $15,000, or you could use less than the bank offered and buy a $12,000 car, with $5,000 of your own money and $7,000 in borrowed funds from the bank.

, Using the price range you’ve established, start shopping! You can shop for a car either at a dealership or from individual owners selling their own cars, and modern tools like Craigslist and Cars.com will allow you to search vehicles for sale in your area without leaving home. Make a list of three or four cars you’re interested in, and go look at each before making a decision.


Generally, you will pay more for a vehicle at a dealership than from a private party. Many dealerships will let you trade in your old car for credit against the new one, but they might be less likely to negotiate the price of the car.You may be better off selling the car separately, either privately or to CarMax.
If you go to a dealership, stick to your budget. Dealers usually are paid by commission, so they want you to buy the most expensive car on the lot. By knowing ahead of time how much you are willing to spend and what you’re interested in, you can avoid some of this nonsense and start by test driving the car you researched.

, Especially at dealerships, prices are always negotiable. Use the fact that you know your budget and have other options to your advantage and negotiate the price you pay for the car. Remember what amount of money you were approved for at the bank, and only accept an offer that is reasonable and within your budget.


You know the fair value of the car based on your research, so offer slightly less than that for the car. If the dealer rejects your offer, leave and go look at the next car on your list. The dealer will likely make you a counteroffer that you can come back to, but by walking off the lot you show that you’re serious about finding a bargain. Often as you are leaving the dealer will offer to sell at your suggested price.
If you’re getting rid of your old car, a dealership might also offer you the trade in value of your car. Generally this is less than what you can get by selling the car yourself, but some people prefer to trade in vehicles simply because of the convenience. If you do trade in your car, don’t tell the dealer about it until after you have negotiated a final price for the car, so that you get the most value for each individual vehicle.However, you also don't want to lie, so you can mention you may want to trade-in, but tell the dealer, ""We can talk about that later. Right now let's focus on the cost of the new car."", When a dealer or private party has accepted your offer, it’s time to go back to the bank. The bank will want to inspect the car, review the title, and look up the vehicle history. Once the inspection is complete the bank will complete your loan and take the title of the car.


You will either have to get insurance before the loan is closed, or right away afterwards. The bank will require you to list them as a part-owner in the automobile, so if you are in an accident that damages the car, they maintain collateral.

 For example, suppose you negotiate a deal to purchase a new car for $19,055.  You have a down payment and your old car to trade-in, and you qualify for a customer cash rebate.  You plan to finance the rest of the cost with an auto loan.
;
,  Also find out how much your state charges for tax and title fees.  Add this to the cost of the car. Some states don’t allow a deduction of sales tax on trade-ins; you must pay tax on the total cost.

 For the example, suppose your state charges 7 percent sales tax and an additional $200 for tags and title fees.  

 The sales tax would be $19,055∗.07=$1,335{\displaystyle \$19,055*.07=\$1,335}.

 The cost of the car would now be $20,590 ($19,055+$1,335+$200=$20,590){\displaystyle (\$19,055+\$1,335+\$200=\$20,590)}.


, It may be the case that you're trading in your old vehicle to help pay for the new one. Once you've settled on a trade-in value with the dealership, deduct that amount from the purchase price of the car.

 The dealer offers you $3,000 for your trade-in.  This brings the cost of the car down to $17,590 ($20,590−$3,000=$17,590){\displaystyle (\$20,590-\$3,000=\$17,590)}.


,  Dealer fees vary depending on your state and whether you are purchasing a new or used car.  Destination fees pay for the cost of delivering a new vehicle from the factory to the car dealership.  Documents fees (also known as “doc” fees or conveyance fees) include loan processing fees and service and handling fees.  Some states have caps on documents fees.The dealer charges you $500 in destination and vehicle preparation fees.  This brings the cost of the car to $18,090 ($17,590+$500=$18,090){\displaystyle (\$17,590+\$500=\$18,090)}.


,  You may qualify for these discounts when purchasing a new car.  Manufacturers and car dealers use them to steer customers away from the competition and ensure brand loyalty.  Research available incentives and rebates ahead of time to potentially save thousands of dollars on a new car.Typical rebates include customer cash for brand loyalty and dealer cash that may be passed along to the customer.

 Common incentives include low annual percentage rate (APR) financing for customers with excellent credit and special lease programs.

 You qualify for a brand loyalty rebate of $1,000.  The cost of the car is now $17,090 ($18,090−$1,000=$17,090){\displaystyle (\$18,090-\$1,000=\$17,090)}.


, The down payment is the amount of cash that you're putting down to pay for the car.This amount will vary from sale to sale and is based on what you can afford to pay out of pocket immediately. Deduct that amount from the amount to be financed.

 Your down payment is $2,000.  This brings the total cost of the car down to $15,090 ($17,090−$2,000=$15,090){\displaystyle (\$17,090-\$2,000=\$15,090)}.  

 The amount you need to finance, or borrow, is $15,090.


,  Auto loans are what is known as an amortizing loan.  The creditor lends you the principal amount, which is the cost of the car.  You pay the creditor back plus interest.  The principal and interest are paid down (or amortized) in equal payments over the life of the loan.The monthly payments remain the same, but the interest piece of the payment decreases and the principal piece increases over the course of the loan.


,  The term “amortization” means paying down the loan in equal installments.  The formula will tell you how much each payment will be.  The information you need is the amount of the loan, the interest rate per month and the total number of months that you will make a payment.Use the formula A=P∗(r(1+r)n)/((1+r)n−1){\displaystyle A=P*(r(1+r)^{n})/((1+r)^{n}-1)}.

 A = the monthly payment.

 P = the principal

 r = the interest rate per month, which equals the annual interest rate divided by 12

 n = the total number of months


,  Using the above example, you need to borrow $15,090 to purchase the car.  This is the principal.  You qualify for an auto loan that lasts 4 years, or 48 months and charges 7 percent annual interest.  You will repay the loan (including principal and interest) in 48 equal payments (once per month).

 Calculate the interest rate per month.  The annual interest rate is 7 percent. Divide this by 12 to get the monthly interest rate.  The monthly interest rate is 0.583 percent (7/12=.5833){\displaystyle (7/12=.5833)}


A=15,090∗(.00583(1+.00583)48)/(1+.00583)48−1{\displaystyle A=15,090*(.00583(1+.00583)^{48})/(1+.00583)^{48}-1}.


A=15,090∗(.0077/.3218){\displaystyle A=15,090*(.0077/.3218)}.


A=15,090∗.02393=361.07{\displaystyle A=15,090*.02393=361.07}  

 Your monthly payment will be $361.07


,  Fortunately, Microsoft Excel offers several handy functions that will perform complicated calculations for you.One of those functions, the PMT function, will calculate your monthly payments based on specifics about your loan., You'll not only need your loan information, but you'll also need to modify them slightly to get the correct value.

Multiply the length of the loan in years by 12. You want to calculate monthly payments, not annual payments, so you'll need the total number of months throughout the life of the loan. For example, if the loan is for four years, then the number of months is 4 * 12, or 48.

Since you want to pay off the loan completely, the future value of the loan will be 0. This means that you won't owe any more money at the end of the payment stream.


, Launch Excel and type these words on the first 4 rows in column A:

Rate

Number of Payments

Present Value

Future Value


, Plug the following numbers in column B next to the descriptions:

7.00%

48

15,090

0


, Input the formula “=PMT(B1/12,B2,B3,B4)” in a cell below the numbers.

Type “=PMT(“ and click on the cell with 7.00% so “B1” appears after the left parentheses. 

Type “/12,” (including the comma). Remember, you're dividing by 12 because you're calculating the interest rate on a monthly basis and the interest rate you were given is on an annual basis.

Click on the cell with 48 to see “B2” appear. 

Type a comma after “B2” and click on the cell with 15,090 to see “B3” appear.

Type a comma after “B3” and click on the cell with 0 to see “B4” appear.  

Type a right parenthesis at the end to complete the formula. 


, Press the “Enter” key and the formula will be replaced with the monthly payment of $361.35.
,  Change any of the variables, such as the finance amount or number of months, to see how the monthly payment changes.
, If you want to double-check Excel's math or you don't have access to Excel, you can get your loan payment by using one of the many loan payment calculators that are online."

This borrowed amount, known as the principal, will serve as the basis for your car loan.Keep in mind that you should put as much money down on your car as possible to minimize the amount borrowed and reduce your finance charges.


This step will require you to know roughly how much your new car will cost. See How to Buy a New Car for more information about finding a good price and working within your budget.;
, The APR reflects how much additional money you will have to pay beyond your principal for each year of your loan. A low APR will reduce the yearly and monthly amounts of finance charges on your loan. However, many low-APR loans are longer in duration, so the overall cost may remain relatively high. Alternately, a short-term loan with a higher APR may end up being cheaper overall. This is why it is important to calculate your finance charges beforehand.


Getting a low APR on your car loan may mean seeking other lenders beyond your car dealership. Be sure to do your research and select the cheapest available combination of APR and duration. See How to Get a Low APR on a Car Loan for more information.

, The majority of car loan payments are made on a monthly basis. When calculating your monthly payments, you will need to know both how many payments you will make each year and how many payments you will make in total. This information can be easily found in the terms of your car loan., There are many car loan payment calculators available for free online. Take advantage of these free services if you don't want to spend the time calculating your payments yourself. Search ""Car loan payment calculator"" and you will be provided with many options.If you still want to work it out by hand, continue to the next step.

, Start by converting your APR to a decimal by dividing it by 100. For example, if your APR is stated at 8.4%, 8.4/100 = 0.084. Next, find your monthly percentage rate by dividing your APR decimal by 12. So, 0.084/12 = 0.007. This is your monthly percentage rate expressed as a decimal.

, If, for example, your principal were $20,000 (if you borrowed $20,000 to buy your car), you would multiply this by 0.007 (from the previous step) and get 140.

, The formula is as follows: Monthly Payment = (Interest rate due on each payment x principal)/ (1 – (1 + Interest rate due on each payment)^ -(Number of payments))The top part of the equation (interest rate due on each payment x principal) is your number from the previous step. The rest can be calculated using a simple calculator.


The ""^"" indicates that the figure (-(Number of Payments)) is an exponent to the figure (1 + Interest rate due on each payment). On a calculator, this is entered by calculating 1 + interest rate due on each payment, hitting the button x^y, and then entering the number of payments. Keep in mind that the number of payments is made negative here (multiplied by negative one).
In our example, the calculation would go as follows (assuming a loan duration of 5 years or 60 months):

Monthly Payment = (0.007 x $20000)/(1-(1+ 0.007)^-60
Monthly payment = $140/(1-(1.007)^-60)
Monthly payment = $140/(1-0.658)
Monthly payment = $140/0.342
Monthly payment = $409.36 (this number may be off by a few cents due to rounding)



, This is done by simply dividing your principal amount by the duration of your loan in months. For our example, this would be $20,000/60 months = $333.33/month

, In our example, this would be $409.36 - $333.33. This equals roughly $76. So, with this loan agreement, you would be spending $76 per month in interest payments alone.

, To find your total finance charges over the life of your loan, start by calculating your monthly payment. How to do this is explained in the previous section.

, The formula is as follows: Monthly Payment Amount x Number of Payments – Amount Borrowed = Total Amount of Finance ChargesSo, in our example, this would be:

$409 x 60 - $20,000 = Total amount of finance charges
$24,540 - $20,000 = Total amount of finance charges
Total amount of finance charges = $4,540



, To be sure that you calculated your total correctly, divide that number by the total number of payments (60, in this case). $4,540/60 = 76. If the result matches your monthly finance charges you calculated earlier, then you have the correct number for total finance charges.

Complete the credit application.",How to Buy a Used Car With Bad Credit," There are steps you can take to improve your credit score as much as possible before you attempt to apply for bad credit financing:


Order your credit reports from each of the 3 credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax and Experian.
Verify that the information on your credit reports is correct. It is not unusual for credit reporting agencies to make mistakes that could wrongly lower your credit rating. Sometimes, improving your credit score is as simple as disputing inaccuracies on your credit report.
Pay small judgments and past-due accounts off. Even nominal amounts that are reported as negatives on your credit report can impact your bad credit for the worse. Paying them off could save you money in down payment and interest.
Wait 6 months after cleaning up your credit reports to buy used cars on credit. This will allow time for the credit updates and scoring improvements to take place.;
, Be prepared to have to accept a high interest rate and to have to put down a large down payment.

, List all of your expenses and compare them to your income. That way, you will know exactly what you can afford to pay per month and you can avoid getting yourself into a situation that could further worsen your credit.

, If you have bad credit, you can expect to have to make a relatively sizable down payment in comparison to scenarios involving good credit. Plan on putting down 10 percent of the car's value.

, It is best that you get pre-approved for an auto loan before you go shopping. Try these avenues:


Dealerships. Find an auto dealership that specializes in used cars and bad credit financing. These are often referred to as ""buy here pay here"" lots.
Credit unions. If you already have an account at a credit union, you may want to inquire there first. Credit unions are generally more lenient with their qualification requirements than other banks, especially in regards to their members. If you are not a credit union member, join a credit union and ask about auto financing for problematic credit.
Cosigners. You may be able to find a friend or family member who will cosign for you to help you obtain an auto loan.
Sub-prime lenders. These are lenders that specialize in lending to those with damaged credit. An Internet search will return numerous sub-prime lenders, and you can often fill out an application online and have an answer within minutes.

, Once you find a used car you are interested in buying, sit down with the salesperson or manager and negotiate the lowest purchase price you can.

, You will need to prove employment, income and residence, and provide whatever documentation the finance professional requires of you.

"
"
Get your own credit score and credit report.,
Know what to expect.,
If having a car is not an immediate necessity, consider taking a few months to save money and improve your credit score.,
Shop around at different dealerships-- and bring along your credit score and report.,
If you're having trouble getting approved through dealerships, or aren't satisfied with the rates they're offering, look for lenders who specialize in ""subprime"" loans.,
Consider a lease assumption.,
Look into used cars for sale by owner.",How to Buy or Lease a Car when You Have Bad Credit," Everyone is entitled to one free credit report per year from one of the top three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax or TransUnion). The credit history report will detail all past and current credit accounts, mortgages, loans, and/or leases-- including missed payments, late payments, bankruptcies, and repossessions. Your credit ""score""-- called the FICO score-- is a single number between 300 and 850 that summarizes your credit history, and can be obtained for a few additional dollars. A score between 680 and 700 is considered ""prime,"" while anything below about 640 is typically considered ""subprime."" Scores in the 500s or below are often refused altogether for loans and leases.


While they will request both, car dealerships and lending institutions will likely skip the detailed report and only look at your FICO score. Thus it's worth your while to look at both in order to determine why your score is what it is-- and what (if anything) you might be able to do about it. A low credit score can be the result of many different causes, some of which are more easily reparable than others. For instance, a few late payments on a credit card is not as severe a problem as a recent bankruptcy or foreclosure.
Each of the credit reporting agencies uses slightly different data to generate your score, and the scores they report vary accordingly. When your score is lower than ""prime,"" it may be worthwhile to get a report from all three major agencies. If the variance among the credit scores they report is substantial, there's a good chance that one (or more) of the agencies has erroneous data about your credit history. If you suspect this may be the case, call the credit bureau in question or look on their website for instructions on how to file a dispute regarding your credit information. Spotting any such potential errors might improve your credit score considerably.;
, When you try to finance or lease a car with a ""subprime"" credit score, you can expect to be asked to pay a higher down payment, higher interest rates, and/or a security deposit (for a lease). You may also have trouble getting insurance. Keep in mind, however, that even extremely low credit scores can sometimes get approved at certain dealerships and in certain situations. If you're unsure about just how ""bad"" your bad credit is, it might not hurt to simply call a few dealerships or insurance agencies and ask them about the likelihood that your credit score would be approved for a lease or loan (they might not give you much information over the phone or without a specific deal in consideration, but it may be worth a shot). Try to get a sense for what's feasible in your situation, so that you don't waste time at dealerships where you probably won't be approved.

, A good way to achieve both is to determine how much you can afford for a monthly car payment, and begin setting aside that amount each month. During this time, maintain regular payments on any credit accounts-- on time, and in full (draw from the money you've set aside, if it's necessary). Because your payment history accounts for the largest determinant of your FICO score (35%), paying your bills on time is crucially important during this period. Once you have saved up enough money for a down payment (from what you've set aside each month), your credit score should also be improved to yield better interest rates.


If you don't already have multiple credit accounts, consider opening a new credit card or store card account and use it to pay between $50 and $100 of your usual monthly expenses. Be sure to pay off the balance completely as soon as you receive a bill.

, Each request for a credit report and score (each ""credit inquiry"") has a minor negative impact on your FICO score (typically less than five points deducted)-- and if you're shopping around a lot and already have a ""subprime"" score, this can add up.The best way to prevent excessive credit inquiries from negatively impacting your credit score is to make them unnecessary by bringing your own score along. Show your score (preferably in a print-out of the report given by the credit bureau) to the finance director at a dealership, and don't let them do a credit check until you've struck a deal. They should be able to gauge whether or not you'll qualify for a loan or lease based on the score you show them. If you got more than one, and they don't vary substantially, bring them all in case the dealership insists on using their preferred credit agency. This way, you can shop around for the best deal, but without lowering your chances for approval and better rates in the process.

, Dealers and the finance companies they work with are not the only source for loans and leases. You may get better rates by arranging a pre-approved loan with a sub-prime lender. This can often be done through online lenders who specialize in financing cars for people with poor credit histories.

, A lease takeover is often an easy and affordable solution for those struggling to buy or lease a car with bad credit. It involves finding a ""seller""--someone who has entered into a lease contract for a car, and found that they can no longer afford payments or for whatever reason no longer want or need the car--and essentially taking over their lease (car, keys, payments and all). The lease company involved in the takeover will still have to check and approve your credit, but in this case the standards for approval are generally not as strict. ""Sellers"" often offer cash incentives, like no down payment. Online companies can help facilitate lease transfers by matching lease ""sellers"" with appropriate ""buyers"" in their area-- just search for ""car lease assumption,"" or ""car lease takeover."" , This can be a good temporary fix while you save up or improve your credit in order to buy or lease a new car, but it can also be an alternative avenue to a great and affordable car you'll want to keep for years. Most owners will insist upon cash only at the time of purchase, but under some circumstances (for instance, if the owner happens to be a family member or someone you know well) they may be willing to work out a payment plan. In either case, buying directly from an owner often means paying much less overall than you would at a dealership.


Search local listings, and get Kelley Blue Book values for any car you're interested in before you go and see it. Be sure to get values for different conditions the car may be in (excellent to fair). When you go to see or test drive the car, compare the price the owner sets to the KBB value for the condition the car appears to be in. Have the car checked by a mechanic before you buy. Some owners may agree to pay for this inspection, or to split the cost. Pay extra attention to any mechanical problems that will immediately or inevitably need repair, and any problems that won't pass inspection when you take the car in for registration. Many owners will consider offers below their asking price based on this inspection, the KBB value, or both. If they don't, keep looking until you find a fair deal.

Your principal amount has several components.The formula for the principal amount of your car loan is (Purchase price) – (rebates) – (cash down payment) – (trade in value). A car purchase will also include fees and sales tax. Those two amounts are typically included in the principal amount.

A rebate is a fixed amount of money paid to the buyer for the purchase of a particular vehicle. Rebates serve as an incentive to make the purchase. In most cases, the purchaser uses the rebate to reduce the principal amount of the loan.A cash down payment is paid by the purchaser. You may also trade in a vehicle- usually the car you are replacing. A trade in is something you sell as partial payment for something new. In this case, the value of the car you trade in reduces the purchase price on the new vehicle.Assume you’re buying a car for $20,000. The manufacturer provides a $2,000 rebate. You pay $3,000 as a down payment, and trade in a car valued at $5,000. The principal amount of your loan is $20,000 - $2,000 - $3,000 - $5,000, or $10,000.
;
, The loan term is the period of time that the loan will be outstanding. Most new car loans have a term of six years. The longer the term, the more interest you will pay on the principal balance.
, The interest rate will be stated in your loan agreement. For car loans, the interest rate is commonly referred to as the Annual Percentage Rate, or APR. Your interest rate multiplied by the outstanding principal amount is the interest you owe for a particular period of time.

Assume that your principal amount is $10,000. Your annual interest rate is 6%. You want to calculate the interest you owe for the month.

Your interest rate for one month, also known as your monthly interest rate, is (6%/12 = 0.5%).


, The formula for amortizing a loan is complex. The math required is difficult to perform manually.

When a loan is amortized, the borrower makes a fixed loan payment, usually monthly. That payment includes both repayment of principal and interest owed on the debt.

As time goes on, each fixed loan payment includes a larger portion of principal repayment, and a smaller portion of interest.

There are many amortization calculators on the Internet allow you to input a principal amount, loan term and interest rate. The calculator can provide the monthly payment, based on the criteria you input. Try searching online for ""car loan calculator"" to find one. 


, Assume that your loan’s principal amount is $10,000. The term of your loan is 6 years, and the interest rate on your loan is 6%. Input those amounts into the loan calculator.
, The schedule produces a monthly payment amount of $163.74. That schedule includes $50 of interest in the first monthly payment. The interest portion of each payment declines over time. For example, the interest portion in the 24th month’s payment is $35.93.
, The amortization schedule calculates total interest owed of $1932.48 over the life of the loan. If you want to reduce the total interest, you can choose another loan structure with a shorter term, maybe 3 years. You can also make larger monthly payments. The larger payments will reduce your principal faster- which will also reduce your interest paid on the loan.
, The vast majority of car loans use simple interest. In order to calculate the amount of simple interest you will pay, you’ll first have to calculate your monthly payment using this formula: M=P∗i(1+i)n(1+i)n−1{\displaystyle M=P*{\frac {i(1+i)^{n}}{(1+i)^{n}-1}}}""M"" represents your monthly payment. This is what the formula will be calculating.

""P"" represents your principal. As previously discussed, this is what you will pay for your car after rebates, trade-ins, and your down payment. 

""n"" represents the total number of monthly payments over the life of the loan. So, if you have a standard, 6-year loan, this would be 6 six years * 12 months per year, or 72. 


i"" represents your monthly interest rate. This is your stated interest rate, usually listed as your APR, divided by 12. So, if your stated interest rate is 6%, your monthly interest rate would be 6%/12, or 0.5%. 

For the purpose of calculation, this number will have to be represented as a decimal instead of as a percentage. To get this number, simply divide your monthly percent interest by 100. In the example, this would be 0.5%/100, or 0.005. 




, Even if you don't already have concrete terms for your loan, you can use estimates here and get a good idea of what various different loans would cost you.

For example, we can use the terms discussed previously. That is, a loan with $10,000 principal, 6% APR (interest), over 6 years. 

Our inputs would then be 10,000 for ""P,"" 0.005 (the monthly interest rate, expressed as a decimal) for ""i,"" and 72 (6 years x 12 months per year) for ""n."" 

Our example equation would now look as follows: M=10,000∗0.005(1+0.005)72(1+0.005)72−1{\displaystyle M=10,000*{\frac {0.005(1+0.005)^{72}}{(1+0.005)^{72}-1}}}


, From here, you'll simply to have solve your completed equation in the proper order.

Start by solving the parts within the parentheses. In this case, this just means adding the 1 to the 0.005 in both places. Your simplified equation should now look like this: M=10,000∗0.005(1.005)72(1.005)72−1{\displaystyle M=10,000*{\frac {0.005(1.005)^{72}}{(1.005)^{72}-1}}}


, Next, you'll have to raise the parts in the parentheses to the power of ""n"" (72 in this case). This is done on a calculator by typing in the value within parentheses (1.005 in this case) first and then pressing the exponents button, usually denoted as ""x^y"". You can also type this calculation into Google and it will solve it for you.

In our example, we raise 1.005^72 and get 1.432. Our equation now looks as follows: M=10,000∗0.005(1.432)(1.432)−1{\displaystyle M=10,000*{\frac {0.005(1.432)}{(1.432)-1}}}


, This time, you'll need to simplify the top and bottom parts of the fraction, also called the numerator and denominator, respectively. To simplify, multiply the parts on top and subtract on the bottom.

After these calculations, our example equation will look as follows: M=10,000∗0.00716)0.432{\displaystyle M=10,000*{\frac {0.00716)}{0.432}}}


, Divide the numerator by the denominator. The result is the number that will be multiplied by your principal to determine your monthly payments.

After this calculation, our sample equation will simply be M=10,000∗0.0166{\displaystyle M=10,000*0.0166}


, Multiply the final two terms in your equation to find your monthly payment. In this case, the monthly payment is $10,000*0.0166, or $166/month.

Keep in mind that this number will vary slightly due to rounding during the calculation process. 


, This is done by subtracting your principal from the total value of your payments. To get your total value of payments, multiply your number of payments, ""n,"" by the value of your monthly payment, ""m."" Then, subtract your principal, ""P,"" from this number. The result is your total interest paid on your car loan.

In our example, this would be calculated as 72(""n"") * $166(""M"")=$11,952 - $10,000 ('P"")= $1,952. So, total interest paid on this loan would be $1,952, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of the value of the loan.

Call your motorcycle shop and ask them if there is a race track with a motorcycle “Track Day"".,
Get protective gear (don't skimp here):

Gloves should be race type gloves, very thick at the knuckles, possibly rivets on the palms.,
Go over your motorcycle thoroughly.,
Transport your bike to the track.,
Hydrate.,
Listen carefully to the instructor.

",How to Race Your Street Motorcycle," Don’t be scared. They usually have lots of support for new riders. They will escort you around the track several times so that you can get comfortable out there. The track is way safer than doing this on the street. No little ol ladies, no sand in the corners, no stoplights and everyone going the same way. Pay your track fees early to take advantage of possible discounts. (Expect track fees of roughly $100.00 a day on average);
,
Leather or cordura race pants and jacket that zip together or a one-piece race suit with built in protection at the knees, calves, elbows, forearms etc. (preferably vented to let cool air in.)

hard back/spine protector.
Motorcycle racing boots
Full face helmet.

,

Tires and brake pads must be near new.
Tire must be race or near-race quality. They’ll have stickier composition. Proper tire pressure is of utmost importance. Your normal street pressure is probably not right for the track. Check with the tire rep, your local shop or the people running the track day.
Remove the mirrors.
Disconnect the headlight and brake light.
Use blue painter's tape entirely over the headlight, turn signals, and taillight.
Check the oil, chain, forks, anything else with possible maintenance.
Setting your suspension up is important in track riding. If you don’t know how to set your forks and swing arm to racing settings according to your body weight, set them to firm.
Find out if you need to replace your engine coolant with water. Coolant is slippery if it leaks, so some tracks forbid it. Straight water works fine if the bike is moving on the track. (Even if your race track does not require you to replace your antifreeze you should change it to water+Redline Water wetter anyway, you don't want to be the cause of another rider crashing because your bike has a small leak. Water evaporates, ethylene glycol does not.)

, Many people go the night before and sleep at the track. The track may have a bunkhouse for the racers. Get your gear on, go to the riders meeting and ask about the new rider’s slots and training. ( Everybody does this first once) Don’t worry! This is just like the street except safer. It is very unlikely that you will wreck if you follow the rules.

, Eat protein for breakfast. This is a physically demanding task and being in good shape will help. For every 7 pounds you lose, you gain one horsepower.

If you are new at this, it's best to go on a day or night when the track is hosting a ""street-legal drags"" type of event, where all street-legal cars are welcome regardless of engine size, tire type, etc.,
Ask your local dragstrip if they hold events to race your street-legal car just for fun.,
Get your car ready to race.,
Once at the track, pay, park and signup.,
If you've never raced before, examine the layout you obtained and see where the staging lanes are.,
Near the end of the staging lanes, watch other cars from your lane and see where they pull up to.,
Now, pull up to the starting line and watch the ""Christmas Tree"" (display of lights at the beginning of the track, between the two lanes.),
Depending on the tree, either all three amber bulbs will light at once followed 0.4 seconds later by the green (this is called a Pro-Tree), or the three amber bulbs will flash consecutively 0.5 seconds apart followed by the green coming on 0.5 seconds after the last amber (this is called a Sportsman or Full tree.),
If the track is giving out time slips, there will be a shack on the return road where you can stop and your time will be given to you on a slip of paper.,
You can go around to the staging lanes and race again, or park for a while and get some food/drink or watch others race.

",How to Race Your Car at the Dragstrip,";
, Ask about the admission price, any additional charges (tech card, parking, etc.) and also if they give out time-slips after races. They often do, but, during some events your time will be displayed on the board only, with no time-slip. In this case, have a friend stand near the track to record your time and speed after each run if you really want to know it. If you've never been to a dragstrip before, ask if they have a website providing a layout of their facility to familiarize yourself with the individual areas of the track. If not, ask for a map once you arrive.

, Inspect, change, or top off all oils and fluids. Check your brakes, steering, and suspension for wear and repair if needed. If you have a nitrous system, have your bottle filled. Though, most tracks sell nitrous and fuel, but expect to pay more. Put the tires you will race with on your car (or bring your race-only tires separately) with the proper air pressure. Don't top-off your fuel tank, as it makes your car heavier than necessary. Ideally, you want to race a streetcar with a 1/4 tank or less, depending on the vehicle and tank size. Do not run out of fuel completely. Once you feel your vehicle is ready to begin racing, drive to the track.

, Usually, they'll provide paperwork to sign and an armband or something to indicate that you're authorized to race. Go back to your car and move to the staging lanes if racing has begun.

, These are located at the beginning of the dragstrip, and clearly marked with painted lane stripes and numbers. Ask a track attendant for help if you can't find them. Follow all directions from track attendants carefully to avoid a collision, and remember top speed is 10 mph (16 km/h) in this area at most tracks. A track attendant will come alongside your car to ensure you've registered, and you may or may not get a number on your car window. Now, mentally prepare to go racing, and make sure your car is set up to do so also. You may wait a while in the lanes, so while it's OK to get out and chat with other racers, stay near your vehicle so you can move it forward at any time. Ask other racers questions, as with few exceptions, they'll be willing to provide advice.

, Some will drive through the ""water box"" (wet area for doing burnouts), others will drive around it. If you have street tires, it's best to drive around it and proceed onto the dragstrip. With slicks, drive into it and wait for the signal to do your burnout. In either case, don't do anything until a crewman signals you that it's OK to proceed. Generally, one person will signal you to pull out of the staging lane onto the track, where another will wave you forward. Slowly drive around or into the water box, and continue to follow hand signals. If doing a burnout, wait for a crew member's signal.

, Each lane has it's own set of lights in order from top to bottom: 2 small bulbs at the very top of the tree (Pre-Stage), 2 identical small ones under that (Stage), 3 large amber bulbs, a green bulb, and a red bulb. Roll you car forward slowly until the first set of bulbs are lit (Pre-stage), this indicates your front tire are approximately seven inches from the starting line. Continue to creep forward until the second set of small bulbs are lit (Staged), then stop.

, When you see the green light, GO! Keep racing until you reach the finish line, at which point you should begin to slow down and decide which turn-off you are going to take. If you have smoked your competitor, make sure you have his/her vehicle in sight before you turn off...you don't want to hit him while turning because he was in your blind spot!

, If it doesn't make any sense to you, ask another racer to explain it, but basically it shows your reaction time (R/T), time until your car reached the 1⁄8 mile (0.2 km) mark, your speed at that point, time until you car reached the 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) mark, and again your speed at that point.

Depress the clutch once the car is ready at the starting line.,
Shift transmission to first gear.

,
Maintain engine revolutions per minute (rpm) to about 50% of the maximum engine range (for example, if red line is at 6500 rpm, maintain at ~3200 rpm).

,
Wait for the signal lights to turn green.

,
Once green, move clutch to fully engage, modulating throttle input (gas pedal position) to balance rear wheel spin.

At the end of the strip, SLOWLY apply the brakes and follow directions away from the track.

Understand the sponsorship process first.,
Figure out what you can offer to a potential sponsor.,
Decide where you will look for racing sponsors.,
Start making phone calls.,
Prepare a sponsorship proposal.,
Get a contract for the sponsorship.,
Read through the terms of your sponsorship agreement with your lawyer.",How to Get Racing Sponsors," The best way to learn about racing sponsorship is to read as much as you can about the subject. Once you understand how the sponsorship process works, you can set out to getting racing sponsors on your own.;
, Things such as logos on uniforms and equipment are the most common and basic things of value offered in sponsorship packages but sponsors are more demanding than ever. The more sponsorship offerings you have, the better your chances of landing a sponsorship deal.


A sponsorship inventory checklist is a great tool for figuring out everything you can offer to a potential sponsor.

,


Local: Will you be racing locally? If so, you should approach businesses where you live and where you race.
National: Will you be racing nationally? If so, you'll have a much larger pool of businesses to approach but you'll also have a lot more competition from other racers approaching those same businesses. In this scenario, learning how to research and evaluate potential sponsors first will be a huge advantage so make sure to read some books on this topic.

, Once you have decided who you will approach for sponsorship, you'll have to contact the sponsors. When trying to get racing sponsors, phone calls are much better than emails. Emails are very easy to ignore but phone calls are not. Looking for racing sponsorship is a time-consuming process but the more people you reach out to, the better your chances of starting a conversation that might lead to a sponsorship deal.

, Once you have established a conversation with a business that might want to sponsor you, you'll need to provide them with a sponsorship proposal. A sponsorship proposal is basically a sales brochure for your sponsorship program. It outlines the benefits of becoming your sponsor and it includes all the costs of doing so. It can have many pages of information or it could be very short but whatever the length of your proposal, it just needs to answer the questions that will make your potential sponsor say yes!

, When a business decides to sponsor you, you'll need a legally-binding contract that stipulates all the terms and conditions of working together. This is called a sponsorship agreement and you should hire a professional lawyer to handle this aspect of the sponsorship process for you. One of the most rewarding experiences you'll ever have as a racer is signing a sponsorship agreement.

, If you're happy with the terms, go ahead and sign. If not, ask the lawyer to renegotiate the terms, but be realistic; also realize that if you're too pushy, you can lose the deal. When you do go ahead and sign it, congratulations, you now have a racing sponsor!

Consider certain factors when driving a race car:


Weight of the vehicle (including yourself) and the weight ratio
The car's grip
The car's stopping power
The power and torque of the engine
The steering of the car
The car's suspension;
,
Perhaps one of the most important factors is grip.,
But knowing the grip of the car will be very handy as it will tell you how fast you can go when making a turn with a certain radius.,
Another important thing to remember about corners is the car's suspension.,
Also, knowing how the car's suspension handles will get you acclimated to the car better.,
Another thing that is good to know is how fast the car responds to turning the wheel.,
The next thing to keep in mind is stopping power.,
The last thing to keep in mind is the power and torque of the engine.",How to Drive Race Cars,", The cars grip is a measure of how much force it takes to cause the cars tires to slip on a certain terrain, usually asphalt. The grip is very important, as taking a turn too fast will cause the car to lose grip, resulting in a severe loss of control. One thing that you NEVER want to do in a race car is lose control. Drifting does not count as losing control, and in fact requires more control.

, And knowing that will allow you to get through corners faster, which is the place where a lot of people fail.

, If the car's suspension is tight, it won't sway as much which helps because it makes the car more predictable. However if the car's suspension is loose it keeps its tires on the ground better (watch a video of racing, and during sharp corners you can actually see the inside front tire lift off the ground) and having a tire lift off the road surface will decrease grip.

, Many people tend to freak out a little bit when they feel the car swaying due to the lateral forces being exerted on it. That sway is normal. It is caused by the center of gravity shifting slightly, and is not a good indicator of when a car will slide since the car will often sway the same amount whether it is going way to slow to slide or whether it is careening off the track sideways.

, Knowing how sharp to turn is very important, but in order to do that you have to know how much to turn the wheel. Turning the wheel too little will cause the car to understeer and will throw it off the track, while turning too much will cause the car to oversteer, and will either cause the car to slide or will cause the car to hit the inside of the corner.

, If you plan on doing serious racing, then you will often have to slam on the brakes to slow down for corners. Doing that, rather than coasting down to speed, lets you maintain a faster speed longer, though waiting too long to brake will either result in braking too hard (which results in sliding) or having to brake while turning (which adds another sway factor that must be considered, which decreases grip and often leads to sliding).

, Knowing this will give you a better idea of how to drive the car, although most cars you can just slam down on the accelerator and go. Some cars, such as Indy cars, have a very high power to weight ratio, which means that always just slamming down on the accelerator will often cause a burnout, which leads to sliding. Being able to accelerate as fast as possible is good, and in most cars this value is determined solely from the engines power, but in others is determined also by the grip of the car.

Beginner courses generally cost $125 and last six hours.
MSF offers the most widely available dirt bike classes. If there isn't one in your area, use a reputable search engine to find a course through another organization. You can find a course through a local motorcycle dealer too.
Take beginner courses as many times as you want. You should feel comfortable and confident on a dirt bike before moving forward. Once you feel comfortable, try a more advanced class.;
, Use this directory and talk to your instructor and fellow students about local tracks and trails to practice on. Some tracks have bikes you can rent, but for others you have to bring your own. Part 2 has information on how to buy a bike.


Practice basic riding skills like using the front and back breaks, using the clutch, and navigating bumpy terrain. Work on riding in different conditions like rain and mud, and learn how to navigate whoops, dips, and jumps. Move up to more advanced skills like wheelies and power slides. Remember, practice makes perfect!

, Make friends in your classes and at the tracks. The motocross community is a welcoming bunch, especially for beginners. Organize outings and ride together. Doing motocross with friends will be a much more enriching and fun experience.


There are plenty of motocross clubs out there. Go to a reputable search engine and search for 'motocross clubs near me'. If there is one, reach out to them about joining! They'll show you the ropes and give you people to ride with.
Try to find people around your skill level to practice with. Have some playful competition with them!

, Make a day of it and enjoy the spectacle that is motocross. Take note of the riders' gear and technique. Learn the names and sponsors of the best racers. Above all else, have fun!

, Your dirt bike will feel ""wiggly"" at first. The little grooves in the loose dirt will drag your front wheel back and forth. That's natural. As you get to higher speeds, your front wheel will straighten out. Don't tense up. Get a feel for going straight.


Start in a low gear and work your way up.
At faster speeds, make sure your back is at a 45 degree angle and your arms are at a 90 degree angle. Standing up will act as additional suspension, which will give you more control.

, Body position is key for this. When you accelerate, your body will naturally get pushed back. Remember to stay forward. Keep your butt in the natural indentation where the seat meets the gas tank. Your hips should be directly over the foot pegs.


Don't fight the backward push by pulling on the handlebars. Instead, lean forward and press down on the foot pegs.

, The more force you press on the handlebars the less control you have. Use your legs to stay in the proper position.

, Stick your inside leg out and keep your outside elbow up. If you have to put your foot down to avoid crashing, do it. Keep pressure on the outside foot peg and keep your butt on the outside of the seat. This will give you more traction.


Remember to brake and shift before you enter a turn. You want to concentrate fully on the corner and your line, not braking.
If your bike doesn't shift automatically, work on shifting quickly and in one motion. You should use the throttle, clutch, and shifter together, not separately.

, Again, your legs add extra suspension and control. Whoops are the most common place to crash, so take them cautiously. Go slow and steady to start. Keep your weight towards the back of the bike, and remember that your bike will get wobbly. The key is to ride through it.

, Whether or not you already have a bike, your next step should be to find a quality dealer. Go to a reputable search engine and search for ""motocross dealer near me."" Comb through the results and find a motorcycle dealership that specializes in motocross and has a good reputation.


Don't let them pressure you into buying anything. You're just talking about motocross. The dealer is there for you as a resource first and a salesperson second.
Build and maintain a relationship with your dealer.
If you don't like the first dealer or their shop, move on and find another. Not every dealer is right for you. They should be friendly, willing to help, and have a top-notch shop.

, This is your most important decision. Do some research on the different kinds of bikes. Talk to your dealer and a find a bike that fits your personal needs. These are the questions to consider when buying a bike:


How experienced are you? If you're just starting, you should probably go for a smaller, four-stroke bike.
How tall are you? Find a bike that suits your size. Especially if you're a beginner, you need a bike that's short enough to allow you to put both feet on the ground.
How old are you? If you're a teenager, you'll want a 125cc-250cc bike. Adults should get 250cc-500cc bikes. Note that cc stands for cubic centimeters. The more cubic centimeters, the more power the bike has.
How much time are you willing to put into maintenance? Different bikes require different amounts of care. Generally speaking, four-stroke bikes require more maintenance than two-stroke bikes.
How much money are you willing to spend? Motocross is expensive. Bikes generally cost thousands of dollars. Used bikes cost significantly less. Find a bike that fits your budget. Remember that you have more expenses coming with other equipment and memberships.

, As the saying goes: dress for the crash, not the ride. In motocross, you will crash. Be prepared and get the right safety gear. This is the safety equipment you'll need:


Helmet. This is the most important piece of gear. Your helmet should be snug, but not uncomfortable. A full-face helmet is the safest type. Don't skimp on your helmet.
Goggles. Always wear goggles. Your primary concern here is comfort.
Body armor. You'll need chest and back protectors to prevent impact injuries to your body.
Clothing. Long sleeve shirts are a requirement. Wear something thinner to stay cool. Jeans are fine to start with, but you should get racing pants eventually.
Boots. You have to wear boots that cover the ankle. Make sure they're comfortable and broken in.
Gloves. Always wear a sturdy pair of motorcycle gloves.
Elbow and knee pads. These are optional but highly recommended, especially for beginners.

, You'll need a way to move your bike from your home to wherever you ride. Your method of transportation depends on how many bikes you need to transport and what kind of transportation you already own.


If you have a pickup truck, you're set. Strap your bike or bikes down in your truck bed with tie-downs.
If you have a trailer, hitch it to your car and put your bike in the trailer.
If you don't have a truck or a trailer, and you don't want to buy one, the cheapest and safest option is to buy a dirt bike carrier. You can order one online or buy one from your dealer. This only works to transport one bike, however.

, Look on their website, ask around, and check the local bulletin board. Most events will have classes suited to every skill level.


Most events will require you to have a membership. The American Motorcycle Association hosts the majority of motocross events, and it's a good idea to stick with AMA-sanctioned events. AMA membership will cost at least $50.
Most races have an additional fee to enter.

, Register for the class that suits your skill level. Some events require online preregistration while others have you register on race day.


Along with registration, you will need to buy a pit pass to get in. This is usually an armband. You must have this on you at all times on race day, so don't lose it!

, You will need plenty of time for registration, getting dressed, and doing maintenance on your bike. Most events have a rider's meeting, practice time, stagger starts for the smaller classes, qualifiers for the main events, and then the main event. Keep track of where they are in the event!


Walk the track before you practice. Think about what line would be best. Then, use your practice time to test out different lines.
Refuel after your practice time. Keeping your tank at a third full will save up to ten pounds of extra weight.
Stay hydrated throughout the day.
Find people in your class and try to stay with or near them so you don't miss any deadlines.

, Bring your bike, all your safety gear, jerseys, a basic tool set, water, rain gear, lawn chairs, and snacks. You won't regret bringing too much. Races can make for long days.


Your tool set should include tire irons, a patch kit, tire pump, tire gauge, chain lube, a plug wrench, extra spark plugs, extra air filters, duct tape, and WD 40.
Bring plenty of extra gas, too.

, Stay positive and don't worry if you get nervous. Even seasoned motocross veterans get nervous on race day. It's rare to win in your first race. Be competitive, but remember at the end of the day, you wanted to get into motocross to have fun!

Cost, your commitment to rebuilding an repairing the vehicle, and your ultimate ambitions for the car should be taken into account. Most drag racers want basically the same thing: a throaty beast of a dragster with a great paint job, equally great looking when parked in the lot, as it looks when its blowing past you in the passing lane.


Ideally, you want a light that's amenable to lots of modifications. A good dragster often has an engine modified with aftermarket cams, heads, and other components, to maximize the horsepower so it runs in excess of 600 or 700 HP. If you've got that, you'll have a muscle-monster. But for many drivers, anything beyond 500 HP is excessive. That's still an insanely fast car.
Many aspiring dragsters probably have a frame or a model in mind when they're getting started, because of the look. A '57 Chevy Bel Air is a perfectly-great drag strip candidate for some classic-car enthusiasts, but for others that heavy frame might outweigh the style points.;
, Hot-rodding for the drag strip is, above all else, a great nostalgia project. Get a hold of the Corvette model your dad always lusted after when you were a kid, painted sea-foam green, a car he never got to drive. Or maybe you want a Mustang just like the one Steve McQueen drove for the classic chase scenes in Bullitt. Maybe you want to go all-out and get an old Chevy Apache frame from the '40s and make a funny car to crack up the boys down at the track. There's no wrong choice, if you like the car.

, Most cars that are successful on the strip are light in body and easy to work on. For this reason, you'll typically see a lot of Fox-body Mustangs built between the late 70s and early 90s, which are super-light and can take almost any engine you want to throw in it. Hemi? Flathead V-8? You can make it work in a Mustang body.Because Mustangs are almost ubiquitous at American tracks, they lose a little cache. They're great to work with, but do you really want to be another guy with the same looking car? Trans-Ams, Z28s, and Chargers all have similar characteristics, with great factory-built specs. The Charger McQueen drove was basically straight from the factory, with some suspension work done. If it was good enough for Bullitt…

, How fast do you want your car to go? What kind of engine do you want to build? What kind of engine can the body of your vehicle take? Much of the work and much of the fun that goes into planning a hot rod project will come with making these decisions for yourself.


A good drag engine should maximize horsepower, probably using some aftermarket modifications to maximize the efficiency of the engine. Hydraulic roller cams and aftermarket cylinder heads are a common modification.Depending on the engine, you should be able to use at least some of the factory components in the drivetrain to keep the project as affordable as possible.
Try to set a limit for yourself. Sure, you can say you want to have a 1,000 HP dragon-breather going in that Trans-Am, but the cost of the all the aftermarket drive train components necessary? The stress upgrades necessary for the chassis? If you can get 500 HP at street-level, you won't have to worry about getting embarrassed at the track. Ever. Try to keep your ambitions practical, Mr. Andretti.

, As you increase the power in your engine, the stock suspension will quickly become unsuitable. One of the most important modifications that you'll need to make in a serious drag racer is in the suspension. Make sure you upgrade the suspension after increasing the power, to make sure you match the stress specs to the new power of the vehicle.


If your dragster has rear leaf springs, consider upgrading to CalTrac bars to increase the stability and the control. If your rod comes with coil-spring suspension, using aftermarket control arms is the best approach. You can also check out the possibility of using ""no-hop"" to modify the geometrical center of the suspension, giving your more muscle in your starts.
Some racers will unhook the front sway bar and install drag-style coil springs. Drag racing stresses the axles, making problems common, so it's a good idea to get shocks made for the purposes of standing up to the stress.

, After the Fast and Furious movies, everybody and his brother wants to hit a nitrous button and blow the competition off their rear bumper. Using a small nitrous system for your races will allow you to use a more basic torque converted for driving on the street and the highway at normal speeds. It can also help keep your engine leaner, making it easier to run at a low compression ratio. Naturally-aspirated engines will require a bigger cam and will need to process higher-octane fuel if the compression ratio rises.

, The more you modify the factory parts, the more problems you'll encounter from those modifications, especially if you're running your dragster rough and stressing the accelerator. Hot rods commonly have problems with overheating, making some precautions necessary. You might not have any problems if you've done your mods correctly, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for potential problem areas.



Install a bigger radiator to keep the vehicle from overheating and check your fuel pump regularly. Running your drag car aggressively will wear out these components very quickly. Make sure you have a sensitive an accurate heat gauge and monitor it closely when you're driving.

, Most pro drag race vehicles are specially designed roadsters made to race at short distances, but hobbyists and weekend warriors have their own categories, as well. Vehicles are rated and classed based on a variety of information, including the advertised factory weight of the vehicle, the type of fuel used, and the horsepower of the engine. The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) boasts over 200 separate categories of vehicles, though the basic categories can be divided in two:



Top Fuel Dragsters have an almost-comical length of 20–30 feet (6.1–9.1 m), and upward of 10,000 HP, which run on nitromethane. These are the dragsters you'll likely find at pro races as a spectator. Top Alcohol Dragsters are similar to their Top Fuel cousins, though they run partially on methane.

Stock Dragsters started as factory vehicles and have been modified according to NHRA guidelines to improve HP and efficiency. On open-track days, this is typically the only kind of vehicle you'll find coming to the track, and probably what you're running if you're interested in drag racing. If you've got a modified muscle car, you can look up your vehicle on the NHRA Classification Guide.

, If you want to drag race, you've got to do it on a racetrack under the proper conditions. Drag strips are usually a quarter-mile long, after which is a ""speed trap"" of about 70 feet (21.3 m), where your top speed will be measured.Many tracks will have open invitationals that anyone can show up for, as long as you pay the registration and track fees. Likewise, time trials are often available on a regular basis, if you want to get out and open the throttle a couple times.


When you arrive, you'll likely have to pay a small entrance fee, as well as a track fee if you plan to race. If you're going to race, the cost will depend on the class of vehicle you're racing, so it's a good idea to call first and find out about any costs before you show up.Go watch some races first and try to get a sense of the culture and the kinds of races that happen at the track you're thinking of racing. Talk to other racers and track officials to ask for advice. If you drive a Honda Civic and want to drag race, you might be able to enter into a Bracket-Style race with handicaps, but you might also feel a little out of place. Before you drive all the way to the track, take the time to check out a few races as a spectator first. Besides being a fun sport, it's a great community that you can be a part of from the bleachers, as well.
Only drag race at approved sites. Drag racing in perfect professional conditions is dangerous enough, and drag racing in the street is downright suicidal. It's also illegal everywhere. Never drag race on the street.


, To keep the playing field level, most tracks and racing organizations divide the field into a large number of different vehicle classes. After paying at the gate, you'll need to fill out a race card, filling out information about the class you'll be racing in, your name, and other specific information about your vehicle.


If you just have a factory-standard vehicle that you want to race, or have made minimal modifications to it, the class will still vary based on the size of the engine and other specifications.Many tracks will have open invitationals on a regular basis, at which you can register your car and find out what class and category your vehicle qualifies for, or what you need to do to get your vehicle to spec and race it, if you want. This is the easiest way to find out more about your class, if you're not sure.

, Depending on what kind of vehicle you have, your ambitions for racing, and the particular rules of the track in your area, you'll likely have lots of different options available to you for races. You might want to enter a pro-style elimination race, which is probably the most common, or you might just want to get on the track and burn some rubber in time trials. As long as you've got a good vehicle with some muscle behind it, you'll be able to find something that's right for you at most tracks.



Elimination Races are basic bracketed elimination rounds, in which two cars in the same class will go head-to-head. The loser will be eliminated, and the winner will move on to the next round, until one car remains. To seed the field, practice runs and time trials usually precede the race.

Bracket Races are similar to Elimination Races, but with the inclusion of handicaps to allow for vehicles of different specs to compete against one another, making these races a test of skill, rather than muscle. Instead of straight-up time trials, cars complete ""Dial In"" runs, in which the goal is to come as close as possible to the estimated speed (how fast your car can possibly make a single run). The difference will be subtracted from each of your trials throughout the race.

Time Trials are available for any class of vehicle that passes safety inspection and pays the track fee. Usually, if you're not planning on running trials to qualify, you'll only be allowed to make runs on particular days, sometimes called ""test and tune"" nights. You can collect a time sheet with specific details about each of your runs, and keep track of your long-term progress. This is an excellent way to start and build your drag-racing skills.

, After paying at the gate and registering, you'll next drive your car to the inspection area, where track officials will give your car a once-over, checking fluid levels, weight, and other specifications to make sure that your vehicle is safe to run on the track. If you pass the inspection, they'll usually slap a corresponding inspection sticker on your windshield, signifying that you've passed and that you can proceed to the staging area.


Most tracks require a minimum running weight to be met by every vehicle, with the driver in the car. Many serious racers will find the minimum weight for their vehicle class and get it down as low as possible to increase the horsepower and the efficiency of the engine., Before you pull up to the starting line and jam on the gas, you'll have to find out where you'll race in the field by qualifying for your starting position. Depending on the track rules and the vehicle class, you'll be held to different standards, but you'll start most elimination rounds by qualifying for your starting place with the best possible run you're capable of. Several measurements are taken for each race, including your reaction time, the total elapsed time of the run, and your speed.


Your reaction time will be measured right at the start of the race, and should be as short as possible, tracking the time between the green light and your vehicle leaving the starting line.
Your elapsed time will be measured from the moment you've left the starting line to the moment you cross the finish line.
Your top speed will be measured just as you pass the finish line, making it important that you power across it for the best result. There should be ample room to slow down.

, In the staging area behind the track, you should pass through what is called the water box or the bleach box at most tracks, which is basically just a patch of the track that has been hosed down. This is where racers with track tires will do a burnout to heat up the tires and ""burn off"" any sediment or other gunk that's been built up.


If you don't want to burn out before racing, that's fine. Just drive around the water box and approach the starting line instead. Flat racing tires always need to be warmed up, but street tires with tread should generally not be. If you're worried about street build-up on street tires, you can do a peel out to clean them up, if you want.

, On professional tracks, the starting line is somewhat complicated, because it's not usually marked on the ground and is monitored with lasers. Let the track officials guide you toward the general area, and then look to the ""Christmas tree"" (the stalk of colored lights in the center of the track) to find out when you're on the money.


At most tracks, a yellow light will engage when you're close (within 7 inches) of the starting line, and a second light will engage when you're on it. Watch the track official between the two lanes for more specific instructions. They're there to help.

, Most trees usually about about seven lights, including the indicator lights when you're on the starting line. Depending on your class and the kind of race you're running, the tree will light differently to signal that start of the race.In some races, three large amber lights will flash simultaneously, followed by the green light in four-tenths of a second. In other races, the three bulbs will flash twice, followed five-tenths of a second later by the green light. Make sure you watch other racers start and find out what kind of light start will be used before you end up on the starting line.

, In general, if you see the green light, you probably started too late. It takes some practice and skill to get a good start down, because it's very much about anticipating the green and leaving with it, rather than waiting until you see it. Experienced drivers are often very good at this, so don't get frustrated if it takes you several time trials and runs before you get the hang of it.


Before you start, maintain your RPMs at the optimum speed to jump into your desired gear (lots of dragsters will pop in second, for example). Keep track of the timing changes in the lights, anticipate the green, and hit the gas.

, Drag racing isn't the time for taking it easy, it's the time for seeing what your machine is made of. If you've passed the safety inspection and know your vehicle inside and out, you should know what it's capable of and use this opportunity to open up the throttle and go all-out. Floor it, shifting up as you power through the track, and accelerating into the finish.While you're tearing down the strip, be very careful to stay in your lane. Don't look at the other car, if you're going head-to-head, pay attention to your own car and what you're doing. Crossing the center line, apart from being extremely dangerous, will usually earn you a disqualification.

, Often, at tracks, there's a particular ""track rules"" etiquette regarding which lane has the right of way in head-to-head runs. Often, the common courtesy, however, is that the slower car will slow down more quickly, falling in line behind the faster car. You'll both pull off in line, then, and drive to the timing booth.

, After running the race, you'll pass by the timing booth, where you'll receive a slip with your reaction time, your total elapsed time, and your top speed. At some tracks, this may also show large on a scoreboard-style screen, but often these are back closer to the starting line for spectators to see.

, When you get wrapped up in all the grease and machismo floating around at the strip, it can be common to forget about the most essential part of drag racing: surviving it. Make sure that you're aware of everyone on the track, around it, and stay focused on completing the run with safety. If you feel unsure about racing, unconfident in your vehicle, or uncomfortable with the track conditions, pack it up for the day.


You need to always have your vehicle inspected before drag racing. Blowing out a tire going 120 mph (190 km/h) is extraordinarily dangerous, and turning out of a skid at those speeds can be deadly. Use extreme caution.

, The Snell Memorial Foundation was founded by William ""Pete"" Snell, an amateur auto racer who died in a racing event in 1956. His then supposedly state-of-the-art helmet failed to protect from passing away, and a number of his fellow racers, colleagues and friends came together in an effort to improve the design of helmets along with their capabilities. They're now considered the standard in the field. If you're going to drag race, you need one.

, The ideal time to shift is when the descending power curve for the lower gear crosses the ascending power curve for the higher gear. Most drag racers will use a tachometer to closely monitor the RPMs and feel for that sweet spot, just before the RPMs hit the red patch on the gauge.


Many drag racers will use a lighted tachometer, which will flash a light indicating the optimal time to shift. Great racers anticipate these lights, however, shifting perhaps 200 or 300 RPMs before the ""ideal"" time, to make the action slightly smoother.
Drag racing in automatic transmission vehicles exists, but is less common. Manual transmission vehicles offer faster acceleration times if you can get the technique right. If you want to get into drag racing, practice your shifting in a manual transmission vehicle.

, If you want to really grip the track, you need to get some racing tires for your vehicle. Without tread, heading up bald tires will allow you to grip the track and increase the efficiency of the engine.


Contrary to popular belief, keeping the tires a little low doesn't help improve your times as much as once believed. While it does increase the surface of the tires by a small degree, keeping the tires too low can cause the interior wall to wrinkle, having the opposite effect. Keep the tires inflated to the low end of the proper specs.

, After several runs down the strip, you should start to notice some build up from other cars' rubber and exhaust developing. That's the sweet spot. Bare asphalt won't have the traction that this coating of rubber has. Stick to the groove and barrel down the track.

Most racers know about gear ratio and gear ratio charts are listed in numerous places.,
But in order to get a true picture of gear ratio one must use tire circumference in equation.,
To figure IPR use this equation: Rear Tire Circumference(T) x clutch gear(C) divided by rear gear(R) = IPR.,
Even though both these racers were using the same gears they were not running an equal set-up.,
So remember, if you ask someone what gears they are using and you don't also ask what size their tires are, you are wasting your time.",How to Select a Go Kart Racing Gear Using Gears and Tires," Gear ratios are figured using rear gear divided by clutch gear. For example if you were running a 15t clutch gear and a 60t rear gear it would be 60 / 15=4. Simply put this means 1 revolution of the axle to 4 revolutions of the crank.;
, If you run the same gears as someone else but you have 34"" rear tire circumference and someone else has 36"", the true ratios are not equal. To figure the true ratio you will want to use IPR(inches per revolution) which simply means the number of inches a kart will travel per each revolution of engine.

, For example if one racer(Racer A) was running a 15t clutch gear with a 60t rear gear and their tires were 34"" the equation would be 34 x 15 / 60 = 8.5. This means the kart would travel 8.5 inches (21.6 cm) per revolution of engine. If another racer(Racer B) had the same gears but had 36"" tires look what happens. 36 x 15 / 60 = 9.0.

, Racer A would be faster coming off the corners and Racer B would be faster down the straight. So what if Racer B wanted to run the same IPR as Racer A but still use the same tires? To figure that we can replace Racer B's 60 with Racer A's IPR. 36 x 15 / 8.5 = 63.52. This means that for things to be equal, Racer B would need to change their rear gear to a 63t or 64t.

, Think IPR, not gear ratio. Here's a couple of links to use if you need a go kart racing clutch or rear sprockets.

Focus on being smooth.,
Make your overtake as clean as possible.,
Don't always go for a gap.,
Be prepared to put in plenty of practice.,
Identify a part on the track that helps you find your usual braking point.,
Try braking a little later than your braking point to see how it affects your exit speed.,
Observe whether the driver ahead of you brakes at the same time that you do.,
Use corners you're familiar with.,
While you have these turns figured out, think about whether the ideal way of overtaking on this corner would be to go on the inside of the opponent or go on the outside of the opponent.

,
Think about a few corners in advance.,
Note the opponent's moves.,
Don't panic if you are not able to overtake your opponent the first time.,
Practice frequently.,
Stay confident and reduce your fear.,
Look where you want your kart to go.",How to Overtake in Karting," This is one point that a lot of racers neglect. Being an aggressive driver may help you gain a few places but will eventually force you to make a mistake and you may lose all the places you took.;
, If you feel that you are overtaking your opponent before entering the corner but are unable to carry out the overtaking move through the exit of the corner then you are probably doing it wrong.


This could be because you are either unable to manage a faster exit speed through the corner or you are too aggressive on the steering and the brakes which in turn make you slower through the corner, which helps your opponent to keep pace with you.

, There could be a possibility that you may have the inside line for a corner but the very next corner could be in the opposite direction and may give your opponent the inside line making your overtaking move useless!

, This method of overtaking does not come easily. It takes practice and a lot of patience. 

, This is the point that you always brake at before turning into a corner.

, If you exit too slowly because your kart loses a lot of traction, you might want to experiment more with your braking points.

, Note whether that driver brakes a lot earlier than you. You can use this knowledge to your advantage and try to steer away from the racing line brake later than the other driver. This allows you to not only overtake the driver but also to make a comfortable exit through the corner, as you are now able to out brake your opponents.

, This is the time you start finding a particular corner or a set of corners that you can take flat-out or in which you save a lot of time while doing timed heats.

,, For example: If you are approaching a hard braking corner after a long straight and you believe that you can overtake the driver then think about the next set of corners. This would help you to analyse how you would have to tackle the next set of corners in order to maintain your position.

, You have to be very attentive about how the opponent takes these corners. Notice whether the driver is struggling or is fairly good through these set of corners. Use the opponent's line through the corner and quickly work out your ideal line to overtake the opponent.

, You know your strong corners and your opponent will now try to be defensive of his or her space, trying not leave any for you to overtake. Use this behavior to your advantage and push the opponent to make a mistake through a corner; that will be your key to overtaking him or her.

, Karting is an expensive sport, so use your time on the track wisely. When karting, think and experiment with your line, so as to be well prepared when you actually have to use all of your practice to overtake your opponents.

, In a high paced sport like karting, never let fear get the best of you. If you do, the other driver behind you will not hesitate to drive you off the track!

, If you have a gap that you can fit through and overtake, stare into the gap because that's where you want to go.


If you stare at the kart in front if you and keep thinking that you will crash, you are bound to crash then!

Put your car into first gear.,
Turn your steering wheel as to perform a tighter circle.,
Floor the accelerator and release the clutch and hand brake.,
Decelerate slowly after one to two donuts.,
Shift your car into first gear.,
Press on your accelerator.,
Manage both the power and the brake.,
Shift your car into reverse gear.,
Begin to back your car up.,
Turn your wheel sharply.,
Turn off the traction control on your car before you do any donuts.,
Find a clear open space to spin donuts.,
Check the tread on your tires.,
Maintain your car's fluids.,
Bring some friends along with you.",How to Do Donuts," This method only works for cars that have a manual transmission, as you will need to use the clutch. Pull the gear shift, either next to your steering wheel or your right leg, and shift it to first gear. Then gradually press on the accelerator and drive forward slowly. As your car picks up some speed (15-20 mph) begin to turn your steering wheel in the direction you want your donut to go. Note: this step is not about making the donut, but about positioning your car so that you are ready to do so.








Only turn your steering wheel 45 degrees, while making one slow, large circle with your car.
Continue making the large circle a few times, getting used to how your car feels and the way it turns.;
, It is important that this step, and the following step, be done one right after another, fairly quickly. Continue to press gradually on your accelerator. Turn your steering wheel so that it is positioned somewhere between a 45-90 degree angle (in the same direction as before). As you are turning your wheel, press all the way down on your clutch and pull up on your hand brake.








Your car's rear wheels will begin to lock up as your car begins to skid.

, It is important that this step, and the previous step, be done one right after another, fairly quickly. As your car's rear wheels lock, and your begins to skid, floor the accelerator. At the same time you are flooring your accelerator, you should also release both the clutch and the hand brake. If you have enough speed, your car should now begin to spin and perform a donut.







, After you have completed between one to two donuts, bring your car back to normal speed by lifting up on the accelerator. As you are slowing down, begin to turn your wheel back to the straight forward position. You will want to aim your car in the direction of an open space of blacktop. After you have the car under control, press on the clutch and shift your car back into park.







, Shift into first gear if your car has a manual transmission. Go into hill-climbing gear if your car has an automatic transmission. The gear shift is located either next to your steering wheel or your right leg. As you are shifting your car into gear, turn your steering wheel completely in one direction., Floor the throttle and your car should begin to turn in one direction. As the car is sliding, yank the hand brake to begin the rear-wheel slide., To keep the car spinning and gliding on the rear wheels, you will have to continuously press on the accelerator and lift the hand brake. After you have done so once, let off the accelerator slightly, and let the hand brake go . When your car begins to lose power, and therefore some of the spin, press on the throttle again, and lift the hand brake.Be careful not to rev your engine too much in first gear. If you do this more than 5-6 times it can start to damage your engine.
To stop the donuts, simply let off the accelerator slightly, while jerking your steering wheel back to the center position.
Press on the clutch and brake as you shift back into park.

, This method only works with cars that have a manual transmission as you will need to use the clutch. Start by turning your steering wheel to one direction. As you do this, shift your car into reverse. The gear shift should be located either next to your steering wheel or right leg., First press the clutch. As you do this, floor the accelerator. Once the accelerator is floored, let up from the clutch. Your car will begin to lurch backwards, as the front wheels begin to lose grip and start to slide. The front will start to rotate around the back wheels.Back off the throttle slightly. Hold the accelerator at a constant, medium-strength position.

, After your car begins to slide on the back wheels, jerk your steering wheel all the way to the opposite direction. The donuts that are produced will generate severe pressure against your body (lateral G force).Once you have completed the donuts, bring your steering wheel back to the center position and lower the accelerator down so you are at around 20 mph. You may have to jerk the wheel slightly back-and-forth to maintain control of the car.
Press down on the clutch and brake as you shift your car back into park.

, This is key, otherwise the tires might lock up and not spin properly. Put your key in the ignition, and turn to start your car. While your car is still in park, turn off traction control. There is generally a button on the left or right side of the steering wheel allowing you to disable traction control. See your owner's manual if there is no such button.Do not turn off traction control before you start your car. The default setting for traction control is ""ON."" This means that traction control will turn on after the ignition starts.
A light is likely to appear on your dashboard above your steering wheel calling your attention to the fact that traction control has been turned off. Do not worry about this light, as it will disappear once you finish spinning donuts, and turn traction control back on.

, The surface of the space should ideally be blacktop rather than grass or dirt. It is best to spin donuts on a barren parking lot, or back road. Make sure that you have enough space, not just for your car, but for when it begins to spin in circles. You should also make sure that the surrounding space does not have any houses, trees, or other obstructions.


Though you can also do donuts in snowy areas, avoid icy or slick areas as these can present a safety hazard.

, You do not want to spin donuts with tires that are already worn down, and/or need replacing. To check the tread, perform the ""penny test."" Take a penny and place it in one of the tire's tread ribs. Make sure Lincoln's head is facing down. If the tread rib covers the entire head, you have enough tread on your tire to safely spin donuts.If the head is more than halfway showing, you should think about replacing your tires. You can either do this yourself by purchasing tires online, or visiting your nearest car care professional.

, Make sure that your oil has been recently changed. You should also change your power steering and brake fluids. These are severely important, as spinning donuts puts a tremendous amount of pressure on your car. You need to make sure it is in top shape before you take it out. Please visit your nearest car care professional, or use the following links to change your cars fluids:


How to Change the Oil in Your Car
How to Flush Power Steering Fluid
How to Refill Brake Fluid
You should also perform an overall check on your car's internal components. Check your engine, transmission, muffler, etc. to make sure they are in tip-top shape. Visit: How to Do a Maintenance Inspection for Your Car.

, Generally speaking, spinning donuts is safe. However, in case of an emergency, you should always have people on standby. This could be a couple of friends or relatives who are willing to go out with you. Have them stand far away from where you are spinning donuts. This way there is no chance that they can get hurt, and therefore will be able to call someone in case of an emergency.


Make sure your phone is charged up before you go out, as well as your friends' phones.
Have your local sheriff's office and emergency personnel phone numbers on hand in the event of an emergency.

Pick a fast kart (if you can), but be careful because if a kart is going too fast you may drift and lose control.,
Enter turns slow, exit turns fast.,
Be smooth.,
Plan your drive path as ""out-in-out"", the wide path will help you maintain momentum.,
Limit the sliding in your turns.,
Time your passes carefully.,
Do not crash into people, it may sound obvious know but out on a busy go kart track it is an easy mistake to make.,
Learn your way round the track and its history.",How to Successfully Drive a Go Kart1," If you are selecting from seemingly identical karts, look for karts with fresher tires or from karts that have been winning previous races that day at the track. , This single tip is the most important lesson of fast go-karting. Winning a go kart race is about maintaining momentum throughout the entire track., You may think you are cool slamming on the accelerator, but sliding and jerking actually slow you down. Accelerate smoothly, brake smoothly to retain momentum and be faster all around that track. , For example when you are entering left turn you stay at the right side, then cut in the apex. Then drive to the right again. For a right turn, vice versa.


When you are just learning, it can help to follow a fast driver to duplicate her race line as closely as possible.

, Sliding and drifting may look cool, but they aren't actually fast techniques for the beginner or intermediate driver.


Brake at the end of the straightaways before you enter the turn. If you start breaking during the turn, you will slide.
Control your front tire grip. If your front tires stay in control, your kart will stay in the line you want. It can be OK to let the back tires slide a bit.

, Don't pass when there is risk that you will end up in the tires.

, Also, most go kart tracks will make you leave if you repetitively crash into people.

, If you go a lap without crashing then push a bit more and you might gain some seconds. If you crash, slow down a bit. Also learning about its history if it's quite old and quite big can help you ""get into touch"" with the track.

Have a valid written contract.,
Create clear contract language.,
Create a “security interest.” A “security interest” is what creates the collateral for your loan, and what gives you the right to repossess the property.,
Include a clear provision about repossession.,
Locate the vehicle.,
Gather your paperwork.,
Take possession.,
Remove the car.,
Do not create a breach of peace.,
Limit the repossession to the car alone.,
Allow the borrower the right to redeem his car.,
Conduct a “commercially reasonable” sale.,
Keep accurate records.,
Return excess value from sale of car.,
Beware of bankruptcy.",How to Repossess a Car," Anyone who has seen “The People’s Court” or “Judge Judy” has probably seen all kinds of oral agreements that get held up as contracts. However, the sale of an automobile must be in writing in order to be enforceable., If you are the seller of the car, you are the one responsible for the language in the contract. If there are any terms in the contract that wind up being ambiguous, they will usually be ruled in favor of the buyer.If you want to have the right to repossess the car in case of a default, make sure that your contract defines the following issues:


Default – just what is a “default”? Do you want the right to repossess if the buyer is a day late with his or her payment? A week late? A month late? Be sure to specify.Notice – If the buyer is late, will you issue a warning or notice of default before repossessing? In some states, you may have to, but in others you may not. Spell it out in the contract.Grace Period – Will you allow a grace period for late payments? Many contracts will accept payments that are made within, for example, five to ten days late, but many do not. This is a point you need to discuss when signing the contract and make sure to include it in writing.

, In this case, the collateral is the car itself. Part of your sale contract needs to include language that creates a security interest in the car.

, Your contract needs to put the buyer on notice that failure to pay on time may lead to repossession. You will need to check with your state law to be sure that you use the proper language about creating a security interest, which is what gives you the right to repossess the property., If this was a private sale to a friend or neighbor, then locating the vehicle may not be a difficult process. On the other hand, it may take some work to hunt it down. When you do believe that you have found the vehicle, be absolutely certain that you have the actual car. Check the car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). You can usually find this on the dashboard, in the front left corner under the windshield. Check and make sure that it exactly matches the number on your title or contract for the sale.

, When you go to take possession of the car, you will need to have the proof that you are entitled to it. This would include the original contract, the proof of payments that you have received and, by the absence, the ones you have not received. If you need the help of a police officer or a locksmith, for example, they will most certainly require this information.

, You have a few choices when it comes to gaining entry into a car and removing it from the premises.


Use the key code to have a key made in advance. Many cars manufactured within the last six years have a key code that can be found on the title or by looking up the car’s VIN. You can use this key code to have a key made for you.Pick the car lock to get in. Slide a narrow metal rod through the window and into the door, then use it to pull up the door lock. You may also use a wire coat hanger bent to the correct shape.
Tow the vehicle. You may opt to hire a towing company or tow the car yourself.
Start the vehicle without a key. Use this method if you must gain entry into the car without having a key. There are other sources online with information about “hot wiring” a car.

, Once you have taken possession, remove the car to a secure location where you can hold it until you resolve the issue of payment or sale. Be aware that once the car is in your possession, you become responsible for its condition. If the car gets damaged through your negligence, the debtor may actually have a legal claim against you for any loss in the car's value.

, Nearly every state has a law that allows you to repossess a car as described here. Those laws also require that you are not allowed to “breach the peace” to take the car.A “breach of peace” generally means that you may not:


Break into someone’s house to get the keys, or into their locked garage to take the car. (There is some question about taking the car from a closed, but unlocked garage.)Cause a fight or other physical altercation while taking the car. For example, if the owner/debtor notices what you are doing and tries to stop you, perhaps by standing in your way or blocking the car, you may not forcibly remove him in order to take the car.Cause damage to the car or other property while in the act of repossessing the car.

, You may have the right to repossess the car, but that does not give you the right to any additional property that is inside the car. For example, if the owner/debtor has expensive camera equipment in the back seat, you are responsible for returning that to him or at least notifying him how and when he can collect it. Otherwise, he could turn around and sue you for the value of that additional property., To “redeem” means to pay off the amount that is owed and buy back the car. Most states allow the debtor this right., The purpose of repossessing a car is usually to re-sell it in order to collect the money that is owed on the loan. As the lender, you are required to conduct this sale in a “commercially reasonable” manner. This means that you must advertise it fairly and conduct it at a place and time that is reasonable expected to bring a fair price.You may not, for example, tell two of your friends that you will be holding an auction at 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday and consider that “commercially reasonable.” It is up to you to sell the car for a fair price.

, If you repossess a car, you are generally entitled to recover not only the full unpaid loan amount but also any costs of the repossession, advertisement of a sale, costs of hiring an auctioneer, etc. You must keep accurate records of all these costs and be able to show them if the debtor questions your figures., If you are able to sell the car for an amount that is greater than the loan and the costs you incurred, you are required to return any remaining money to the debtor. You are only allowed to collect what you are actually owed – not more., If the debtor notifies you at any point in this process that he has filed bankruptcy, then your efforts to repossess the car must stop immediately.


If you have not yet taken possession of the car, then do not go through with the repossession.
If you have already taken possession of the car but have not yet sold it, then you should keep it secure until you are contacted by a representative of the Bankruptcy Court with further instructions.
If you have advertised a sale but have not held it yet, you should stop and check with the bankruptcy trustee to find out if you may proceed with the sale.
Any action you take after being notified of a bankruptcy case could be considered a violation of federal law on your part and could create serious problems for you."

Notify the Office of Consumer Affairs in your state.",How to Report a Car Under the Lemon Law," The first report of a problematic car under the lemon law in most states must be to the dealer where you purchased the car. Whether the dealer has provided the service to your car, or you have gone to another service station, you must report the problem to the dealer. The dealer, by law, must have an opportunity to correct the problems that you are having.Visit the site, www.carlemon.com, to access a summary of each state's lemon laws. You can search for your own state and find the laws that apply to you.;
, After you report the problem to the dealer who sold you the car, you must allow a “reasonable” opportunity for the dealer to correct whatever is wrong with the vehicle. Most states provide two possible definitions for what is “reasonable”:at least two, or up to four, attempts to repair the vehicle, OR
such repairs that take the car out of usable service for 30 days.

, Put your notice in writing and send it by certified mail. You should send your notice to the local dealer’s location and also to the corporate national headquarters. The local dealer is the one that will address the issue, but writing to the corporate headquarters puts the company officially on notice.In your letter, you should begin by clearly stating that you believe your car falls under the lemon law of your state. For example, your letter may begin, “Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to notify you that the car I recently purchased from your dealership falls under the state lemon law because of the need for repetitive repairs.”
Identify the car clearly by providing the make, model, and year of the car, as well as its vehicle identification number (VIN). The VIN will be necessary to provide a specific identification of your particular car.
Explain the mechanical problem that you have been experiencing. Try to be as detailed as possible, with information about the impact the car problems have had on you and the way that the car does not work.
Provide a list of the dates when you had the car repaired. You should include the name and location of the service station that provided the work each time, a description of the problem that you had worked on, and your description of the result. Include the length of time that the car was out of service for each repair.

, If the dealer agrees with your lemon law claim, and agrees that “reasonable” repair efforts have failed to correct the problem, the dealer is expected then to offer you either a replacement vehicle or a refund. In most states, it is your option to accept the replacement vehicle or the refund.An offer of a replacement vehicle should include reimbursement for any additional costs that you incur related to taking a new car. This should include additional registration fees or transfer fees, any towing or rental costs you incurred, and any sales tax related to the replacement vehicle.
If you opt to accept a refund instead, your state law will direct the amount that you should be able to receive. You should be compensated for the full purchase price, including all costs related to the purchase, such as taxes and registration. The dealer may be entitled to reduce the refund by a percentage to account for the time or mileage on the car at the time of the refund. The reduction will be calculated according to your own state’s law.

, You will need to take further action if the dealer will not offer you either a refund or a replacement vehicle. The dealer may not accept your conclusion that the car is a lemon. This disagreement may be based on any one or more of the following details:


The dealer may argue that you let too much time go by before filing your claim.
The dealer may assert that you are exaggerating the problem. The dealer could hold the opinion that the repairs have fixed the vehicle satisfactorily.
You and the dealer may disagree on whether the offered replacement vehicle is acceptably similar to yours.
You and the dealer may disagree on calculating an acceptable refund amount.

, In a large number of states, lemon laws offer a state-certified arbitration program to help resolve disputes. In those states, arbitration might be considered either mandatory or optional. In states that offer arbitration, you must meet certain eligibility requirements in order to take part. For example, in California, your vehicle must meet the following requirements if you want to take part in state-certified arbitration:Purchased or leased in California from a retailer
Covered by the original warranty
Purchased for personal use

, If eligible, you should gather important documents and get your ducks in a row before filing. Start by collecting all of your repair orders, taking notes regarding conversations with your dealership, and by keeping a log book of all repair attempts (including dates).This information will help you file your arbitration claim and be successful during your arbitration hearing.

, To file for arbitration, check your warranty materials. In a state like California, the manufacturer is required to supply you with detailed steps for filing within those materials if the manufacturer is a part of the state-certified arbitration program. If you do not find the information you need in your warranty materials, visit your state's lemon law website. There is usually no filing fee associated with these arbitration claims. Also, there is generally no need to hire a lawyer, unless you want one. When you file an arbitration claim, you will provide the following information:A statement of the problem and how you would like it resolved
A date and signature

, If possible, attend your hearing in person. However, if you are unable to attend, you can usually make your case over the phone or in writing. During the hearing the arbitrator will ask each party to present evidence about their case. You should be prepared to summarize repair attempts, give the arbitrator copies of all your documentation, and have your vehicle on hand so it can be inspected.


Towards the end of your presentation, tell the arbitrator how you would like the matter resolved. In general, you will be able to ask for additional repairs, a replacement vehicle, a refund, and reimbursements., After both parties have presented their case, the arbitrator will make a decision about how your case should be resolved. In California, this decision must be made within 40 days of you filing your arbitration claim. The decision the arbitrator makes is binding on the manufacturer, but only if you choose to accept it. If you reject the decision, you will be able to move forward and seek other remedies.


If you accept the arbitrator's decision, the manufacturer will have to perform under the decision within a certain period of time. In California, the manufacturer will have to perform under the decision within 30 days of being made aware of it., If arbitration does not lead to a final solution, you can file a complaint in court. For example, in Maryland, you can file a lemon lawsuit in court regardless of whether you first arbitrated your case.In California, you can only use the ""Lemon Law Presumption"" if you first arbitrate your claim. This is meant to incentivize arbitration and dispute resolution.Each state has a lemon law and each state has its own requirements for filing a lawsuit.

, An attorney can work with you to review your claim, the details of the repair efforts, and the strength of your lemon law allegations. In the beginning, as you work with the dealer to try to resolve the repairs that are needed, you may not feel that an attorney is necessary. However, if you choose to proceed with more involved legal processes, an attorney will probably be very helpful. In some states, an attorney may even be required., If you are eligible to file a lawsuit, you and your attorney will need to file a complaint in the correct court. Most often, this will be in the county and state where your vehicle was purchased or where you are licensed to drive. The complaint is a formal legal document that states your claims (i.e., that your car is a lemon) and specifies the remedy you are seeking.In general, in lemon law cases, you can ask for additional repair attempts, a replacement vehicle, a refund, and reimbursement for expenses.If you do file a lawsuit, you should name both the local dealer and the corporate manufacturer as defendants in your lawsuit.If your state requires you to arbitrate before filing a lawsuit, make sure you provide the details of the arbitration in your complaint. If you fail to do so, the court may dismiss your case.

, After you file your lawsuit, the clerk of courts will sign and stamp a summons form. This form, along with a copy of your complaint, must be sent to the defendant. This process, called service, helps notify the defendant of the pending action against them. In most cases, you will not be able to serve the defendant personally. Instead, you will need to hire someone over the age of 18 who is unrelated to the case. You can also hire your local sheriff's office to serve the defendant on your behalf., Once the defendant has received a copy of your complaint, they will respond by filing an answer. An answer is a legal document that replies to each of your allegations. In addition, the answer might contain various defenses the defendant finds relevant. Once filed, this answer will be served on you. Read the answer carefully because it will help you determine how to proceed.

, During discovery, you and the defendant will exchange information in order to prepare for trial. You will be able to collect facts, interview witnesses, see what the other side is going to say at trial, and determine how strong your case is. To accomplish these things, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in-person interviews with witnesses and and parties. The interviews are conducted under oath and answers given can be used in court.
Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to witnesses and parties. The responses will be written under oath and can be used in court.
Requests for documents, which are written requests for information you would not normally be able to get your hands on. For example, in a lemon lawsuit, you might ask for warranty information, internal memos, phone records, and repair records.
Requests for admissions, which are written statements the defendant must admit or deny. These requests help hone in on what is really at issue in the case.

, When discovery concludes, the defendant will most likely try to end the litigation immediately and have the judge rule in their favor. To do this, they will file a motion for summary judgment. In order to succeed, the defendant will have to prove that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that, even if all factual assumptions were made in your favor, you would still lose.


To defend against the motion, you will need to file a response. It will contain evidence and affidavits showing that factual disputes do exist and that they need to be hashed out in court. You will be successful so long as you can persuade the judge that you have a chance (no matter how small) to win at trial., Trials can be incredibly expensive and time consuming. To avoid the burden of trial, you should attempt to settle if you get this far into the litigation. This is a great time to settle because both parties will have evidence gathered during discovery, which will help during the negotiations. In addition, you will most likely know how the judge is feeling about the case based on how they handled summary judgment. Start by taking part in informal negotiations with the defendant. If they do not lead to a resolution, try mediation.


During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with both parties and discuss the case. The mediator will try to come up with unique solutions that can make both parties happy. The mediator will not inject their own opinions and they will not take sides.

, If you end up going to trial, you will have to present your case to a judge, and perhaps a jury. As the plaintiff, you will present your case first. Your attorney will examine witnesses and present physical evidence to the court. When your attorney is done, the defendant will have an opportunity to present their case. At the end of the trial, the judge and/or jury will deliberate and come up with a resolution. The resolution will then be announced in court. If you win, you will be awarded one or more remedies asked for in your complaint.


If you lose, you will not be awarded any remedy. However, if you feel as if the judge made some legal error that affected the outcome of the case, you may be able to appeal the decision to a higher court. If you think this is a possibility, talk to your attorney as soon as possible. In most cases, your attorney must file a notice of appeal within about 30 days of judgment being entered against you., Whether or not you take action in court, you can at least report your problem to the Attorney General. Most states’ Attorney General’s offices will provide a website or a telephone contact to take formal complaints. A complaint to the Attorney General is not likely to result in a financial recovery for you, but it will initiate an investigation into the dealer.To find the site that you need, search for “Attorney General consumer complaint” and the name of your state. This should lead you directly to a site with the forms and additional information to help you file your complaint.

, The Better Business Bureau (BBB) provides notices and support to consumers when they get involved with disputes with various businesses. The BBB has an online complaint form that you may use if your dispute was not resolved to your satisfaction.The Better Business Bureau will receive your complaint and share it with the manufacturer for a response. If the manufacturer provides no response, the BBB will make a second attempt. The BBB will share with you any response they receive, or notice that they received nothing. In any event, your complaint will go on record and may help future consumers.

, The Office of Consumer Affairs is an agency that records complaints and concerns with businesses. In many states, this is a department within either the Attorney General or Secretary of State’s office. The Office of Consumer Affairs may not take an active part in your dispute. However, they do keep records and can take action if a number of complaints are received against a single business.


You can use the site www.usa.gov/state-consumer to find information about Consumer Affairs in any state in the U.S. You can select your state from a drop-down list, and the search engine will provide you with several access numbers and contacts within your state.

The policy is the contract between you and the insurance company. It spells out what the insurance company is supposed to pay, under what conditions they pay, and what your duties are to get those things paid. Look for things such as: Covered and uncovered items
Determination of fault
Required documentation
Time limits for submission
Contact information for claim submissions;
, If anything is unclear, your agent can tell you how the insurance company usually handles certain situations and how they interpret certain policy provisions. This can prepare you for potential upcoming issues. The agent can also provide any forms you need and guide you in the process of submitting your claim. , Your policy will likely stipulate deadlines for submitting claim forms, estimates, medical bills, and other documents. You will also be required to make your vehicle available for an adjuster's inspection. If you do not comply with these requirements, your claim could be denied, leaving you with no further recourse. , If your claim is denied, you should refresh your understanding of any policy provisions you believe the insurance company may be violating. Familiarize yourself, too, with the process of appealing a denial. , As you read the policy, list any provisions that you believe require the insurance company to pay. Beside each item on that list, notate the associated bills (including amount, payee, and description of the service provided). Then note the reason the claim was denied and your reason for disputing the denial. Common causes of denial include: There was no complaint or treatment at the time of the accident. Some states have laws barring claims if you don’t seek treatment within a short time frame following an accident.
Medical records don’t indicate any injury or pain. Insurance companies are not required to pay for non-existent damages, and without medical records indicating injury or pain, they are often considered non-existent even though they may later prove to be very real.
Your injury resulted from a pre-existing condition. If the accident worsened a condition you already had, you may still be able to get your claim paid if you can show that the accident exacerbated the condition.
You could have avoided the accident. If the insurance company believes you did something to cause the accident, that may void your coverage. An example is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. If your policy states that the company will not pay for an accident that was your fault, you may need to prove to them that it wasn't.

, Even if it has already been submitted with the initial claim, you will want to submit evidence of your damages or conditions of the accident with your appeal. This evidence may include:


The police report from the officer who responded to the traffic accident and documented the scene.
Pictures you took of the vehicles and accident scene.
Statements of witnesses to the accident.
Medical records and bills.
Any bills and estimates for vehicle repair.

, Your appeal will most likely be written in the form of a letter with the evidence attached. Be sure you state each reason they denied your claim, why you believe that reasoning was incorrect and contrary to the policy, and which piece of attached evidence supports your position. Attach all pieces of evidence that you used to support your position. Keep a copy of your appeal, and send the original to the location provided by your policy. Your agent can help you identify the appropriate place to file the appeal if your policy is unclear., While most minor traffic accidents are easily settled, your insurance company may deny a claim you believe should be paid. This could include damages that the company believes may have pre-dated the accident and medical expenses the company does not believe were necessary. Insurance companies can get very creative when attempting to deny claims.

Consider hiring an attorney. Many accident attorneys work on a contingency basis, meaning they get paid a percentage of anything they recover for you in court. However, if your claim is small, some attorneys will not take the case. , Review the statutes in your state. You will want to read statutes regarding insurance, personal-injury claims, torts (sometimes considered civil procedure), and contracts. A link to state statutes can typically be found on the websites of your state’s legislature, supreme court, and/or governor’s office. Look for the things you must prove in court, defenses the insurance company may have, and anything you must do prior to filing suit. Also look for limits to recovery. If your state does not allow you to recover court costs or the cost of any experts expected to testify, it may not be worth suing. , Your state may require you to make certain attempts at settlement prior to filing suit in court. These will be found in your state statutes. These steps may include: Ensuring you are within the statute of limitations. Typically you must bring suit within five years, but some state statutes of limitations are as short as one year.
Sending a demand letter. In a demand letter you inform the insurance company exactly how much money they owe you and what provision(s) of the policy make them responsible for those charges. You should also outline the steps you have previously taken to get this debt satisfied. Do not threaten to take any specific action. Instead give a deadline (such as 30 days) after which further action will be taken. You need not define what that further action would be.
Obtaining a medical or other expert. Some states will not allow you to file suit for medical injury unless you have already engaged a medical expert to testify on your behalf.

, On the website of your state’s highest court, there should be a description of the state court system. Looking at that description, locate the general jurisdiction in your state. Often there will be a division between courts based on the amount of money under consideration (a small-claims court vs. a court of general jurisdiction). Once you identify the court that handles claims for the amount you are attempting to recover, locate that same court in your county or parish. You will want to file in the county or parish in which the accident occurred or a county where the insurance company has an office if you are suing the other driver’s insurance company. You can file in the county in which you live if you are suing your own insurance company.

, Most states provide pre-prepared forms for some civil actions. These can usually be found on the website of your local court and/or your state’s highest court. You can often get assistance finding and completing forms at your local self-help center. Some states provide an interactive, online program that creates your documents tailored to your particular circumstances. You will likely need at least a petition and summons or citation. , Once the appropriate documents have been completed, you will need to sign them. Any forms that have a notary block on them will need to be signed in front of a notary. Make copies of all documents for yourself and all defendants (insurance companies or individuals you are suing), and keep the originals secure.

, Give the original set of documents to the clerk of the court that will hear your case. A filing fee will be charged unless you apply and qualify for a waiver. You can ask the clerk to stamp your copies with the filing date. The clerk will also need to sign your summons or citation, which s/he will return to you.

, Ask the clerk to sign your summons or citation when you file your documents. Make a copy of the signed summons or citation for your records. Attach the original summons or citation to the copy of the documents for the other party. Typically the other party must receive these documents within 90 to 120 days of the date you file your case. Methods of service are different in each state, and acceptable methods can be found by reading your state’s civil procedural rules. They usually include some of the following: You can pay the sheriff’s office to serve them.
You can pay a private process server to serve them.
You can arrange for a friend or relative (at least 18 years of age and not involved in the case) to serve them by a method listed in the civil procedural rules. This person will need to complete a Return or Proof of Service and may need to testify as to how they served the documents.
Note that in most cases you are not permitted to serve these documents yourself.

, In most states the other party has 21 to 30 days from the date s/he was served with the petition to file a written answer. You should receive a copy of the answer, but if you do not, call the clerk and ask if one has been received. If no answer was filed, consider filing for a Default Judgment. , If you need to gather information or evidence to support your case in court, you will do this via discovery. Read the rules governing discovery usually found in the civil procedural rules to learn about discovery techniques and processes in your state. In general you can require the other party or potential witnesses to:


Provide you with copies of documents
Allow you to inspect items or property
Answer written or oral questions under oath.

, Throughout the case you will be asked to make certain disclosures to the other party, and you should request these same disclosures if they are not made voluntarily. These disclosures may include medical records, lists of people expected to testify at trial and what they intend to testify about, exhibits you intend to present at trial either as evidence or for demonstration purposes. If these things are not disclosed prior to trial, and the other party objects to their use, you may not be able to present them at your hearing.

, Be sure you understand them. If you have any questions about them, it is worth paying an attorney for assistance or instruction., Here a neutral third party attempts to bring the parties to an agreement on the issues. There is no need to bring any evidence, because the mediator does not make any decisions. The intent is for both parties to compromise a little so that the issues can be settled without the need for a trial. If mediation is successful, the mediator may prepare the proper documents, obtain the signature of each party, and submit the documents to the court. If mediation is unsuccessful, the parties simply proceed to court. In most cases statements made in mediation cannot be used in court, and the mediator makes no statements to the court other than whether mediation was successful., Contact the clerk of the court to schedule your hearing. You should be able to estimate for him/her how long the hearing is expected to take. The clerk may set a scheduling conference or hearing at which the judge will ask questions to be sure all issues are ready for trial and to determine how much time will be needed for the full hearing. You will be required to provide notice of the hearing to all other parties. You can do this by preparing a Notice of Hearing or by sending a letter to the other party giving all details of the hearing (date, time, location, expected duration, and the name of the judge). Ask the clerk if your court provides a form for this. Issue any necessary witness subpoenas. , On the day of the hearing be sure you are dressed neatly and respectfully. If you have a suit, wear it. If not, clean clothes that would be suitable office attire are acceptable. If you only have jeans, be sure they are clean and in good repair. Do not wear shorts, flip flops, tank tops, miniskirts, or sagging pants. Arrive early. Speak only to the judge, not to the opposing party or their attorney. Address the judge with respect, calling him or her “Your Honor” or “Judge”. Stand when speaking. The case will likely proceed as follows, although this can vary with circumstances:Opening statements of the petitioner (you). This is a roadmap of the case and what will be proven.
Opening statements of the respondent (the other party)
Witnesses called by the petitioner and cross examined by the respondent
Witnesses called by the respondent and cross examined by the petitioner
Closing arguments by the petitioner (a summary of the trial and arguments as to why the judge should rule in petitioner’s favor)
Closing arguments by the respondent
Rebuttal by the petitioner
Ruling by the judge

, After the judge’s ruling, the prevailing party is usually tasked with preparing any orders. If you submitted proposed orders earlier and now prevail at trial, the judge may use those. The judge may also have stacks of blank orders on the bench that s/he fills out and signs while making the ruling. If you are tasked with preparing the order, locate the appropriate order form from the link above and complete it. Make two copies. File the original with the court, and send a copy to the other party. Keep the second copy for your records. Once the judge signs the order, you can get a copy of the signed order from the clerk. If you disagree with the judge’s ruling, you typically have 30 days to file a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. Check your state’s rules of appellate procedure for the appropriate deadline. "

Contacting the authorities is very important, since they will document the accident. In doing so, they will record the details of the accident in accordance to the testimonies of all the parties involved (including witnesses). Such documentation is vital as insurance companies will use it to determine which party is primarily responsible for damages.


In most cases, you’ll want to call the police.
In a case of minor car accidents, such as a fender bender in the parking lot or something similar, you might be able to contact another type of law enforcement officer who will document the accident.
In the case of a more severe accident, emergency services will dispatch paramedics or firefighters to the scene. Remember, the safety and well-being of all parties is paramount to insurance-related claims.;
, It is your right to obtain the personal details of the other driver. It is also your obligation to give them your personal details. If the accident involved another person, make sure to have their:


Name.
Driver’s license number.
License plate number.
Insurance information, if they have it., Getting the contact information of witnesses is also very important and can aid you in the claims process. Witnesses of the accident might want to talk about what they’ve seen. However, not all of them are willing to do that particular task.


Don’t be rude to them if they don’t want to talk.
In most cases, witnesses who remain on the scene will be happy to help.
Politely ask for their names, phone numbers, and address.

, If you are carrying a camera or camera phone when the accident happened, don’t hesitate to take picture of the accident scene. Photographing the accident scene can potentially help your case when filing a claim. Pictures can include:


The positions of the cars after the accident.
The damages in your car.
The name of the street or place where the accident took place., Before calling your insurance company and filing a claim, you need to make sure you have all of your appropriate information. This is important, as your insurer will be unable to complete a claim unless you have certain information. Make sure you have:


Your policy number.
Other identifying information (like your date of birth or last four of your social) that the company can use to verify your identity.
A basic description of the incident. Avoid making a call to the insurance company if you are in the middle of finding out what happened. Remember, document the incident and contact the authorities immediately., After you and the authorities have documented the accident, you’ll want to take steps to prevent further damage. Most insurance companies require that their policy holders take reasonable steps to make sure insured vehicles do not experience any further damage after the accident.


Many times, your first step will be to arrange for a tow truck to move the vehicle to a safer location (if needed).
If your vehicle has any damage that would allow moisture to enter the interior, you should close off that damage with a tarp or thick plastic.
Make sure the vehicle is stored or located in a place where theft or vandalism is unlikely., After you’ve taken steps to contact the authorities and document the accident, you need to contact your insurance company. While sometimes you will phone the company through a 1800 number, depending on your insurer, you might have to call your specific agent. Regardless, contacting the company is important, since the insurance company will need appropriate information in order to begin the claims process. When calling your insurance company:


Call your insurance company as soon as you safely can. Unless you are injured and hospitalized, you should make your call within 24 to 48 hours.
Make sure that you or others in your party are not in further danger. Avoid calling your insurance company while on the side of a major interstate in rush hour traffic.
Make sure that you are in an environment where you will be able to hear the agent or representative on the phone.
Provide all information that your agent or representative requests., While on the phone with your insurer, it is important to ask them about any information you need to know going forward. This information will allow you to mentally prepare for the rest of the claims process.


Will you be covered for the incident?
What is your deductible?
What are the limits of your policy?, After your initial call to the insurance company, you’ll be referred to an adjuster. What often happens is that the adjuster will call you several days after the claim is filed to set up a time to review your car.


Make sure to make yourself available to the adjuster. The sooner you meet with him or her, the quicker your claim will be processed.
The adjuster will inspect your car, accident reports, and other relevant information.
The adjuster will come to a conclusion about the fault of the accident.
The adjuster will provide an estimate of the repair cost of the vehicle.
Very rarely, the adjuster will let you know that the car is a total loss. In this case, if the loss is covered, the insurer will pay you for the replacement cost of the vehicle (if the loss is covered).
In some cases, your insurer will have you bring your vehicle to a body shop with an onsite adjuster. Often, this speeds up the claims process., After you’ve spoken with the adjuster, you need to maintain communication with your insurer. Maintaining communication is key in making sure the adjuster and the insurer stay proactive on your claim.


Phone your insurer two days after the adjuster has viewed your car.
Ask them the status of your claim.
Request a timeline of your claim., Your deductible is the amount of the damage to your vehicle that you are responsible for independent of your insurer. After you speak with your insurance company, you should prepare to pay or otherwise deal with your deductible.


In the event of a total (covered) loss, your insurer will provide you with a check for the replacement cost of your vehicle minus your deductible. For example, if the replacement cost is $5,000 and your deductible is $500, your insurer will provide you with a check for $4,500.
In the event that your car sustained a limited amount of damage and can be repaired at a body shop, you will be responsible for paying the deductible to the body shop and the insurer will either pay the body shop directly or reimburse you the covered amount.
Policies and procedures vary by company, so make sure to ask your insurer how they will deal with your deductible.

, Sometimes the adjuster will provide an estimate of repairs (or the replacement cost) for your car that is either unrealistic or just too low. In these cases, you'll need to call and dispute the estimate and negotiate with your insurer.


If you think the replacement cost of your car (in the event of a total loss) is too low, you should provide 3-5 examples of the cost to replace your car in your region. Make sure to find examples that match your totaled car.
If you think the estimate for repairs of your car is too low, have several body shops in your area provide estimates for the repairs. After you have the estimates, submit them to your adjuster and/or insurer.
If you think your insurer and the adjuster are not treating you fairly, make sure to persist and escalate your dispute to managers and supervisors within the company., Within a couple days of meeting with the adjuster, they will probably provide you with an estimate and let you know what is covered. At that point, it’ll be time for you to choose a body shop. Choosing a body shop is an important part of the claims process, as it will be one of the last steps in closing your claim.


Make sure to choose a body shop that is proficient in repairing the make and model of your car.
Your insurer might suggest several body shops that they frequently work with. Remember, though, you do not have to pick one of these shops.
Make sure you are comfortable with the shop you pick and the work they do., Remember to also document all of your expenses as they occur. This is important, because your insurer might cover certain expenses related to your accident. As a result, make sure to be diligent about tracking expenses.


Keep copies of your receipts, invoices, and estimates.
Keep copies of associated medical bills.
Your insurer might pay for a rental car, in some circumstances.
Your insurer might pay for a tow truck to relocate your car."

Make sure the car is officially an abandoned vehicle before making any attempts to obtain the title.


A motor vehicle is a vehicle that has been left unattended on the property of another person. However, a certain amount of time must pass before it can be considered abandoned. Timeframes vary by state and sometimes even by county. In New York, for example, the vehicle must remain unattended for at least 96 hours before it's considered abandon.You can find out the qualifications in your state either by visiting your local Department of Motor Vehicles or browsing the local DMV website.;
, The process for obtaining a title is different in each state. Make sure you know what your legal rights are in regards to an abandoned vehicle in your state.


If the vehicle was not found on your property, it will most likely be towed and then held by an automobile business. If the owner does not reclaim the vehicle after a certain timeframe, and the vehicle is worth less than a certain fee, the vehicle will be considered unclaimed. The timeframe and value varies by state. Once a vehicle is marked unclaimed, it will likely be sold at a public auction to the highest bidder. If you purchase an unclaimed vehicle at an auction, you will receive the vehicle and the title shortly after your bid is collected.In some states, even if the vehicle is found on your property it might still be auctioned. This is usually if the vehicle is worth more than a certain amount. You should always contact local authorities before trying to claim a title on an abandoned vehicle.In other states, you can purchase the vehicle from the original owner if it's found on your property. The owner might also opt to simply transfer the title to you.Check your state's DMV website to see what the policies are in your area in regards to the possibility of obtaining an abandoned vehicle's title.

, Oftentimes, vehicles are abandoned for a reason. They may be run down, unsafe, or otherwise unusable. Take a quick look at the vehicle, preferably with the help of a mechanic, and determine whether it's worth pursuing the title. You might simply want to contact the state to have it towed and scrapped if it's not worth salvaging.

, In order to obtain the title of an abandoned vehicle, you must first locate the owner. The vehicle's VIN number can help you do so.


Usually, the VIN is found on the lower left corner of the dashboard right in front of the steering wheel. Usually, you can read the number by looking through the windshield. However, if the number is obscured you do have other options.The VIN is also located on the front engine block, which you can find by popping the hood and looking under the engine.It might also be on the front of the car, under the container that holds windshield fluid.If you can open the car door, look underneath where the side view mirror is located when the door is shut. You can also check near the spot where the door latches, close to the seatbelt return., Once you have the car's VIN number, visit your local DMV. They can help you track down the owner.


In most states, the owner will be notified by certified mail that you are attempting to obtain his vehicle's title. The sheriff in the county where the vehicle is abandoned will also be notified. There will also be publications regarding the vehicle published in the country where it was abandoned for a couple of weeks.Notifications will include a complete description of the car, including it's year, model, and license plate number. It will also include any fees the owner may have to pay for the vehicle's removal., As previously stated, the state might opt to sell the vehicle at a public auctions. This means, to obtain the title you will have to enter a bid. It's easier to simply purchase the car and obtain the title from the previous owner. See if you can do so in your state.


In order to purchase the vehicle from the owner, you will need to draft a bill that includes the date, your name, the vehicle's year, make, and identification number, purchase price, and the signature of the current owner.The owner may be willing to sign the title over to you free of charge. In this case, you would probably need a Sales Tax Exemption Certificate Transfer Affidavit. However, this form might not be required in all states. Talk to your local DMV about what to do in the event the original owner simply wants to transfer the title to you., Paperwork varies state-by-state. In some states, there is initial paperwork you must fill out detailing the original condition and location of an abandoned vehicle. In other states, you need to fill out a notification of sale and other documents regarding the transaction. There also might be fees in your state regarding receiving a vehicles title. Visit your local DMV or call them during operating hours with any questions regarding forms and fees.

, Cars are often abandoned in hectic times of an owner's life. Therefore, it's not uncommon that the owner lost the original title. If this is the case, obtaining the title yourself can be difficult but not impossible.


The owner can apply for a duplicate title at a DMV office. This is probably the easiest way to replace the lost title, although there might be some fees involved depending on the state.The owner might not want to take the time to apply for a duplicate title. In this case, you can have him sign power of attorney over the vehicle to you. This will authorize you to request the duplicate title yourself., The previous owner might refuse to transfer the title to you, even if he has no intention of claiming the car. There are a number of reasons for this, the most likely of which is the original owner is trying to draw out the process to get more money out of you. In this case, you can take the owner to small claim's court.


Contact a small claim's court in your area and explain the situation. Someone at the court house should be able to explain the process of filing a claim to you.If your case does not pan out in small claims court, you can obtain a writ of execution from the county clerk which you would then bring to the sheriff's office. You should bring this alongside a copy of the car's DMV record and a letter from you indicating the car can legally be seized. You may be able to then obtain the title by entering a credit bid to the state.You should only go the small claim's court route if the vehicle is found on your property., Sometimes, it's difficult to locate the car's previous owner. Contact an attorney and see if you can attempt a quiet title. This is a court action that allows you to obtain judgement that would award the car to you."

Keep a copy.",How to Draft a Carsharing Agreement," You should title the document “Car Sharing Agreement.” Put the title in bold and center it in the middle of the page.


Be sure to use a font size and style which is readable. Times New Roman 12 point is fairly standard.;
, The agreement begins by identifying the parties and stating that you have an agreement.


For example, you can write, “This agreement is between Jane Smith and Michael Jones, who agree to the following.”Include the names of all people who will be sharing the car.

, You need to properly identify the car by year, model, and Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).


If you own the car together, then state, “We agree to share the ownership and use of a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu, VIN#: 12345XXXXXX, (hereafter called ‘the car’).”If you only agree to share (but not co-own) the car, then type, “We agree to share the use of a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu, VIN#: 12345XXXXXX, (hereafter called ‘the car’).”

, If you do not already share ownership, then explain when title will be transferred into both owners’ names. If you are only sharing the car and not co-owning it, then you do not need this section.


“Within two weeks of signing this agreement, Jane will transfer title to the car from her name to both names, ‘Jane Smith and Michael Jones, as tenants in common.’”You should understand the different forms of ownership. For example, if you own a car as “tenants in common,” then both people will need to sign in order to sell the car. However, if one of you dies, then the other person does not automatically get the other person’s share of the car. Instead, that share passes to whoever is named in a will or whoever is an heir (if there is no will).By contrast, if you own the car in “joint tenancy,” then the other person’s share will automatically pass to you at death. To create a joint tenancy, write “Within two weeks of signing this agreement, Jane will transfer title to the car from her name to both names, ‘Jane Smith and Michael Jones.’”

Realize, however, that with a joint tenancy, either owner may sell the car without the other’s permission.



, If one of you paid money for a share of the car, then explain how much in the car-sharing agreement. To properly value the car, visit the Kelley Blue Book website and look up the make and model of the vehicle.


For example, you can write, “In consideration for a 50% ownership in the car, Michael will pay Jane $6,500, which we agree is half of the car’s Blue Book value.”, Although you might both own the car, you probably don’t own everything inside the car together. For example, one person might pay for a snow shovel, windshield scraper, locking device, etc. You need to clarify in the car-sharing agreement who owns the separate property.


You could explain ownership this way: “Both parties agree that the following property will remain Jane’s: the snow shovel and windshield scraper.”You can also clarify that if one of you buys something for the car, it will remain the property of whoever bought it: “Once this agreement has been signed, Jane or Michael will retain ownership of any property they purchase for the car.”

, Decide on this ahead of time so that each owner will know where to get the car. You might want to park it regularly at someone’s house or apartment, or in a garage.


For example: “We will park the car at Jane’s apartment on Liverstone Drive.”, Be sure to put in writing the days each owner will use the car. Ideally, you will be as specific as possible so as to pre-empt any disagreement from arising later on.


“Jane will use the car Monday through Friday in the morning, from 6:00 am until 11:30 am. Jane will also have use of the car all day Saturday. Michael will use the car Monday through Friday, from 1:00 pm to 7:30 pm. Michael will also have use of the car on Sundays.”

, Inevitably, one of you will want to use the car to take a long trip. You should clarify the approval process. For example, you might require that the other owner give written permission. You could also require the person taking the trip to pay a rental fee.


For example, “If one owner wishes to use the car for a trip longer than two days, the person using the car will pay rent, in the amount of $75 a day, for the days the other owner would usually be able to use the car.”, Car owners must make many decisions regarding their cars, from selling the car to making major repairs. You should clarify who can make decisions. Often, you will want agreement from all owners:


“We agree to take part equally in making decisions about the car. Both of us must agree to sell or make expensive improvements or repairs. If we cannot both agree, then we will seek mediation.”, If you want to prevent the other owner from using the car in a certain way, you should specify. For example, you might want to prevent the owner from doing any of the following:


eating or drinking in the car
smoking in the car
transporting dogs or other animals
letting anyone sleep in the car
using the car for an illegal purpose

, There are regular costs associated with a car: registration, maintenance, and repairs. You should clarify how you want to divide the costs.For example, you might want to divide costs equally:


“We will divide the cost of registration, maintenance, and repairs equally. Any unforeseen costs will also be divided equally, unless one of us objects. In the absence of agreement, we will mediate the dispute.”

, You can decide to divide gas in a couple of ways. You might want to divide the cost 50-50, especially where you both drive the car an equal amount. Alternately, you could divide the amount in a lose proportion to how much you drive.


You could type, “We will keep receipts for purchases of gas and then divide the amount equally at the end of the month.”
Or, you could insert this provision: “Each of us will pay for whatever gas we use. Instead of keeping detailed records, we will try to purchase gas in proportion to the miles we drive. The car gets roughly 25 miles per gallon.”, You will need insurance on your car, and your car-sharing agreement should explain how you will divide premiums.State who you have a policy with: “We will carry insurance with Allstate.”
State the policy details: “Our policy will cover up to $250,000 per victim, $750,000 per accident, and $25,000 for property damage.”
Identify in whose name the policy will be listed: “Jane will be listed as the primary driver and Michael will be listed as the secondary driver.”
Also explain how you will divide the costs of the insurance: “We will each pay 50% of the insurance premiums. If one of us commits a driving infraction which increases the cost of the insurance, then that person will be responsible for the increase in the premiums.”

, This provision is necessary in case one owner gets in an accident. The owner who is at fault should reimburse the other owner for any expenses the other owner incurs. For example, if one owner totals the car, then the other owner may need to take taxis every day to work.


Sample language could read: “If one owner is involved in an accident for which he or she is at least partially at fault, then this owner will pay all insurance deductibles as well as indemnify and compensate the other owner for expenses related to the accident which are not covered by insurance. The owner at fault will also cover increases in the insurance premiums. However, if one owner is involved in an accident but is not at fault, then both owners will pay one-half of the deductible and any costs related to fixing the car.”, Sometimes, the owners cannot agree to something, such as whether to make a major repair. In this situation, you will need to resolve the dispute somehow. Your agreement should state the method, e.g., you will attend mediation.In mediation, you will explain your dispute to a neutral third party, the mediator, who will guide you to a solution you both can accept. Mediation is a good method for resolving disputes, especially where you intend to continue your relationship with the other party.
To include a mediation provision, insert language like the following: “Whenever a dispute arises which we cannot solve on our own through discussion, we will attend mediation at the Cook County mediation center.”

, At some point, one of you might want to terminate the car-sharing agreement. You should explain the process. Typically, termination will involve buying out the other person’s share of the car (if you co-own the car). However, there are other options.


“If one of us wants to stop sharing the car, we will consider the following options in order: (1) the other owner will keep the car and pay the departing owner half of the car’s value, according to Kelley Blue Book; (2) the departing owner will keep the car and pay the other owner half of the car’s value; (3) both owners will sell the car and divide the proceeds.”, If you end up going to court, then a court will have to interpret the agreement and order a resolution. You have the power to decide which state’s law you want to apply during the dispute. Generally, most people select the state where they live.


You can write, “This agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of .”, You want to state that the written agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties. This will prevent one of you from later claiming that you also had an oral side agreement which is not in the contract.


You should include this merger clause: “This agreement represents the entire agreement. No consent, waiver, modification, or change of terms shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. There are no agreements, understandings, or representations, either oral or written, not specified regarding this agreement.”, You should include a signature block for each person sharing the car. Include a line for:the date
signature
name
address

, To make it more official, you can sign the agreement in front of a notary. Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification to the notary. Typically, a valid driver’s license or passport will suffice.


Notaries can be found at most town or city offices, as well as at the courthouse. You can also find a notary near you by using the Locator at the website for the American Society of Notaries., Make sure that all parties to the agreement keep a signed copy. You can refer to it later on if a disagreement arises.

Wait for the new title to arrive.",How to Gift a Vehicle," This sounds obvious, but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner. To do that, you must have the title. The title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer, probably after you paid off all the loans.The title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle.


If you have lost your title certificate, you will need to get a replacement from your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Each state has a different procedure and fee for this. At http://www.dmv.org/replacing-a-lost-title.php you can find a handy map of the U.S. with contact information for the DMV in each state.;
, A lienholder is someone you borrowed money from, with the car as collateral. If you still owe them money, their name will appear on the title. Before you can give away the car, you must pay off all loans, and the lienholders must sign off on the title certificate that they have been paid., If the owner’s name on the title is someone who is deceased, and the gift is an inheritance, you may need to go to Probate Court to get an order for the transfer. Alternatively, in some states, it is possible to file a simple affidavit with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in order to take possession. You will need to check with your state law.If the car was owned jointly by a married couple, for example, and one dies and the remaining owner wants to give the car away as a gift, the surviving individual can, in most cases, transfer the car alone. A copy of the death certificate may be needed to accompany the title.

, The person giving the vehicle will be required to provide his or her signature, driver's license information and odometer information for the vehicle at the time of the gift. The person receiving the car must fill out the buyer portion of the title. Where the title asks for the sale price, you will fill in “Gift.”


Be careful when completing these steps. Many title certificates specify that the writing must be done cleanly and clearly, with no erasures or cross-outs. Even a simple printing error could require you to obtain a new copy of the title certificate and start over.

, If the lienholders have not yet already given you something to show that the loans are satisfied, you will need to have them sign off on the title as satisfied in full. If your loan was from a dealer, you will want to contact the lending department. If you obtained your loan from a bank or some other lending institution, then find your original loan paperwork. That will tell you who to contact for payoff information.

, In general, gifts between family members are freely allowed, and there would be no sales tax at the time of the transfer.However, each state’s laws are different and you should check with your own state. Some states may require proof of a family relationship for the gift to be tax-free.

, The person receiving the car will ordinarily have to demonstrate that he or she is covered by insurance before taking ownership. This is not exactly a concern for the person giving the gift, but the new owner, in order to drive the car, will have to get it insured and registered. The new owner's insurance company will usually issue the owner a card or letter to show proof of insurance., Some states will require the car to be inspected separately at the time of the transfer. Other states will not. You can check with your state's Department of Motor Vehicles to find out your requirements. In many states, this will require you to take the car to a licensed inspection station and undergo a safety inspection, emissions test, or other similar procedure.

, In most states, the person receiving the gift will have to take the completed documents to the Registry of Motor Vehicles. You will turn in the original title, with all the completed signatures, along with whatever fee may be required.

, This will be up to the new owner of the car. Registration is the procedure in all states that certifies that the car may be licensed and driven in the state. In many states, you can call the Registry ahead of time to make an appointment., As the recipient of a gift vehicle, you will need to receive a new title. The Registry will deliver this in your own name, usually within a couple weeks. When it arrives, check the new Certificate of Title to make sure that the information is all printed accurately. This document is your proof of ownership of the vehicle. If there are any errors, even if they appear minor (such as an incorrect middle initial, for example), these could cause trouble for you in the future. If you see any mistakes, notify the Registry of Motor Vehicles immediately. You will probably have to submit an application for a correction."
"
Call the police.,
Check with your insurance company.,
Contact the Registry of Motor Vehicles or your country's corresponding agency.",How to Find the Owner of a Vehicle1," Particularly if you witnessed any kind of accident, illegal behavior, or if your car was the victim of a hit-and-run incident, you should not attempt to locate the other driver on your own. Your best option is to notify the police with whatever information you can provide. If possible, you should try to provide them with:


The make and model of the car.
The car’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). If you have an opportunity to get close enough to the car, you can find the VIN on most cars by looking through the windshield at the bottom corner of the dashboard on the driver’s side.
The license plate number.
Any particular distinguishing features, such as unusual accessories, paint job, or damage to the car.;
, Your insurance company has resources available that you may not. If you are filing a claim, or even just investigating the possibility of a future claim, the insurance company may be able to identify the owner of the other car.

, If you can provide the Registry of Motor Vehicles with the license plate or VIN for a car, they will be able to use that information to identify the owner. They will probably not be allowed to give that information to you directly, but depending on why you need the information, they may be able to provide the information to some other appropriate person (your insurance agent, for example)."
"
Find the car’s VIN.,
Search the Internet for companies that will identify owners.,
Be cautious about using the results you get.",How to Find the Owner of a Vehicle2," If you have an opportunity to get close enough to the car, you can find the VIN on most cars by looking through the windshield at the bottom corner of the dashboard on the driver’s side., There are several sources online that will perform VIN reference checks. Most of these sources, particularly the ones that offer a free search, exist to help buyers of used cars check the history of the vehicle or to ensure that the vehicle has not been stolen.However, if you are willing to pay for the service, you may find some online search engines that will provide you with personal identification information, such as name, address and phone number.

, For privacy concerns, many online search sites are unlikely to provide you with as much information as you may want. Most VIN searches, especially the ones that are free, will let you know if a car has a history of being reported stolen or reported damaged, but they will not give you personal names or contact information. For an additional fee, you may be able to receive names of prior owners, but even then you need to be wary of the results. These search engines are only as accurate as information that is fed into public databases, and the ones that claim to be able to give you personal information about prior owners are usually less reputable.In fact, in the ""small print"" on some search sites, the search company itself warns that you should ""independently verify"" any information that you recover."
"
Check the title.,
Check the bill of sale.,
Consider using any available accident or insurance reports.",How to Find the Owner of a Vehicle3," If you are either the current owner and trying to find the person who sold you the car, or if you recently sold it and you are trying to find the new owner, you should have some paperwork that will help. As part of selling a car, the Certificate of Title should contain information that identifies both the seller and buyer of the car. If you kept a copy of this document (you should!), then you may be able to find the information you need quite easily., Another document that should be part of a vehicle sale is the bill of sale. In some states, the bill of sale is optional, and in some it is required. This would identify both the owner and seller.The bill of sale is not generally recorded with the registry. It is simply one of the documents that you may have kept if you were a party to the previous sale, and it might help you out in tracking down the buyer's name.

, If the car is one that you previously owned, and you are looking for a current owner, you may be able to dig up old records of any accident or insurance claims you may have filed in the past. These records, if you’re lucky, would probably contain the car’s VIN, which you can then search online.


Contact your insurance company for help locating any insurance related documents. If you don't have the records yourself, their record system may include information that can help you.

Place a newspaper ad to find someone local.,
Place a classified ad in a car magazine.,
Post on social media.",How to Find the Owner of a Vehicle5," This is not the most effective way to reach out to someone, but if you’re really serious about trying to find someone, and if you believe that person may be local to you, you could just run an ad in a local newspaper. Describe the type of car, the reason you are trying to find the person, and a safe way for him or her to contact you.

, If you are looking for the owner of a car that is likely to be a collectible item, or an antique, then you may wish to try this option. There are numerous magazines dedicated to car enthusiasts, and they would likely have a broader circulation than a local newspaper. Try placing a classified ad with a description of the car and driver you are hoping to locate, and include a safe way for him or her to contact you.


Be careful not to post too much private information about yourself. If you set up a meeting with the person you contact, keep it in an open, public location where you will be safe.

, The Internet reaches all over the world. Consider using sites like Facebook, CraigsList, or similar resources to make your search truly wide-reaching. Again, be careful not to put out too much personal information about yourself, and only arrange meetings in safe locations.


If available, you might consider posting a photo of the car in question. For example, suppose a car is illegally parked in your neighborhood, and you're trying to reach out to the owner. Posting a photo of the car on a neighborhood Facebook group might just catch someone's eye.

Identify the parties.,
Detail the date of the sale and the purchase price of the vehicle.,
Describe the vehicle.,

Draft any other information you want to include in the document.,
Leave space for signatures.,
Get the bill of sale notarized, if required.",How to Draft a Bill of Sale for a Vehicle1," After you buy a vehicle, you will need to fill out a bill of sale and submit it to the DMV, as part of the vehicle registration process, in order to prove you own the vehicle.If you are choosing to draft your own bill of sale, you will need to make sure it complies with your state's laws and regulations. States regulate these documents because they are used for official purposes (i.e., to register your vehicle).To find out if your state regulates bills of sale, conduct a general internet search for ""bill of sale regulations"". Look for government websites and links to statutes and regulatory guidance documents.
If you do not have permanent access to the internet, you can visit your local law library and ask for help. Law librarians are well-trained to help you find books and other materials on specific legal topics. When you get to the library, ask a librarian if they can help you find laws relating to vehicle registration and certificates of vehicle title. Let them know you are looking for information on bills of sale.;
, Once you find the applicable laws, look through them to determine what will have to be included in your bill of sale. This step is important and, if you miss a requirement, your bill of sale could be rejected by the DMV. While each state will have its own requirements, bills of sale will generally have to have at least the following information:The date of the sale
A description of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, VIN, and manufacture year)
Your name and address (as the buyer)
The seller's signature and address.

, After compiling a list of all the things that need to be included in a bill of sale, you can start drafting. If at all possible, use a computer. Start by giving your document a title (e.g., ""Bill of Sale""). Directly beneath the title, write an introduction that gives context to the document and presents the transaction that took place.


For example, your introduction might state, ""Seller is selling, transferring, and delivering the below vehicle to Buyer."", Within the introduction, or directly after, you need to define who the buyer is and who the seller is. These are the parties to the bill of sale so they need to be described in as much detail as possible. While every state will have different requirements, you should always include:The seller's full name, address, and phone number.
The buyer's (your) full name, driver license number, address, and phone number.

, The next sentence of your bill of sale should describe the sale that has taken place. You need to include at least the date the vehicle was purchased and the price you paid to purchase it.


If the vehicle was gifted to you, you need to state this. In addition, you should indicate what the parties perceive the value of the gift to be (i.e., how much you think the car is worth)., In a new paragraph, the car needs to be described in enough detail that the DMV can accurately link the particular bill of sale to the vehicle you are trying to register in your name. If the vehicle description is too vague, the DMV will not be able to process your bill of sale for registration purposes. While each state will require different information, you should always try to include the vehicle's:Make
Model
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
Model year
Year of manufacture
Type of body (e.g., pickup, sedan, SUV)
Number of cylinders

, Federal and state laws require the seller to disclose an accurate odometer reading to you when they transfer ownership of the vehicle. Because the transfer document is usually a bill of sale, this is where the odometer disclosure usually takes place. In addition to leaving space for the seller to write in the odometer reading, you should also include a certification for the seller to sign or initial, which will state that the odometer reading is accurate.


For example, you might draft a provision that states, ""Seller certifies that the odometer reading is , and that this reading reflects the actual mileage. Providing a false statement may result in Seller being fined and/or imprisoned."", Depending on the complexity of your transaction, you may choose to include other information in your bill of sale. Commonly, sellers and buyers will agree to certain warranties, which are promises and assurances about the history of the vehicle and its condition.


In addition, some bills of sale are drafted and provided to a lender as security for a loan. If you are in this scenario, your bill of sale will need to include language making it clear that it will not become effective unless you default on your loan. For example, this type of provision might be necessary if you ask a bank for a loan and the bank requires you to use your car as collateral on that loan., At the bottom of the bill of sale, make sure you leave lines where both you and the seller can sign and date the agreement. While most states only require the seller to actually sign the bill of sale, it is always good practice to have the buyer sign as well., If your state requires you to get bills of sale notarized, you will need to hold off on signing the agreement until you are in front of a notary.Notaries can be found at most banks, law offices, and even a lot of nonprofit organizations. Once in front of a notary, you and the seller will sign the bill of sale and the notary will acknowledge the signatures.

"
"
Obtain a bill of sale form.,
Fill out the required information.,
Add an addendum if you need to include additional information.,
Have each party sign the bill of sale.,
Give the original bill of sale to the buyer.,
Keep a copy for your records.",How to Draft a Bill of Sale for a Vehicle2," In most circumstances, you will be able to fill out a simple bill of sale form instead of drafting one from scratch. State DMVs and transportation departments will usually make forms available that include all of the required information. Talk with the vehicle's seller and determine who will obtain the bill of sale form. If you need to get the form, you can do so in the following ways:


First you can navigate to your state's DMV website and download the form from there. Generally, every state will have a place online where you can find forms. Look for the vehicle bill of sale form.
If you do not have consistent access to the internet, you can call your local DMV office and ask them to send the bill of sale form to you.
If you are near your DMV, you can visit the office in person and pick up a bill of sale form as well.

, Once you get a copy of your applicable bill of sale form, you will need to fill it out with the seller of the vehicle. Work through the form and fill out everything accurately and completely. Do not leave anything blank unless the form says it is acceptable. While each state form will differ in substance and layout, they will all usually ask for at least the following information:The vehicle's description
The names of the buyer and seller
The date the transaction took place
How much the vehicle was sold for
Whether the vehicle transfer was a gift
The seller's address and contact information
The buyer's address
The seller's signature

, If your state has a form, it may not include all of the information you want to include. If this happens, you can usually attach a piece of paper, known as an addendum, to the bill of sale form. Some states may even have certain addendum forms for particular situations. For example, in Vermont, if the vehicle you are buying is nine years old or newer, you and the seller must attach an odometer disclosure statement. This statement asks the seller to certify the vehicle's mileage and it must be signed by you and the seller., After you fill out the bill of sale and all required or discretionary addendums, you and the seller need to sign in the necessary places. Most states only require the seller to sign the bill of sale, but both parties might do it anyway. Additionally, you and/or the seller may have to sign one or more addendums. Make sure you read the form directions carefully so every party signs the in the correct places.

, The bill of sale is not only a document that evidences the sale of a vehicle, it is also an official document that must be submitted to the state. Therefore, you (the buyer) will need to obtain the original bill of sale once it has been filled out. This original document will need to be filed with the DMV when you register the vehicle in your name.

, Before you file the bill of sale, make copies for the seller and yourself. This document is your main piece of evidence proving a transfer took place. You will need it in case there is a dispute between you and the other party.

You are only allowed to have one driver license of any kind at a time. Having more than one can result in fines or jail time.If you have a valid CDL from another state, you may apply for a New York CDL at a DMV office.

Class C vehicles are vehicles that are designed to transport at least 16 passengers. Buses and any vehicle that requires hazardous materials placards are also Class C.

, In agreement with Federal regulations, New York DMV has two categories for CDLs: Interstate Commerce and Intrastate Commerce. These categories help determine which type of CDL you are eligible for. Failure to correctly state which type of commerce you intend to drive could mean you lose your license.Interstate commerce means that you drive a Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) from one state to another state, or from one state into a foreign country.
Intrastate means that you will drive a CMV only within the state of New York.
If the cargo you’re driving began or will end its journey in another state or foreign country, you must select Interstate commerce.

, There are two statuses for CDL holders in New York: Excepted and Non-Excepted. Drivers who fall under the Excepted commerce category are exempt from needing a medical certification (see Step 4). Non-Excepted commerce drivers must provide a medical certification.Excepted (EI or EA) commerce categories are usually restricted to the transport of people and farm goods, such as farm machinery, supplies, and crops. A full list of the Excepted driving activities is available from the New York DMV here.
Non-Excepted (NI or NA) commerce categories include all other driving purposes than the ones listed under the Excepted category.
If you drive for both Excepted and Non-Excepted activities, you must select Non-Excepted.

If you have never held a commercial driver license before, the New York DMV strongly recommends that you find professional training before you apply for a CDL.

It will include your driving history and will note if your license is under suspension. It can also let you know whether there are inaccuracies on your record that you should resolve (such as a traffic ticket that you successfully contested). Depending on your state, you may be able to order your driving record online, over the phone, by mail, and/or in person. Check with your local DMV office to find out how they offer access to your driving record.


Some states allow you to order a copy of your driving record online. Most states charge a small fee for obtaining your driving record (usually between $5-$15). Always visit your state’s official DMV/DDS website. The official web portal of the US Government lists each state’s official DMV/DDS website here. Remember, most official government websites end in “.gov” in the United States, although some -- such as Oklahoma’s Department of Public Safety -- end in “.us”. Going through the official government portal will ensure you get to the right website.

Never enter your personal information on a website that says it will give you a copy of your driving record for free. Official websites do not require “sign-up” fees, either. Websites that offer “free” driving record copies or require “sign-up” or other “service” fees are usually phishing scams intended to access your personal information.
Some states require you to appear in person at the DMV office to get a copy of your driving record. Bring proper photo identification and the fee (which will vary by state).
Some states allow you to order a copy of your driving record by mail. Fill out a form (which you can get online or at a local DMV office) and include a photocopy of your driver’s license and the fee.;
, A DMV representative will usually be able to tell you if your license is valid or suspended. He or she may also be able to tell you why your license has been suspended and what you need to do to reinstate it.


Sometimes, you must go to the DMV in person to get this information. However, many states have an online service that will tell you if your license is suspended. Check your state’s DMV or DDS website for their regulations.

, In most states, suspension notices will be mailed to you. If your address is currently on file with the appropriate agency (such as the Department of Public Safety or Department of Licensing), you should have received a letter with details of your suspension.


In many cases, these letters will also include a hearing request form. You can return this form if you wish to request a hearing to argue against the suspension.

, There are several reasons why your driver license might be suspended. Common reasons include repeat violations (excessive speeding, reckless driving, etc.), serious violations (such as DUI/DWI), and unpaid fines. However, these are not the only reasons to suspend a license. Even if none of these reasons apply to you, you may want to investigate and make sure your license is not suspended.It's possible that inaccuracies on your driving record can cause a suspension that should not have happened. For example, if your record reflects tickets that you didn’t get, your license might be suspended.

, Most states have a point system that assigns a certain number of points to each moving violation (traffic violations that occur while the vehicle is moving, such as running a stop light or speeding).If you reach the maximum number of allowed points, your license will be suspended for a predetermined amount of time.The number of days that your license is suspended is usually determined by the number of points on your record. For example, in Alabama, 12-14 points within a 2-year period results in a suspension of 60 days, but 24+ points within a 2-year period results in a suspension of 365 days.Usually, you won’t get a suspension for a single moving violation. However, if a driver commits certain serious traffic offenses – such as speeding 15 or more miles per hour above the posted limit, or reckless driving – multiple times within a certain time period, many states will suspend the driver’s license.

, In most states, some serious driving offenses, such as driving while intoxicated, will immediately suspend your license.Other offenses that usually result in immediate suspension include:


Vehicular homicide
Felonies involving a motor vehicle
Leaving the scene of an accident
Evading the police

, If you're pulled over or involved in an accident, you will be asked to show proof of insurance. Not having valid proof of insurance can result in a suspended license. If you were pulled over or in an accident and couldn't show proof of insurance, your license may have been suspended.


If you’ve left your proof of insurance at home, check with your DMV office to see if your state allows you to bring the proof of insurance to the DMV before your license is suspended.

, When your license is suspended, you cannot legally drive for the period of suspension. If you’re caught driving with a suspended license, you may incur serious penalties. These could include additional suspension time, heavy fines, and even jail time. Check with your state’s DMV to learn the full rules.


Some states, such as Florida, require you to turn in your license to the DMV following a suspension.If your state requires you to turn in your license, the mandated suspension period will not start until you do so. In other words, if your license is suspended for 60 days but you don’t turn in your license for 30 days, the 60-day suspension period will not start until you turn in your license. However, your license would still be suspended for the 30 days before you turned it in. Having the license in your possession does not mean you can legally drive.
Failure to turn in your license when required to do so usually results in an extended suspension period.

, In many cases, you are entitled to a hearing where you can appeal your license suspension. For example, in Washington you will be sent a hearing request form with the suspension notification letter. You can complete it and mail it in to request a hearing.In other cases, there may be special forms or procedures you need to take care of in order to request a hearing. There are several reasons why you might request a hearing.For example, if you believe the violations on your driving record should not have been issued, you should use the hearing to explain why.
You could argue financial hardship by showing that if you’re unable to drive to work you might lose your job.
You can also discuss the facts of any traffic accidents. For example, some states will assign points to your license for any traffic accident, regardless of fault. Providing details, such as from your auto insurance company or an accident report, that show the accident was not your fault may persuade the hearing officer that your license should not be suspended.

, If your license was suspended because of an alcohol-related offense, you can usually appeal the suspension. To find out details and specifics about appealing, visit or call your state’s DMV office.


Keep in mind that appealing the DMV’s decision to suspend your license does not affect any civil or criminal case against you stemming from the incident.
In many cases, these appeals cost substantial fees (for example, in Georgia, appealing a DUI suspension costs $150).These appeals must usually be made within a certain time-frame after the suspension. Check with your local DMV office for your states’ regulations.

, In some states, you may be able to reinstate your license if you complete traffic school or a state-approved defensive driving course. Check with your state’s DMV or similar department for their policy.If your license was suspended due to a points violation, you may usually reinstate your license by completing traffic school or a defensive driving course.

, In some states, you may be eligible to apply for a “hardship license” even if your driver’s license has been suspended. These licenses are temporary. They are only meant for you to be able to do necessary driving, such as to and from work or to go buy groceries.In some cases, an “ignition interlock device” may be installed in your car if you get a hardship license. These are usually for alcohol-related suspensions and will not allow your car to start if you’re intoxicated., If your license was suspended for a specific amount of time, for example 60 days, you must wait until that suspension period has completed before you can apply to reinstate your license.


Remember that if you must turn in your license, your official suspension period will not start until you comply.

, You can’t just begin driving again after the suspension period is over. You must complete certain requirements to officially reinstate your license before you can legally drive. These requirements will differ by state, so check with your state’s DMV to learn what you have to do to reinstate your license.

, In most states, you will need to pay a fee to have your license reinstated. The amount of this fee varies dramatically. If you live in a state that requires you to turn in your license, you must usually also pay a fee to get a new license made.


For example, in Massachusetts, the reinstatement fee is $100.In Minnesota, it is only $20.The fee may also vary depending on why your license was suspended. if your license was suspended for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or for criminal activity involving a vehicle, the fee will probably be much higher than for other suspensions.

, Most states require you to do things like complete traffic school or participate in a substance abuse education program as part of your suspension. If you were required to do anything like this, you’ll need to provide documentation that you fulfilled the requirements.


Make a copy of your documentation for your records. Sometimes, records can get lost, and you will want to be sure that you can prove you completed all the requirements.

, Most states require you to fill in and submit an “SR-22” form to reinstate your license. The SR-22 form certifies that you carry at least the minimum auto insurance required by your state.In most states, you will need to have your insurance provider submit this form directly to the the DMV or other agency.


Most states require these forms to be filed for 3 years. If you’re accident-free for that period, you will not need to continue filing the SR-22.

, Depending on the terms of your suspension, you may need to comply with other requirements to reinstate your license. Make sure that you complete all certifications, education programs, etc. before you apply to reinstate your license.


For example, if your suspension was the result of a DUI, you may pay all of your court costs and fines before you can reinstate your license.

You will need a valid license to obtain your IDP. It is also necessary to have one when using your IDP in Japan.
Understand that an IDP is only a temporary solution. You cannot drive in Japan indefinitely with only an IDP; you may need to eventually obtain a Japanese driver's license, especially if you plan on staying in Japan for more than one year.;
, You can only obtain an IDP from the American Automobile Association (AAA) or the American Automobile Touring Alliance (AATA) within the United States.You must secure your IDP from either source before leaving for Japan.
You can only obtain a valid IDP from these two sources. Others who claim to offer IDPs are not authorized by the U.S. Department of State; therefore, an IDP purchased from such a source will not be valid.

, Go to either the AAA or AATP website and print an official application for your IDP. Answer all questions accurately and completely.


The forms can be found online.

AAA: http://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html

http://www.thenac.com/international_driving_permit.pdf


You'll need to provide your full name, home address, U.S. driver's license details, birth date and place, and phone number. You must also indicate where you plan to go and when, along with the type of vehicle you plan to drive.

, You will need to send your completed application to the AAA or AATP, depending on which application you filled out. You also need to include a few other necessary documents and a fee.


Your application must be accompanied by two original color passport photos, a signed photocopy of the front and back of your U.S. driver's license, and your payment.
As of 2014, the cost of the IDP was $15, plus shipping and handling fees.
Send your AAA application to your nearest AAA office, which can be located by using the online search tool: http://www.aaa.com/locations/

Alternatively, send your AAA application to the organization's headquarters at:

AAA/IDP
1000 AAA Drive
Heathrow, FL 32746
Attn: Mail Stop #28


Send your AATP application to:

National Automobile Club
Attn: IDP
373 Vintage Park Drive, Suite E
Foster City, CA 94404



, The AAA or AATP should send your IDP to the mailing address written on your application within four to six weeks.


If you pay extra for express shipping and handling, however, you may receive your IDP sooner than that.
Note that you must have your IDP with you before you can drive in Japan. Simply filing the application is not enough.

, Under most circumstances, you can use your IDP to drive in Japan for 12 months. After a year passes, however, you will need to obtain a Japanese driver's license.


If you plan on staying in Japan for a short visit, there is no restriction on how early you must receive your IDP. If you want to stay longer and attempt to renew your IDP back in the U.S. every 12 months, you must wait at least three months after renewing your IDP before re-entering Japan., You must obtain a Japanese driver's license if you stay in Japan for more than one year and plan to drive, but you must also meet basic eligibility requirements to start the licensing process.You must have a valid U.S. driver's license, and you must have been a resident of the United States for at least three months after the U.S. driver's license was issued.
You will also need to be 18 years of age or older.
It is also required for you to possess a valid visa to stay in Japan, and you must be registered as a foreign resident at the local Japanese city, town, or ward office.

, You cannot present your U.S. driver's license to the officials at the license center. You'll need to have an official translation of your license, which can be obtained from the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF).Bring a completed application form, a photocopy of your residence card, and your original U.S. driver's license to your nearest JAF translation office. Pay the 3000 yen fee when you submit your documents.
You may receive your translated license the same day or you may wait as long as three weeks.
Locate the nearest JAF office here: http://www.jaf.or.jp/inter/entrust/index_e.htm

Download the application here: http://www.jaf.or.jp/inter/translation/pdf/pdf_apli_english.pdf


, Bring your translated U.S. driver's license and passport to the nearest license testing center.


Locate the nearest license center here: http://www.japandriverslicense.com/dl-centers.asp

Once you arrive at the center, present your documents for inspection.
If you are determined to be eligible, the testing process will begin.
If you are not eligible, you will be sent away with instructions regarding any additional materials you need to present.

, Officials at the license testing center will perform a basic vision and hearing test.


The vision test also includes a color recognition check.

, The written test is fairly brief and mostly consists of true or false questions. Grading will be done immediately, and you must answer 70 percent of the questions correctly to pass.Grading should be completed within one to two hours. You will only be informed of your overall result and will not be told which questions were answered correctly.
If you fail the test, you will need to return another day to retake it.
A sample test can be found here: http://www.japandriverslicense.com/test1.asp


, If you pass the written test, you will need to take a driving test. This exam will be performed on an enclosed course at the license center.


You will be notified of whether you pass or fail immediately.

, If you have successfully passed all of you driving exams, your Japanese driver's license will be issued to you on the same day.


Before receiving your license, you will need to pay any associated fees. The officials at the license center will also take your photograph.

, Once you have your driver's license, you will need to carry it with you whenever you drive in Japan.


Failure to present your license when you are stopped by traffic authorities or are involved in an accident can result in fines and other negative consequences.

, Instead of driving on the right side of the road like you would do in the United States, you must drive on the left side of the road when you're in Japan.


When you are making a right turn, you must yield to other vehicles driving straight or making left turns.

, Japan has green lights, yellow lights, red lights, arrows, and flashing lights.


Green means go. You can drive straight, turn left, or turn right at a green light.
When you see a yellow light, you must not move further than the stopping point. If you cannot stop safely, however, you may proceed through a yellow light.
Stop at a red light. If there is a green arrow light beneath the red light, however, you can turn in the direction of the arrow, but do not drive turn if the arrow is yellow.
When you spot a flashing yellow light, proceed cautiously. When you see a flashing red light, stop briefly at the stopping point before driving through.

, Speed limits are described in kilometers per hour (km/h) and are usually posted along the road.


Typically, speed limits range between 80 and 100 km/h (62 mph) on expressways, 40 km/h (25 mph) in urban areas, 30 km/h (19 mph) on side streets, and 50 to 60 km/h (31 to 37 mph) anywhere else.
If you are on a public road with no traffic sign, the speed limit will be 60 km/h (37 mph). When you're on an expressway with no sign, it will be 100 km/h (62 mph)., Traffic signs will be posted along the road where they are needed. In rural areas, these signs will only be written in Japanese. When you're on a major road, however, some signs may also be written in English.


It is strongly recommended that you memorize the common traffic sign symbols before driving in Japan.
Note that many of the signs you'll see in Japan will be similar to those you would see in the United States, but there are a few differences.
In particular, you need to familiarize yourself with the appearance of stop signs. A stop sign looks like a red inverted triangle. The word ""Stop"" will be written on it in Japanese.
You can review a full listing of Japanese road signs here: http://www.japandriverslicense.com/japanese-road-signs.asp


, You'll need to stop at red lights, stop signs, and railroad crossings


When you reach a stop sign, stop at the or before the adjacent stop line and yield to vehicles traveling on the intersecting road before moving again.
Stop at the stop line before driving through a railroad crossing. Check for a train before driving through.

, Only park in areas designated for parking. Do not park when you see a ""no parking"" traffic sign.


A ""no parking"" traffic sign looks like a blue circle with a red border. A red line passes diagonally from the upper left to the lower right. If you see an ""x"" instead of the single line, it is a ""no parking or stopping"" sign.
Like the United States, parking lots in the center of large cities tend to be expensive. Fees decrease as the population becomes less dense, and parking is typically free in the countryside.

, Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal, and the penalties for breaking this law can be very strict.


If alcohol is detected by a formal breath test, you can be imprisoned for three years or may face fines as great as 500,000 yen. If you injure or kill someone while driving under the influence, you can be imprisoned for 15 years.

, If you own a car while staying in Japan, you will need to pay various fees ad meet other requirements.


Light cars, also called keisha cars, are smaller and less costly. Regular cars are standard size and cost more to own overall. Keisha cars have yellow license plates and regular cars have white license plates.
Your car will need to undergo a safety inspection every two to three years.
Expect to pay annual automobile taxes.
You also need to factor in the cost of mandatory insurance, secondary insurance, parking fees, toll expressways, and gasoline.

, There are both full service and self service stations in Japan.


An attendant will put fuel in your car at a full service station. Since you'll need to speak with him, you should know some basic Japanese before stopping there.
You will need to fill your own tank at a self service station. The menu instructions are usually in Japanese only, so you'll need to know the language before stopping there, too.

, If you are caught making a minor traffic violation, you will receive a blue traffic violation ticket and a fine payment bill.


You should pay the fine within eight days to avoid criminal prosecution.
If you do not pay the fine within eight days, you will need to appear at a notification center. You will receive a notice for payment and must pay the fine within 11 days after receiving this notice.
If you fail to pay the fine within 11 days after receiving a notice for payment of the fine, you will be summoned to appear in court.

, If you get into a traffic accident, dial 110 to contact the police and 119 to call for an ambulance.


If you only need roadside assistance, call the Japan Automobile Federation.

Make sure you are authorized to request the report.,
Collect the identifying information.,
Obtain a request form from your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.,
Apply online, if available.,
Be prepared to pay a fee.",How to Conduct a Motor Vehicle Report Review for Prospective Employees1," Each state has its own set of laws and regulations that control who may see a driver’s motor vehicle report. The driver himself may, of course, request the report. Therefore, as an employer or prospective employer, you could require employees or prospective employees to obtain their own reports and then present them to you. Alternatively, you will have to check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to find out if you are authorized.


For example, in Oklahoma, only certain categories of requests may be allowed by someone other than the driver himself. These include insurance companies, licensed private investigators, or employers if the employee uses a commercial driver’s license (CDL) in his or her employment.Michigan, by contrast, has a longer list of individuals who may request another person’s motor vehicle report. The list consists of thirteen different categories and does allow for employers to check the reports of their employees. However, this allowance is only to check for fraud and not for making employment decisions.The Commonwealth of Kentucky will allow a record request by anyone for any purpose, as long as you can demonstrate that you have the permission of the person whose report you are requesting.;
, Whether you are going to apply on paper or online, you will need the same basic information from your prospective employee. Each state is different, but most states request the same basic information in order to provide a motor vehicle record report. As part of your hiring process, you should ask for the following information from your applicant:name (legal name and any alias)
address
sex
date of birth
height
weight
driver’s license number
license plate number
car’s VIN
social security number, or last four digits (this will depend on your state’s requirements)A signed authorization for you to conduct a motor vehicle record search. You can accomplish this by including a statement like, “I authorize ____ to request a motor vehicle records report on my behalf,” and then have the prospective employee sign.

, Most states will require employers to submit requests in writing. You can generally obtain a copy of the request form either online or from your state’s driver’s license offices.


For example, Georgia uses a “Request for Motor Vehicle Report MVR)” form, which is available online at https://dds.georgia.gov/sites/dds.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/dds-18.pdf. You may also get a paper copy of the form by visiting any state driver’s license customer service center., Some states will allow an immediate motor vehicle check online. However, in many states, the online application is only available to the individual driver. An employer or prospective employer making the request will usually have to submit a request in writing.


The state of Arizona, for example, has an online service to view the report immediately. However, as part of the application process, you must check a box that certifies that “I am the above listed person.” This suggests that this service is available only to the driver alone or with the driver’s permission., States charge a range of fees for motor vehicle reports. These charges may be as low as a few dollars or could be $25 to $50. The cost may vary from state to state or may also depend on whether you wish to get an unofficial report or a certified copy, which is likely to cost more.


If you are requesting the report online, you will need a credit card available at the time of making the request.In Kentucky, as an example, you may only request reports by mail. The fee is $3, which must be paid by check or money order.North Carolina allows online requests, with a fee to be paid by credit card. The fee for an unofficial report is $10, while the fee for a certified official report is $14."

Decide if you want to conduct a national check.,
Develop your own written request form.,
Finalize the request letter.,
Submit the request and wait for your report.,
Send your applicant to the local DMV as an alternative.,
Interpret the results of the national report.",How to Conduct a Motor Vehicle Report Review for Prospective Employees2," The National Driver Registry (NDR) contains nationwide driver information, maintained by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. If you operate a business that will employ drivers across state lines (trucking and delivery for example), you may want to verify a driver’s record in this way, rather than just from a single state.The NDR report does not include all details about a driver’s history. It will tell you if a driver has had his or her license suspended, revoked or denied for cause, from any state. This can help you in the case of a driver whose license may have been suspended in one state, but he or she presents you with a license from another state.

, The NDR does not have a specific application form. The NDR requires requests in writing, in the form of a letter. If you will be conducting multiple requests, you should develop your own standard form letter, which you can use repeatedly. The form should provide your name, address and reason for the request. You should state that you are requesting a report from the Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) for a prospective employee, and it should include the following details about the driver in question:full legal name
address
email address
state and driver’s license number
social security number
sex
height
weight
eye color

, End with an authorization statement. This should be a statement to the effect of, “I authorize this request of my driving record.” Then there should be a space for the applicant to sign the letter. You will need to get the applicant's signature notarized. The NDR will only accept requests with notarized signatures. If you do not have a notary available in your office, you will have to arrange to visit a notary each time that you wish to perform such a review., Send the notarized request to National Driver Register, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., NVS-422, Washington, DC 20590. There is no fee for this request. The NDR says that they will attempt to reply to all requests within 15 days. However, they note that requests are dealt with on a first come-first served basis, so they do not guarantee the timing., Instead of requesting the PDPS report by mail, employers of motor vehicle and mass transit operators may instruct applicants to visit the local DMV. The employee should ask for a PDPS check of his or her record and then return that report to you., The NDR report does not include all the details of a driver’s history. The NDR report will present one of the following four responses regarding the driver:No match. This means that the individual does not have a record on file in the PDPS system. In most cases, this is a positive result, which should mean that the driver has a valid license. However, if the identification information was incorrect or if the applicant changed his identification at any time, then you could get a “No Match” response.
Licensed (LIC). This response means that the driver has a valid license in the state noted and is eligible to drive. However, if LIC appears on the report, this means that the driver’s license was at one time suspended or revoked and has been reinstated. A report of LIC is not as positive as a “No Match” response.
Eligible (ELG). This response indicates that the driver’s privilege to drive or apply for a license in the noted state is valid.
Not Eligible (NELG). This response means that the driver’s privilege to drive in the noted state is invalid.

Determine how much you can spend.,
Identify what you need the car for.,
Research which types of car you can afford.,
Review used car prices in Blue Book.,
Create a budget.",How to Buy a Car with Bad Credit1," It is important to plan ahead of time how much you can comfortably afford to pay for the car each month. This will help you get the best deal while negotiating. Understand that if you have bad credit, you may have to pay more per month, so you may want to make sure that you can afford a new car.

First you will need to calculate your total monthly income. Subtract your current fixed expenses, such as rent, utilities, average, and insurance. Try to estimate discretionary expenses too, such as how much you spend on entertainment.
After calculating this, take whatever income is left, and see how much of that you can pay each month for car payments. Remember to include the cost of car insurance, fuel, and other vehicle maintenance into this cost.;
, How you will use the car will help you determine what car you need. This will make it easier find the right car for the right price. Consider your lifestyle and needs.

If you have a family with children, you may need a sedan with four doors. A hatchback or station wagon may also be useful. If you are single, you may be able to get away with a cheaper two-door coupe.
If you need to commute long distances, you should look for a car with more fuel-efficiency.
If you haul large loads, such as construction materials, you may need to look into getting a truck.

, Start researching cars in your budget. Identify the make (the company that makes the car), model, and year of each car that fits your budget and lifestyle. Try to find different options so that you can look for the best deal.

Look for reliable makes and models. Read reviews online, and compare cars so that you do not end up paying for expensive repairs or maintenance later on.

, If you want a used car, start looking at car prices in the Blue Book. The Blue Book will tell you how much particular makes, models, and years of cars are worth. This will help you make an informed decision when you buy a car and prevent you from paying too much., Once you have identified what type of car you need and can afford, you can start saving up for it. Assume a maximum of 36 months of payments plus 20% down payment and closing costs. Even before you find the right car, start putting aside money every month so that you can afford to buy the car when the time comes."
"
Save up cash for a down payment.,
Ask family and friends for help.,
Be prepared when you visit lenders.,
Go to your local credit union.,
Talk to a local bank.,
Contact a national bank.,
Look online.",How to Buy a Car with Bad Credit2," No matter what lender you end up using, paying the largest down payment you can afford is always smart. Even small down payments--$500, for instance—can make a difference in the terms of the loan you end up with.If you don't need a car right away, it might be best to forgo getting a loan altogether, and just pay cash for an older car instead.

, Friends and family may be able to help you afford a new car. Perhaps they can loan you money to help with the down payment, or perhaps they would be willing to co-sign your loan. Reach out to your family to see if there is anyone who is willing and able to help.

Remember that if a family member or friend co-signs and you default, they are responsible for the loan. This can severely damage your relationship with them.

, When you're visiting a lender, come with your documents in hand. Every lender needs to see several pay stubs, proof of identity (like a driver’s license), and proof of residency (like an electric bill in your name). Although they might need additional documents, those are typical, and you'll probably be able to get a good idea of what they'd lend you with those alone.It’s not that any one of these things changes your credit score, how much you have to spend, or much of anything on your end. What it does change is how they look at you. Someone who is prepared is more likely to get a fair deal than a person who seems hapless and disorganized.

, Since credit unions are not-for-profit, they typically charge lower interest rates on loans than banks do. Although some credit unions lend to nonmembers, members typically get preferential treatment. Since it’s easier than ever to become a member of a credit union, they should be your first option for loans.Not only will a credit union typically have a lower interest rate (an average of 2% compared to 4% on auto loans), they will also be more likely to take your unique circumstances into account, and see you as a more than a credit score.
Of course, there is a trade-off. Since credit unions aren’t trying to make a profit, they charge lower rates. Since they charge lower rates, their profit margins aren’t as high. So they do have to be cautious about lending to too many debtors in the subprime category. So think about it this way: if your credit is mediocre to poor, you might have a shot at getting a loan at a credit union. If it’s through the floor, you’re going to struggle.

, Most local banks are not going to be able to match the interest rate you’ll find at credit union, but that doesn’t mean they won’t have their advantages. A local bank is likely to be able to offer a few things a larger bank can’t. For example:Fewer fees and lower interest rates than the larger banks. Larger banks will have technological and logistical advantages over smaller community banks and credit unions, but the network of ATMs, cutting edge apps, and a branch on every block all cost money.
A local bank is less likely to be as rigid as a national bank. While they probably won’t be as flexible as a credit union, they will in fact be more able and willing to lend to a person rather than a credit score.
A local bank is also just a bit more likely to write a smaller loan for an older car than a large bank would be, which can really be ideal for someone who’s looking to minimize their car payment.

, While credit unions and local banks will be more flexible with respect to lending generally, don't forget about bigger banks. National banks are a big part of the conversation when it comes to lending to people with bad credit, and with good reason. Certain national lenders have a large presence in the subprime auto loan market, and they lend a lot of money that puts a lot of people on the road.For example, Wells Fargo and Capital One Auto are two of the biggest players in the subprime auto loan market, and two of the biggest banks, period. If you’re having trouble getting financing from more low interest lenders, take a look at these guys. They might charge higher interest rates than a credit union, but they won’t be as high as some of the online lenders.

, Online lenders are a pretty mixed bag. Whereas some lenders, like OneMain, have a decent reputation, others, like Santander, have anything but. Regardless, they are flourishing at the moment, and subprime buyers are making up the largest segment of auto lending. You can very well find some good deals, but you might end up getting fleeced as well. This is one area where you have to do your homework even more than usual.There's no one place you can go to get reputable, unbiased reviews of every single online lender in one place. Before you apply, you're just going to have to investigate their reviews and reputation. A good place to start is the Better Business Bureau, but that's not going to give detailed information about the bank as a lender, but rather as a business in general. If an online lender has anything other than an A rating from the BBB, look elsewhere.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be another good resource for research. That agency regulates financial entities as they relate to the public, so you could find out if a lender was under investigation or had a large number of complaints.

Consider bank or lender repossessions.,
Consider private sellers.,
Buy from reputable dealers.,
Get a vehicle history report.",How to Buy a Car with Bad Credit3," Buying a car that has been repossessed by the bank can sometimes save you between 25 and 40% of the car’s cost. Keep in mind that you cannot have a mechanic check these cars beforehand, so you may end up buying a lemon. Still, if you’re willing to take the risk, you can research local auctions or look online for dealers.Repo cars are sold as-is. The car may have maintenance issues that you will need to address.

, You can buy a used car from its former owner if you are willing to take on the paperwork yourself. You can usually save quite a bit of money this way. Look in your local newspaper or online for people selling cars in your area. You might also ask around your social network to see if anyone is thinking of selling their car.

Private sellers may be more willing to negotiate on the price of the car. Don’t be afraid to haggle.
Remember that when you buy a car from a private seller, you have no legal recourse if there is something wrong with the car. You are responsible for filling out the paperwork yourself.
Always get a VIN history report on any car that you buy from a private seller. It is also highly recommended to have a mechanic check the car out before you purchase it., Usually, the most reputable dealerships in a given area will be franchise dealerships and national chains like CarMax. A franchise dealership is a dealership with the sole license to sell new models of a certain make within a geographic territory, like ""Smith GMC,"" or ""Jones Cadillac."" Franchise dealerships always have an inventory of used cars they've acquired from trade-ins, so it's best to start there.


After you've looked at franchise dealerships and national chains, try smaller dealerships who use bank/credit union financing, and sell higher mileage used cars. However, stay away from dealerships acting as their own lenders (buy here, pay here lots). Even though they might have some attractive sticker prices, they are notorious for selling lemons, concealing damage, and all sorts of other things.Step 4. Get a vehicle history report

, Make sure you check the vehicle’s history before you buy it. Carfax is the most famous of all the services conducting vehicle history reports, but https://www.vehiclehistory.com/ offers the same service for free.You’ll want to watch out and see if the car’s ever been wrecked, declared a total loss, had flood damage, is a salvage title, or ever had the odometer tampered with. If it has, it’s probably a car you want to avoid.

"
"
Negotiate price with the seller.,
Consider dealer financing if available.,
Ask for a mechanic inspection before closing.,
Complete the purchase.,
Buy the required insurance.",How to Buy a Car with Bad Credit4," Once you’ve been pre-approved by the lender, you'll know what you can spend. But there's no reason to share that information with the dealer. If you walk in saying you've been pre-approved for $15,000, you'll probably end up spending $15,000. Instead, try and do all the negotiation you can beforehand.


If you think you’ll be tempted to show it to the salesmen, don’t come to the dealer with your pre-approval paperwork at all.

, If you are buying a car from the dealer, they may offer you financing. This financing usually has higher interest rates, but the dealership can offer you other incentives, such as rebates or no-interest periods, that may bring down the cost overall. Talk to the dealer, and get a quote for financing to see if it is right for you.

Some dealerships will advertise that they finance people with no or bad credit. Typically these dealerships charge extremely high interest rates. It is better to see if a bank, credit union, or reputable dealer will give you a loan first., Before you buy a used car, ask the dealer if you can have a mechanic examine the car to make sure that there are no problems. Always get your own mechanic to perform this service. They should check out the car’s brakes, electrical system, compression, transmission, and other parts to prevent you from buying a defective car., Once you buy the car, make sure that you have the title transferred into your name. You should doublecheck that the VIN on the title is the same as it is on the car. The odometer on the car should also be the same or higher than it is listed on the title. Go through all of the proper paper work, and submit it to your state DMV.

Be sure to get a new license plate for the car registered in your state of residence.

, You must have insurance on your new car. Contact a few insurance companies to find the best rate. If you had insurance on your old car, contact your insurance agency and tell them that you have bought a new car, so that they can adjust your insurance. This will ensure that your insurance will cover the new car."

Check your credit report for mistakes.,
Negotiate with creditors to remove negative items from your report.,
Reduce credit card debt to below 30% of credit line.,
Don’t max out your cards.",How to Buy a Car with Bad Credit5," Roughly one out of five Americans has an error on their credit report, and until you examine yours, you won’t know if you fall into that group, and if you do, how seriously it could be damaging your credit score.By law, every American gets one free copy of their credit report each year from each of the major credit bureaus. Get your at free report at https://www.annualcreditreport.com.
Should you spot a mistake, you need notify the credit bureau in writing and by certified mail. Along with the notification, forward any copies of documents that support your position. It isn’t mandatory, but wouldn’t hurt to notify the creditor in the same way at the same time. In any event, the credit bureau has thirty days to investigate your claim. If they do not resolve it to your satisfaction, contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) at http://www.consumerfinance.gov/ and file a complaint.

, After you’ve examined your credit report, you might notice a few blemishes on your record. Not errors, exactly, just relics from when you were younger and poorer. It’s by no means guaranteed, but you may be able to negotiate those off of your report if you reach out to the creditor.Tell the creditor you’d be willing to pay them and settle the debt if they would remove the items from your credit report. They may counteroffer, suggesting they indicate instead the debt was “paid as agreed.” That’s not as effective, but it looks better than a delinquent account. Whatever you agree on, get the agreement in writing.

, One of the components of your credit score is the proportion of available credit compared to the total credit. If you’re using more than 30% of your available credit, it hurts your score.So if you do need to close out an account, you need to pay down enough of the remaining credit to balance the loss of that line of credit.

, Don't max out your credit limits for the same reason you don't abruptly close lines of credit--you're using too high a proportion of available credit. If you find you’re going to need a larger line of credit than the one you have, either ask your creditor to raise the limit or apply for another card. That way you can spread the same amount of money onto several sources of credit, keeping your overall utilization low."
"
Have a good credit score.,
Know your debt-to-income ratio (DTI).,
Determine the loan value of the RV.,
Make a down payment.,
Extend the duration of your loan.",How to Be Successful in Getting a Loan for an RV1," The number one factor that impacts RV loan approval is credit history. Most lenders will want a credit score of at least 640, but a score of 700 or better is more likely to obtain an approval at the best rate and most favorable terms. If your credit score is below this range, you may have to accept a higher interest rate or less favorable terms. With very low credit, you may not qualify for a loan at all., This is your monthly revolving debt, (mortgage, auto and credit card payments) divided by your monthly gross income. Your gross income is your income from all sources before taxes.


Lenders will also want to see proof of income, which is usually asked for in the form of your tax returns for the past two years.Most RV and marine lenders look for a maximum debt-to-income ratio of approximately 45 percent or less, however some will go as high as 50 percent or more with excellent credit., Each lender has their own formula for determining the amount they will loan on any particular RV. Most lenders will loan somewhere between wholesale and retail, depending on the previous factors listed above. However, some will loan up to the RV's retail value on refinancing.


Research the value of the RV you are buying and look for a good deal. This will help you get a loan because the collateral (the RV) will be worth an amount equal to or greater than the loan value.Again, the better the credit history, the more flexible the lenders are likely to be.

, A down payment will not only lower the overall amount of your loan, but will also ensure that you are not upside-down in your loan. Because a new RV may depreciate a full 20 percent in a year, you want to have at least paid off that much of its value in that time. Paying a full 20 percent down payment will help you do that and is standard practice among RV lenders.


If you can't afford the 20 percent, there may be special programs that offer lower down payments, especially for those with great credit.
However, if you can't spare the 20 percent, odds are you should wait and buy an RV when you can afford the down payment., Most RV loans are between 5 and 15 years. However, for larger loans, perhaps over $50,000 or $100,000, they are willing to extend the length of your loan. This will lower your overall interest rate and make payments more affordable. However, keep in mind that you will end up paying more interest overall (over the life of the loan)."
"
Get financing before shopping.,
Consider dealer financing.,
Find a third-party lender.,
Compare lenders before deciding.",How to Be Successful in Getting a Loan for an RV2," Before going to the dealer to look for RVs, it's best to already have some preliminary financing in place. This allows you to know how much you can afford to pay for an afford. In addition, it will give you a starting place for talking down your dealer's own financing terms. This can allow you to get an even better rate as the RV dealer works to earn your business., Like car dealerships, RV dealers generally offer in-house financing. Their rates are slightly higher other rates you could get from a third-party, but may qualify you for better loan terms or discounts. Work with your dealer to identify and negotiate these terms.


RV dealer financing may be more difficult to get than car dealer financing., If you choose not to go with dealer financing, you will be able to seek out other lenders that may offer a lower rate. The exact rate you will get depends on your credit score and other factors, but even a slightly lower interest rate will mean big savings over the life of your loan. There are many options for pursuing a third-party loan, including banks, credit unions, and other independent lenders.Credit unions often offer the best rates. Search for credit unions in your area to see if you qualify for one of these loans.Some of the best rates and terms in the industry are offered by Good Sam Finance Center, Essex Credit, and Alliant Credit Union. Visit the websites for these lenders to determine current interest rates and get a quote., Look around and get quotes from a number of different third-party lenders and from your dealer. Compare interest rates, down payments, and other items, like prepayment fees if you plan to repay you loan early. Interest rates and lenders' willingness to accept your credit score will vary widely between lenders, so make sure you check out every available source of financing and choose the best one for you.Remember to talk to your RV dealer about any discounts or special terms you may be eligible for if you take out a dealer loan with them. They may be willing to offer you additional discounts to earn your loan business.
However, know that dealer loans are generally more expensive in the long run due to higher interest rates. Even a small different in rates can add up over the life of the loan. With a dealer loan, you're paying for the convenience of a one-stop RV purchase.
In general, dealer rates are your best option if you're buying a brand new RV, while third-party options are better if you are buying used."
"
Pay a higher down payment.,
Accept higher interest rates.,
Lower your debt-to-income ratio.,
Wait and improve your credit before buying.",How to Be Successful in Getting a Loan for an RV3," Paying a larger down payment can help you qualify for a loan you would otherwise not get. Making a down payment of 20 percent or more will show lenders that you have enough money to afford the loan, despite your poor credit., If you have bad credit, lenders will see lending to you as a risk. This means that they will charge you higher interest rates than a borrower with good credit would get in order to counteract that risk. You may be able to qualify for a loan by accepting these high rates, but keep in mind that the interest be very expensive over the life of the loan and will increase your monthly payments., Your DTI, defined as the percentage of your monthly income that goes towards paying off debt, should be lower than 45 percent. For a borrower with low credit, an even lower DTI can help you get a loan. Improve your DTI and your standing with a lender by showing a recent increase in income or a decrease in your debt payments.


For example, if you recently paid off a car or your home, you will have a sudden reduction in debt that will give you more buying power and a better chance of getting a loan., While it may not be what you want to hear, the best thing to do is to make an effort to improve your credit before taking on more debt to buy an RV. You can improve your credit by paying overdue bills, removing errors from your record, and lowering your outstanding debt balances. You can also improve your credit over time by making payments on time and using less of your available credit.


Even if you don't improve your credit score dramatically, showing that you made an effort to do so can convince a lender to finance your RV purchase."

Set up a payment system.,
Tighten your budget.,
Make up any missed payments.,
Calculate late fees.",How to Avoid Car Repossession1," In order to avoid going into default on the car loan, you should always make timely payments to the lender. Set up an automatic payment system if necessary so that you don’t miss any payments.;
, You should make it a priority to pay secured debts, like a car loan, before paying unsecured debts, like credit card payments or medical bills.Since you probably need your car to get to work, you should make your car payment the most important bill after essentials like rent and food.


Go through your monthly expenses and see where you can cut. You should be able to get rid of entertainment expenses (like movies or Netflix) as well as money spent at restaurants and bars.
If you don’t know how to make a budget, then you could contact credit counseling. Credit counselors can help you create a realistic budget.You can find credit counseling agencies by visiting the Department of Justice’s website, which maintains a directory of approved credit counseling agencies.Also see Create a Household Budget for sample documents and helpful tips.

, You don’t necessarily enter “default” simply because you missed a payment. You should read your loan agreement, which will define default.Typically, you are not in default until the lender sends you a letter stating that your account is in default.


Accordingly, you should quickly make up any late payment before you enter default. As soon as possible, you should find the money to make the payment.

, Although a late payment can keep you out of default, you may need to pay fees or late charges. Be sure to properly calculate these and tack them onto the monthly payment. If you don’t pay all of the fees, then you could still be in default.If you can’t tell how much you owe, then call the lender and have them calculate the amount. Be sure to pay promptly.

Call the lender.,
Do not hide the car.,
Decide if you can afford it.,
Ask if you can sell the car.,
Surrender the car.,
Identify your defenses.",How to Avoid Car Repossession2," If you realize that you can’t make your payment, then you should call the bank and let them know. You should commit to being honest about your financial situation.Tell the person on the other end what you can afford and ask if the loan can be modified.


Sometimes you can refinance. A 60 month loan, for example, could be stretched out to 72 months. This would lower your monthly payments even though you would end up paying more over the life of the loan. Always get new contract terms in writing., In some states it is illegal to hide a car to keep it from being repossessed.For this reason, you are better off calling the lender as soon as you know you will be late with a payment. If you can make full payment but at a later date, then let them know.

, Maybe you splurged and bought a car that is too expensive for your budget. If so, then you will need to get rid of the car. However, if the car is in good condition and you think you can afford it, then you should prepare to negotiate with the lender.


You can ask for your loan to be modified. For example, you could extend the loan, or change the payment structure so that you will pay less now but make larger payments toward the end of the loan.

, If the lender won’t refinance or otherwise modify the loan, then you could ask whether you can sell the car yourself. By selling the car yourself, you can be assured that you will get the highest price possible. Typically, a lender will sell the car at auction and may settle for a lower price.


If you can sell the car yourself, then you might be able to avoid a deficiency.For example, if you owe $15,000 on the loan, you might be able to sell the car for $15,000, thus wiping out the money owed to the lender. If the lender sells the car itself, then it might settle for $11,000 at auction. You would be left with a $4,000 deficiency.

, Another option is simply to surrender the vehicle to the lender. Before doing this, though, you should try to negotiate something in return from the lender. Specifically, try to get the balance of the loan forgiven.For example, if the lender repossesses a car and sells it for $10,000, it might leave you with a $5,000 deficiency. See if the lender will forgive the remainder of the loan.
If the lender agrees to forgive the balance of the loan, then get this agreement in writing., You will have a stronger negotiating hand if you can identify illegal acts taken by the lender. Typically, you would raise these defenses at trial, when the lender tries to sue you for the remaining balance of the loan. However, you can also raise them during negotiations. By doing so, you alert the lender that a lawsuit could be very time-consuming.


For example, the lender may also have failed to give you written notice of your deficiency as required by the loan agreement. Read this agreement carefully and check if the lender followed the rules.The lender might have miscalculated how much you owe. You should bring this to the lender’s attention. In court, a lender may be embarrassed to have to defend sloppy record keeping. To avoid that situation, the lender might be willing to negotiate with you.
Also, a lender must get a court order to repossess a car if you are in the military.
You can also note illegal acts taken by the repo man (if the car has already been repossessed). For example, if the repo man broke locks or damaged property in order to repossess the car, then he “breached the peace.”Take photographs of any damaged property to show the lender.

"
"
Read your loan agreement.,
Contact the lender.,
Think about redeeming the car.",How to Avoid Car Repossession3," You should check to see if the contract grants you the right to reinstate your loan. If so, then you can make your account current by paying all of the past due payments, including late fees and interest.In some states, you are given an automatic right to reinstate the loan. To check if you have this right, then search “loan reinstatement” and your state.
In Illinois, for example, consumers who have paid at least 30% of the vehicle’s deferred payment price or the amount of payments due are eligible for reinstatement., If you want to reinstate the loan, then you should immediately contact the lender and check if this is an option. Your lender should have sent you a written notice explaining your right to reinstate.Nevertheless, the lender may have forgotten, so call and check.


If the lender agrees, then you will probably be given a limited amount of time to make the back payments, e.g., 15 days.

, You can also do a “redemption.” This is similar to a reinstatement; however, instead of paying missed back payments, you instead pay off the entire loan.You may not have the money to redeem the car. Nevertheless, a redemption (like reinstatement) might make sense if you are getting back a large income tax return or otherwise are soon coming into possession of a sum of money.

Understand the automatic stay.,
Meet with a lawyer.,
Give your attorney a list of creditors.",How to Avoid Car Repossession4," When you file for bankruptcy, you provide the court with a list of all creditors. These creditors are then sent a notice by the bankruptcy court telling them to stop all collection efforts. If the creditor continues collection, then it will face heavy fines. This notice is called the “automatic stay.”


You can stop a repossession by filing for bankruptcy.The automatic stay will then stop the lender from repossessing the vehicle.
Nevertheless, you should understand that once you emerge from bankruptcy the repossession can start up again unless you discharged the underlying car loan during the bankruptcy proceedings.

, Filing for bankruptcy is a big step. It can have a far-reaching impact on your credit score and other areas of life. You should meet with a lawyer to discuss whether or not bankruptcy is a good option for you.


You can find a bankruptcy lawyer by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.You are strongly encouraged to use a lawyer to file for bankruptcy. People represented by lawyers have greater odds of completing bankrupt successfully than those who proceed without a lawyer.

, If you decide to go through with filing for bankruptcy, then you should give your attorney a list of creditors. Be sure that the lender is included in the list.


If, after filing, your car is repossessed, then tell your lawyer. You can bring suit against the lender for continuing collection efforts after the automatic stay has been issued.

However, you'll still need to assess your budget and find out what you can pay each month. Even if you get a short-term loan with a great interest rate, you still need to be able to afford the monthly payments. Look at your monthly budget and determine a car payment amount that doesn't stretch your finances.


Focusing solely on the monthly payment during your loan search can leave you with a bad deal that involves a long loan term and a relatively high interest rate.When you're calculating this figure, be sure to also think about maintenance and insurance costs. Consult with an insurance agent to find out how much your car might cost to insure.In general, used cars tend to have higher maintenance costs than new cars. This is because the car already has miles on it and you don't necessarily know the wear and tear it has been through previously.;
, After you've established how much you can pay each month, think about how long you are willing to pay a car off for. Car loans are typically available in terms ranging from three to six years. Pick one of these terms and use an online car loan calculator to estimate how much you can spend on a car. Then, try other loan durations and write down how much you can spend with each different duration., When you want a used car loan, it's better to pay more of the total cost as a down payment and finance less of the deal. Consider how much you can pay up front and what leftover portion will need to be financed through a used car loan.


Consider making a larger down payment. A large down payment helps to not only control interest on the loan, but sometimes helps buyers to pay off their car loans quicker, allowing them to drop some of the pricier insurance coverage that lenders require while the vehicle is being financed., Lenders base a portion of their financing calculations on the buyer's credit score. Make sure you Understand Your FICO Credit Score when you look at it. Make sure yours is in good condition, hopefully above the 680 mark, and allow the lender to do a basic credit check. If you have a very low credit score, such as below 650 or 600, it may be very difficult for you to qualify for a loan at all. Be sure to check your credit before applying for loans by visiting annualcreditreport.com for your free annual credit report. There may be other factors that hinder your ability to get a loan, such as:


Most lenders (except for dealers) will refuse to lend to you for a car that is more than four or five years old.
The majority of lenders will not lend to you if you are buying from a private party (anyone except a car dealership)., It may be easier to just walk into a dealership, without shopping for a loan beforehand, and just submit to whatever the dealer wants to charge you. However, by doing this you are setting yourself up for a bad deal. What you should do instead is to get a loan pre-approved before entering the dealership. This will give you some bargaining power and also give you a standard of comparison when the dealer makes a financing offer., Start by locating banks and credit unions in your area. Don't just look at your bank, but go around town to other banks that also offer auto loans. Then, go in for a loan consultation.

You can also shop for car loans online at sites like Capital One, Up2Drive, and Blue Harbor., Look carefully at what the lender wants for the loan application, and give them the details that will help you successfully apply for a used car financing deal.


Show income and assets. Any proof of income or large assets that could be used as collateral will help you to present a successful used car loan application, and can also lower the interest rates that you can demand from lenders.
It's best to complete all of these applications within a two-week window. Otherwise, applying for so many loans might negatively impact your credit score., The APR, or annual percentage rate, is the amount of interest that will be charged on your car loan each year. A higher interest rate represents a more expensive loan. However, the more important factor in choosing a loan is the overall cost, which combines both APR and loan duration. Therefore, you should compare your loan offers by looking for the loan with the lowest combination of APR and loan duration.


Small APR differences can have a large effect on how much you end up paying in interest over the life of the loan. For example, on a $15,000, 3-year loan, a 7 percent APR will be $500 more expensive overall than a 5 percent loan.You can standardize these comparisons by only asking for loans of a certain duration, like 4 years or 5 years. That way, the APRs will be directly comparable.
When choosing a loan, you should also look out for loans that charge large amounts of fees., Once you are pre-approved for a loan, it's time to Shop for a Used Car or Vehicle. Your lender should have given you a limit on the value of the car, so stick to it. Remember, you can get a cheaper car than you are qualified for, but not a more expensive one. With pre-approval, you can shop for cars within your budget without renegotiating a deal with the dealer each time.


There may be terms in your loan pre-approval preventing you from buying cars over a certain age or with over a certain number of miles. Be sure to check this before buying., Compare the dealer's offer with the offer that you are pre-approved for. Is the overall cost cheaper? Even if the dealer offers you a lower APR, the duration of the loan may be more expensive. Take your time and make calculations to ensure that you are getting the best deal. When you've made your choice, the dealer's finance department will work to finalize the sale.


At this point, you will be asked to add a number of optional add-ons to your purchase. It's best to study these before going to the dealer so that you aren't pressured into them in the moment.The dealer may offer you a rebate or a low financing deal. However they will not offer you both. By taking a loan from a third-party lender (a lender other than the dealer), you can take the dealer's rebate and still get the low interest rate offered by the third-party lender., Even if you think you have terrible credit or have been turned down by a few lenders, you still may be able to get a loan elsewhere. Different lenders look for different aspects of a borrower's credit and financial situation to assess whether or not to lend to them, so don't give up after a few lenders.You may be able to get a car loan online, even with bad credit, at websites like Roadloans.com and Auto Credit Express. However, the rates on these loans will likely be very high., Watch out for lenders that specialize in subprime loans or loans for lenders with bad credit. These are often expensive debt traps that will charge you exorbitant or flexible interest rates that can end up being much more expensive than you expect. Instead, always to regular lenders, like local banks and credit unions. You can also check to see if your employer or insurer offers car loans.


Make sure your loan terms are final, not conditional or contingent, in your loan contract. Non-final loan terms can change without warning, even after you leave the lot in your new car. This is known as a ""yo-yo"" scam and can leave you with a higher interest rate or down payment than you agreed to.
Similarly, watch out for add-ons or exorbitant fees in the loan contract. Unscrupulous lenders try to add these in to take advantage of borrowers., A cosigner is a friend or family member that signs on to your car loan. This person is essentially guaranteeing your loan to help you qualify. This can help you even if you have very bad credit or no credit history. However, because your cosigner has signed on to your loan, they are equally liable for the balance in the event that you can't make your payments. Make sure you can make the payments before asking a cosigner to sign for you.

, Lenders may be more willing to lend to you if you make a large down payment. This decreases your ""loan to value"" ratio, which is how much your loan is for versus how much the car is worth. In essence, this reassures banks that your vehicle will be worth more than your loan balance in the event that you default on your payments and your vehicle is repossessed. This, in turn, makes lending to you less risky.


Making a larger down payment may also reduce your interest rate and monthly payments."

Make sure that you restructure your own personal budget after the agreement is signed.",How to Reduce Your Car Payments Without Getting a Refinancing Loan," If you are late or missing car payments, loan modification is an option to avoid repossession of the vehicle. Loan modification is similar to refinancing, but occurs under distressed conditions, and usually involves a change in existing terms to make the loan more affordable.Loan modification can involve several different changes to your loan. This could include a lowering of your interest-rate, an extension of your term (which lowers your monthly payment, but would result in you paying for a longer period and therefore more interest over time). It can also include forbearance -- which refers to making little to no payments for a very specific period of time -- or various other options.
Every lender has a different approach to loan modification. Some lenders do not permit it at all, whereas some lenders have official financial hardship programs for borrowers with difficulty repaying. Toronto-Dominion Bank, for example, has a ""loan repayment solutions"" program, which offers distressed borrowers individualized plans that can include modification, forbearance, or several other options.;
, Keep in mind that modification and refinancing are very different. Refinancing refers replacing an existing loan with a new loan that has a lower rate, or more favorable terms. A modification refers to taking the existing loan and adjusting the terms, often for a short-time, for borrowers who are in a distressed condition. For individuals with poor credit, refinancing may not be an option, making modification a better choice.


Lenders are often open to modification because repossessing a car is not a favorable option for the lender. When a car is repossessed, there can often be significant costs involved in preparing for resale. It is often a simpler option for a bank to simply restructure the loan.
Another key difference between loan modification and loan refinancing is that refinancing is a permanent solution, whereas modification is often temporary until what hardship lead to the modification is relieved. If you suffer a job loss for example, you may be permitted to make reduced payments until you are employed once again.

, The process of modifying a car loan can be difficult and time consuming, therefore, its important to make sure it is the right option for you.


If your car loan is underwater or ""upside-down"" you may qualify. This means your debt is worth more than the car itself, which would leave outstanding debt if the car was sold. Modification can help correct this
If you had an accident or other incident that reduced your car value significantly, modification can also be the right option.
If you suffered a job loss or income reduction and are having difficulties making payments, a loan modification can also correct this.
If you are in any situation where a default is a likely option, modification should always be explored as a way to reduce payments, as the lender would rather explore options than default.

, Generally, in order to receive any type of loan modification or hardship assistance, you will need to demonstrate you qualify before applying. Usually, qualification depends on several factors.It is important to have a decent track record of honestly trying to repay debt. If you have a positive track record of making an effort to repay debt and working with the lender, they are more likely to assist you in a modification.
Demonstrate that unforeseen circumstances lead to your inability to pay. This can include a job loss, divorce, medical emergency, or any factor beyond your control. Poor budgeting will often not suffice as a reason, but if your financial situation is such that you cannot afford to live while making payments, it is worth approaching the lender.

, This is an important preparation step, as it allows you to determine how in debt you actually are, and if modification is likely to be accepted.


The DIR is simply the ratio of your monthly debt payments to your monthly income. To calculate it, divide your monthly debt payments by your income. For example, if you pay $1000 a month to various forms of debt, and your income is $1500, you would have a very high DIR of 60%. Between 30-40% is considered reasonable.

, Look online or call your lender to check if your lender has an official financial hardship or loan modification program. If they do, simply follow the instructions to proceed.


If your lender does not have a specific program, call them and explain your situation. Make it clear that you are unable to continue making payments under the current arrangement, and that you are worried about being at risk of default. The lender will then inform you if loan modification or assistance is an option, or if the lender simply does not provide that service. Most lenders will be receptive, since defaulting is not a favorable option for them either.
Make it clear to the lender that you want to pay the loan. Let them know your intention is to pay the loan in full, and that with some mild assistance, it is possible. , Just because the lender agrees to the idea does not mean the process is over -- it is now necessary to prove your financial hardship is viable.


The lender will likely request several documents. Be prepared to include paystubs, phone bills, utility bills, bank statements, or even notarized letters

, The hardship letter (sometimes referred to as a request for assistance) will usually be required, but if it is not, it is always a good idea to submit one anyway. This letter will outline why your car payment is unaffordable, and why your income is reduced and your expenses are increased.Be sure to include the specific reasons as to why you are requesting a modification. Refer to Part 1, Step 3 above, and make sure that you demonstrate clearly that you have been making honest efforts to repay, that you have been afflicted by some unforeseen circumstance beyond your control (job loss, income reduction, medical expenses, illness, divorce, unexpected expenses, death of a family member), and that the current circumstance is likely to last more than a few months. Be honest, and do not be afraid to include numbers confirming your income reduction.
Provide a specific request for new terms. This could include the precise amount you can afford to pay each month, an end date for the new reduced payment. Think about how much you can afford, and for how long, and make sure to specify this. Being too open can lead to unfavorable terms being extended., After the application is complete, you can simply wait to hear back from the lender. If possible, still try and make payments during this period. Often repossessions can occur while waiting for approval, so make sure that the individuals responsible for the modification are communicating with the repossession team to ensure they are aware of the process.

, The lender may offer several different options depending on what they have available to them, and your particular situation. This may include lower interest rates, reduced payments for a short-term until whatever difficult you have ends, or adding missed payments to the back of your loan.


If the new terms the lender offers will not decrease your odds of a default, make this very clear. However, if you are clear in your hardship letter about exactly what you need and what you can afford, it reduces the odds the lender will come back with something unfavorable.

, This will further help you in improving your finances, especially when the hardship plan is temporary.


Although modification of a loan can be a stressful and time consuming process, by sticking to the new terms and restructuring your personal budget to give loan repayments top priority, it is very possible to both keep your vehicle, and begin the process of improving your credit.

Shop around for your loan.,
Don't take out a small loan.,
Get a pre-approved loan before you buy a car.,
Consider leasing instead of buying.",How to Reduce Finance Charges on a Car Loan1," Automobile loans are largely determined by the borrower's credit score; the better the borrower's credit score is, the lower his interest rate will likely be.Knowing your credit score before you apply for an automobile loan can help ensure that you get the best possible loan terms. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report (one free copy is guaranteed every 12 months) by visiting AnnualCreditReport.com or by calling 1-877-322-8228.Your credit report won't explicitly contain your credit score, but it will contain information that determines your credit score. Because of this, it's tremendously important to review all of the information contained in your credit report and understand what determines your credit score to ensure that there are no errors.
If your credit score is low, you may need to improve your credit score. Improving your credit score will likely get you much better terms on your loan. If you can hold off on purchasing your vehicle until you've repaired your credit, it may be worth waiting.Consider contacting a credit counseling organization to help you rebuild your credit. A credit counselor can work with you to build and stick to a budget, and can even help you manage your income and your debts. You can find a credit counseling organization near you by searching online - just be clear on the terms and fees of the services offered before signing up with a credit counselor.;
, Most dealerships offer automobile loans at the dealership, which can make it convenient for buyers. However, the dealership may not be offering the best available loan. Many automobile dealers arrange loans by acting as a ""middle man"" between you and a bank, which means that the dealership may charge you extra to compensate for its services.Even if the dealership's fees aren't unreasonable, it's likely that the dealer will then sell your contract to a bank, credit union, or finance company, and you may end up making payments to that third party.Even if you end up going with the dealer's financing option, it's worth shopping around for a better loan from a local bank or credit union.

, Every loan term is different, depending on factors like your credit score and the amount you're requesting to borrow. Smaller loans typically have very high monthly finance charges, because the bank makes money off of these charges and they know that a smaller loan will be paid off more quickly.If you intend to take out an auto loan for only a few thousand dollars, it may be worth saving up until you have the whole amount that you'll need to purchase an automobile, or purchasing an automobile that fits in your available price range., Pre-approved loans are arranged in advance with a bank or financial institution. This may be helpful, as many people feel pressured to go with the loan options that a dealer offers at the car lot, and end up getting a loan with high finance charges. If you get a pre-approved loan beforehand, you'll know exactly how much you can afford to spend on an automobile, which will also help you stay within your budget., Leasing a vehicle allows you to use your vehicle for an arranged duration of time and a predetermined number of miles. You won't own your car, but lease payments are typically lower than what the monthly payments on a loan would be for the exact same vehicle.Some lease terms also give you the option of purchasing your vehicle at the end of the leasing period. Before you decide to lease, it may be helpful to consider:

Be ready to walk away.",How to Get a Low APR on a Car Loan," Most dealers will offer you an APR based on your income and credit score. Consumers are entitled to one free credit report per year from a credit bureau. The federal government authorized annualcreditreport.com to issue free credit reports. You can alternately choose from TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian, or see this guide.


Your credit report does not come with a free credit score. It would be nice to know your credit score, but you should be able to get an idea of how good your credit is based on the report alone.
The most common credit scoring model is FICO. The FICO score is calculated based on amounts owed (30%), new credit (10%), length of credit history (15%), credit mix (10%), and payment history (35%).Shoot for a score as close to 850 as you can, but the upper 700s will get you good loan rates as well.Some credit card companies and banks will automatically generate a FICO score for you each month. You may receive this report for free, or you may have to pay extra for it.;
, You need to walk into the negotiating room aware of the rates others in your area are getting. There are numerous companies who compile interest rate reports that you can find with a simple web search. You can also check your bank’s website to find their rates., The second criteria car dealers use to determine your interest rate is your income. Bring a pay stub, tax return, or other government document that indicates your income. Showing job stability will help you get a better interest rate.

, Getting fixated on a dream car makes it easier for dealers to manipulate you into higher interest rates. Find multiple cars so you have the flexibility to walk away from a bad deal later on. Unless you are in the market for a rare car, you should be able to find several similar vehicles in your area.

, The best loan may be with a dealer, a bank, or a credit union – it just depends on the business or institution. Think about the perks of borrowing money from each place. Though one institution may have higher rates, it may be more convenient for you.Taking a dealership loan is not always a bad idea. In addition to the convenience factor, they may have special programs that help you keep your car on the road. Get information about all they offer with their loans, but be wary of ‘add-ons’ that pad the offer but have little value.Bank loans usually have lower APRs. Despite legislation to cap APR rates and loan markups in many states, you will often get the best deal at your bank. If you use multiple banks, you will be able to choose the best rate. Credit unions generally have much lower rates for auto loans. Look at the most up-to-date report from the American Credit Union Administration to see how banks and credit unions compare., Many people with low income have little defense against exploitative loaning practices. There are numerous programs to help low income families obtain and pay for cars. Check with nonprofits to find a car ownership program in your area., Whether you end up taking the bank loan or not, having one in hand is a powerful bargaining chip when you talk to a car dealer. If you suspect a car dealer has made you a bad offer, talk to your bank. Until you sign the papers, your pre-approved APR from your bank may get you a comparable rate.

, APR rates increase dramatically based on how long you choose to pay back the loan. A standard short-term loan is 36 months. This information will be in the loan information you found for your bank when you were doing your homework. A shorter payback time equals higher monthly payments, however, so evaluate whether you can afford the additional cost. On average, car owners spend about 11% of their income on car payments., Car dealers prefer to receive as much cash up front as possible. Offering to make a larger down payment than necessary is a bartering chip you can use to get a lower APR. It will also decrease the size of your payments, and maybe even allow you to choose a shorter payback period.

, Dealers use add-ons such as cash rebates, minor car improvements, and incentive programs to increase the cost of the car. Some of these, however, are ‘back-end products,’ meaning that they have not yet been installed or gone into effect. Tell the dealer you would like to trade some add-ons for a lower APR., Though it doesn’t apply to all, the usurious used car dealer stereotype exists for a reason. If you are getting a bad deal and they won’t budge, walk away. If you did your homework, you will have several more options. Even if they don’t give you a better deal to get you back to the negotiating table, you will probably have better luck with another more trustworthy dealer.

Contact your lender.,
Gather the necessary information.,
Compare refinance loan options.",How to Reduce Finance Charges on a Car Loan2," You can apply to refinance your automobile loan with the lender from the original loan, or you can switch to a new lender. Lenders who allow refinancing will replace your existing loan with a new loan, typically offering lower monthly finance charges.Not every lender will allow borrowers to refinance a loan, so it may be worth comparing your options to determine which lender to go with, or whether you're eligible to refinance at all., As part of the refinancing application process, you'll need some basic information to provide the lender. Before you apply to refinance your loan, you'll need to have ready:


your current interest ratehow much money is still owed on the existing loanhow many months remain in the existing loan's termsthe make, model, and current odometer reading of your vehiclethe current value of your vehicleyour current income and employment historyyour current credit score, If you are eligible for an automobile loan refinance with your existing lender, you may be eligible for a better loan through a different lending institution. It's worth comparing your refinance loan options to get the best available loan terms.When you search around and compare refinance options, it's worth considering:

"
Learn whether you're able to pre-pay your loan.,
Learn the pre-payment process for your lender.,
Calculate your early loan payoff amount.",How to Reduce Finance Charges on a Car Loan3," If refinancing isn't an option, you may be eligible for pre-paying your loan. Pre-payment, also called early loan payoff, simply means that you pay off your debt before the agreed-upon end date of an existing loan.The benefit of pre-paying your loan is that you're not subjected to the monthly finance charges you would otherwise be paying on your loan, but for that reason many lenders charge a pre-payment penalty or fee.The terms of your existing loan should specify whether there is any pre-payment or early loan payoff penalty, but if you're unsure you can always consult with your lender.

, If your lender permits you to make pre-payments on your loan, there may be a special process for making those payments. These payments are sometimes referred to as principal-only payments, and it's important to specify to your lender that you intend for that payment to be applied to the principal loan, not the finance charges for upcoming months. Each lender's process may be different, so it's best to call or email the lender's customer service department and ask what you need to do to make a principal-only payment towards your loan., There are many early loan payoff ""calculators"" available online, but all of them factor in the same basic information to determine how much you will need to pay in order to payoff your loan early:


the total number of months in your existing loan termthe number of months remaining on your existing loanthe amount your existing loan was forthe monthly payments remaining on your loanthe current annual interest rate (APR) on your existing loan"

Determine whether it is a lease or a loan.,
Check your loan contract.,
Speak with your creditors and find a buyer.,
Come to an agreement with the buyer and your loan company.",How to Get Someone to Take Over Your Car Payments1," You will no doubt already know this, but if you are in any doubt be sure to clarify whether your have leased the car or have an auto loan. A loan would mean that you have in effect bought the car and you are paying off the cost in instalments to a bank, auto dealer, or other financial institution. A lease, on the other hand, is a limited term contract that will expire after a certain length of time.If you are leasing a car it is generally easier to transfer the lease to another person than it is to transfer a full auto loan.
It is often not possible to directly transfer one loan between two people, but there are alternative ways to bring about the same result.;
, Before you go any further you need to make sure you understand your contractual situation. Thoroughly read through all the documentation you have about your auto loan, looking for information about your options if you are struggling to make the payments, or want to get out of the contract early for whatever reason.


There may be options in your contract to sell the car and pay off what you owe, or to trade in the car for another model and adjust the loan accordingly.If you are uncertain about your position, contact the loan company and consider getting some legal advice from an attorney.

, Once you have established your position with your loan company, you may well find that your best option is to sell your car privately. You could then use the money to pay off the amount you owe, with the new owner making the payments to the bank or loan company. If you decide this is your best option you need to have the agreement of your loan company before you go ahead with it.


Until you have paid off all the debt on the car, you will not completely own it, so you will need to get permission from your loan company to sell it.
Taking responsibility for the sale yourself will make it more likely that you will get a good price than if you left it to the creditor to sell.Defaults and repossessions are costly for creditors so they will most likely be interested in alternatives if you can't make the payments.
If you have an agreement with a friend or family member this can help the process move more quickly.

, The simplest way to effectively transfer an auto loan between between two people is for the new owner to take out a loan which he uses to buy the car from the old owner. The old owner will use the money from the new owner to pay off the amount he owes to the loan company and the car's ownership would be transferred to the new owner.If you are operating with one loan company this process could be more straightforward than if you are dealing with multiple organisations.
By doing this you are basically transferring the loan and the outstanding payments to another person.
Make sure that you also transfer the title of the car to the new buyer, in accordance with the laws in your state. Notify your insurance company that the car is no longer in your possession.

"
"
Check your contract.,
Speak to the leasing company.,
Consider your options.",How to Get Someone to Take Over Your Car Payments2," The first thing you need to do is make sure that there is an option in your leasing contract to transfer it to another person. This varies from company to company so you need to know where you stand.If you are unsure whether your lease agreement allows assumption of the lease, consult the leasing company or an attorney.


Generally, leases are easier to transfer to another person than loans are. If you are only leasing the car, you are not working towards buying it outright, so the contract will be shorter than a full auto loan., After you have checked your loan agreement, you should contact the leasing company directly to discuss your options and the possibilities. Before any lease assumption can be made, you will need to have it signed off by the leasing company, so it's a good idea to talk to them in the early stages. Some leasing companies might work with you to determine whether they consider an assumption as a good and viable option.Some companies may work on a case-by-case basis, so they may be able to help you with the process.

, If you are struggling to keep up with your lease payments or your circumstances change and you decide to try to pass on the lease, you should take some time to consider your various options and the impact they will have financially and on your credit rating. It can be very expensive to terminate a lease early, and defaulting on the lease will lead to repossession and a significant black mark on your credit record.One alternative might be just to sell your car outright rather than transferring the lease to someone else.
If you are in negative equity, meaning the value of the car is less than the amount outstanding on the lease, selling the car won't cover your debts.You may be able to work out a deal with your creditors that enables you to turn in the car. So always speak to the leasing company about your options."
"
Contact a specialist company.,
List your lease online.,
Advertise it locally.",How to Get Someone to Take Over Your Car Payments3," Perhaps the easiest way to find someone to take over your lease is to go through a company that matches people with leases. For a fee, these companies will help buyers and sellers connect and act as a go-between which can assist in the process and vet potential buyers and sellers.Search online for car lease swap companies and look for customer testimonies and companies with positive feedback.Weigh up the costs of the fees with the value of the service being provided. If you need to find a buyer quite quickly, it could be worth it.
Some lease swapping websites will enable you to search by make, model, and year.

, An alternative to employing a lease swapping company is to list the lease online yourself, and deal with any interest you get from the advert. If you opt for this approach, you will have to do more of the work to find a buyer and negotiate a deal, but you will avoid the costs of employing someone else to do it. There will be listing and registration fees, so be sure you shop around to find the best deal with a reputable company.


The fees will vary but you should expect to pay around $200 to register with the listing site and place your listing.
There will be optional extra costs that will boost the visibility and presence of your advert., The classified section of your local paper is a good place for an ad seeking potential drivers to assume your lease or take over your loan. Run an advert with a photograph of the vehicle, mileage, general condition, amount of monthly payment, and term remaining on the lease.


You can also use social media websites. If you use Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or any other social media site, post an ad on it.
Be sure to include a photograph and the amount of the monthly payments, as well as the remaining term of the lease.
Talk to friends, family, and co-workers. Let friends, family, and co-workers know that you are looking for someone to take over your loan or lease.

"
"
Contact your lease company.,
Take the buyer for a test drive.,
Prepare the vehicle for its new owner.,
Turn over the vehicle.",How to Get Someone to Take Over Your Car Payments4," Once you have found someone to assume the lease, you need to work with your leasing company to ensure everything is properly agreed and all the paperwork is complete. Each financial institution has its own procedure for lease assumption, but the procedure generally includes:


Submission of credit application by the new owner. When taking over a lease, a potential owner/lessee will have to fill out a credit application and be approved for the total amount remaining on the lease.Payoff or transfer of the current lease. Once the new owner/lessee is approved for purchase/lease of the vehicle, the lease or title will be transferred to him or her.
Creation of new lease in new lessee name. When lease for the vehicle has been opened or transferred, the new lessee becomes responsible for the remaining payments on it.
If you are operating through a lease trading company they will guide you through this process., The buyer will no doubt want to take a test drive in the car before completing the deal. They will also want to inspect the vehicle to verify that is in the condition you stated in the listing or advert.This is important for both buyer and seller, as you will both inspect the car together and agree on its condition. Having a clear and recorded understanding will avoid potential disputes down the line.


The seller should always accompany the buyer on the test drive.
Be sure you are present for any independent inspections of the vehicle. It can be helpful to take photographs to ensure that you have proof of any minor blemishes or damage., When turning over a vehicle to a new owner, you will want to be sure to remove all personal items. That means taking out your iPod, gloves, charger cord, and any other items of personal property out of the vehicle. After this, be sure you clean the interior of the vehicle. Wipe down the dash, doors, and steering wheel, and clean the inside and outside of all the windows. Take the vehicle through the car wash or wash it yourself. Be sure to put a nice wax on it when you are through.

, Depending on the arrangement you have reached, you will pass the car on to the leasing company, lease trading company, or directly to the person taking over the lease. Follow the instructions you have been given by your lease company to turn the vehicle over. Most companies will pick up the vehicle and handle turning it over to the buyer.


If you are in possession of the title to the vehicle, you will need to sign it over to the new owner or your financial institution. Check with the lease company for instructions on whom to sign over title to.
Contact your state's Motor Vehicle Department to transfer ownership. This will eliminate the possibility that you might be held liable for any damages after the transfer.
Once the paper work is all complete, and you have handed over the keys, the process is complete."
"
Ask around friends and family.,
Contact your lease company.,
Understand the risks.",How to Get Someone to Take Over Your Car Payments5," Another option is to allow someone you know and trust to use the car and make payments to you which you then use to make your lease payments. If you are considering this option, you should approach trusted friends and family who might be interested in taking over the lease., Before you consider this you should check your leasing contract to see if such an arrangement is expressly forbidden. Simply allowing someone to take over your lease contract without the involvement and approval of the leasing company is likely to violate your contract.If you have a trusted family member lined up to take on the lease, the company may look on the proposal more favourably.


Speaking to the leasing company can help you decide whether to transfer the ownership completely by putting the lease in someone else's name.
If you do this the new lease holder will have to be checked and approved by the lease company.
The alternative is to keep the lease under your name and have the other person pay you directly, but this may breach your contract, so be sure that you are clear.

, This more informal arrangement comes with inherent risks that you should understand. If someone is using your car and making payments to you, you essentially become a creditor so if the person stops making payments to you, you will have to repossess the car. This can be difficult and complicated. You will still need to make the payments on the lease regardless, so you are exposing yourself to risk.Any damage to the vehicle will see its value depreciate and push you into negative equity.
If you own the car, you will need to add the new driver onto your insurance, which will likely raise the premium. If you do not, the driver will not be covered, which is often illegal.
Due to these risks you should carefully consider the risks before embarking on this kind of arrangement.
Think about the trustworthiness of the person, as well as his ability to make the required payments to you.

Lock the handbrake.,
Release the clutch.,
If the car is an automatic, put the transmission into D, hold the footbrake down as firmly as possible, build up the revs of the car by pushing the throttle pedal.",How to Do a Burnout1," To perform a burnout, you need a car with lots of horsepower, generally more than a 4-cylinder engine. Regarding transmissions, it is easiest to do in a manual but is possible in an automatic . For the best effect, street tires are also desirable, which have smoother surfaces that'll put out more smoke.
, Depress the clutch fully and start revving the engine. You shouldn't start moving, as long as you've got the clutch all the way in. Get your RPMs up so the tires will be hot when you let 'em loose.








, After you pop the clutch, your tires will be spinning very fast, so you can either pop it to speed off and perform a peel-out, or you can keep the hand brake or parking brake locked to spin your tires and create smoke, performing a burnout.

Try a peel-out.,
Do a donut.,
Try a rollback burnout.,
Use a line locker.",How to Do a Burnout2," A peel-out is the nicer cousin of the burnout, and happens when the driver spins the wheels on the road before moving. Peel-Outs are far easier and less dangerous to your car than a burnout, and even happen accidentally at stop lights when you jump on the gas too hard. To perform the Peel-Out:









Depress the clutch with the car in gear. Rev the engine high and release the clutch abruptly to peel-out.

, A donut is a circular burnout. To do a donut, find a large open area with no other cars, lampposts or other things you can hit. It is easy to lose control of a car with a donut. Begin driving in slow circles and then hit the gas hard so that the rear tires begin to lose traction, holding the wheel in the same position to perform the spinning donut.








, A rollback is just like a burnout, but performed on a hill. They are a good way to get a burnout in an underpowered car as the backward movement helps with traction after the burn.









Find a hill and put the car in first gear. Depress the clutch. Let the car roll backwards down the hill slightly, then start giving the car plenty of gas. Finally, ""pop"" the clutch to jump into first and take off.

, A line locker is a device that modifies a car so the brake pedal only engages the front brakes. A line lock is a solenoid (fancy name for a switch) that gives you some extra buttons in the drivers seat to control your brakes. To do a burn out with a line locker installed:









To use a line locker, step on the brakes and push the line lock button. When you release the brake pedal, you'll leave your front brakes on but disengaging your back brakes, leaving those wheels free to spin, burn and make smoke. Release the line lock button to release the front brakes and move forward.
Like burnouts, this device is almost always illegal and is quite dangerous.

Expose the engine so that you can get to work adjusting the motor. If you don't have a central governor spring, you can still get your cart to move a little faster.

, The clutch is the pedal (sometimes a handle near your knee) that you use to put the car into reverse or change speeds. You can adjust the clutch to send more gas to your engine, moving you faster.

, The length of this cable determines how much gas flows into your engine. Again, you should remember that the cart's motor will struggle the faster you make it move. So test every change and listen for clunks or stalls to make sure you protect your motor., You should see the cable lengthening slightly. This will make your cart faster. Tighten the nut to make the cart move slower., This is most common on modern, all-electric engine. Many manufacturers, including EZ Go, do not want consumers tampering with their engines, and have thus hidden the governors in the spark plug ignition. This is very difficult to adjust without ruining the engine, and should be left to trained professionals."

Take a class at a racing school.,
Enroll in a racing program.,
Get your racing license.,
Enter an amateur school race series.",How to Become an F1 Driver1," This is the quickest way to find out if Formula 1 is right for you. It is ideal for older racers that are new to the sport. You will get to get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 race car and learn some of the basics of racing.These classes may have a substantial fee for a few hours of racing knowledge, but it is the most affordable way to gain knowledge about Formula 1 racing before you decide to make a larger financial commitment.


You must have a valid standard driver's license to take these classes, and if you are a minor you will also need parental consent.
You must be capable of driving a car with a manual transmission to take racing classes.;
, These programs will involve approximately 1-2 weeks of advanced classes to hone your racing skills. Since your goal is to race in Formula One, you likely want to select a school that is approved by the licensing organization.

, Upon completion of the required courses your school will send a letter of recommendation to a racing organization. This will enable you to register and compete in a racing school event.

, These entry level race events are a great opportunity for amateur drivers to showcase their skills and get the attention of potential sponsors. Some schools hold their own races and will even provide you a car for these race events. You can win scholarships and race points towards getting your next level license.

Try kart racing.,
Get a kart racing license.,
Buy your kart.,
Enter a race.",How to Become an F1 Driver2," This method is the best way for younger racers to get involved in the sport. Most of the top Formula 1 drivers all started off racing carts. Buying a kart can be costly, so you may just want to visit a local kart track and try it out first.

, Some organizations will give any beginner that applies a license so they can start entry level races to learn the sport. To get into more serious races, you will need to continue to apply for higher licenses. You may need to pass a test given at an accredited school, or show proficiency at racing at your current level before being allowed to move up.

, If you are going to race you need some wheels. There are different vehicles for different levels of race, and you will probably need to buy or rent several karts before you move up to racing cars., Placing well in races is a big part in how quickly your racing career advances. The better you perform the sooner you will reach the next level. If you plan on getting to Formula 1, you will need to race as much as you can and always be looking to move up to the next level.

Complete two years in junior single seater racing events.,
Turn 18 years old.,
Accumulate 40 race points.,
Accumulate 300 driving hours in a Formula 1 car.",How to Become an F1 Driver3," Formula 1 requires drivers to have a good deal of experience driving similar vehicles. While there are many possible race series that can be your path to Formula 1, all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up., Formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license. Some younger racers are good enough to be considered for Formula 1, but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age. If you are still too young, look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points.

, These points are acquired based on performance and placement in junior race series events. 40 points must be acquired over a 3-year period to be eligible to get your Formula 1 license.

, To be eligible to hold the racing license you need to have a good handle on driving the car. These hours can be logged doing practice laps or test drives for car manufacturers.

Accept an offer to drive for an F1 team.,
Getting sponsorships.,
Pay to drive in F1.",How to Become an F1 Driver4," If you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team. These teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs. They usually sign their drivers on a season-to-season basis.

, Most Formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track. To attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion. You may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on-track work. Racing is a very expensive sport, so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible.

, Pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports, including Formula 1. Instead of being paid by the race team, the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations.While this isn't practical for most new racers in Formula 1, it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it.

Watch the track crew water down the track.,
Pull onto the track with the rest of the participants to drive slowly, packing the track down.,
Participate in the qualifying laps.,
The track will be very crowded during racing, so be cool at first until the pack spreads out and thins out.,
As much as possible, stay to the outside in the straightaways and move to the inside through the turns.,
When going through the turns, get the car into a slide, kicking the rear out toward the outside wall.,
When turning, be careful of the infield.,
Remember that you are most vulnerable when turning.,
Don't pass on the outside during turns, and don't pass on the inside on the straightaways.,
Drive with the transmission in the lowest gear possible.,
Keep a keen eye out for debris on the track.,
Plan ahead.,
By the time the race is over, twenty-five laps or so, there may be only two or three cars still running at all, the rest having returned to the pits or sitting dead on the track.",How to Race a Junker on a Dirt Track," Depending on the season's rainfall, the track may be hard or soft. The additional water will make it a little slippery, a lot slippery, downright muddy, or a mix of the three.;
, No speeding, no passing, no bumping; just drive around. This is a good time to get used to the bumps and the bank on the curves. Hit the gas hard a few times to see how easy wheelspin is, but don't get out of control.

, You'll get three or four laps at full speed with no other traffic around. The fastest qualifiers will compete for trophies. Everyone else will just run for fun the rest of the night. This is the time to push your car as hard as you can without spinning out. Find the muddy parts, the hard, dry parts and the slippery parts.

, Make your way around the first couple of laps without bumping any other cars.

, You want to make your path through the turn as straight as possible to avoid scrubbing off speed.

, Maintain this slide through the turn by steering to the opposite direction than the turn. Keep the front wheels in the direction you want the car to go, regardless of where the front of the car is pointing.

, If there's not a wall between the track and the infield, there will certainly be a ridge of dirt. Bumping your left front wheel against this will affect traction on that wheel, and you could lose control. If you bump the infield, move the car a bit towards the outside.

, Other drivers will try to spin you by bumping your left rear just behind the rear axle with their right front (known by police as the PIT maneuver). This will cause you to spin out, lose position, and possibly crash. If you know there is a driver in position to spin you this way, don't slide as much, if at all.

, Doing so enables the other driver to push you to the wall or the infield, respectively. Getting pushed to the infield is much worse than going to the wall. The infield, if not walled off, is a complete mud bog that you'll spend many laps trying to get out of, if you can get out at all.

, Example: if you can only get up enough speed to get high in first gear, but not shift to second, leave the car in first, not drive. The engine will help slow the car down when you brake for turns, and your acceleration will be more immediately responsive going into the straightaway.

, If someone has lost a bumper on the outside of the backstretch, remember to stay to the inside. You may also be able to use debris to your advantage by coercing other drivers into it.

, When you see a crash, think about what you're going to do when you come around the track again, because the wreck will probably still be there, and could be worse. Consider a wreck to be a giant piece of debris, and use it to your advantage as well.

, The key to winning is finishing, and the key to finishing is keeping your car moving. Drive aggressively, but also be very calculating. If you're not in good track position to muscle someone out of the way, bide your time.

If you are smart and lucky you will recognize early that you've become addicted and will get your daily driver off of the track and buy a dedicated track car.,
After over 40 track days, you may begin think about racing.",How to Race Your Car," Racing your car on public roads is dangerous and illegal. You will also have a lot more fun on a track that is made for speed and safety. Search on the Internet (see ""External Links"" below) or look in a phone book.






;
, Call the racetrack on the phone and ask when they will be hosting a ""Driver's Education"" event or when it will be open for the public. You should not race your car until participating in a Driver's Education event. If the track knows of none, search on the Internet for ""motorsports clubs"" in your area. If you have a car with a racing heritage like Audi, Porsche, BMW, Subaru, etc., search for that club (i.e., Porsche Club of America). When you go to any track, if there is classroom time, avail yourself of the wisdom which will be imparted. Many racers began their careers participating in autocross events. Contact the local NASA (National Auto Sport Association) or do an online search.








, On the day of your first Driver's Education event, check all of the mechanics of your car including oil (which should be topped off), tire pressure (a few PSI higher than normal-ask the instructor or another participant), tire tread, steering fluid, brake fluid and brakes. If you are not experienced in doing a safety check on your car, take it to a mechanic and tell the mechanic you plan on racing the car. When you get to the track, check the tire pressure and oil again. Look under ""Things You'll Need"" (below) for a list of items to bring to the track.








, Every event has different rules. One common rule is a prohibition on passing, among the most dangerous of racing moments. Find out the rules from the event organizer.








, Feel the track. Be the track. On the track, go around twice at a normal rate of speed to get the lay of the land; if possible, get out and walk the track paying special attention to the turns. Commit the track to memory by drawing it on paper, noting turn-in and track-out points. Do a drive-through with an instructor if at all possible. Don't be scared of the track (AKA: An ""O'Gorman""), but give it the proper caution and respect.








, When you first go on track at speed, follow an experienced driver. Every turn is approached with a minds-eye view of entry & exit and understanding of apexes. The prime apex point is the point in the center of the turn which will produce the fastest exit speed. Depending on track conditions(debris)and traffic you may need to use an early or late apex. You want to maintain as shallow an arc from your entry (turn-in point) to the exit (track-out)point. You should always maximize the amount of road surface used.








, Rather than braking incrementally when going into a curve, it is best to be going as fast as you are prepared to and to then brake fast. This does not mean slamming on your brakes to the point where you could go into a spin (a common mistake) but it does mean knowing when to brake at the last possible moment. Braking can be practiced daily on interstate off-ramps, etc. Braking is usually done to impending lock-up. With ABS, you simply stand on the brakes. Braking can slow the car to the speed necessary to successfully negotiate a turn as well as settle the car at turn-in or when used in combination with steering and acceleration can cause the car to begin to rotate in order to carry more speed into a corner. A teacher familiar with the track can tell you exactly when you should start braking and turning and even where your car should be positioned going into turns.








, Or you can start drifting if you know how to and take a steady and compressive turn and go out of it without losing much speed.








, If you are driving under ""No Pass"" rules, this usually means that passing is still allowed if consent is given. Ask first. If this is the case, ask for the signal to show your consent. You should not be doing a lot of passing (or any passing) as a novice but you should be getting passed often. When you see a driver approaching rapidly, the driver may well be looking for your signal. It is important to be courteous by giving this signal whenever it is safe to do so. This signal is usually an arm point out straight to the left if you wish the driver to pass to your left or, if to the right, your arm out the window and bent over the roof pointing to your right. Give the signal clearly with your arm fully extended. Immediately upon giving the signal, make sure your car behaves as if it is ready to allow passage on the side you indicated. Do not point right and then track right. Stay in your line of travel. Only give a passing signal on straightaways.








, While most tracks attach the same meaning to each flag, there is some local variation. Use this paragraph as a guide but be sure to check with the event organizer. The following will usually apply:
A solid green flag means that the warm-up lap has ended and that passing may commence (when passing is allowed and then only according to rules of consent).
A blue flag with a diagonal yellow stripe means that you need to allow the car behind you to pass. This is usually only shown when you have already failed to do the right thing without request. At the next passing zone, give the signal and hold your line.
A stationary yellow means that there is some type of danger ahead. Slow down and use caution.
A waving yellow means that there is a disabled car on the track. Slow down and prepare to go off your line to avoid the car.
A flag with alternating yellow and red vertical stripes means that there is debris on the track (e.g., an oil slick). Slow down and watch for debris on the road.
A black flag means that there is something wrong with your car. If the black flag is shown at all flag stations, it means that all cars are being called back to the pit, usually because there has been a crash or there is something else obstructing the track. Safely slow your vehicle, indicate to the flagger that you have seen the flag and pull into the pits for instruction from the track master.
A red flag means you must stop your car immediately. Brake slowly and be aware that another car may be behind you. Come to a stop, preferably off to the side. Stay still and stay in your car. There may be emergency vehicles entering the track. Wait for instruction.
A black flag with a yellow meatball means that the run group is about to end. Proceed through the checkered flag and slow to a cool-down lap.










, The last run is called a ""cool-down"" lap because you are cooling down the brakes, which, by now, may be hot enough to melt rubber. Go slow and try not to use your brakes at all. Wave at all the corner workers. Use all of your fingers.








, When you are driving, position your hands at 3:00 and 9:00 clock format. This will give you the best response time and best posture at high speeds.








, Keep both front windows down. This is necessary so you can signal a pass and arguably safer in crashes where the glass breaking would otherwise cause injury. Also keep your radio off. You want to hear the noises your car is communicating to you, not your music.








, You will be shocked at how difficult it is. Early in your development you will be assigned an instructor at each Driver's Education event. As you improve and the different organizations get to know you, you will be allowed to drive without on instructor.








, You will be shocked at how fast you go through brake pads, rotors and tires. the additional strain on your car will have you replacing other unexpected items.








, If you are especially clever, buy a dedicated track car that will easily join a popular and relatively inexpensive race class.








, Each racing organization has a Competition School that is necessary to get your Novice License.

Invite feedback.When you write a review, there will be many people who agree with you and many who disagree with you.",How to Write a Car Review," If you’re reviewing an environmentally-friendly electric car, you should include relevant information about how much C02 is being reduced per trip.


If you’re writing for a car enthusiast magazine, you can probably include more details than if you were writing for a mainstream magazine or newspaper, since the car enthusiast will be more literate about cars than the average person.;
, There are many ways to being your review. The tone you adopt in your writing and the path you take when beginning your review is dependent on your audience, your experience with the car, and the outlet you’re writing for. Whatever you do in your first few sentence, make sure you summarize your experience concisely.


Your audience might be receptive to or familiar with the car or manufacturer of a particular vehicle. You might want to start by addressing preconceptions, anxieties, or stereotypes. For instance, you might write, “While the GeoCar has been widely panned by critics and industry insiders, it’s everything a modern driver needs.”
You could start with a quote.The quote could be from a famous person or, if it’s very memorable, from someone you know. The quote must be appropriate and relevant to your driving review. For instance, you could write, “Henry Ford wrote that ‘Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.’ Today, his company is still doing it right even as market diversification ensures that far fewer people are looking.”
If the driving experience was exceptionally wonderful or terrible, come right out and say so in a powerful way. You might write of a great car, “Only word is needed to describe the new NTX 9100: ‘Wow.’”

, Organizing a review requires identifying the major components or aspects of the car which will be useful for readers and talking about each in turn.The organization of your review depends on the car, how many words you can write, what the audience is looking for, and the editor’s preferences.


Generally, you’ll start with a summary of your experience and end with a final evaluation.
The middle parts of the review are highly customizable. A car review might have sections on safety features, style and design, engine specifications, technological innovations, or the car’s ability to drive on rough surfaces.

, A common ranking systems assigns a value of one to five stars to the car.You might choose a scale of one through five stars, with five stars being a perfect car. Alternatively, you could rank the car on a 1 through 100 scale, assigning a higher value to a better car.You could also choose to forego a final score and let your writing speak for itself as to your feelings about the car.
In addition to an overall final rating, you could provide separate sub-ratings for various aspects of the car like its value, design, and safety.
Develop a rubric to rate your car. For instance, perhaps you give three stars in the ""Acceleration"" category to a car that reaches sixty miles per hour in 12 seconds, four stars to cars that reach that speed in 8-11 seconds, and five stars to cars that reaches that speed in 7 seconds or less.

, Be clear about the car you’re reviewing. List the manufacturer, year (assuming its a classic car), model, and price. Sometimes this information is introduced in the body of the review. Other times it is presented at the top of the review under a general heading such as, “Review: 2016 Mazda Miata (MSRP: $50,000)” or some similar layout.Your review might also list the final verdict right at the top in the form of a rating based on the five-star rating system.

, How fast does the car accelerate? What are the dimensions of the car? How is the fuel economy? There are also many relevant subjective (opinion-based) details. For instance, how does the car handle? Does it sport a beautiful interior and exterior? Is the steering wheel too big or too small? Use these and other related questions to stay focused when writing your review.


Some details which do not directly pertain to the quality of the car can enhance your writing. The personality of the dealer who provided the car, or the history of the car’s manufacture could be of interest and add personality and depth to your review. Generally, however, you should omit details which are not relevant to the quality of the driving experience.
Don’t include your personal itinerary unless using it to indicate that driving on different types of terrain such as dirt roads leads to a new insight about the quality of the vehicle.

, You should think about the standard features of a Tesla -- the comfortable, modern design and smooth handling, for instance -- and identify whether or not these hallmarks are present in the new model.


If they are, make note of it. You might write, for instance, “The new model is truly a Tesla thoroughbred.”
If the brand’s standard design elements are absent, you should also make note of this. For instance, you could write, “Strangely, the typical features of the Tesla are missing from the new model.”

, The car’s value is not equivalent to its cost. Value refers to how much bang for the buck someone who purchases the car will get. For instance, if the car costs $30,000 but provides far more amenities or is overall a higher quality car than others of a similar price, it has a high value. A car of low value will offer fewer amenities or have a generally lower quality of craftsmanship when compared with others within the same price range.

, Suppose you’re reviewing a new car. Your review should touch on unique technology. For instance, does the car have a new, more efficient GPS system? Does it accept ethanol or another alternative fuel? Can it fly? In your review, address the presence of each major technological element and evaluate whether it did its job. Was the new GPS system much better than traditional GPS? Or did you get lost while using it?

, Sum up your experience by writing something along the lines of, “Overall, this car handles great and would be perfect for a suburban parent or young couple. While it’s not for everyone, this vehicle is an affordable alternative to other cars of its class.”

, If you liked the car -- or if you disliked the car -- explain why. An honest review is useful to the reader. Take a few days after driving the car for the first time to think about what works (and what doesn’t work) in the car’s design.


Judging a car is highly subjective. Write what you think of the car using your experience and prior knowledge of cars. There are no right answers when writing your review, but you must use reason when backing up your opinion.

, Ethical behavior requires that you do not accept more from a given car manufacturer than is necessary to write a review. For instance, if the company offers to loan you a car, only borrow cars you intend to review, and only borrow them for as long as you need to draft your review.


In some cases it’s okay to accept offers from manufacturers as long as gifts and relationships are fully disclosed.

, For instance, do you favor electric cars? Muscle cars? Family or practical cars? Identify the type of car you know the most about and write reviews focused primarily (if not exclusively) on cars within your niche. Use your knowledge of that niche in your review to compare it to other, similar cars of its type.

, Before getting behind the wheel of a car you intend to review, ask the manufacturer, dealer, or someone who has already driven that car what it’s like. Does the car have any quirks? Does it shake when taken past a certain speed? Is the engine very loud? Researching these and other pertinent questions will help you prepare to drive the car and guide your evaluation process.

, Usually, established writers are offered the opportunity to drive new cars for the purpose of reviewing them.If you’re just starting out as an automobile reviewer, you might have to wait until the car is available for the general market in order to give it a go. Visit the car dealership of your choice to find out if you can take the new car for a test drive.


The dealer might dislike the idea of you driving the car about if you don’t have any real intention of purchasing it. Call ahead of time to explain that you want to write a review of the new car. Ask if the dealer allows car reviewers to drive new cars in order to write a review. Perhaps you could work out a mutually beneficial deal with the car dealership such as advertising the dealership on your blog (directly or indirectly) in order to secure continued access to new cars.
If one dealership turns you down, ask another. They all have different rules., A passenger might pick up on things you don’t. Getting the input of another person -- preferably someone who is familiar with cars -- can give you an extra set of eyes and ears on the vehicle you intend to review., Explore the car from top to bottom. In your review, draw attention to whether the car’s features are better, worse, or equal to similar cars. Make note of any irritating qualities like drink holders that are too small, or stereo speakers that fuzz out when the volume gets too loud.

, If you’re serious about starting an auto blog, you’ll want to review the latest vehicles. There are many platforms available for starting a blog. Try sites like Tumblr, Squarespace, or WordPress to find a layout and blog style that speaks to you.

, Autoweek, Motor Trend, and Hot Rod are just some of the many publications catering to car enthusiasts. Contact the editors at the periodical of your choice to learn how to get your car reviews published.Ask the magazine you’re interested in what kind of reviews they are looking for.

, There are a variety of auto enthusiast websites which welcome reader reviews. For instance, you could check the site or forums of Autotrader, Edmunds.com, or CarSurvey.org., Good reviews should be of fifty words or more, have accurate spelling, good grammar, and describe your ownership/driving experience. Use a spellchecker on your word processing program to ensure punctuation and spelling are correct. Avoid capitalization and exclamation marks., By inviting others to critique your review, you keep the conversation going. At the end of your review, allow space for questions and comments. Write something like, “Have you driven this model, too? What did you think of it?” You could also invite readers to write to you directly with follow-up questions at your email address.

Select the date.,
Consider your budget.,
Select the venue.,
Market and promote your show.,
Set up your participant registration.,
Set up entertainment.,
Set up your judging and trophies.",How to Host a Car Show," The date of your event might seem minor, but it could impact the number of show cars and spectators which attend.


Depending on where you are located, choose a month where the climate is mild to warm. Most show car owners will not bring their vehicles out in the dead of winter.
Do a search online and try to select a date where there are not too many events similar to your event.;
, Determine in advance how much you can spend on the event. Your budget should include your investment, estimated vendor fees, sponsor fees, and raffle ticket sales. It will also guide many aspects of the event. Expenses you might incur include your event venue, permits, event insurance, trophies, advertising, flyers, entertainment (DJ, MC, etc.), and raffle prizes.

, Selecting the ideal venue can be tedious at times. Your budget and anticipated number of participants will drive what type of location is required. Indoor locations will drive the cost higher with the need for additional staff, security, lighting, air conditioning, etc.


Indoor locations are often used for larger national events. Outdoor locations can vary from utilizing a racetrack, a park, or even a school parking lot.
Based on the number of anticipated participants for your auto event, call around locally to discuss pricing. In some cases, automotive shops will sponsor the venue for the event. The facilities should have appropriate parking, restrooms, and be accessible to food vendors.

, The most important aspect of planning your car show or automotive event is marketing and promoting the event.


Create or have a designer create a flyer for your event. The flyer should contain the following information:

Event Name and Host
Event Date and Time
Event Venue
Event Type (i.e. Car Show, Racing, Classic Car Show, Imports, etc.)
Car Show judging classes, along with prizes, Entry Fees and Instructions on Registration
Contact Information (Name, Email, Phone, Website, etc.), List or Logo of sponsors and vendors
Any disclaimers
Once your flyer is designed, find a printer locally or online.


Start promoting the event online, and locally, by do the following:

Ask your location's automotive shops to display your flyers on their counters.
Create a Facebook event and share it with your friends.
Post your event on a website free of charge.



, Some events allow participants to pre-registration, while others only allow registration on the day of the show. Allowing attendees to pre-register provides the host with some working capital and a gauge of how many participants will display their vehicle. The incentive for the participant is a discounted registration fee.


If using pre-registration, set up a cutoff date to ensure you have enough time to send electronic conformation and your paperwork is in order.
On the day of the event, assign a person to be responsible for keeping a log and handling all pre-registrations. Either method will require a registration area set up at the entrance of the event. Each vehicle should be provided a window card, with their name, vehicle info, and vehicle class.

, Although all the participants and spectators attending your event are coming for the cars, one should provide other entertainment.


A DJ is the most popular type of entertainment, spinning the latest music for the crowd’s enjoyment. Some events spend the extra cash to hire an MC. An MC will work to keep your crowd engaged and entertained for the day. Other options include hiring a local band, break dance or some other competition, sound system competitions, raffles, etc.
Don’t forget to ensure you have electrical outlets; otherwise, a generator is required.

, Judging of car shows is very important for you participants and should be done fairly with folks knowledgeable of the vehicles. Everyone has different opinions as to what they like, but judging should be taken seriously and be done fairly based on the quality of the build.


Plan out the categories for which you will judge one's car. These include performance, engine cleanliness, interior, paint job, body work, sound, etc.
Develop a point system on how to rank vehicles in each category. Usually, 2-3 judges visit a vehicle, and score them based on the criteria established. Tally up the results and 30-45 minutes before the end of the event is the time to announce the winners.
Most events honor participants with the most points with a trophy. Trophies can range from $10-$100 depending on the size. Be sure to order your trophies 3 weeks in advance to ensure they come on time. In cases where trophies are delivered unassembled, allow yourself enough time to assemble them prior to the event.

Once the car is finished, take it to your local Car show & start winning those trophies!",How to Make a Show Car," Preferably one that does not already require a large amount of work. You don't want to spend all of your time & money on repairing the car.
, If its not a common vehicle make, you may need to come up with your own ideas., These are not cheap, unless you can do it yourself. Some of these modifications are more ideal to leave for the pros to do, they include:

BODY KITS.

You can buy these pre-made or have one custom made.


PAINT.

Although airbrushing & graphics can be cool, it can be over done. Try avoid going over the top, a nice two-tone paint or a nice glossy one colour can score big points.


BODY MODS.

Mods such as, rolling the guards, adding wings/spoilers, aftermarket side mirrors & lights, just look for nice things that you can add to the body of the car. If you have a common make, there will be a lot out there.


INTERIOR.

Trimming seats/dash/pillars/floors/roof etc can score big points. Adding some colour like painting small plastic bits to suit the exterior colour can be good sometimes.
Look for other aftermarket parts like: pedals, shift-knob, steering wheel, and just anything else that is not factory. These items usually very simple to install yourself.
Adding lighting can be good, but try make it hidden so people only see the Glow, there is nothing worse than having a bright light in your face.
Gauges are only cool, if they have a purpose. E.g Boost gauges for TURBO cars only. I.C.E (In Car Entertainment - TV screens, speakers, cd player, dvd players, ps3 or xbox, custom installs, subwoofers, amps, etc etc. All of these items installed properly and customized, can get you big points! Try keep it all one brand and try not to get to mixed up.


ENGINE.

The mods you can do will depend on what kind of car you have, and how fast you want it to go. Best to do some major research. See what can be done. Maybe go to some performance car workshops & see what they purpose. The main things that are done to show cars are: turbo setups or superchargers, custom air intake, custom exhaust system & upgraded parts depending what mods you do.
Adding some colour & polishing metal parts can also score big on engines & engine bays. Try make it look ""bling"" and people will love it.


WHEELS & SUSPENSION & BRAKES.

Massive wheels on a small car and vice versa can look ridiculous. Try the wheels on before buying, try a few sets and pick your favorite.
Suspension & Brakes should be based on what engine mods you have done. You want to go fast, then you have to be able to stop & you want the car to handle good.



, Some States & Countries have banned certain modifications to save getting in trouble with the police, stick to the Law! Most shops can help you with that., You may not win any, it depends on how extreme you go but at least you've got a PHAT RIDE! If you do not want to go to shows, at least you can show it off while cruising & picking up chicks!"
"
Familiarize yourself with the course.,
Plan your driving lines.,
Take your initial track notes.,
Sit correctly in your cart.,
Maintain a consistent hold on the steering wheel.,
Use controlled acceleration.,
Steer as little as possible.,
Brake before corners.Ideally you want to brake as little as possible, and want to be accelerating out of turns.As such, brake before you approach a corner.,
Experiment with different lines.While you'll have a general idea of the lines you want to take from evaluating the course prior to racing, sometimes you need to switch things up.,
Take track notes.",How to Excel at Kart Racing," You'll first want to look over the track so that nothing will surprise you. You don't want to be unaware of a blind hairpin turn after a straightaway! Make a plan. By familiarizing yourself with the basic layout of the track you'll save yourself from nasty surprises and eliminate mistakes., By looking over the track, you'll have an idea of its layout and start to develop a plan of attack.In general, your first approach to the track should be one that you are confident you can pull off with ease.


You can become more aggressive once you have experience handling the track and have a better sense of you vehicle's limits.

, Write down your impressions on the course and your plans for handling its challenges in a log book. Not only will writing it down help you remember your plan during the stress of racing, but you'll be able to compare track notes before and after your run in order to help aid your learning. , Your seating position and center of gravity make a huge difference in how the kart handles. Sit back in the seat and try to relax your body. Don't lean forward or bounce the kart by fidgeting or jumping in the seat.


Leaning forward pushes weight towards the front of the kart, slowing it.
Bouncing the cart shifts weight and can cause the wheels to lose contact with the ground. No contact, no power!

, You should hold the steering wheel near where 9 and 3 appear on a clock face. Some prefer higher or lower (as high as 10 and 2 or as low as 8 and 4). Make sure your hands are symmetrically placed on the kart steering wheel.


Don't grip the wheel too tight. Firm and steady is the way to go to keep your wrists flexible and quick.
Try to consistently use the same hand placement. Familiar positioning will help yourself react instinctively and stay in the zone. , Once you receive the signal to go it may be tempting to mash down on the accelerator, but this isn't always best. Jamming the accelerator from a standstill can cause the wheels to spin rather than effectively grip the surface. You'll need to get the feel for your kart.


If your kart wheels spin when you jam the accelerator, ease back and try to learn the sweet spot of maximum acceleration.
Weather, track, and tire conditions have a major effect too. Be sure to adjust.
If your kart can tolerate jamming the accelerator without losing traction, go for it!

, It almost sounds counter intuitive to steer less, but any deviation from a straight line compromises acceleration. Try to plot your driving and turning to involve as little steering and braking as possible. The straighter your overall course and the smoother your turns are, the faster you'll go!, Apply the minimum amount of brake pressure to stay on course through your curve. Then as you coast through the curve and come out of it you are ready to accelerate again.It's not how fast you get into a corner, but rather how fast you exit it.

, As you get used to a course and the limits of your kart you'll find places where you can push the limits and go even faster.


If turns are too easy - and slow - try braking and turning later and later. See how far you can push the speed envelope while still making a turn.

, After your race, take notes on the course, your kart, and what you felt went both well and poorly. This may seem boring, but is one of the most important things you can do to improve in the future. Just ask any pro and they'll tell you the same thing. Even if you just had your best-ever run, you can always improve! "

Break down a go kart racing tire first.,
Determine which side of the wheel is the short side.,
Get the tire off the wheel.,
Flip the tire and wheel over and push the rim onto a piece of carpet at about a 45 degree angle.,
Make sure that after breaking both beads, place the wheel on a piece of carpet with the valve side down.,
Mount the tire.,
Heat the tire if you have a way to do so.,
Make sure the valve core is removed from the wheel.,
Use something slippery to lube up the edges of wheel and tire, such as tire snot, dishwashing liquid, Simple Green, WD-40,and Greased Lightning.,
Place the tire and wheel in the tire mounting ring.,
Lay the tire band on the floor on its side with open ends facing left and right instead of up and down.,
Put valve cores back in wheels and inflate tires to a middle pressure that you run.",How to Mount Racing Go Kart Tires on One Piece Wheels," There are several kinds of bead breakers made to accomplish this task


This task will be much easier if the tire is hot or at least warm. If you do not have an oven or tire box to heat a tire up, even placing the tire in the bright sunshine for a while will help.
Deflate the tire and remove the valve core completely and place the core in a secure place as you will not need it again until you have a new tire mounted on the wheel.;
, Most of the time the shorter side will be the inside (side without valve stem) of wheel. Place wheel in bead breaker with the shorter side facing up. Adjust bead breaker to fit the size wheel you have and simply push tire off bead. Flip wheel over and repeat process on the other side.

, There is a trick to doing this without using tire irons. It just takes some practice to get the hang of it. But once you do get the hang of it you will be able to remove a tire without risking damage to the tire or wheel which you will be risking if you use tire irons. With the inside of the tire, roll the top of the tire inward, making the bottom tire bead extend itself over the rim. Grab the extended bead and slowly work the tire off the rim until the entire bead has been removed over the rim.

, Hold rim with your left hand and use your right palm to slowly work the outside bead over the inside surface of the rim. This method does take some practice to get the hang of it. If you can't get the tire off using this method then here's how to do it using tire irons, or, heaven forbid, screwdrivers.

, Push one edge of the tire to the narrow middle section of wheel. Take the tire iron and place it on the other side and pull down. Take the other tire iron and do the same thing. Once you have about half of the bead over the rest of the tire should pull over by hand, flip the tire and wheel over and the other edge can be pulled off by hand. Be very careful not to mess up the edge of rim or the bead of tire if using tire again. If you are tossing tire, you don't have to worry about that.

, To accomplish this task you will need a tire mounting ring or tire band as they are sometimes called. There are two basic types, one is a Ratchet style tire band and the other is a Screw type tire band. You will also need an air compressor, of course. Use a compressor with at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank on it. Before starting to inflate tire release some air until compressor kicks on, that way tank is completely full.

, Heat simply makes the rubber softer, thus easier to stretch.

, Do not forget this! Identify the smaller edge of the wheel rim. Most of the time this will be the inside edge of the wheel. Most Douglas wheels have equal size lips but if you look closely one lip is thinner than the other and the edge is more rounded. This smaller edge is the edge you will slide tire over first.

, Avoid getting lube on the inside of tire as much as you can. Place the wheel on a mat or piece of carpet between your knees. Hold the tire like you would a steering wheel and push it against wheel at about a 45 degree angle so that the bead contacts the wheel at 2 points. Now push the tire on to the wheel. The first few times you do this you will most likely be using brute force to accomplish this step. After you have done this several times you will figure out the trick and you will be able to do this without breaking a sweat. Flip the tire and wheel over and repeat process for other side.

, Then, either turn the knob or use a ratchet to secure tire band around tire. Never use band with open end facing up and your face right over it. If the tire blows, your face is toast.

, With everything out in front of the open ends, and both edges of wheel and tire lubed up. Connect and begin pumping the air to it. When tire seals on bead you will hear a very loud POP. Do not stop pumping air when you hear the first pop. Keep pumping air to it until you hear the second POP. Release air as soon as you hear the second POP. And since you remembered to remove valve core, all air will release immediately. You probably do not even want know how much air was in tire when second bead pops on.

, Now would be the time to balance your wheel.

When you brake, hit the pedal in a short, sharp motion.,
Remember that you are taking a wet line away from the rubber.,
Now the kart doesn't turn and spin.,
When you snap that steering wheel round, you will naturally need to lean forward a little because turning the wheel will extend your reach.,
When you get the timing right, you will find the kart turns hard and sharp, and that's when you need to get your weight back over the rear wheels, get the steering straight as possible and accelerate away.

,
Introduce the power gradually, and feel for traction.",How to Drive a Kart in Wet Weather," This should be enough to get the rear tires to lock and bite into the track. A nice gentle push on the brake won't do it because it kills the kart. You want the kart to feel quite lively, and you need to get it working and biting so you can get a feel for the grip that is available. Also, you want to reduce the amount of time on the brakes and braking needs to be out of the way before you turn.;
, Turn into the boot very late, and when you turn the wheel, snap it into full lock hard and fast.

, You turned the wheel so fast and it's like you shocked it into a huge under-steer. But, you are also getting maximum jacking effect from the front end and when the kart finds a bit of grip it will turn very sharply. Also, since the front end is sliding, it is slowing you down too, acting like front brakes.

, Lean forward and toward the outside of the kart. By doing so, you are taking weight from the rear and putting it over the front, which helps the kart to lift the inside rear wheel.

,, Always try for as much traction as possible.

Drain the oil.,
Drain the gas.,
Locate the throttle linkage.,
Find the starter.,
Remove necessary nuts and bolts.,
Take off the drive belt.,
Remove the engine.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine1," Depending on the engine you are using, you may need to use a pair of pliers to disconnect the spark plug wire to remove the oil drain plug.Use a suitable receptacle to drain the oil into, and wipe any spills.


It's best to drain the oil from an engine when it's slightly warm, as the heat allows for a faster flow than when cold.;
, Loosen the fuel hose clamp before you start draining your fuel. You can do so by tracing the route of the fuel hose from the engine to the base of the gas tank. Notice where the hose attaches to your lawn mowers carburetor.Using your pliers, squeeze the clamp loose and slide it upwards on the hose. Now you can detach the hose and drain your fuel into a bucket.

, You can usually find the throttle linkage beneath the carburetor. There will be a cable that should connect to the throttle, and by removing the screw that holds the cable in place, you can easily remove the throttle linkage., This part is on the side of the engine and will have the shape of a small can.Electric-start lawn mowers will have a red battery cabled attached. Use a wrench to unfasten the cable from the starter.

, At the base of your mower engine is the mower house, which is where the engine is seated normally. Using your wrench on the bolt and another to hold still the nut below the mower house, unscrew the bolts holding your engine in place.

, You will find the drive belt on pulley on the crankshaft beneath the engine. Incline the engine slightly forward and pull the drive belt from its pulley., Taking the engine firmly with both hands, lift the engine from the mower house and place it carefully off to the side in a safe place.

Measure the size of your engine.,
Pick a suitable go-kart frame.,
Draw out a true to size basic design of your frame with chalk.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine2," You will need a go-kart frame that is capable of housing the size and weight of your engine. Most 5 to 7 horsepower engines will fit a standard size kart.The vertical shaft engine you choose can be from a riding mower or a push mower, either will work for your go-kart.


Larger engines in the 13 to 22 horsepower range, which you can find on riding mowers, may destroy the transmission or kart., You will want one that can support both your vertical shaft engine and lawnmower gearbox comfortably. Your gearbox should will need to have non-trans axle set-up.

, This will give you a better sense of the dimensions that will be comfortable for your frame.


Most frames have a width that varies between 1/3 and 2/3's the wheelbase of your go-kart, with wider models giving better stability."
"
Cut bumper frame and drill holes for tube padding.,
Install the axle.,
Put in a floor.,
Weld a brace for your seat.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine3," You should round the edges of your bumper by connecting the vertical pieces that link to your frame and the horizontal piece parallel to the back piece of your frame with a short connector cut on a 22.5 degree angle. Drill holes for your tube padding into the back of your bumper.


Drill 5/16"" centered holes through your bumper padding at 1 1/8"" from the padding end.

, Cut a 1"" x 1"" section of square tubing and weld bolts to the ends. A 6"" bolt will go on the driver's side of your kart, while a 4"" bolt will be on the passenger side. Weld the axle underneath the base of the frame.


Always use proper protective gear when welding. Failing to do so can result in significant harm to yourself.

, A 16 gauge sheet metal piece should be sufficient for the floor of your kart. Using your plans from earlier, drill holes in the sheet for the fastening bolts for your seat.

, You should brace both outer sides of the go kart frame with flat, 3/16"" gauge steel. This is where you will install the bench for your seat."
"
Cut and install you steering column.,
Cut the steering hoop and kill switch brace.,
Add resting tabs for brake and throttle.,
Attach spindle brackets.,
Give yourself a foot rest.,
Don't forget your brake band stud.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine4," You should cut a section of 3/4"" x 11 gauge tubing and weld it to your steering tabs. Insert an additional 1"" spacer loosely by the shaft near the steering hoop, grinding the shaft slightly near the hoop if too tight.Drill a three hole pattern with the holes equidistant from the center of the washer at the end of your shaft.

, Make your cuts at a 39 degree angle for your hoop. At this time you should verify that all measurements for your steering assembly are correct for your kart and allow for a full range of motion.


The hoop and shaft should be at a 90 degree angle to one another.

, These 2"" long 3/8"" diameter tabs keep your pedals in their resting and full forward positions. The closest tab to the center of the frame should be fixed a max of 1/2"" after the crosswise piece your to which your steering column is attached. The second tab should be installed 1 3/8"" after the first tab.

, You will weld these to the front axle of your go-kart. The spindle should have a 1"" clearance above the front axle.

, Use a 3/8"" rod in a vise to bend it with a hammer into the shape of your passenger footrest if applicable. This will keep your feet from resting on tie rods.

, This stud will serve as the pivot for your brake band. Weld a 3/8"" round bar to the frame 1 1/2"" after your axle.

"
"
Install your motor mount.,
Attach the throttle cable guide tab.,
Put in the brake rod guide tab.,
Bend your brake rod into shape.,
Give yourself a seat.,
Choose your side rails.,
Weld motor mount and attach accessory parts.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine5," Make sure your motor mount slots allow your engine to slide forward slightly, and then tack the mount into place.No dimensions are included here deliberately, as the size of your mount will change according to engine.


The motor mount should be welded as the final step to building your kart.
Your mount should be able to hold your lawn mower engine in the horizontal position.

, About 4"" away from the middle of the throttle pedal bolt hole, weld this tab to your kart on a 45 degree angle.

, Take your brake rod and insert it through the tab, bending it to adjust it to the brake band. Next, take the tab with the rod inserted and weld it to the kart.

, Bend this 1/4"" round rod so that it angles to meet your brake pedal assembly. Cut the length of your brake rod as needed, and weld eyelets to the rod with a return spring installed brake pedal.

, Many go-kart kits do not bolt seats directly to the kart. If this is the case for you, use a simple frame and bolt this into the seat braces. Your seat should be cut at a 37.5 degree angle for a 105 degree incline for your backrest., There are many different designs you can use, but the traditional side rail is formed of three pieces joined to form a rectangular rail with the side and back of the frame.


Side rails are an optional addition for your go-kart.

, Having finished with the body of your go-kart, you can now weld the mount to your frame. Upon completing your weld, you can add tires, seat padding, and all other necessary hardware to your vehicle.

"
"
Bolt down both motor and gearbox to the mount.,
Change the sprocket size for the gearbox.,
Utilize, for clutching, the manual belt slip clutch from the lawnmower.,
Attach a throttle cable to throttle linkage on carburetor.",How to Create a Go Kart with a Lawnmower Engine6," The location of your motor is not as important as that of the gearbox.To properly install your gearbox, align it with the gear on the rear axle, and then bolt it into place.

, A sprocket is a gear toothed wheel inside your gearbox that controls the gear ratio for your transmission, which is another name for the gearbox. Your target gear will be about 16 teeth.

, One end of your clutch should be installed into the engine, with the side protruding a sprocket connecting to your gearbox. If you lack a manual belt slip clutch, you can buy a centrifugal force clutch from your local auto parts store and use that instead.The ratio between your motor and transmission should be 1 to 1.

, Now you can clean off any residual oil from your kart, but do so with care. Always allow for sufficient time for the materials you are working on to cool, like the engine or solder, before using a cleaner.

Draw up detailed plans for the go-kart you want to make.,
Size the go-kart appropriately.,
Gather your materials.,
Obtain a welder.,
Consider buying a go-kart kit.,
Cut the metal tubing.,
Weld the frame together according to your design.,
Assemble the front stub axles.,
Install your rear axle and wheel assembly.,
Build your seat out of plywood and bolt it to the frame.,
Install the engine mount.,
Assemble your steering linkage.,
Install the wheels and brakes.,
Attach the throttle cable to the hand throttle.,
Double check your brakes and suspension system before test-driving.",How to Build a Go Kart," Go karts can be many different sizes, shapes, and designs. These homemade vehicles are amenable to any design elements you want to throw into it. The basic essentials are a chassis, a simple engine, and a steering/braking system.Get creative in your planning for the project and produce detailed diagrams to make sure you get enough materials to complete the job. Look at other go-karts for inspiration and learn from kart-makers who've been there before.
Alternatively, you can find schematics and plans online for many different types of models, if you'd rather let someone else do the planning. Use a template and modify it as you see fit.;
, The size of the go-kart should depend on the age and size of the driver. For young drivers, about 30 inches (0.76 m) wide by 50 inches (1.3 m) long will work, while adults will want about 40 inches (1 m) wide by 72 inches (1.8 m) long.


It's important to plan the go-kart accurately, using specific measurements, otherwise it'll be difficult to get the right materials and the right amount of them.

, If you're short on cash, visit a scrap yard and see if you can pick up any low-cost parts. Or, you may be able to salvage parts from an old riding lawnmower or a junk go kart found at a yard sale. Ask lawn mower repair services for spare parts or junked out riding lawnmowers and used 4 cycle engines in the 10 to 15 horsepower range, with horizontal shaft and a drive clutch assembly. Here's what you'll need:


For the chassis:

30 feet (9.2 m) of 1-inch (2.5 cm) square tubing
6 feet (1.8 m) of 0.75-inch (2 cm) round steel barstock
6 feet (1.8 m) of 0.5-inch (1.5 cm) bar stock
3/16-inch (0.5 cm) thick steel plate in a width and length slightly larger than your engine
Plywood or metal (for seat and floorboards)
Seat


For engine:

Engine (try an old lawnmower engine)
Chain that fits the sprocket
Bolts, washers
Gas tank


For the drive train:

Wheels
Steering wheel
Gear and handbrake
Drive shaft
Bearings
Steering shaft
Brake pedal
Throttle/go pedal



, If you've got no experience welding, you will have to hire a welder for this project. The most essential part of the go-kart is a solid chassis that'll hold you onto it while driving and house the engine. If you're going to weld it together out of pieces of barstock, the welds should all be made with the proper heat, weld depth/penetration and uniform weld-beads. Otherwise, the welds may be weak, brittle, bubbly, cracked and/or only surface deep, making your go-kart a death trap.


If you don't have experience welding, don't start by putting together a go-kart. Start with other smaller projects if you want to learn.

, If you're not interested in welding and designing your own go-kart, purchase a no-weld kit that you can put together with simple tools, featuring detailed instructions and schematics to make the job a snap.Available widely for about $550 dollars, you can have the satisfaction of putting together a go-kart yourself without the hassle of designing it and buying all the materials separately.

, Cut your lengths of tubing to the appropriate lengths, given your design or schematics.


For most designs, the front end will feature a camber angle, narrower than the rear, which will allow the wheels room to turn, allowing the chassis to twist slightly. To do this, mount a King Pin at the front corners where the wheels will be, to allow for easy twist.
For an easy eye-guide, consider marking up the floor of the garage or the area you're working with sidewalk chalk of the appropriate measurement, to keep you from having to remeasure repeatedly. You could even draw out the whole design on the ground and start laying it on top.

, Use concrete blocks to keep the frame elevated while you work, making sure all your connection points are solid and the chassis is secure. It needs to be strong enough to hold your weight and the weight of the engine, so it's not the time for a shoddy weld job. For more strength, use gussets at all corners.

, Build your axle with a straight piece of 0.75-inch (2 cm) steel rod, and two bushings attached to your frame. Use washers and cotter pins drilled through the axle to keep the assembly in position.


Install the front stubs that'll allow you to turn easily before messing with the steering column and attach your King Pin, to the steering arm. You'll need to have at least 110 degrees of angle on the front wheels, so plan accordingly., You'll likely need to assemble an axle carrier with a bearing bracket for the rear axle, meaning that the axle itself can be welded to the frame while also spinning freely and snugly.Weld a steel plate onto the chassis, securing the pressure plate outside with high-tensile bolts and lock nuts, to squeeze the bearing.


Rather than making your own, you can also purchase these assemblies, sometimes called ""Pillar Bearing Units.""

, Drill holes in the plywood and install T nuts within the holes to provide support when bolting the seat to the frame. Cover the plywood with 2"" high density foam, then cover the foam with marine vinyl. Secure the vinyl to the seat by stapling it to the underside or back portion of the plywood. Alternatively, you can try to salvage an old go-kart seat or an appropriately-sized car seat from the junk yard to save money. Leave enough room for the steering, engine, and other controls.

, Weld a flat piece of 3/16-inch (0.5 cm) thick steel plate to the rear frame to mount your engine. Place the engine on the plate, and mark the holes for the mounting bolts so that the engine pulley lines up with the drive pulley on your axle.


Attach the drive pulley on the axle prior to mounting the axle in the bushings. You can either use a set screw to hold it in position, or weld it directly to the axle, but it should be aligned with the pulley on your engine.

, Use the 0.5-inch (1.5 cm) steel rod for linkages, and the 0.75-inch (2 cm) for your axles. To make the 90-degree bends in the 0.75-inch (2 cm) rod, you may have to use a torch to heat the steel.


Provide adjustable links for aligning steering, because it is very important to have the proper caster and camber: front-wheel vertical and steering tilt.

, Get some small racing wheels to give your kart the optimum acceleration and control. Fix them onto the axles with hubs and start working on the brakes, so the go-kart will be safe.


For the brakes, fix a disc onto the rear axle and a caliper assembly onto the chassis for the most professional system possible. Often, you can acquire these assemblies in relatively good shape from junked motorbikes. They're the appropriate size and will be easy to work with.
Install a brake pedal to operate with your foot, regardless of what kind of acceleration you have. Don't leave too much to do with your hands other than steering.

, Depending upon your experience and the kind of engine you're working with, you may be able to put together a foot pedal, or you may just need to make it easy and throttle-up like you would a lawnmower.

, Even if you're going at relatively slow speeds, it's important to make sure you're not going to slip an axle on your first go-around. Double check your welds, your brakes, and the engine's mounting. Then take 'er for a spin!

Your car must be repossessed without “breaching the peace.” If it is not, then you can raise breach of peace as a counterclaim to the deficiency lawsuit.“Breach the peace” has no clear definition; however, there are some common examples:the lender broke into your garage to take the car
the lender physically removed you from the car from repossessing it
the lender confronted you and tried to intimidate you


Be sure to document the repossession. Videotape it, if possible. You should also take pictures of any broken locks or damage done to your property during the repossession.
At a minimum, write down your memories of the repossession. Did the lender confront you? What was said? Were threats made? These notes, written soon after the repossession, can help you later at trial.;
, After the creditor sells the car, you should receive a letter explaining how much the car sold for and the amount that remains on your loan. The letter should also outline what costs the creditor incurred to sell your car. These costs can include advertising fees and storage fees.You should receive this letter within 10 days of the sale.The letter might threaten you with further action, such as a lawsuit. You should take this letter seriously.
Double check to make sure that the loan balance amount is right. Look through your own paperwork to see how much money you owe.

, Because the creditor might sue you for the loan deficiency, you should begin thinking about what defenses to bring. Sometimes the loan paperwork might be faulty. In that situation, you can claim that the faulty paperwork prevents the creditor from suing you. Check for the following as you read the loan papers:The loan paperwork might not have granted the creditor a security interest in the car. Read your loan documents. If the lender does not have a security interest, then it was not entitled to repossess your car.
The loan paperwork didn’t give the creditor the right to sue you for the deficiency.
The creditor who wants to sue you is not the same creditor on the loan document. Furthermore, it has no document showing that the loan was validly assigned to it. In this situation, the plaintiff has no standing to sue you because you don’t owe it money.

, State law requires that the creditor give you proper notice of your deficiency. You should have received these notices before the creditor sells the car. Take them out and look to see that all of your rights were included. If not, you could challenge the deficiency judgment in court.The notices typically must inform you of:


your right to redeem the car and when you could do that
your right to reinstate the loan (if allowed by state law) and when you could do that
the date of the car sale, if it was a private sale
the date, time, and location of the auction, if the car was sold at auction
a calculation of the deficiency balance

, The creditor must also sell the car in a “commercially reasonable manner.” This is a vague standard, but it essentially means that the creditor must use good faith in getting full value for the car.Accordingly, you can defend against a deficiency claim by challenging how the creditor sold the car. Look for the following, which is generally not commercially reasonable activity:


The creditor sold the car to friends or family. This is not commercially reasonable.
The creditor didn’t sell the car. If the creditor decides to keep the car, then your debt is fully satisfied and you can’t be sued.The creditor made a private sale when most repossession sales in your area are handled by auction.
The creditor did not get the car appraised before selling it for junk.The creditor did not advertise the sale and did not let interested buyers inspect the vehicle.
The advertisements did not describe the car accurately (make, model, mileage, general condition).
The creditor waited too long to sell, allowing the car to depreciate in value as it sat in a lot.

, At a minimum, you should meet with a lawyer for a half-hour consultation. Many attorneys now provide free or reduced-price consultations. At the consultation, you can describe your situation and get the lawyer’s advice about what defenses are best to bring.


To find a lawyer, you can visit your state’s bar association, which should have information on finding a lawyer in your state. The bar association may also run a referral program.
If costs are a concern, understand that most states allow you to hire a lawyer to do only discrete tasks. This is called “limited scope representation.” For example, you could hire a lawyer to draft court documents for you or to coach you about how to handle a trial. Ask during your consultation whether the attorney offers this service., You can try to negotiate a settlement with the creditor. If you succeed, then you can avoid going to court. Settlement negotiations are beneficial because you can resolve the dispute faster, thus giving you peace of mind. However, you will probably have to pay the creditor something in order to settle. If you think you have a strong defense, you might want to decline to negotiate.

, Alternately, you might want to use mediation. In mediation, you and the creditor will meet with a neutral third party. This person is called the mediator, and his or her job is to listen to both you and the creditor describe the dispute. Like settlement negotiations, mediation is voluntary. You or the creditor can walk away at any time.


The mediator is not a judge. Instead, the mediator helps the parties come up with creative, workable solutions that both parties can agree to.If you are interested in mediation, then you should check whether your local courthouse offers a mediation program. Also, you can call your local or state bar association to check if there is a mediation program you can use.

, Arbitration is like a trial. You and the creditor will present your dispute to a neutral third party, the arbitrator, who acts like a judge. The arbitrator’s decision is usually binding, which means you agree to abide by the arbitrator’s decision at the outset. Arbitration has some benefits over a trial: it is private and usually goes much faster. If you want to arbitrate, then you should think about hiring a lawyer to represent you.


Unfortunately, you might waive your right to appeal if you arbitrate.For this reason, you should think carefully before agreeing to arbitration. Although a trial may be slower, you would still keep your ability to appeal should you lose.

, If the creditor does decide to sue you, then you will need to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner. The creditor begins the lawsuit by filing a complaint. This document will describe the facts surrounding the lawsuit.


You will receive a copy of the complaint and a summons. The summons will tell you how much time you have to respond.Make note of the date.

, In your answer, you respond to each allegation made in the complaint. Many courts now have “fill in the blank” answer forms for you to use.Ask the court clerk or check the court’s website.


Alternately, you might need to draft your answer using a CD or book of legal forms.

, In your answer, you can raise any affirmative defenses which would allow you to win. With an affirmative defense, you win even if everything the plaintiff says in the complaint is true. There are some common affirmative defenses:


The lender waited too long to sue. Each state gives people only a limited amount of time to bring a lawsuit. This is called the “statute of limitations.”To find your statute of limitations, search for “repossession deficiency statute of limitations” and “your state” on the Internet.
Your state doesn’t allow deficiency judgments. Some states don’t allow creditors to get deficiency judgments.In this situation, you can get the case tossed out of court.
Deficiencies in the loan paperwork (see above).

, You can also raise counterclaims in your answer. Although these are not affirmative defenses, they might induce the creditor to enter into settlement negotiations with you if they are true.


As counterclaims, you can raise any deficiency in the repossession process. For example, if the lender breached the peace in retrieving your car, then raise that as a counterclaim.Also point out any deficiencies in the notices you were given or in the manner of sale of the car.

, After you finish your answer, you should take it to the court where the creditor filed suit. Tell the court clerk that you want to file your answer. The clerk will stamp all of the copies with the date. One copy is for your records. Another copy is for the creditor.


You must send a copy of your answer to the creditor’s attorney (if one is listed on the complaint) or to the creditor (if no attorney is listed).Ask the court clerk for acceptable methods of service.

, Discovery is the fact-finding phase of a lawsuit. You and the creditor can request information from each other. The most common discovery techniques include:Requests for production. Here, you request relevant documents in the plaintiff’s custody and control. To defend against the deficiency judgment, you should seek any paperwork related to the sale of the car.
Interrogatories. These are written questions the creditor must answer under oath. Interrogatories are helpful for getting basic information. For example, you could get the name of the auctioneer (if the car was sold at auction) or the name of the private party the car was sold to (if sold to a private party).
Depositions. In a deposition, you ask witnesses questions in person. A court reporter will record the testimony, which can sometimes be used later at trial. Depositions typically take place in an attorney’s office.

, At the close of discovery, either you or the plaintiff can bring a motion for summary judgment. The purpose of the motion is to argue that a trial is unnecessary because there are no issues of material fact for a jury to resolve. You also argue that the law favors you so much that it would be impossible for the creditor to win at trial.Summary judgment motions are technical and require extensive familiarity with the law. If you want to bring one, then you should think about hiring an attorney to draft it for you.

, If you lose the motion for summary judgment, you will probably have to go to trial. At trial, you will pick a jury, cross-examine the creditor’s witnesses, and present witnesses of your own. If your creditor has a lawyer, then you should try to have a lawyer defend you in court as well.


If you can’t afford a lawyer, then see Represent Yourself in Court (U.S.) for tips on how to defend yourself in court.

, If you lose at trial, you might be able to bring an appeal. Talk to a lawyer about whether it is worth the time and effort. Appeals generally take a year or longer to resolve. You also might have to pay the creditor or purchase a bond to cover the judgment against you.

Find legal help.",How to Co‐Own a Car," One way to co-own a car is to purchase it together with another person. You can then put both of your names on the car’s title. On the title, you will need to specify how you and the other person are holding the car. There are typically two options:Joint tenancy. With this arrangement, the car automatically goes to the other person upon one co-owner’s death. To create a joint tenancy, list your names as “Mary Smith or Michael Jones.”

In some states, however, creating a joint tenancy allows one owner to sell the car without the other owner’s consent. To prevent that from happening, you can list the names as “Mary Smith and Michael Jones, as Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship.”


Tenancy in common. Under this arrangement, you can leave your half of the car to whoever you want if you die. To create a tenancy in common, list your names as “Mary Smith and Michael Jones.”;
, If you buy from a dealer, you might need to finance the purchase with a loan. The lender might require that both co-owners be on the loan. However, you might have the option of taking the loan out in only one person’s name but putting both names on the title. If you choose the second option, then you will need a joint ownership agreement, which should contain the following:The statement of agreement: “Mary Smith and Michael Jones agree as follows:”.
The details about the loan. “Mary has entered into an agreement with First Lending Car Loans to take out a car loan for $18,000 to purchase a . Mary has agreed to pay First Lending Car Loans the sum in monthly installments of $350, inclusive of interest, for 60 months, due on the first of every month beginning February 1, 2016.”
A statement that you own the car equally: “We intend that this car is owned equally by both of us and we each will pay one-half of the cost.”
Details about how the person not on the loan will give the money to the borrower: “Michael agrees to pay Mary $175 one week before payment is due. Mary will then pay First Lending Car Loans in a timely manner.”
Information on how the person not on the loan can buy out the other owner: “If Mary no longer wants to own the car, then Michael can enter into an agreement with First Lending Car Loans to take over the payments himself, and pay Marry one-half of the difference, if any, between the car’s current resale value and the amount of money still owed.”
An explanation of how the person on the loan can buy out the other owner: “Mary may buy the car from Michael by agreeing to be solely responsible for the monthly payments to First Lending Car Loans and by paying Michael one-half the difference, if any, between the car’s current resale value and the amount of money still owed to First Lending Car Loans.”
Whether the ownership percentage will change if one person fails to contribute to the monthly car payment. For example: “Should either fail to make the required share of the payment, the other may do so. Accordingly, this person’s ownership percentage will be increased. If, for example, Mary makes 12 payments without Michael contributing, her share of the car will increase to 60/40.”
A statement that the agreement can only be modified in writing.
The signature of both co-owners.

, If you already own a car, you can sell a share to someone else. You also could purchase a share of someone else’s car.You need to come up with a fair price to pay or charge. Visit the Kelley Blue Book website for information on the current market value for used cars.You must follow your state’s procedures for putting another person’s name on the registration and title. To find the requirements, visit your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). In New York, for example, you can’t simply add someone to the current registration or title certificate. Instead, you must apply for a new registration and a new title certificate in the names of both owners.Buying a used car can trigger different fees that you have to pay. To find the full fee schedule, contact your state’s DMV.

, Before purchasing a share of someone’s car, be sure to check for any liens on the car. A car may have a lien when the owner owes someone money. The creditor then puts a lien on the car to secure the debt. If the car is sold, then the lien holder actually gets his or her debts paid off before the car owner. A lien holder can also foreclose on the car if the debt is not paid. In this situation, the owner loses the car.


Of course, if the owner took out a loan for the car, then the loan company should have a lien on the vehicle.There is no reason to refuse to buy a share of a car simply because the owner took out a loan to purchase it. Instead, ask the owner for proof that he or she is current on payments. If you doubt the owner’s financial stability, then you should refuse to buy a share of the car.
To find out whether a car has a lien on it, you should ask to see copies of the car’s title and registration. These documents should state whether the car has a lien.
You also should get the car’s VIN (vehicle identification number), which is on the car’s dashboard. Take this number to the DMV and ask for a car history. This history will show whether someone has a lien on the car.Look for liens held by those other than the bank that lent the owner money to purchase the car. If there are multiple additional liens, then you should avoid buying a share of the vehicle.

, In most states (41 of 50), you will need to get the permission of the lender before you can put a co-owner’s name on the title.Contact your state’s DMV to ask about the specific process. In some states, the DMV will make the request to your lender. In other states, you need to contact the lender directly.You will not need permission if you live in:Kentucky
Maryland
Michigan
Minnesota
Missouri
Montana
New York
Oklahoma
Wyoming


You may also have to pay off other lienholders, such as mechanics who have made repairs but have not been paid. In this situation, you would need to pay the debt and get a release of lien form completed. Contact your DMV for your state’s requirements.
If the owner has multiple liens because of unpaid debts, you should think carefully before becoming the co-owner of a vehicle with someone who has trouble paying debts.

, You might agree that only one person will put his or her name on the registration and title to the car. You can then agree to share the vehicle. However, there are downsides to this approach:


An insurance company might not add the second driver to the policy if he or she is not an owner or a family member.Should the second owner wreck the car, then your insurance company will probably not cover the accident.
You should be careful about relying on an informal (particularly oral) agreement. These are difficult to enforce in court because there are no documents. Instead, the lawsuit becomes a “he said, she said” situation. Watch an episode of Judge Judy to see how judges treat these kinds of lawsuits.
If you want an informal agreement, then be sure to write down the terms of the agreement in a contract.

, Before becoming the legal co-owner, you should sit down with the other person and set rules for sharing the car. Try to come to as much agreement as possible about when you will use the car and for what purpose. Be sure to discuss the following:Your schedules. When will you need the car? For how long?
Can either person use the car for a longer trip? Do you need permission from the other owner?
Who can ride in the car?
Who owns the objects inside the car? For example, who owns the windshield scraper, the radio (if added to the car), and the floor mats?
Can you smoke or transport animals in the car? Can you eat or drink?
How do you handle refueling issues: does each co-owner need to make sure that there is a minimal amount of gas in the car at all times?
Who will pay for insurance and how much will each driver contribute? Who will pay for the car’s upkeep, such as repairs and inspections?
Who will pay for the car to be cleaned?

, As you talk, take notes about what you agree to and then sit down and type up a formal agreement. For information on how to draft an agreement, see Write a Legal Contract.


You should try to be as detailed as possible. The more you can include in the agreement the better. When both co-owners understand the rules, then you can pre-empt most disputes.

, You should sign the agreement to make it a formal contract. You should also sign the agreement in front of a notary public. Notaries can be found at most courthouses and in large banks. To find a notary, visit the American Society of Notaries website, which has a Notary Locator feature.Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification to the notary. Typically, a valid driver’s license or passport should be sufficient.
Also remember to give a copy to the other owner so that he or she can look at it whenever a dispute arises.

, When problems arise about using the car, you should try to resolve them as soon as possible. Meet face-to-face to discuss any disagreements. Using email or leaving notes can often inflame tensions because the other person might misinterpret your written statements. Indeed, about 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal., Effective communication requires that you hear what the other person is saying. To communicate peacefully, try the following:Sit in an open manner. Do not cross your arms or turn your body away from the other person.
Make eye contact.
Ask the other co-owner about his or her needs. If you don’t understand their situation, ask for more detail.
Don’t interrupt.
Try to mirror by summarizing the other person’s needs and concerns. After summarizing, ask if you understand their situation correctly.

, However, don’t use the agreement as a weapon. Instead, simply remind the other person about what you agreed to. If the other co-owner is using the car for an unauthorized purpose, quietly say, “I don’t think I see that we agreed to that,” as you flip through the contract.


Remain calm. Effective problem solving requires that you avoid getting too emotional. By remaining calm, you don’t threaten the other co-owner or try to punish them. In this way, you make it easier for the other owner to understand your point of view., You might find that your initial agreement is out of date and needs to change to accommodate the realities of each co-owner’s life. For example, you might not have had a job when you initially purchased a share of a friend’s car. Once you get a job, you might find that you need to use the car more.


Amending one part of the agreement might mean that other parts of the agreement must be changed. For example, you and the co-owner might have agreed to split insurance and repairs 50-50 because you had initially agreed to use the car an equal amount. However, if you suddenly need to use the car 80% of the time, then you should expect to pay a greater percentage of the costs associated with the car.
Once you and the co-owner have come to a new agreement, you should type it up. Then both owners should sign the new agreement in front of a notary.

, Some disputes cannot be solved on your own. Instead, you might need the help of a professional mediator. A mediator is a neutral third party who listens to your dispute and tries to come up with creative solutions that are acceptable to both car owners.


The mediator isn’t a judge, and he or she will not be assigning blame. So it is important to be honest when meeting with the mediator. Typically, a mediator will let each co-owner discuss the problems in front of the other co-owner. Then the mediator will meet individually with each person.
To find a mediator, you should visit your local courthouse to see if they run a mediation program. They might also have a list of court-approved mediators.You can also contact your local or state bar association.

, Lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming, even if you appear in small claims court. You should try to resolve problems with a co-owner through mediation or on your own.

, When a legal dispute is unavoidable, you should seek a lawyer’s assistance, especially if the other owner has a lawyer. Although you might be worried about the costs of an attorney, there are several ways to minimize legal bills.


Use your court’s self-help center. Some courts have self-help centers where staff assists people who are representing themselves. To find out if a self-help center is available, call your local courthouse.
Find a local legal aid organization. Legal aid organizations provide free legal services to those in financial need. To find a legal aid organization near you, visit the Legal Services Corporation’s website at www.lsc.gov. Click on “Find Legal Aid” in the upper right-hand corner and then enter your zip code.
Ask if a lawyer provides “unbundled” legal services. Many states now allow lawyers to provide “unbundled” legal services. Under this arrangement, a lawyer can agree to perform only discrete tasks. For example, you might pay an attorney to offer advice, look over your court documents, or even represent you before a judge. Because the lawyer does only the work you give them, unbundled legal services is a good way to keep your legal fees down.Call a lawyer and ask if he or she offers unbundled legal services.

Advertise your lease transfer.,
Respond to inquiries from interested parties and negotiate transfer terms.,
Transfer your lease.",How to Break a Car Lease1," A lease transfer allows you to find someone else who wants the car and is willing and able to make the monthly lease payments.


If you’re able to transfer your lease, you can get out of the monthly payments without paying early termination costs. You'll still pay a few hundred dollars to transfer the lease.
About 80 percent of leases have no post-transfer obligations, but the other 20 percent require that you assume responsibility for the successful payment and maintenance of the vehicle. Although the general trend in leasing favors open transfer policies, some lease agents and car companies such as BMW and Infiniti retain post-transfer obligations.
If your lease includes post-transfer obligations, you're still on the hook for payments even after the transfer. This means if the person who took over your lease doesn't make the payments, the lease company will come after you.Some car companies also limit the time frame when you can transfer your lease. For example, Nissan won’t allow you to transfer your lease if you have fewer than seven payments remaining.Your lease company may require you to pay a fee for the transfer and processing of the application, although you could pass these fees on to your buyer. For example, Ford Motor Credit Company charges a $75 credit application fee.Never transfer a lease without the lease company’s approval. Doing so will result in significant fines.;
, Companies such as CarLeaseDepot.com, Swapalease.com, and LeaseTrader.com specialize in lease transfers and handle the transfer process by working directly with your lease company.Compare the fees and services of several lease transfer companies, and read customer reviews. Make sure you've read and understand the detail for all fees and procedures before you pick one to use.
While each company does the same thing, fees for various aspects of the process may differ, or you may find you prefer one company’s handling methods to another.

, Once you pay the advertising fees, the lease transfer company will post your advertisement on its online marketplace.


Research reasons people take over car leases. Taking over a lease has many benefits, including the ability to commit for a shorter period of time and avoid hefty down payments. If you find reasons that seem to fit your car, you can target your advertisement toward those people for better responses.
For example, some people like to swap cars frequently and try new things, so if your leased car is a particularly trendy or sporty car, you might want to tailor your ad to attract that kind of buyer.
Interested parties will respond to you via email or through your account on the lease transfer company’s website.

, Provide details and documentation relating to the vehicle’s condition, maintenance, and accident history as soon as possible.


Usually, the new lessee pays for any necessary vehicle inspections and transportation, as well as any transfer fees charged by the lease company.
Depending on your situation, you might want to add an incentive for the person who will take over your lease. A typical incentive is a stipend that reduces the monthly payments for the lease buyer, and can range from $500 to $5,000.
When transferring a lease to someone who lives in another state, the lease transfer company can help arrange vehicle inspections or transportation of the vehicle.

, Either the lease transfer company or your original leasing company will do a credit check to see if the interested party is eligible to assume the lease.There may be a fee for this.Once the buyer is approved, you’ll pay a processing fee to the lease transfer company and provide the lease information to the transfer company.
The lease transfer process usually takes several weeks to complete. Once the transfer is in order, you’ll sign the documents from the original lease company and the transfer company and turn over the car.

Find a buyer for your leased car.,
Consider taxes and fees.",How to Break a Car Lease2," Most leases include a “payoff” or “buyout” price. Paying this amount will release you from your lease and pass ownership of the car to you.The price of the buyout is normally more than the car is actually worth, and the difference can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Consult the Kelley Blue Book to find out your car’s value before choosing the buyout option.

, If you can cut a deal with a buyer who has the cash on hand, you can reduce your overall loss by selling the car immediately after you buy out the lease. Post your car for sale online at sites such as cars.com or autotrader.com. Alternatively, you can sell your car the old-fashioned way. Put a sign in the window and leave it parked in a place with a lot of traffic.
Look for an individual buyer rather than a dealership. Car dealers will offer the wholesale price because they need to make money on the car too – that typically won't be enough to get you out of your lease. A private individual wants to drive the car himself and may be willing to pay more.
Be honest with potential buyers. Tell them as soon as possible why you are selling the car — especially if you require payment up front.
If you need to get the money from the buyer before completing the lease buyout, the buyer may feel more comfortable paying the money directly to your lease company rather than paying you first and having you finish the transaction.

, Depending on the sales tax laws in your state, you may have to pay taxes when you sell your car. There may be other fees to take into account, such as title transfer fees or registration fees."

Keep in mind these clauses are usually designed to protect the finance company, not benefit you., Find out exactly how much early termination will cost you, and what additional fees are involved. Many companies charge a substantial early-termination fee that is roughly equivalent to making all remaining lease payments at once. In addition, they’ll tack on predetermined penalty fees or other fees for “restocking” or “processing.”

, If your only reason for needing out of the lease is a financial one, your lease company may have relief programs for people with verifiable financial strain.


If you’ve lost a job or experienced a death in the family, it might be possible to get a forbearance on your payments. You’ll be expected to make up the difference at a later date, but it might help you in the meantime.
Some companies will let you “trade-in” your lease. For example, if you were leasing a more expensive car and want to save money, you could trade in your luxury sedan on a cheaper economy car.Trade-ins often come with additional fees, and a trade-in typically is still considered an early termination of the lease for credit reporting purposes.

, Some leasing companies will assess additional fees for body damage or general disrepair."

"
Mentally note the other car's license plate number, make, model and color.,
Make sure nobody is hurt.,
Call the police as soon as possible.,
Move your car safely.,
Turn on your hazard lights and turn off the engine.,
Get out of your car if it’s safe to do so.",How to Deal With a Minor Car Accident2," There's a chance that the other driver may try to drive off, especially if they’re at fault. As soon as your car stops moving, look at the back of their car. Note the license plate number, and keep repeating it out loud until you can write it down. Do the same with the make, model and color.


Turn this information into a string you can memorize and give it a rhythm. For example: “Blue Toyota Corolla 922 RIE”.
Try to get a picture of the other car with your phone, but only if the car is pulled over and stopped.

, Check yourself for injuries first. You’re unlikely to be seriously injured in a minor accident, but you should still check for whiplash or concussions. Check your passengers as well. Ask them if they feel any pain or discomfort. Headaches could be indicative of a concussions, so pay particular attention to what your passengers say., It’s important to call the police, particularly if repairs are going to be needed. The police report will help the insurance companies determine who is responsible for paying.Ask the police if you should cautiously move the car out of the travel lane, if it will move and it is safe to do so. Do not move far lest the other driver think you are trying to flee.

, Depending on the accident, you might need to move your car to avoid putting other drivers in danger. For instance, if your car is in the middle of a traffic lane, you should try to move it to the side of the road.

, The hazard lights will be a first warning to other drivers of a possible obstruction; doing this makes makes things safer both for you and incoming traffic. Make sure to turn off your engine. A damaged, running engine can leak fluid and cause problems., In a minor accident, your car is unlikely to be at risk of catching fire. Do not step out into fast-moving traffic--go out the opposite door if necessary. The police will be able to direct traffic away safely soon. Be especially careful at night. It is much better to have someone hit your car with you in it than to have them hit you out of it."

Look for witnesses.,
Exchange information with the other driver.,
Document the incident.",How to Deal With a Minor Car Accident3," If the accident happened in sight of pedestrians, a shop, or other drivers, ask them to stay on the scene until the police arrive so that they can provide statements. If possible, get their name and phone number.

, After the police officer has finished taking statements and completing the report, you should get the other driver’s information. Make your information freely available as well; people might think you’re at fault if you try to hide anything. The following information should be exchanged:


Full name, address, contact information
Driver's license numbers
License plate number
Insurance company and policy number
Make, model and color of the vehicle, Write down any information you receive from the police officer and the other driver. Take pictures of the scene with your phone.You’ll want to get pictures of the location itself, including stop signs, traffic lights, and other elements you think might have played into the accident. The insurance company will ask many questions, and you can use these pictures as a reference. Make sure to get pictures of the damage to the vehicle as well.

"
"
Tell the police officer exactly what happened.,
Avoid admitting fault.,
Notify your insurance company of the accident.,
Make a claim with your insurance company.",How to Deal With a Minor Car Accident4," Be specific and don't exaggerate. Try to provide as much detail as possible, including the timeline of events, damage on your vehicle, and the health of all involved.


Ask the officer where you can obtain a copy of the police report.
If the officer provides a reference number for the police report, make sure you jot it down.

, Even if you think you caused the accident, you should never admit to be at fault. Insurance companies hire a number of experts that will determine who is at fault. However, if you tell people you’re at fault, and it’s on record, you might be held responsible for damages.Be especially careful to not admit fault when talking to the other driver or the police. If you do so, it’ll be recorded in the police report.

, Some insurance companies require that you inform them of any incident, including minor accidents with not much damage.This will usually just involve answering questions about the incident.

, Making a claim means you’re actually seeking compensation from the insurance company. It starts with you contacting the insurance company; they will then obtain the police report and contact the other driver’s insurance company. They’ll likely ask you to visit a mechanic to have the damage to your car evaluated as well. Keep in mind, however, that there are certain circumstances when you might not want to file a claim:


A one car accident, where you’re only slightly injured if at all.
You can afford the damage to your vehicle, or the repairs are largely covered by the policy’s deductible.
Damage to either car is minor or nonexistent."

Get a final settlement in writing.",How to Achieve a Settlement After Being Involved in a Truck Accident," The worst thing you could do is leave the scene of an accident, even if you think it was something minor. Unless you talk with the other driver, you may not know if he or she will report that you caused the accident (whether you did or not)., Perhaps the most important thing you can do immediately following an accident is to remain calm. This will help you focus on all the remaining details and collect information that will help you with your claim. If you get overly excited, you will miss things or may say things that could hurt your case down the line. Try to keep calm and limit what you say and do.

, If you are injured, then you should stay put until medical staff arrive to help you. If you are not injured and can help anyone else who was involved, you may wish to do that.Remember that unless someone is in immediate danger, you should leave any injured person alone until professional medical help arrives. Consider the scene of the accident and determine whether you need to remove yourself or others due to possible fire, explosion or other imminent danger.

, If you or someone at the scene has a cell phone, call 9-1-1 right away. Even if you believe the accident is minor, you should contact the police. A police officer on the scene can help move the vehicles safely out of the road or can help direct traffic while you and the other driver exchange information. At the very least, you will want a police officer to write a formal report of the accident. A police report that contains the facts of the accident can make a big difference in reaching a settlement (assuming that the facts are in your favor)., After any immediate health concerns have been addressed, talk with the other driver and share basic contact information. This will include all of the following:name
address
telephone number
license plate
car description - make, model and year
name and contact information for any passengers

, You should ask the other driver for his or her insurance carrier and policy number. You should be prepared to share your information as well.Sharing insurance information is not an admission of fault on either side. It is an ordinary step in dealing with an accident.
Insist on collecting the other driver’s insurance information, even if he or she says, “Let’s just settle this without insurance.” Many drivers will want to avoid an insurance claim, out of fear that their premiums may increase. As a result, you may get someone who simply offers you a cash payment. The choice is yours, but until you have any damage reviewed, you cannot be certain what the repairs will cost. Cars (or people) can sometimes be damaged in ways that are not immediately evident. You can opt later not to file an insurance claim, but at this stage you should get the information.

, When you are involved in an accident with a big-rig truck driver, it is likely that the driver was on the job for an employer, rather than just driving for himself. Ask about his or her employer. This may provide you with an additional defendant, who may be more able to pay for the damages you suffered.

, Before you leave the scene, you should write down some notes about the accident. In your notes, you should try to answer the following questions:What is the exact location? Make note of any side streets or intersections.
What time did the accident occur?
Describe the weather, particularly if it may have contributed to the accident.
Describe your location on the road (which lane you were in, which lane the other vehicle was in) and the movement of each vehicle.

, If you have a cell phone that contains a camera feature, take some photographs of the accident scene before the vehicles are moved. Try to get pictures that will show the cars’ positions and demonstrate how the accident happened. Take pictures of the damage to each car as well.It is important to photograph both vehicles, not just yours. Although your car is the one that concerns you, you should photograph both vehicles. Having pictures from the scene of the accident will prevent the other driver from making an unsubstantiated claim later on and blaming it on you at this accident.

, Very often, other cars will stop if they saw what happened, or you may be able to identify a pedestrian who saw the accident. Get their names and contact information, if you can. Ask each to verify what happened, so you will know if they will support your claim eventually., If you were badly injured in the accident, you will likely be taken to a hospital by ambulance. If you are less injured, or if you think you were not injured at all, you should still report to your own doctor or an emergency room to be checked. Inform the medical staff that you were in an accident and ask to be checked for injuries. Get a written report. Keep a record of the expenses for this visit and any other medical visits.Your state law will determine whether you can collect from the other driver or his or her insurance company for medical visits that are covered by your insurance policy. In some cases, you can only collect for out-of-pocket costs, such as a co-payment.

, Keep notes of all costs that you incur as a result of the accident. You may wish to start a notebook or a folder to hold receipts and notes. You may not be able to collect reimbursement for every item you record, but keeping the notes will help you in negotiating a settlement later. You should record and maintain:lost wages
rental car costs
the value of damages to any personal property in your car.

, Regardless of how you think the claim will resolve itself eventually, you need to notify your insurance company that you have been involved in an accident. An insurance agent will ask you for detailed information about the accident. Answer all questions as thoroughly and honestly as you can., Your agent will be able to inform you about the laws of your state and about the process going forward. You will want to find out if you live in a “no fault” state and if you are entitled to claim against the other driver or only against your own policy.The states with “no fault” insurance laws are the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Utah. If you live in one of these locations, your claim may be limited to collection against your own policy, regardless of which driver may have caused the accident.

, A claims adjuster is an employee of your insurance company whose job is to examine your vehicle and estimate the damage. The insurance agent will probably give you the contact information for an adjuster when you make your first contact. Set up a time and location to meet and review the damage.Some adjusters will have you visit their place of business, while others will travel and come to you. If you have the opportunity, select a time and place that are convenient. You should not have to lost additional time from work to meet with a claims adjuster.

, Don’t just rely on the claims adjuster’s estimate. You have the right to take your vehicle to a body or repair shop of your own selection to get an estimate of the repair cost to your vehicle., If you are dissatisfied with resolving the payment through your insurance company, you may hire an attorney. An attorney who deals with accident claims will be able to advise you of your rights and your likelihood of collecting.Particularly if you suffered a chronic injury that will need ongoing care, an attorney can help you maximize your collection.
Accidents with big-rig trucks are more likely to cause significant damage or injury, due to the size and weight of the truck. This works in your favor when looking for a larger settlement., Make sure that your attorney is aware of the police report, the statements you have already received from any witnesses, and the costs that you have already incurred. The attorney will discuss your overall case and help you decide whether the case should go to trial.If it appears that your case is not strong, or that you were partially to blame for the accident, your attorney may advise you that the initial offer you received, either from your insurance company or from the other company, is the best you will do. At that point, you may choose to accept the offer and be done with the case.
Alternatively, if the attorney believes you have a strong case, with the potential to prove significant damages, he or she may advise you to proceed. Your next step is to go to trial, or at least contact the other driver to settle without a trial.

, Drivers of semi-trailers are controlled by several state and federal regulations. These regulations cover such things as the driver's license, truck maintenance, and cargo capacity.You or your attorney will need to research these regulations to look for deficiencies. If the driver or the driver's company neglected to meet federal or state standards for maintaining the truck, for instance, you could have a strong negotiating point in discussing a settlement.

, Either on your own or through your attorney, the next step toward reaching a settlement is to contact the other driver and set up a meeting. At this stage, you will need to let the other driver know that you intend to proceed with a complaint and trial, if necessary, unless the accident can be settled.

, The key to a successful negotiation is to arrive prepared. Usually the better prepared side will come out of the negotiation meeting with the more positive result.As part of your preparation, you need to collect the evidence that supports your claim and the evidence of the damages you have suffered. This evidence of damages should also include any medical reports about future pain and suffering.


Part of the preparation for a negotiating meeting also includes researching the other driver’s potential resources. There is no point in demanding millions of dollars, for example, from a driver who has very limited resources himself and would never be able to pay. However, if, at the time of the accident, the truck driver was working for a large trucking company, you may be able to collect a great deal from the company. Your attorney can help you look into this.
You will need to consider any defenses that the driver may raise. For example, if the driver admits a level of responsibility for the accident, but then says that the true fault was a problem with the brakes, you may get tied up in a product liability dispute with the brake manufacturer. Details like this could make a trial very long and drawn out.

, This level of negotiation may be difficult to do without filing a complaint first. If a complaint is filed, you or your attorney then have subpoena powers and the tools of discovery to compel certain information. But if you can answer any of these questions before filing a complaint, they may help with settling your case:Was the driver's CDL license active or suspended?
Does the driver have a criminal record or a history of tickets?
Does the driver have a history of accident involvement?
What was the truck carrying, and was it within legal load limits?
Was the driver in compliance with sleeping regulations?
Was the driver under the influence of any drugs or alcohol?

, At a negotiating conference, you and/or your attorney will discuss the damages that occurred and your view of the case. You will discuss enough of your evidence to convince the other side that you have a strong case, without disclosing everything. Part of this meeting is to size up the other side’s defense, compared to your own case, and make an informed decision about the likelihood of winning at trial., Eventually, you will present a monetary amount that you expect to collect as a result of the accident. This figure should be reasonably connected to the actual damages that occurred, along with an amount that your attorney believes you could collect from a judge or jury if the case were to go to trial. The other driver, or his attorney or insurance representative, will likely counter. This can go back and forth, until you eventually reach a figure that both sides will agree on.Be prepared to give up something to reach an agreement. Part of negotiating means being willing to compromise for something less than what you fully want. Some possible ways to do this are to take a lower amount than your original demand or accept delayed payments over time.

, If the other side is evidently not coming close to your demand, and if you believe that you have a strong enough case, you need to be willing to break off the negotiation and go to trial. Sometimes, just threatening to end the negotiation may be enough to show the other side that you are serious, and could bring a better offer., After you have reached an agreement for a settlement amount, you (or your attorney) will need to finalize a written settlement agreement. A written agreement is designed to detail the amount of the agreed payments, a schedule for such payments to happen, and to set forth certain legal terms about the accident. In particular, the party who is making the payments will probably want the settlement agreement to include a clause stating that the settlement is in “full and final” satisfaction of “any and all” claims related to the accident. This language means that if some future injury arises later, you may be barred against claiming for it. You should have your attorney review any written settlement agreement carefully before you sign it."

Accept a plea offer.,
Appear before the judge.",How to Avoid Boating Under the Influence Charges," The easiest way to avoid a BUI charge is to not drink alcohol if you intend to operate the boat. Remember that it takes a while for alcohol to work its way through your system. A couple of drinks on the dock can stay in your blood for a long time.


If you want to drink, then appoint someone the “designated driver” of the boat.You should realize that you don’t actually have to be operating the boat at the time that you get arrested. For example, the police could consider you “in care and control” of the boat even if you are asleep on it.;
, You can have just as much fun out on the water drinking iced tea, lemonade, water, or soda. These beverages will also keep you cooler than alcohol will.Also bring a variety of food and snacks so that you can satisfy your cravings without resorting to alcohol.

, You might decide to dock somewhere and have a meal on land. You might naturally want an alcoholic beverage, or two, during your meal. However, you should plan your meals so that enough time passes before you get back on the boat.


As an estimate, give yourself one hour for each drink. If you had two drinks, then wait two hours from when you stopped drinking.It is always best simply not to drink. You might find that even a little alcohol impairs you more out on water, since you are exposed to the sun and also may become disorientated because of the water spray and glare.

, Each state has a cut-off point for considering you legally intoxicated. In Texas, for example, it is illegal to operate a boat with a BAC of 0.08 or higher.Any boat operator under 21 should have no alcohol in their blood.

, In most states, the BUI laws will apply to almost any motorized or non-motorized watercraft. For example, the following may be covered by your state’s BUI laws:sailboats
jet skis
inflatable boats or rafts
dinghies
kayaks (in some states)
canoes (in some states)

, If passengers on the boat want to drink, then you should make sure that they drink while wearing life jackets. People lose their coordination as their blood alcohol content rises. Also, drinking in the hot sun can make people light-headed.


Most people who die in boating accidents drown because they are not wearing life jackets. Ask your guests to put on a life jacket before getting in the boat., If you are pulled over for BUI, then you should realize that you have a right to remain silent. You should exercise that right. The worst thing you could do is try to talk your way out of a ticket or arrest.You may have to provide some basic information, such as your name.
You should also get the officer to tell you why you were stopped. You can ask, “Is anything the matter?”
Instead of answering your question, the officer might pepper you with additional questions: “Do you know why I stopped you?” “Anyone been drinking on this boat?” Try to shrug these questions off. Say, “I don’t know why you stopped me.”

, You should follow directions and not get agitated. Some people become aggressive when they drink, so this is all the more reason not to drink when out on a boat. If the police officer wants you to do something, then it is best to comply.


Resistance usually escalates the situation. Instead, remain polite in all of your interactions., The police will probably ask you to take a breathalyzer test. It is your choice. If you know you haven’t been drinking, then you should take it. If you refuse to take the test, then you should know the consequences, which will differ depending by state.


In some states, refusing to take the breathalyzer, by itself, will cause your license to be suspended.In other states, you can be fined for refusing to take the breathalyzer. However, your license might not be suspended.
Before going boating, you should research your state law so that you know what punishment awaits if you refuse the breathalyzer.

, If you are arrested, you will be given “Miranda” warnings. These warnings inform you that you have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, the right to have an attorney appointed for you, and that anything you say can be used against you in court.If you say you want to speak to an attorney, then all questioning should stop. However, if you decide to start up the conversation again, then the police can continue to question you.
Once you request an attorney, it is best to stop talking until the attorney arrives.

, You might be able to get the district attorney to drop the charges against you, or potentially reduce the severity of the charge.However, to make the strongest argument, you need to hire a lawyer. Only an experienced local lawyer will know how to defend you.


You should hire locally. If you live in a city but was boating in a small town, you should get a lawyer from the town where you were arrested. He or she will be familiar with the local prosecutor.
Make sure that the person has experience in BUI or DUI cases.You would benefit from having someone who specializes in this area.

, A conviction for BUI is usually just as severe as a conviction for DUI. You could face the following consequences if you are convicted:You could serve time in jail.
Your boat license could be suspended.
You will have a criminal record. If you are convicted of a felony, then you could lose your voting rights.
You could be fined.
You might suffer higher car or boat insurance premiums.

, At the completion, the prosecutor dismisses your criminal charges.Typically, a diversion program is only available to a first-time offender. Also, you must not have caused property damage or injured a person because you were operating the boat under the influence.
Each state’s program is different. You should talk to your attorney and check if diversion is available.

, Plea bargaining is common. Almost nine out of ten criminal cases are resolved with pleas. In order to decide whether to offer you a plea bargain, a prosecutor will consider the following factors:The seriousness of your offense. If you harmed someone because of your BUI, then you are less likely to get a plea.
The strength of the evidence against you. If the police have a breathalyzer reading above the legal limit, then they probably have strong evidence. However, you might not have given a breathalyzer. In that case, the prosecutor might have to rely on the officer’s judgment that you were drunk. In that situation, the evidence is much weaker, especially if you made no incriminating statements.
The likelihood a jury will find you guilty. If the evidence is weak, then a jury is less likely to convict you.

, Your lawyer can’t accept the plea offer for you.Instead, he or she must get your permission, but you can give permission ahead of time. For example, you might agree ahead of time to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge.

, A judge needs to approve the plea agreement.Accordingly, you and your attorney will need to attend a hearing. You should definitely look your best and be on your best behavior.



Dress well. You should wear “business casual” at a minimum. This means dress pants and a button up shirt for men and dress slacks or skirt with a nice blouse or sweater for women.
Don’t interrupt the judge when he or she is speaking. Always listen quietly.

Understand what an international driving permit is.,
Determine if you are eligible for an IDP.,
Watch out for scams.,
Apply for an international driving permit.,
Submit your IDP application well in advance of any travel plans.,
Use your IDP in the country you are visiting.",How to Apply for an International Driving Licence in the United States," The international driving permit (IDP) is not truly a license. Instead it is just a translation of your existing driver's license into 11 languages. You must continue to carry your regular driver's license with you at all times.The permit is recognized in 150 countries (a list of those countries can be found at thenac.com/international_driving_permit_countries.pdf). In 40 countries, you are required to possess an IDP in order to obtain a rental car.An IDP will not be issued more than 6 months before you need it. It is only valid for one year from the date of its issuance.;
, You can only receive an IDP if you currently hold a valid driver's license. An IDP will not be issued if your license is suspended or revoked. In addition, there are a few requirements.


Your domestic license must be valid for at least six months after your IDP is issued. If your license will expire during the six month period, renew your license at your local DMV office.
You must be 18 to get an international driving permit.

, The U.S. State Department website notes that only the National Automobile Club and the AAA offer international driver's permits in the United States.Do not pay any other organization for an international driver's permit. Such offers are often scams. Even if you do receive something that appears to be a permit, it may not be a legal document.


The United Nations does not issue international driving licenses. If you obtained a document purported to be an international driving permit issued by the U.N., you do not have a valid international driving permit.
A real, valid IDP is a multi-page booklet 4 by 6 inches (10.16 by 15.24 cm) in size. It has a gray cover. It includes a page displaying the holder's name, date and place of birth and home address. This information is repeated in 9 other languages on separate pages. If you have any questions regarding the validity of an IDP, take it to your nearest AAA office.

, As noted above, there are only two agencies that provide the IDP in the United States--the National Automobile Club and the American Automobile Association. You can either obtain an IDP in person or through the mail.


If you would prefer to get your IDP from AAA, you have two options. You can download the application from the American Automobile Association and bring the completed form to an AAA office near you.Alternatively, you can mail the form to the closest AAA office. You can find the AAA office in your area on their website.You can also download the application from the National Automobile Club website and mail the form to the NAC at the following address:The National Automobile Club, Attn: IDP, 373 Vintage Park Drive, Suite E, Foster City, CA 94404.
Included with your application forms, you must supply two “passport type” photos. You can get these pictures taken for a small fee at an AAA office.
The cost of the permit is $15 (from either association).

, Even though an IDP will not be issued more than six months before you plan to travel internationally, make sure that you get your IDP well before the trip. If you have waited until the last minute, go get your IDP in person to avoid mail delays.


There is no waiting period, so if you decide to go in person everything can be handled in a single visit.
Applications sent through the mail will normally be processed in 10 to 15 business days.

, Remember that the IDP is really just a certified translation of your driver's license. You must keep your actual driver's license with you at all times.

Collect the judgment.",How to Collect Car Repossession Deficiency," In order to collect on a deficiency, you need to follow your state’s notice requirements. If you fail to follow the requirements, then you might not be able to sue for the deficiency.


To find your state’s law, you should go to your local law library, which should be at your courthouse. Ask the librarian to see your state’s law on car repossession and deficiency judgments.
You can also search the Internet. Many states put their statutes on the web. Type “your state” and then “car repossession law” into your favorite web browser.
Look for websites with .gov in the address. This signals that it is an official state website. State websites should have the most accurate information.;
, Depending on your state law you will have to provide several written notices to the car owner. These notices typically include:notice of your right to redeem the car by paying the full loan amount and when you can redeem it
notice of your right to reinstate the loan (pay the back payments) and when you can do it
the amount of the deficiency balance, which includes any fees and charges
the date of the sale, if you are selling at a private sale
the location, date, and time of the auction, if you are selling by auction

, You also have to make sure that the borrower receives your notice. State law may require a certain form of delivery as well as deadlines for when notice must be given. Make sure to follow the law.


In Connecticut, for example, you must give at least 10 days’ written notice, which should be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.Regardless of what your state law requires, you should always send a copy of the notice certified mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt is your proof that the borrower received your notice.

, You must also sell the car in a “commercially reasonable manner.”This standard is a little vague. Often, it means selling the car at a public auction. However, private sales can sometimes be commercially reasonable if you engage in fair and honest dealing. Make sure that you avoid doing the following, all of which are not “commercially reasonable”:Don't sell the car as junk without doing an appraisal
Don't buy the vehicle back (after the sale) and then resell it for a higher price
Don't sell the car in a private sale when most repossession sales in your area are conducted by public auction
Don't refuse to advertise
Don't sell to family, friends, or employees

, To sell the car properly, you should advertise.Preferably, you should advertise in a large newspaper or in a trade publication that has a large readership.In your advertisement, you need to include a proper description of the vehicle. Include the year, make, model, mileage, and general condition of the car (fair, good, excellent).
You can sue the defendant for the costs of the advertisements. Hold onto your receipts from the newspaper or publication.

, These sales are suspect. You should try to make an “arm’s length” sale to a stranger. If you sell to people you know, then the borrower could claim that you gave the purchaser a break on the price because of your relationship.

, You should try to get a price as close to the resale value as possible. Look up the car’s value on Kelley Blue Book by visiting its website at www.kbb.com.


Once at the website, click on “Check My Car’s Value” on the left-hand column.
Enter the year, make, model, and mileage of the vehicle. Then enter your zip code on the next screen.
Select the car’s style and provide information about the car’s options.
You will then be given two prices: if you were to trade in to a dealer or sell to a private party. Select “Sell to a Private Party.” You will then be provided with a price depending on whether your car is in fair, good, very good, or excellent condition.

, Should the borrower try to redeem the car or reinstate the loan, then you must accept payment.You won’t be able to sue to collect the deficiency if you refuse to sell to the borrower.

, You cannot sell or keep the borrower’s personal property. You should be sure to clear out the car before auction. Any personal property in the car when it is repossessed must be returned to the borrower.Personal property does not include things done to improve the car, such as the installation of a luggage rack or stereo.


Send a letter to the borrower stating where and when to pick up the personal property. You should safely store it so that it does not become damaged.

, To sell in a commercially reasonable manner, you should use an experienced auctioneer who has worked in the auto resale market.In many cities and states, there are companies that hold public auctions as their business.To find them, type your city or state and “auto auction” in a web browser.


Also make sure that the minimum bid is not too low. That suggests that you are not interested in maximizing the amount from the sale. A court might not think the sale is commercially reasonable if you set the minimum bid too low.
You should also let potential bidders inspect the car.

, You will need proof of the sales price when you sue for the deficiency. Make sure to type up a sales contract and have the purchaser sign it. Make sure that you include the sale price in the contract.


For tips on how to write a simple contract, see Write a Legal Contract.
If you choose not to sell the car but keep it, then you can’t sue for the deficiency., To successfully sue for the deficiency, you need to be the payee on the loan papers. You also must have been given a security interest in the car.Take out your loan papers and review them. Look to see that you have been listed as the payee and that you were granted a security interest. You should be identified as the payee near the top of the loan document.
Look for “Security Interest” as a subject heading in the loan document. If you can’t find that you were granted a security interest, then meet with a lawyer to review your documents.
Also make sure that the loan documents give you a right to sue for the deficiency. If not, then you probably cannot sue.

, You can sue only for the deficiency. This is the amount of the loan minus the amount you recovered on the sale. You can also charge for certain costs and fees:costs associated with repossessing, storing, and selling the vehicle
attorneys’ fees (if your state allows)

, An experienced attorney can help you bring the lawsuit. To find a lawyer, you can visit your state’s bar association, which should give you a referral.


Make sure that your lawyer has experience collecting deficiency judgments in court. Once you have the name of a referral, then you can call to schedule a consultation. When you call, check to see if the lawyer has experience in this area.
For tips on how to find a competent attorney, see Find a Good Attorney.

, Your state might require that you send a letter to the borrower after the sale. You should include information about how much the car was sold for and how much in costs and fees you incurred repossessing, storing, and selling the vehicle.


You also need to account for how the sale proceeds have been applied to the debt. Typically, you are allowed to apply the proceeds to your costs before applying proceeds to the balance of the loan.For example, assume that the loan balance is $10,000. You incurred an additional $500 in costs. You then sold the car for $7,500. Under this scenario, you first apply the proceeds to the costs: this leaves you with $7,000 in remaining sale proceeds. Then you apply those proceeds to the loan balance. In total, the deficiency is $3,000 ($10,000 minus $7,000).

, You start a lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. The complaint states the factual circumstances of the lawsuit and states how much you are trying to recover from the borrower.


Your lawyer can draft the complaint for you. If you choose to proceed without a lawyer, then you should get a form complaint from the court clerk. This is a printed, “fill in the blank” form. Ask the court clerk if one is available.
An example of a form complaint for Colorado is available at https://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/PDF/c.r.c.c.p.21.pdf. If your state does not have a form complaint, you cannot use Colorado’s. However, you can use this as a guide as you type your own complaint.
Attach a copy of any loan agreements to the complaint. In some states, you must attach a copy of any contract you are suing on., You should file your lawsuit in the county where the borrower lives or where the contract was signed. Make several copies of your complaint and take them to the court clerk. Tell the clerk you want to file. The clerk should date stamp all of the copies.


You will probably have to pay a filing fee. This will vary, depending on the court. Ask the court clerk how much the filing fee will be when you stop in to pick up a form complaint. If you can’t afford the filing fee, then ask for a fee waiver form and complete it.

, You need to inform the borrower that you have sued for the deficiency. Accordingly, you need to serve a copy of the complaint and a summons on the defendant. The summons will tell the borrower when he or she must appear in court. You can get it from the clerk.Proper service varies depending on the court. In some courts, you can have the clerk mail a copy of the complaint and summons to the borrower. In other courts, you can have someone 18 or older make personal service, provided that they are not a party to the lawsuit.
You may also have the sheriff or a private process server make service for a fee. The fee could cost $45-75, depending on where you live.To find a process server, check your phone book or search on the Internet.
Ask the court clerk for what methods of service are acceptable and be sure to follow the rules. Your case can be thrown out of court if you do not make proper service.

, The borrower will respond to your complaint by filing an Answer. In the Answer, the borrower will admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation made. The defendant will also provide any additional facts which are missing from the complaint.


The borrower will also raise affirmative defenses.In practice, the borrower will probably allege that you didn’t follow proper procedure. For example, the borrower might claim you didn’t give proper notice that he had the right to redeem the car.
Alternately, the borrower could claim that you did not sell the car in a commercially reasonable manner.

, You will need to show the judge that you did follow correct procedures for repossessing and selling the car. Gather the following:


the original loan contract
any communications between you and the borrower
receipts for all expenses incurred (repo, advertising, etc.)
copies of the notice provided to the borrower
a copy of your advertisements made
the sale contract when you resold the car
information about the auctioneer, including name and contact information
a copy of the deficiency letter sent to the borrower

, If you are in small claims court, then the trial will be more informal than if you appeared in regular civil court.In small claims, you should expect the judge to look at your documents and to ask you questions.


Even if you appear in regular civil court, the trial should be fairly simple. The case will turn on whether the contract was validly executed and whether you provided proper notice and made a commercially reasonable sale.
In regular civil court, you may have to select a jury and then make opening and closing statements to the judge. If you appear in regular civil court, you should have an attorney represent you.
If you are representing yourself, then see Be Your Own Lawyer in Court.

, If you lose at trial, you have the option of appealing. Ask the court clerk for the Notice of Appeal form and fill it out. Then file it with the clerk. You have only so much time to appeal, but you should not delay.


If you brought the case in small claims court, you might not have the right to appeal if you lose. You should consider this before choosing to proceed in small claims court.

, You also might win the lawsuit. However, now you need to collect money from the defendant. There are many different methods that you can use to collect a judgment. For information on how to collect judgments, see Collect a Judgment.

Simply put, as a family member with the same mailing address, York does not have any case to punish you for anything you did. http://www.yorku.ca/parking/documents/Rules_and_Regulations.pdf



 

;
, Preparing answers ahead of time will help you prepare in advance for the session (via phone or in person). See Sample questions under the Additional hints (below) for further detail.

, After grilling you, York University will ask you to settle at this point and give you two basic options:1) Pay upfront or 2)They will give the owner a call to discuss the dispute

, There are two ways to go about this:

1. Say that they could contact your parents through the mail and then revert back to your own personal situation. Remember, this has nothing to do with you, so there shouldn’t be any sanctions put in place of your situation. Even if they press on, the key point is not to give out any personal information. You MUST be assertive in this stance, otherwise you’ll have to proceed to ..
2. (See Tips for sample dialogue on 1).







, Then, wait a day before you call York back saying that the owner does not want to contact York because they’re convinced they’ve already paid.
Demand that the sanction be lifted from you.







, York may threaten to have the collection agency after the owner (as last resort guilt and to try to coerce you into paying, but stay firm!) they will say that it will affect the credit rating of the owner but whether or not the claim goes through depends on the amount that you owe and whether York is competent to actually file a report/claim.

This is why it is important to not provide any personal detail about anything. Moreover, if they do sell their debt to a collections agency, there are a bunch of ways to revoke it. The key point that must be considered is if they send the debt to the collection agency, you should not pay a dime.
Doing so can lower your credit rating. Refer to the sources in this article for further detail. If you don’t pay, your credit rating will remain unaffected. York’s threats are mostly empty as long as you don’t give them any personal information (especially with credit/debt card information, phone numbers, etc.)

Make sure you have a copy of the title.,

Print your names as ""buyers"" of the vehicle.,
Obtain a Transfer of Title form.,
Complete the form.,
Submit the form and pay the fee.,
Update your vehicle registration.,
Inform your insurance company.",How to Add a Spouse to a Car Title," You will need to have the title to your vehicle to add your spouse's name.


You may not have possession of your title if there is a lien against your vehicle. A lien is a creditor's legal right to sell certain property of a debtor who defaults on his or her obligations. If you have not paid off your car completely, the lender has probably placed a lien on the car, and may hold the title.If you do have a lien on your vehicle, contact the lienholder and ask them about adding your spouse’s name.Typically, the lienholder will have no problem with this. Adding a name to the title makes the added party liable for the amount due to the lienholder.
Once the lienholder has given consent to add your spouse, most states require that the lienholder fill out a form stating that they granted permission. These forms will vary depending on your state. To find the form for your state call the local Department of Motor Vehicles or visit the website.
If you have lost the original title to your car, you can apply for a replacement. To get a replacement, look at your state’s requirements and visit your local DMV office. Your state's requirements should be available online.Some states require you to submit latest smog test (California) when you change ownership (this includes adding a spouse to a title), but you can submit a statement of facts which will exempt this requirement because your spouse is a family member.Some states, such as California, allow you to have paperless title. Therefore, you need either the California Certificate of Title or an Application for Duplicate or Paperless Title.;
, Although you are not actually selling your vehicle, the process of changing the names on the title is the same as if you were selling your car to yourself and your spouse. Sign the title on the seller line..


Some states require that you sign the title in front of a notary. Look online to find out if this is required in your state.If you must sign in front of a notary, visit any local bank during regular business hours. Most banks do not charge a fee for notarization services if you have an account. If you do not have a bank account, a bank may charge a small fee (less than $10).
You may also be required to list the vehicle's mileage on the title. Requirements about this vary from one state to the next. Likewise, some states require you provide this information on the title itself, while in others you must include an additional. Forms and state-specific information are available online., Some states make a distinction between using ""and"" or ""or"" between the names of new owners.


For example, in Kansas, Tennessee, and Connecticut ""and"" means that both parties must sign to conduct any business with the title. ""Or"" allows either party to take responsibility.If your state makes this distinction, use “and” if you want both partners to approve anything done with the car title.

, Print your name and your spouse's name as buyers on the title. Write the names as you want them to appear on the new title.After printing your names as the “buyers,” you and your spouse should both sign the title in the appropriate places.
Again, your state may require you and your spouse to sign in front of a notary. Find your state's requirements online.You should sign both as the seller and the buyer, while your spouse only needs to sign as the buyer.

, In most cases, this can be downloaded from the DMV website. Go online to find the correct form for your state., States can have slightly different transfer of title forms, but most will simply ask for basic information about you and the person you are transferring the title to.


You will usually need to include your name and address.
When filling out this form, you will put both your information as well as your spouse’s information in as the “transferee.”

, After filling out the form, take or mail the form and your old title to the DMV.


You do not need an appointment, although it may cut down your wait time to make one.
Be prepared to pay the transfer fee. Most states charge a small transfer fee, which you can pay when you transfer your title. The amount of the fee will vary depending on your state, but in most cases it's under $50., In some states, you can simply add your spouse’s name to your existing registration information. However, some states, such as New York, require you to register the car separately for each person appearing on the title. Sometimes this may require additional paperwork. Check with your local DMV to find out what the requirements are in your state. In California, for example, you must do this within five days of adding your spouse. Some states will allow you submit a notice of transfer and release of liability online. This makes it so that any parking violations, traffic violations, and civil litigation resulting for the vehicle before the title is recorded will be ascribed to new owner of the vehicle. In this case, it would add liability for the vehicle to the spouse.

, Make sure that you notify your insurance company that a new name has been added to the title. Your insurance company may also need a current and accurate copy of the title.


However, if your spouse is already covered under your insurance policy, adding his or her name to the car title should not affect your rates or policy.
If your spouse is not covered under your policy, you will need to add him or her, or make sure that your spouse is covered under their own policy.

Prepare for your hearing.,
Observe another hearing first.",How to Appeal a License Suspension," The Department of Motor Vehicles (the “DMV,"" also known as the Bureau of Motor Vehicles or Department of Transportation in some states) should have mailed you a suspension letter stating the reason for the suspension. If you never received such a letter or have misplaced it, call the DMV in your state or check the DMV’s website for a database that you can search to find your license information and reason for suspension. You can find links to each state's DMV website here. Common reasons for suspension include:


Accumulating too many points on your driving record
Getting multiple traffic violations or speeding tickets
Getting a DUI/DWI
Failing to appear in court or pay fees
Failing to pay child support;
, In some cases, such as automatic pretrial suspensions for driving under the influence (“DUI”), you may not have the right to appeal.In any case, you need to request an appeal within the statutorily-prescribed deadline. For example, appeals in Georgia must be submitted within 10 days of the effective date of suspension.If you are not eligible for an appeal or have missed the deadline, you may need to temporarily live with the suspension. To determine if an appeal is available to you:


Check your DMV’s website for information about appealing a suspension.
Look for information about appeals in the letter you received informing you of the suspension.
Call your local DMV and ask about the appeals process.
Contact an attorney. Many attorneys provide free consultations.

, If your license has been suspended, the court will specify how you can get your license back. You may simply be required to refrain from driving for a period of time, or you may be able to get your license back more quickly by taking a driving course or traffic school, paying a reinstatement fee, or asking your insurance company to file an SR-22 or FR-44 form (which proves that you carry insurance).


For certain suspensions and revocations, you may be able to request a ""hardship"" or ""probationary"" license that allows you to drive in limited situations, such as driving for work, attending drug and alcohol programs, or for medical treatment. Contact your local DMV office to find out whether your state offers hardship licenses.

, Usually, you must file an appeal with the appropriate ""administrative agency"" instead of a court. For example, in Arizona, appeals are heard by the Arizona Motor Vehicle Administration.If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your administrative hearing, you can appeal in court. However, because appeals require an argument that administrative decision misinterpreted the law, you should consider hiring an attorney to handle a complicated case.

, All states have a specific procedure for requesting an administrative hearing. Once you submit your request, the agency will contact you and give you a hearing date. Some states use specific forms for requesting a hearing, while others accept more informal emailed or written requests.


For example, in Alabama, there is no form for requesting a hearing. You must make your request by mail or email and include your name, date of birth, and driver's license number.For comparison, Arizona requires that you request a hearing by filling out this Hearing Request form and mail it to the included address.

, An administrative hearing is an informal trial. You will have the opportunity to present evidence, including documents and sworn testimony. At the beginning, you can make an opening statement explaining to the administrative law judge what you believe the evidence will show. At the end, you can make a closing argument explaining why you think the judge should rule in your favor.


To prepare for your hearing, gather any documents that support your claim that your license should not be suspended. Also contact any witnesses who can testify on your behalf and arrange for them to attend the hearing with you.
Be prepared to clearly argue why your license should not have been suspended. Did the DMV or court misunderstand the facts of your situation? Did they misinterpret the law? Make sure you understand what facts and law they relied upon before you address why those facts or law were inaccurately applied.

, You may be able to attend another person's public hearing as an observer. Upon entering the hearing room, inform the administrative law judge that you are there to observe the proceedings.Watch quietly and take note of what the participants did well and what could have been done better.

Do everything you can to make the traffic stop a safe and polite encounter, and the officer may feel charitable enough to issue a warning.


Pull over to a safe area. Exit the roadway as soon as you are able to do so safely and come to a stop.
Turn off the engine.
Roll down the window all the way.
Turn on your interior light if it is dark.
Put your hands in plain sight on the steering wheel. Don't reach for anything.;
, Cooperate with the officer so that the encounter goes quickly and smoothly. Do not search for your license and registration until the officer instructs you to do so.If the officer asks you to step out of the vehicle, do so, but do not attempt to exit the vehicle before the officer asks., Police officers will often ask questions such as, ""Do you know why I stopped you"" or ""Do you know how fast you were going?"" These types of questions are designed to prompt you to admit to a violation.You should use your own judgment when you answer these questions. If you admit to a violation, that statement can be used against you if you challenge the ticket in court, but you may be more likely to get a warning if you admit to the violation and apologize.If you intend to fight the ticket in court, do not say anything that can be used against you. Do not admit to the violation and do not argue., You can ask the officer to give you a warning instead of a ticket. If you do so, be sure to ask before the officer starts writing the ticket, or you will miss your opportunity. Tell the officer that you are usually a safe driver and that you would appreciate a warning this time., If you are given a ticket and want to fight it, you should take down some information at the time you are stopped. Write down or mentally make a few notes:


Was the officer in a car, on foot, or on a motorcycle?
Where did the violation allegedly take place?
Where was the officer when he or she saw you allegedly commit a violation?
Could the officer have actually seen your vehicle from where he or she was watching?
Did the officer say or do anything unusual, abusive, or in violation of your rights? For example, did the officer swear at you or search your car without permission?

, After you are given a ticket at a traffic stop, or were ticketed via a red light camera, you should receive a notice in the mail instructing you to appear in court or pay your fine by a certain date. If your state permits defendants to submit a trial by declaration, that option should be listed on your notice. For a trial by declaration, the defendant submits a written defense to the court, and the citing officer has an opportunity to submit a written response. The judge will read both and make a decision.Depending on your state, you may or may not forfeit your right to a regular trial by submitting to a trial by declaration.The notice you receive should include a form for requesting a trial by declaration. Fill out this form and include it when you submit your declaration.

, To fight your ticket, you need to argue that the officer was wrong to give you a ticket. If you think that whatever you were ticketed for was not against the law, you should research the applicable law. If you think the officer was factually mistaken about what happened, ask yourself: is it my word against the officer's, or can I prove the officer wrong?


To research the law, search online for your state's vehicle code and look up the code section you were cited for allegedly violating. The code section should be written on your ticket.
To investigate the factual circumstances, inspect your vehicle, revisit the scene of the incident, or look at photographs of the area on Google Maps.
Your word may be your only defense. For example, if you know you were not speeding, but have no way to prove it, you can still try to persuade the judge that, based on your driving record, you were probably driving safely and that the officer was mistaken.

, Your declaration is where you explain why you should not have received a ticket. Before you write your defense, review your citation, the section(s) from the vehicle code you allegedly violated, and any mental or written notes you made when you were given the ticket. Write your name and the ticket number at the top, then tell the judge what you were doing, what the officer did, and why the officer was wrong. Every ticket is different, but some hypothetical defenses include:


The officer cited me for driving 80 miles per hour in a 65 mph zone. The officer must have been mistaken, because I was not exceeding the speed limit.
I received a red light camera ticket, but I am not the driver in the picture.
The officer who pulled me over told me that a different officer saw me speeding. The ticketing officer did not witness any alleged violation.
The officer cited me for crossing a double yellow line on Mill Creek Road. There is no double yellow line on Mill Creek Road. The officer was mistaken.

, If you have any documents or photographs that can help prove your case, attach them. If you received a red light camera ticket but you are not the person in the picture, include a photocopy of your driver's license. You can also include pictures of streets or intersections that you find on Google Maps.

, You may be required to pay the fine or bail amount listed on the notice you received. This money will be refunded to you if you win your case. Write a check to the court clerk for the bail amount and include it with your declaration and evidence.

, Make at least one copy of your declaration for your records. Then take your declaration, evidence, bail check, and the request for trial by declaration that you received with your notice to the clerk or mail them according to the instructions on your notice. If you mail your documents, send them via certified mail so that you have a receipt proving when they were mailed.

, Depending on how busy your court is, you might have to wait weeks or even months for a decision. If you win, the court will send you a check refunding your bail money. The court may decide to reduce the charge to a lesser infraction that will have a lesser impact on your driving record, and/or lower your fine. If you lose, the court will keep the bail. Depending on the law in your state, you may still be able to request an in-person trial.The notice you receive from the court should include information on how to request a new trial.

, If you submitted a trial by declaration, lost, and have the option to request a new trial, follow the instructions included with the notice of the court's decision. If you did not do a trial by declaration, simply visit the court clerk on or before the day and time noted on your ticket or notice to appear. Ask the clerk to set a date for an arraignment., Return to court for your arraignment, dress professionally, and wait for your case to be called. When your case is called, the judge will ask you how you plead. If you plead ""not guilty,"" the judge will set a date for your trial. The judge may also require you to pay your fine, which will be held as bail and returned to you if you win your case at trial., You can represent yourself at trial, or you can hire an attorney.If you choose to represent yourself, take some time to prepare to present your case. Prepare a brief summary of the case to recite or read to the judge at the beginning of the hearing. Practice telling your story calmly and clearly. If you have documents or photographs that help your case (such as copies of your license and registration, a receipt showing that you had your vehicle serviced by a mechanic, or a photograph showing the speed limit in the area where you were ticketed), bring them in a binder so that you can easily refer to them in court.


Structure your opening statement like this: ""On (date), I was driving at (location) on my way home from work. At (time), I was pulled over by Officer Jones, who gave me a ticket for (violation). Officer Jones must have been mistaken, because I did not commit the violation. I ask the Court to dismiss the case against me.""

, A witness who actually saw the incident can be helpful in court. If you have a useful witness, arrange for him or her to accompany you to court to testify on your behalf.


Your witness should be a passenger who was riding with you, or who saw you get pulled over. Do not bring a witness to testify that you are a good driver if that person did not actually witness the incident. Generalized testimony that you are usually a safe driver will not persuade a judge.
Practice questioning your witnesses beforehand so that you both know what questions you will ask and what answers the witness will give., On the trial date, you will have the opportunity to tell your side of the story, present evidence, and question witnesses (including the office who issued your citation). The judge will make a decision. If you are found not guilty, your bail money will be returned to you.At the trial, both you and the prosecution will have the opportunity to make opening statements.After opening statements, the prosecution will question the officer (or, if there is no prosecutor, the officer alone will begin testifying about what happened). You cancross-examine the officer about any inaccuracies in the officer's testimony.Next, you will give your side of the story, and the prosecution may cross-examine you. During cross-examination, keep your answers short, to the point, and truthful. If you don't know the answer, don't be afraid to say so.If you have any witnesses, they will be allowed to testify. Ask your witness what he or she observed. The prosecution can cross-examine your witnesses.In your closing statement, briefly summarize the evidence you presented and ask the judge to dismiss the case.

, Appellate courts are different from trial courts in that appellate courts are only concerned with legal mistakes, not factual ones. Thus, you can only appeal your case if the trial court misinterpreted the law, which affected the final decision in your case.Consider this example:


Section 21460 of the California Vehicle Code describes the law about double lines on the road. Double yellow lines are treated differently than double white lines.If you argued in court that the lines were white, but the court determined that the lines were yellow, then the decision is probably not appealable. (This is a factual dispute.) However, if the court acknowledged that the lines where white but still applied the law for yellow lines, then the issue is probably appealable. (This is a dispute about the law.)

, The appeals court is separate from the trial court. Typically, you need to file forms with both courts to move forward with your appeal. The clerk will likely direct you to file a notice of appeal, a request that the trial court prepare and send its records to the appeals court, and a brief arguing the law.The clerk should be able to direct you to pre-printed forms.

, To adequately argue the law in your brief, you will need to do some research. Refer to your state's vehicle code, which should be available online through the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. You may also have a reason to consult your state's evidence code or other sources of law. You should be able to locate other codes by searching online as well, or by visiting a local public library, law library, or university law library.


To search for case law, you can use https://scholar.google.com/, or visit a law library. Law libraries will have print resources, and may offer access to specialized legal research services, such as WestLaw and LexisNexis.
If your appeal raises a legal question that has never been answered by California court, the appeals court may be persuaded if you cite cases and statutes from other states that have dealt with the issue differently.

, Your brief is where you argue the law as it applies to your case. The brief is the most important and difficult part of the appeals process.In drafting your brief, structure your argument like this:


Describe the decision the judge made. Include the evidence and the law upon which the judge relied.
Give your own correct interpretation of the law.
Argue why your interpretation is correct, using references to the text of the law and prior cases where a different court applied your interpretation.
Describe how the outcome of your case would have been different if the judge had used the correct interpretation of the law.

, Note that your brief and other paperwork may not all have the same deadline. You may have an early deadline to file your notice of appeal, and a later deadline to file your brief. When filing your papers, make several copies and take them to the court clerk. The clerk will stamp your documents and file them.


The court clerk will set a date for oral argument. When you submit your paperwork, you may have the opportunity to waive oral arguments. If you waive oral argument, the appeals court may not require you to argue in court and will make a ruling based only upon the brief you submitted.The clerk will charge a filing fee. If you cannot afford to pay the fee, ask the clerk how to submit a request for a fee waiver.

, You must serve copies of your documents on the prosecuting attorney, which may be the city attorney, district attorney or another government agency, depending on your jurisdiction. To serve the prosecuting attorney, have a professional process server, sheriff's department, or someone over the age of 18 and not involved in the case deliver or mail the documents. Ask the court clerk for a proof of service form. Have the process server fill out and sign the form. Then file the proof of service with the court.The prosecution will serve you with a copy of its brief as well. Review the brief and prepare to respond to the arguments in it.

, If you did not waive your right to oral argument, go to court on the date set by the clerk. The court will have read your brief and the brief from the prosecuting attorney, and will ask questions to get you to elaborate on or clarify the arguments you made in your brief. The court will either announce its decision or dismiss you and respond by a future deadline set by state law. The clerk will mail you a notice of the appellate court's decision.Oral argument will most likely follow a format where a judge asks you or the prosecution a question about the contents of the briefs before giving the other side an opportunity to respond. A sample question might be: ""Mr. Smith, in your brief, you cited an earlier case where the outcome was favorable to the defendant, but I think the facts are too dissimilar to be applicable here. Would you care to comment on the relevance of that case as you see it?""

Be calm and polite to the officer.,
Turn your car off and make the interior of the car completely visible so that the officer can see into your car by turning the lights on.,
Be respectful to the officer and comply with his requests.,
Do not change your attitude into a combative one, if the officer does not let you go and he decides to write you up a ticket.,
Remember all the details of the experience as closely as possible, once you leave the scene after receiving the speeding ticket.

,
Call Ticket Busters.,
Look up your exact vehicle code in a search engine like Google or Yahoo.,
Look for any loopholes.,
A gentleman was traveling at about 85 mph (137 km/h) on the highway.",How to Fight a Speeding Ticket in California with Ticket Busters," You want your attitude to assist you in achieving your desired outcome not hinder it. Whatever you do, do not argue with the officer or create any sort of animosity. Arguing with the officer does not increase your likelihood of leniency so treat him as if you would want to be treated.

, This is so that you can take away any unnecessary tension that the officer may have in pulling a car over. He does not know that your car is not loaded with drugs or weapons and they are trained to expect the worse. By having your hands in plain sight and the interior of the car visible, you are showing complete submission to him and will be better prepared to explain your situation.

, Do not start asking him questions or begin pleading with him until after he has gotten through his initial questions. Once he has gotten your information ask him politely if you can speak with him regarding your speeding violation. Plead your case in a very polite and non-combative manner. Most officers will be lenient with you if you simply admit to speeding and tell them that his will cripple you financially. Let them know that you are very sorry for speeding and that you realized you were speeding but felt the flow of traffic was also going at the same speed but you were at fault for assuming that.

, You want to be as inconspicuous as possible to the officer.

,, They will help you beat a California speeding ticket!

, Use the particular Vehicle Code number on the ticket in the look-up field and find a reliable website for details. As an example, use the California Department of Motor Vehicles site.

, Consider the following story as an example of how important these vehicle code loopholes are.

, He knew that there were two spots up ahead where California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers ‘hide’ and wait for the unsuspecting speeders to race by. This man reduced his speed prior to passing the ‘hiding’ officers but, to his dismay, the CHP squad car pulled out and turned its lights on even though he had slowed to 65 mph (105 km/h). When the officer approached his car, the gentleman asked why he was being pulled over. The officer responded that it was because the gentleman was traveling close to 85 mph (137 km/h). The gentleman rebutted stating that he was only going 65 mph (105 km/h). The officer then informed the driver that an aircraft had clocked him at 85 mph (137 km/h) a few miles back. “Wow,” the driver thought to himself, “how am I going to beat this speeding ticket?”.
Well little did he know that he was actually in a pretty good position to beat this speeding ticket. The way that the aircraft ‘clocked’ him was by clocking the time it took the gentleman’s car to travel between two fixed points on the ground. Although math doesn't lie, there are a few points that should be examined in this scenario. First and most important, because two officers were involved in giving this citation, both must show up for court. If either officer does not show up, the gentleman’s case is dismissed. If the driver gets the case postponed, there is an even more likely chance that both officers will not show up. Secondly, being caught by an officer in an aircraft is a bit of a slippery slope. If one reads the law carefully he may be able to beat his speeding ticket. Consider this:
“40800. (a) A traffic officer on duty for the exclusive or main purpose of enforcing the provisions of Division 10 (commencing with Section 20000) or 11 (commencing with Section 21000) shall wear a full distinctive uniform, and if the officer while on duty uses a motor vehicle, it must be painted a distinctive color specified by the commissioner.”
What are the chances the officer in the aircraft was in full uniform? How about the aircraft itself, would it be considered a motor vehicle? Was it painted a distinctive color as specified by the commissioner? These are all valid points that can lead some to beat a speeding ticket before some judges.;
"
"
Read the procedure and deadlines carefully.,
Contest the ticket right away if possible.,
Note any mistakes on the ticket.,
Look for changes or alterations.,
Take photos of the area where you parked.,
Take video of a broken meter.,
Talk to witnesses.,
Request a hearing.,
Study the local ordinances.,
Appear at your hearing.,
Present your defenses.",How to Fight a Parking Ticket," Your ticket will have information explaining how to contest the citation and how long you have after the citation was issued.

, Even though you may have as many as 30 daysto request a hearing or contest your ticket, do it as soon as possible.


For example, in Chicago you have only seven days to contest a parking ticket.If there is a phone number you can call to contest the ticket listed, go ahead and call it immediately so you know you won't miss the deadline. If you can't do this immediately from your car, do what you need to do to contest the ticket as soon as you get home.

, Review the information the officer wrote on the ticket before it was left on your car, and make sure everything is correct and accurate.


The mistake has to be a major thing. For example, if you drive a silver Honda Civic and the ticket lists a green Volkswagen Beetle, that's clearly not your car. However, if the officer wrote the ticket for a ""gray Honda Civic,"" that's probably not enough of a difference to defeat your liability for the violation.

, Because ordinances in some cities prohibit officers from making a change to a parking ticket, any scribbled or scratched out information could constitute an unlawful alteration., Try to take photos before you move your car, especially if you have a dispute about whether the space is marked appropriately.


Typically it is a defense to a parking ticket that any signs or notices of prohibited or restricted parking were removed or obscured.For example, if a sign is obstructed and not clearly visible from your car's position, take a picture clearly showing this. If the curb should have been painted yellow in a no-parking zone and the yellow paint ended before the space where you parked your car, take a picture of the curb and your bumper.
Keep in mind that in many cities the burden of proof for the government will be much lower than at a criminal trial. For example, in Chicago the city's burden of proof is ""preponderance of the evidence."" This means that taking all circumstances into account, it was more likely than not that you violated the city code section referenced in your citation., If the meter where you parked was broken, you need to show it in action if you want to fight that ticket.


If possible, use your phone to take a video of you trying to put money in the meter, making sure the meter's read-out is clearly visible and shows that the money you're putting in the meter isn't registering.
You should do this as soon as possible, not as an afterthought later, since a broken meter may be fixed in the interim and cause you to lose your evidence.

, If you have a friend with you, or if a passerby agrees with you that you didn't deserve the ticket, make sure you write down names and numbers so they can testify at your hearing.


For example, if a stranger walking by mentions that she also thought it was legal to park where you parked, ask her if she'd be willing to help you fight your parking ticket. Parking ordinances often state that adequate notice of no-parking or restricted-parking zones is required, so multiple people testifying that notice was not adequate might defeat your ticket.

, An in-person hearing, if possible, is preferable to contesting your ticket online or through the mail.


Often fighting a parking ticket is a matter of being willing to take the time to wade through the procedure. Most people would rather simply pay the ticket than go to an extended effort to fight it, so if you put forth the effort you may be rewarded., Break down the ordinance you are cited with violating into distinct elements and analyze your parking in light of that ordinance.


Look carefully at what the statute requires, and whether the language in the statute allows for any subjective reasoning. For example, if the ordinance you were cited for violating includes language such as ""if practicable"" or ""safety permitting,"" you have room to argue that the condition required by the ordinance didn't exist in your case., Dress in clean, professional clothing and arrive for your hearing a few minutes early. Most hearings are not as formal as a court proceeding, but you should treat them with the same level of respect and decorum.In many jurisdictions, the officer who wrote your citation must appear at your hearing. If that officer doesn't show up, the ticket will be dismissed automatically., Explain clearly and succinctly to the judge or hearing officer why you should not have to pay the parking ticket.


Be honest and respectful to the judge or hearing officer, and try to avoid getting defensive or emotional. Stick to the facts and keep your remarks brief. After your initial statement, refrain from speaking anymore beyond answering direct questions.
If the officer who wrote your ticket is present, don't argue with him or interrupt him when he speaks.Typically, if the officer speaks at your hearing, you will have the opportunity to ask him questions.If you took pictures or videos at the scene, have them with you so the judge or hearing officer can review your evidence. Also bring several copies of any documents you have such as the original citation.If you have witnesses, you may call on them to speak. The city may have witnesses as well, including the officer who issued your citation."

Pull over as soon as you see the officer's lights and there is a safe spot to do so. You do not want to pull over in an intersection or anywhere else you might obstruct traffic. However, try not to wait more than 30 seconds to find a safe spot. Immediately put on your hazard lights to show you are respectful of the safety of other drivers on the road.Keep you hands visible as the officer approaches your car, placing both hands on the steering wheel. You do not want the officer to think you are being hostile or reaching for a weapon. When the officer asks for your license and registration, politely explain where these documents are and ask permission to reach for them.Show respect in your actions and words. No matter what happens, you must be polite and submissive. Do what the officer asks of you without arguing or getting defensive.;
, If you're being pulled over for speeding, the first thing the officer will ask you is if you know how fast you were going. Be prepared to answer this question in a way that does not further your legal trouble.


When the officer asks you, ""Do you know why I stopped you?"", answer, ""No, I don't."" Answering that you were speeding can be taken as an admission of guilt and sabotage your chances of successfully fighting the ticket.
If he asks how fast you were going, you do not have to answer the question. You have the right to remain silent. However, if you want to give some answer do not admit guilt here. Do not say, ""I was going 62 in a 55 zone,"" for example. Instead, give a noncommittal answer like, ""I'm not really sure.""
Now is not the time to fight your case. Do not say something like, ""I wasn't speeding. I checked my speedometer."" If you anger or otherwise frustrate the officer, he will probably remember you and be more likely to have specific memories and notations that can help the prosecution during trial.
If the officer asks to search the vehicle, you have the right to refuse. A search warrant is required without probable cause. If the officer says he will get a search warrant, politely tell him to do so and continue to refuse a search.

, While the officer is writing your citation, take advantage of this time to survey the scene.


Write down the make, model, license plate and unit number of the officer's car.
Take note of your precise location and try to get an approximate sense of where the alleged violation took place.
Take note of any weather conditions, such as rainfall or clouds, that could obscure the officer's judgment. Also, pay attention to the traffic conditions and look especially for extenuating circumstances that could have caused inadvertent speeding.
If you have any passenger's, take note of their names and make sure they stay silent during the exchange.
Write down anything the officer says.
Note as many small details as possible. This will help you look like a credible witness in court. Pay attention to your shirt color, any small dents or cracks in your car, and any noticeable physical characteristics of the officer.

, Once the officer returns to the car, he will hand you a citation to sign.


Remember, this is not an admission of guilt. It is merely an acknowledgment that you received the citation and understand you're receiving a speeding ticket.
Politely ask the officer if he can move the court appearance to the county seat. If he refuses, ask him to note the request. Having the appearance moved closer will make fighting the ticket easier for you.
Do not refuse to sign the citation. Once again, it's not an admission of guilt and refusing to sign it will not make you look favorable in the officer's eyes.

, Wait for the officer to pull out before you leave the scene and do so in a calm, collected manner. You do not want to appear angry or otherwise confrontational while leaving the scene as anything that makes you more memorable to the officer can result poorly for you during trial.

, When it comes to contesting a speeding ticket, you have a variety of options in terms of the route you take.


When you contest a ticket, you must enter a plea. Pleading guilty means you're accepting the ticket and paying the resulting fines, which will raise your insurance premiums. Pleading ""No Contest"" means you're not contending the charges but not pleading guilty either. This will, however, result in the same consequences as pleading guilty. Pleading ""Guilty with explanation"" means you admit to speeding but want to the court to take certain circumstances into consideration, which may result in your insurance premiums staying the same. However, the best way to avoid losing money over a speeding ticket is to simply plead ""not guilty"" and fight the ticket in court.
You should only plead ""guilty with explanation"" if you were speeding due to an emergency.If you plead ""not guilty,"" focus your defense on either challenging the officer's means of measuring your speed or his identification of your automobile. If there were many other cars similar to yours on the road that day, the officer may have pulled you over by mistake.Always check with your insurance before fighting a ticket. You want to see how much a conviction would affect your insurance premiums and whether the raise would be more or less than it would be if you simply accepted responsibility and paid the fine. Remember, only 50% of people who fight traffic tickets get their tickets dismissed.

, Once you've entered a plea, it's time to set your court date so you know how long you have to prepare your case.


There are three ways to set your court date. You can appear before a judge and enter a Not Guilty plea as well as a request for a court date. You could go to the County Clerk's office and request a trial date. You could mail a copy of the citation to the courthouse, along with a request for a trial date.
You usually have to post bail in the amount of the fine, so check with the court to make sure you have the proper amount and proper payment method. Posting bail means you've already paid your fine, so if you lose your case there will be no additional fees.
Your trial will occur within 45 days of the day you enter you plea. As soon as you've entered your plea, begin preparing for trial.
You probably do not need a lawyer for a speeding ticket. Lawyers are usually only brought into traffic court to fight violations that could result in jail time like DUI's and driving on a suspended license.

, The first step to prepping for your defense is to make a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles. You can get certain records at the DMV that can help you with your case.


You can verify the status of your driving record at the DMV. If you do not have previous traffic violations and have a clean driving record, bringing this kind of evidence to court can help your case. Someone at the DMV should be able to help you print your driving record for a small fee.

, You should know your rights as a defendant while going into court. Rights are often glossed over in traffic court to try and speed through the process and get you to pay the ticket. Review your rights before the trial begins.


You have the right to a court trial with a judge. A jury will usually not be called in for traffic court.
You do have a right to an attorney but, as previously discussed, this is probably not necessary when fighting a speeding ticket.
You have the right to subpoena witnesses or documents. This is an important right to be aware of. If there's anyone who can verify you were not speeding, call them in to testify. Do not call the officer who pulled you over to testify, however, as he will want to see you pay the fine to keep his reputation intact.
You have the right to cross-examine anyone who testifies against you, which usually means the officer who wrote the citation.
You have the right to remain silent. In other words, you do not have to testify against yourself. You should probably avoid testifying against yourself while fighting a speeding ticket as it is unnecessary and could make you look bad.

, While you wait for your trial, you should begin gathering evidence to support your case.


Go back to the scene of the citation. You should sketch a diagram of the scene that includes all roads, making the width of lanes, traffic controls like lights and signs, the location of your vehicle and the officer's vehicle when you were pulled over, any buildings, power lines, foliage, fences, or other notable features of the area.
Submit a request for certain public records. You should review the actual vehicle code in the area where you were allegedly speeding to make sure the officer pulled you over for the correct violation.
You can submit a discovery subpoena to the court to get certain documents that may help your case. You should get documents on the radar device used to determine your speed to check for any malfunctions or recent repairs. You should get a record on the police officer to look for any previous cases he's won or lost in traffic court. You should also get some information on the patrol car regarding any recent repairs or damages to the car.

, If you have time, visit the court and watch the judge oversee a few cases. You want to see how the judge interacts with defendants to get a feel for his personality. You also want to see what his relationship is with the prosecutor and the testifying officer. This should give you a sense of how intense your trial will be.

, Reviewing all the information you've gathered, pick a line of defense you feel will be most likely to help you win your case.


A lack of prosecution witness is an easy way to get a ticket dismissed. If the officer does not show, which happens sometimes, you will be found not guilty. Be prepared to use this as your defense if the officer is not present on your court date.
If the prosecution fails to prove the case against you, you will be found not guilty. Knowing the code well, and having good witnesses and diagrams of the crime scene, can help you win your case this way.
Technicalities can also help you get your ticket dismissed. If the officer was in the wrong jurisdiction or enforcing the wrong code for the area, for example, the judge would likely rule in your favor.
You can also get the ticket dismissed by proving a factual error. For example, you could prove you were driving the proper speed or the radar reading was inaccurate.

, When you enter the courtroom, you need to make a good impression on the judge. Choose an appropriate and professional looking outfit. Dress as if you were interviewing for a job. This will make you appear reliable and responsible.

, Make sure you know the members of the courtroom on your trial day.


The defendant is you, as you're the person fighting charges.
The prosecutor/ADA is the individual or team working on behalf of the state to prove your guilt.
The judge is the person overseeing the case, who has final authority on the rulings. He will have a court clerk, who is his assistant. A bailiff will help conduct the ceremony of a trial.
The police officer, if he shows up, will be the main witness of the prosecution.

, The trial will begin with you stating your case. This is where you present the evidence you've gathered to show the judge why you believe your ticket should be dismissed. This can be a stressful procedure, so be sure to practice your opening statement several times before the trial date.

, Once you've presented your defense, the prosecution will make their case against you.


The prosecution will strive to prove you're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. To do so, the prosecutor will usually call up the officer who issued your citation and ask him a series of questions in an attempt to establish his reliability.
Take notes during the prosecution so you can prepare your cross-examination. On one side of a sheet of paper, note what was said. On the other side, note your possible comments and questions to raise during cross-examination.

, During the cross-examination, you have a chance to ask the witnesses brought by the prosecution a variety of questions. The goal is to undermine their authority and bring about reasonable doubts that you committed the violation.


Ask specifics. Making it appear that the witness does not remember facts correctly casts doubt in the judge's eyes. The details you wrote down earlier in terms of the incident you were pulled over will come in handy here. If the officer, for example, does not remember it was raining and a Tuesday he might not look like a less reliable witness.
Ask questions you think might help your case. If, for example, you're trying to prove the officer pulled over the wrong car ask if he remembers that there were two other blue Honda Civics on the highway that morning. If you're trying to prove his radar system was faulty, ask if he was aware at the time of the citation his radar device was 3 weeks overdue for basic maintenance.
Remember, you're not making any arguments during cross-examination. You're only asking questions.

, Once the judge has heard both sides, he will make a ruling. He will either decide to dismiss the ticket or ask you to pay the fine.


If the judge rules against you, you can appeal the case to a higher court. However, an appeal is not a new trial with new witnesses. An appellate court will only look to see if any legal errors were made and whether these errors affected the final decision in the case."

Check if an exception applies.,
Identify other defenses.,
Find witnesses.,
Obtain phone records.,
Hire a traffic attorney if you need help.",How to Fight a Cell Phone Ticket in California1," California’s ban on cell phone use has several exceptions. The easiest way to fight the ticket is to show that an exception applies to you. Check the following:Were you making an emergency call? The law doesn’t apply to you if you were calling the police, fire department, or emergency services.
Were you operating an authorized emergency vehicle? If so, then you shouldn’t get a ticket.
Were you operating your vehicle on private property? The law doesn’t apply in this situation.;
, You can always claim you weren’t using your phone and that the officer is mistaken. You can also raise these other defenses:


You weren’t moving. You can argue you were actually parked when you were using your cell phone.
Your passenger used the phone. The officer might have seen someone using the phone, but it wasn’t you.
You were using the speaker phone. If you are at least 18 or older, the law allows you to do this.
You used a hands-free phone. Drivers 18 and older can use hands-free phones like Bluetooth or other earpieces, so long as both ears aren’t covered., You’ll strengthen your case if other people can testify on your behalf. Make sure the witness has relevant information, which will depend on your defense. For example, your defense might be that you were using the speaker phone on your cell phone. In that situation, someone sitting in the car with you would make a good witness.


You can make a witness show up to court and testify by serving them with a subpoena. Get subpoenas from the court clerk’s office., You might argue that you were calling emergency services when you were stopped. In that situation, you’ll need copies of your phone records to show who you called. You can get copies of your phone records by contacting your cell phone provider.

, California doesn’t offer free attorneys for traffic citations, so you’ll need to hire someone yourself. Get a lawyer if you don’t know how to defend yourself or are feeling overwhelmed.


Find a traffic attorney by contacting California’s state bar or a lawyer referral service in your county.Ask how much the attorney charges. You shouldn’t hire someone if you can’t afford them.

Plead not guilty by mail.",How to Fight a Cell Phone Ticket in California2," You can fight the ticket in one of two ways: by having a court trial or a trial by mail. A court trial is a two-step process: you request an arraignment where the judge reads the charges against you and you enter a plea. Then you attend a trial.


With a trial by written declaration, you never show up to court. You waive the arraignment and instead present written evidence. Not everyone has the option of a trial by written declaration. Check your ticket or courtesy notice, which might state you need to appear in court., Your traffic ticket should give you a date when you must appear in court. The state should also send you a reminder notice. Go to court on that date and ask the court clerk for an arraignment.You’ll need to schedule an arraignment and a trial date. They can be the same date or on different dates.


If you want them on the same day, you must pay your bail deposit. This amount will be refunded if you are found not guilty.At the arraignment, you will plead not guilty.
You can also request a trial by written declaration when you go to court.

, You don’t have to schedule an arraignment hearing. Instead, you can request a trial by stopping into the traffic clerk’s office at any point before your Notice to Appear date.

Dress professionally.,
Ask the officer questions.,
Call your own witnesses.,
Testify confidently.,
Make a closing argument.,
Receive the verdict.,
Appeal if you lose.",How to Fight a Cell Phone Ticket in California3," People will start judging you as soon as soon as they see you, so look your best. You don’t have to wear a suit, but dress pants and a dress shirt would be ideal. Wear dress shoes if you have them.


If you only have jeans, make sure they are neat and clean.

, Your lawyer can do this if you have one. If you don’t, then you should write up a list of questions to ask. The questions will depend on your situation, but consider asking the following:


“What color car was I driving?” or “What color jacket was I wearing?” You want to cast doubt on the officer’s ability to see clearly.If the officer doesn’t know the answers to these questions, it shows they weren’t paying close attention.
“How fast was I going?” This is a good defense if you claim you weren’t moving. Follow up and ask how the officer knew your speed.

, You can ask your witnesses questions. Remember that they can only testify as to what they observed. After you ask questions, the judge might ask follow-up questions.


Avoid asking leading questions, which can be answered with a “yes” or “no.”For example, don’t ask, “You never saw me make a phone call, did you?”
Instead, as a series of questions to get the same information. “Where were you sitting in the car?” “What were you looking at?” After that, you can ask, “Did anyone make a phone call?”

, You aren’t required to testify in court.However, you might have to testify if you didn’t have a passenger you can testify as to what you were doing. You want to be a credible witness, so do the following:


Sit up straight. Slouching signals you’re afraid of the truth. Push your shoulders back and look everyone in the eye.
Avoid guessing. If you don’t know an answer, say, “I don’t know.” That’s better than guessing and being wrong.Speak in whole words and sentences. Don’t say “uh huh” or make other non-word sounds.
Leave humor at home. Your friends might think you’re the life of the party, but everyone’s humor is different.

, The judge might let you make a closing argument. The best arguments are based on the evidence, not theatrics. Tell the judge why you didn’t break the law and remember to mention specific pieces of evidence.


For example, your defense might be that a passenger was using the phone, not you. In that case, your argument might sound something like this: “Your Honor, the evidence shows I didn’t use the phone while driving. My two witnesses, Mrs. Kim and Ms. White, testified that Mrs. Kim was using the phone as she sat in the passenger’s seat. There’s no reason to credit Officer Kendrick’s testimony. He didn’t even know the color of my car or the color of the sweater I was wearing. He simply testified that he saw someone on the phone.”

, After all evidence has been presented, the judge will issue a verdict. If you lose, then you’ll need to pay your fines and penalties. However, if you already paid bail money before trial, your fine will be deducted from it. If the bail money is insufficient, you’ll have to pay the extra.If you win, then any bail money you paid should be refunded to you.

, An appeal is not a new trial. Instead, the appellate court will review the record to see if the judge made an error or if no substantial evidence supports the verdict. Those are the only ways you can win, so think carefully if bringing an appeal is worth it.


File your notice of appeal within 30 days of the verdict. Ask the clerk for a Notice of Appeal form and fill it out."

, When the judge announces your name and case you will be asked to identify yourself, at which time you will be able to enter a plea. Once you plead not-guilty, a date for your court-hearing will be set.


Be sure to be on time.

, The court clerk will help you with all of the appropriate paperwork, and will be able to provide you with further information regarding your personal defense.


This will include a time and date for your hearing, as well as a specific courtroom address and room number.

, Properly filing a ""request for production"" is very important. It establishes a legal date of receipt.


Depending on your state, the prosecutor will then have a pre-determined amount of time to respond.
If they fail to respond, you can ask to have your case dismissed.
This paperwork will be needed when you return to court.

, Red light cameras take two pictures – one of the driver and one of the car's license plate.


If someone else is driving, and this is clear in the photograph, you can ask to have your case dismissed.
You can also ask to have your case dismissed if the photograph of the driver is blurred or unclear, to the point that the driver's identity remains in question.
Check the license plate. If it doesn't match the car you own, raise this as evidence for dismissal of the ticket.

, This written request requires the prosecutor to provide you with a list of the evidence that is going to be used against you in court. If this request is not met within a set number of days--which is determined by your local state laws--it may be grounds to have your ticket dismissed.Consult your traffic court clerk for more details regarding the number of days your state allows the prosecutor to respond.
Evidence can include photographs, lists of witnesses, etc., If you have already visited the court clerk, you will have all of the information needed to properly serve the prosecutor. When a prosecutor is served, he or she is legally acknowledging that they have indeed received your request. This establishes a legal date of receipt.If the prosecutor does not provide you with this; or does so beyond the legally allotted amount of time determined by your state, you can ask to have your case dismissed.

, This includes copies of your written request, copies of the paperwork you filed to serve the prosecutor, and anything that you have received in return.


All of this is evidence.
You will need this in case you request to have your case dismissed for any reason.

, Again, if the prosecutor has failed to present you with a ""request for production;"" or if it was not provided in the legally-allotted time, you can ask the judge to dismiss your case.

, Specifically, review the photograph.


Is it clearly you in the photograph? If not, it can be grounds for dismissal.
If you were not the individual driving the car, then the photographs should support that claim and you can have your case dismissed.

, Visit the scene and take detailed notes. Time the traffic light as it transitions from yellow-to-red. If the timing is minimal, you might be able to stage an argument in court that there is not enough time to safely bring your vehicle to a stop at the particular intersection.


A copy of the photograph should be included with your ""request for production.""

, You should have a clear line of defense and be able to explain exactly why it is your case should be dismissed. Is the timing of the light too short? Is it not you in the photograph? Are you hoping to have your case thrown out due to some other 'loop-hole'?


Know exactly what you are going to argue before you enter the courtroom.
Have a clear reason for your case to be dismissed.

, Arrange each piece of paperwork or evidence neatly in a folder and in the order that you wish to present it to the judge.


It might be helpful to have a checklist of points that you wish to make.

, Specifically, the court address, hearing time, and court-room number. The courthouse that you will have your case heard may not be the same courthouse where you were first arraigned. Be sure you know where you are going and when you need to be there.

, Your case will not be the only one that the judge will be hearing that day; rather, he or she will be hearing several cases. The order in which the cases are heard will be determined by the court.


Be prepared to spend an entire day at the courthouse.
You may want to pack a lunch or bring snacks.
You might have to pay for parking, so be prepared.

, The judge will then briefly review the details of your case before allowing the prosecutor to present the evidence against you.


Do not interrupt.

, There may be bits of information that are new to you, or that perhaps you were unprepared to address.

, Specifically, pay attention to any discrepancies between the prosecutor's verbal argument and the hard-evidence being presented.

, If any of these conditions have not been met than you may have grounds to have your case dismissed by the judge.


A ""request for production"" was not received, or was not received in the proper amount of time.Your hearing has been delayed by the court beyond a responsible expectation to a ""fair and speedy trial."" Your court clerk can will have more information regarding the number of days your state has determined as ""fair and speedy."", When it is your time to present your case, begin by providing a detailed account of the event from your own perspective. Include relevant information such as exact time, day, intersection, weather conditions, etc.


Point out any discrepancies between your account and the prosecutor's.
Does the prosecutor's account match the hard evidence?

, After you have described the conditions of the event, and after you have addressed any discrepancies, you should go ahead and re-assert to the judge why it is you wish to have your case dismissed.


Were there any extenuating circumstances that you believe should be considered?
Is the timing of the light flawed?
Was it unsafe to stop?

, Only provide evidence that fully-supports your claim, or that directly challenges the case as it was presented by the prosecutor.


After you have presented your evidence, the judge will then move on to the closing statements.
The prosecutor will go first.

, You do not necessarily need to respond to his or her closing statements as you have already made your case.

, Reiterate and summarize your argument or the reason you are seeking dismissal. Be as clear and concise as possible. Speak as if answering the question, ""why should your case be dismissed?""


Be factual, not emotional.

, If all went well, then you may have just successfully defended yourself against a red-light camera violation.

Raise any other possible defenses.",How to Dispute a Traffic Camera Ticket," Because camera tickets are sent to the owner of the car, not the driver, make sure you actually were driving the car when the ticket was issued.


Generally, the prosecutor must prove that you were driving in that location at that date and time. If someone else borrowed your car, you can't be prosecuted.However, understand that some states such as New York treat red-light camera tickets like parking violations, holding registered owners liable rather than the driver specifically.Make sure you check the red light law in the jurisdiction where you got the ticket.
If you were driving your car, try to reconstruct the scene and remember what you were doing or what was happening at the time, and write down any details you remember. For example, you may have been making a legal right turn on red when the camera took the photo. If you were making a legal maneuver you should be able to get the ticket dismissed.;
, Read the law and make sure you understand both its elements and the penalties for violation.


Make sure if penalties are listed in the code section that they match the fines or penalties assessed on your ticket.
Remember that it is the prosecution's burden to prove each element of your violation – it's not your responsibility to prove that you didn't do it.

, If the notification you received included photos, review them to confirm that its your car in the photo, and that the photo is clear.


Your best defense may turn out to be the blurriness of the photo. If the license tag isn't clearly visible, it may be difficult to confirm that the car is yours.If there's no clearly identifiable photo of you in the driver's seat, this may present another avenue of defense. You will be under oath, so you can't argue that you weren't driving if you were – however, you can argue that the prosecution can't prove you were driving, or has no evidence that you were driving. This will get you off the hook if you live in a jurisdiction that requires tickets follow the driver, not the registered owner of the car.If photos were not included with your citation, you may need to wait until after your trial is scheduled to request copies from law enforcement., Some jurisdictions allow you to respond to the citation either by mail or online, rather than going to a live arraignment in traffic court, for less serious traffic violations such as speeding or running a red light.You must plead not guilty if you want to dispute the traffic camera ticket, and you can't pay the fine listed. In some jurisdictions, paying the fine is considered an admission of guilt.
Check your citation and make sure you plead not guilty before the deadline. Typically you'll have 30 days to dispute the ticket, but the time period may be shorter., If you have no choice but to appear in traffic court if you intend to plead not guilty, show up at the date and time listed on your citation.


This also may be called a first appearance or a notice hearing, depending on your jurisdiction., When you plead not guilty, demand a full formal hearing or trial.


When you request a full trial, you also may be required to attend other hearings such as a pre-trial hearing or mediation.Attend those as required, but don't accept anything less than a full dismissal of your traffic camera ticket.

, Now that you have a court date, call up the local police department or other law enforcement agency in charge of the camera used to issue your citation.


If photos were not included with your citation, you'll need to request copies of them.You also should request full maintenance records for the camera and the traffic light or speed monitoring system to establish that they were regularly monitored and maintained. If their accuracy wasn't tested within a short period of time before your ticket was issued, the photo is potentially unreliable as evidence., Look for cases in your city or county about traffic cameras, and see if any appellate court decisions have ruled on the legality of traffic camera tickets.


Aside from the camera itself, there may be other defenses that are recognized by law. For example, some states have specific rules about where warning signs must be posted for traffic lights. If the warning signs were obscured or not present, you'd have a defense.
Some states recognize a necessity defense for speeding. Since obviously a camera cannot tell why you were speeding, you may be able to get out of the ticket this way., Arrive at the courthouse on the day of your hearing with copies of any documents you intend to use as evidence in your defense.


Make sure anything you bring with you is organized and you have a clean, professional appearance. Treat the judge and all courthouse staff with respect. Don't do anything to give the judge the opportunity to make a snap judgment that you are untrustworthy or have an attitude problem.

, The prosecutor will have the first opportunity to speak in your case. Listen quietly, making notes where something is said that you want to bring up later, but do not interrupt or speak directly to the prosecutor., In some jurisdictions such as Broward County, Florida,a red light camera photo is considered hearsay.Basically, hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement presented in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted.In this case, the photo is an out-of-court ""statement"" that prosecution is attempting to use to prove you violated the traffic law.
Hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless it fits into one of the exceptions carved out of the rule. However, there are more than two dozen hearsay exceptions.Some courts have fit traffic camera photos into these exceptions, but others have not. Research the issue to find out if this objection is available in your jurisdiction.

, The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees you the right to cross-examine witnesses.


Unless a witness appears who maintains the record and system associated with the camera, you do not have this opportunity., If no one from the company that maintains the camera shows up to testify, object to the use of the photographs for lack of foundation.Likewise, if you have a camera ticket for speeding, the company or officer who maintained the camera and the speed detection equipment must appear in court to testify or the photo has no foundation to be admitted into evidence.
For the prosecution to rely on the photos, it must present evidence that the camera that took the photo, the system that connected it to the traffic light, and the traffic light itself were functioning properly. Without establishing this foundation that all of these machines are reliable, the photo is not reliable and cannot be admitted into evidence., If the photos are clear and the judge allows them, but none of them clearly show you driving, you have a defense that the prosecution cannot prove it was you driving the car.The photo also provides no proof that the traffic light was functioning properly. If prosecution can't prove the traffic light was functioning properly, they can't prove that you ran the red light.These same arguments apply if you have a camera ticket for speeding. Prosecution must prove that the speed detection system was functioning properly for the photo to be evidence that you were speeding.

, If your attack on the camera fails and the photos are admitted as evidence, use any other defenses you may have found in your research that applied in your case.


You don't have to deny guilt for many of these defenses to work. For example, if you use the defense that you acted out of necessity to avoid harm to yourself or others, you're basically saying that you committed the violation but it was for a good reason."

If you intend to fight your traffic ticket, then you need to plead not guilty. You can do this online.Don’t delay. You have 15 days to answer the ticket. If you fail to answer in time, then your license will be suspended.Driving with a suspended license is itself a crime, and definitely worse than getting a speeding ticket.;
, Once online, you will have the option to select a hearing date. Appropriate dates will be presented. Make sure that you pick a date that you know you can attend.


You will receive a notice of hearing in the mail. Make sure that your address is updated so that you receive the notice.

, You can enter a not guilty plea on the ticket and then send the ticket to Traffic Violations Plea Unit, PO Box 2950—ESP, Albany, NY 12220-0950.Keep a copy of the ticket for your records.


Make sure to mail the ticket within 15 days of the violation date. To be safe, you should send it right away.

, You also have the option of pleading not guilty in person at any TVB location. You can find the TVB nearest you by visiting https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/find-tvb-office-locations. Hours of operation are listed.


Remember that you can’t plead at a DMV Issuing office, which doesn’t handle this sort of thing.

, You must meet certain deadlines to reschedule. Generally, you can reschedule once. If you need to reschedule a second time, then you need to show “good cause,” such as an extenuating circumstance beyond your control.You can reschedule in person at a TVB office or by phone at least 24 hours before your hearing date.
To reschedule by mail, the appropriate TVB office must receive your letter at least 10 days before the hearing. If you received a ticket in NYC, then send your request to the Albany office.
However, if you received your ticket outside New York, then send your postponement request to the office listed on the ticket.

, You can have an attorney represent you at your TVB hearing.In fact, you might benefit from hiring an attorney, especially if you have a lot of points or are worried about your license being suspended.


You can obtain a referral to an attorney by contacting your appropriate county bar association. A listing is available here: http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/lris/directory/main.cfm?id=NY.
Hiring a lawyer to handle a speeding ticket can be expensive. Nevertheless, you can still meet with a lawyer for a consultation where you can discuss what will happen if you are convicted and what evidence you should get.

, You and the lawyer should look at your driving history and analyze how a conviction will impact you. You will accrue points depending on how fast you were going. The following rules apply:1–10 mph (1.6–16.1 km/h) over speed limit - 3 points
10–20 mph (16–32 km/h) over speed limit - 4 points
21–30 mph (34–48 km/h) over speed limit - 6 points
if over 31 mph (50 km/h), must appear in person - 8 points
More than 40 mph (64 km/h) over speed limit (possible suspension) - 11 points

, You can present evidence at your hearing to show that you weren’t speeding. Try to find anything that is helpful, which will depend on the circumstances of the stop. Consider the following:


If you had someone riding in the car with you, then this person could act as a witness. They could testify that you weren’t speeding or that another car was speeding and the cop stopped the wrong car.
You might claim that you couldn’t see the speed limit sign. In that situation, you want to return to the scene and take photographs from a variety of angles. Try to recreate the exact conditions by taking the photographs at the same time of day as when you were stopped.
You might also want to challenge the accuracy of the radar used to measure your speed. Unfortunately, in TVB court, you don't have a right to request written information from the police.Nevertheless, you should try to find out how the officer measured your speed (radar or laser).

, TVB hearings are open to the public, so anyone can attend.If you are nervous about representing yourself, then you should go and observe a couple hearings. Sit in the back and take notes.


An administrative law judge (ALJ) will act as the judge at the hearing. He or she is usually an experienced attorney who has been trained in traffic law.
Listen to how attorneys ask witnesses questions and how they make arguments to the judge.
Also pay attention to where people sit and how they speak to each other and to the court personnel.

, You want to make a good first impression on the judge. Accordingly, you should dress conservatively and neatly. You don’t have to wear a suit. However, your clothes should be washed and pressed. Don’t wear anything too tight.


See Dress for a Court Hearing for more information.

, There is no prosecutor in TVB--only you, the cop, the ALJ, and maybe your witnesses. If you want to make an opening statement, then ask the judge.Keep your opening statement brief. Simply hit the high points of what your witnesses will testify to.

, The police officer should testify about why you were given the ticket. You or your lawyer can then ask questions to cross-examine the officer. If the judge has questions, then he or she will ask questions as well.The purpose of cross-examination is to undermine the officer’s testimony, which you can do in several ways. For example, you could get the officer to admit that they didn’t have cause for pulling you over.Try to catch the officer in a lie. If they say they stopped you because your taillight was out, then ask why the ticket didn’t mention that fact.
You can also challenge the accuracy of the radar used to measure your speed. For example, the radar might not have been tuned properly before use. Or the officer might have actually clocked another car on the road that was passing you.

, You are not required to testify, and the judge will not find you guilty because you refuse. However, you can testify if you think it will help your case. You might want to testify if you don’t have a witness who was riding with you when you were pulled over. In that situation, only you can present your side of the story. Remember the following tips when testifying:Speak loud enough so that everyone can hear you. Also speak slowly. When people get nervous, they sometimes talk quickly.
If you don’t understand a question, ask for clarification. Also think before answering any question.
Direct your answer to the judge, who will decide the case, and not the lawyer asking you a question.
Never guess. Instead, say “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember.”

, If you have witnesses, then you can ask them questions at your hearing.You must remember the following tips so that you can effectively present their testimony:


Only have someone testify if they have relevant, first-hand knowledge. Don’t have someone testify if you spoke to them after you got pulled over. They didn’t observe anything that will help the judge reach a decision.
Write out a list of questions beforehand, and go over your questions with the witnesses. Don’t tell them what to say. Instead, you want to understand how they will answer on the stand.
Don’t ask leading questions. A leading question suggests its own answer.“I wasn’t speeding, right?” is a leading question. Instead, you can ask, “How fast was I driving?” and “How do you know that?”
Make sure your witnesses don’t wander. Get the relevant answer from them and move onto your next question.

, After the ALJ hears all of the evidence, they will deliver a verdict. You will be found not guilty if the evidence doesn’t show your guilt by clear and convincing evidence.However, if you are found guilty, then the ALJ will deliver a sentence.


For example, the ALJ could set a fine.
Your license or registration may also be suspended or revoked entirely. This will depend on your overall driving history.
If you are found guilty, the ALJ will probably hold the point hearing immediately after your trial if the points in any 18-month period total 11 or more. Points will be added based on the date of the violation, not the date of your guilty verdict.

, You have the option of appealing a guilty verdict. Only appeal if you think the judge made an error about the facts or the law. You must file your appeal within 30 days of your conviction. It costs $10 per conviction to file.You can appeal in person or by mail by completing a Traffic Violations Bureau Appeal form (AA-33). It is available for download here: https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/aa33.pdf. You can also pick it up at your local TVB office. Mail the completed form to DMV Appeals Board, PO Box 2935, Albany, NY 12220-0935.
You can also appeal online. Once you file, you will receive a three-digit Appeal Access number. You can use this number to check on the status of the appeal.

Keep in mind that you're still liable for the violation even if someone else was driving your car.However, if the license tag isn't yours, it's possible you received the violation as a result of a clerical error.
For tolled locations where automatic passes are used, if a driver passes through without using one of the pass accounts, a photo of the license tag is taken. That photo is transmitted to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, which provides the name and address of the registered owner of the car.If the photo isn't clear, the tolling agency may get the license tag number wrong, or may send the violation notice to the wrong address.The Illinois Tollway gives you two ways to dispute a license tag image: You may either state that the plate is incorrect, or that the image is missing. If the license tag image is so blurred that the numbers and letters are illegible, you would select ""missing image"" to dispute your toll violation.If the tag in the image is not your license tag, you also should be able to dispute the violation and have the violation waived.;
, If you've recently sold your car, or if it was stolen, you typically won't be liable for the charges assessed.You won't be liable for the toll or the violation if your car was reported stolen before the violation occurred.Although violations typically are mailed to the address on file with the DMV at the time the violation occurs, if you recently sold the car, the DMV information may not have been updated yet., If you have an active payment account with the tolling authority, the violation may be in error.


If you have a prepaid toll account, you may receive a violation if there wasn't enough money in your account to cover the toll. You usually can remedy this situation by checking and updating the status of your payment account.If you have a sticker or other pass, you may receive a violation if the sticker wasn't detected by the tolling location for some reason. As long as your account is active and current, you should be able to resolve the problem by associating the toll bill assessed with your active account., You only have a brief amount of time – sometimes as little as two weeks – to respond to the violation and dispute the charges or they will be presumed valid.


Since the deadlines are different in every state and sometimes among different toll road operators within a state, it's important to read your notice carefully and use the dates or time periods provided on the notice you received, rather than going by anything you've seen elsewhere or done before.

, Most toll road operators have a website, or a toll-free phone number, where you can quickly and easily register a dispute.


For example, the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency in California allows you to contest a violation either online or through the mail. A ""Contest of Notice"" form is included on your violation notice, which you can fill out and return to the agency., Typically you can find a dispute form at the toll road operator's website that you need to file a dispute.


For example, if you receive a notice of violation from the Illinois Tollways, you can download an affidavit of non-liability form from the tollway's website, which you can fill out and submit.Some toll agencies also provide the option of disputing your toll violation using email or fax. Contact the agency that assessed your violation to find out the methods available to dispute the violation., Some forms may have a list of valid reasons from which you can choose, while others simply ask that you explain your reasons., Make sure you've included your correct name and current address and contact information on the form before you submit it.


Your notice should include an address or other methods to register your dispute with the proper authority.

, Typically the toll road authority will investigate the dispute and mail you a report detailing the results of the investigation., Each toll road authority has its own process for appealing an initial investigation or continuing a dispute if you believe you are not liable for the charges assessed.


For example, the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency allows you to seek administrative review if you are not satisfied with the initial investigation of your violation. If you still are not satisfied with the results of the administrative review, you can appeal with the municipal court., If you need to request a hearing or appeal to a different government body, you must fill out the correct form by the deadline on your report.


Forms typically are made available online or by contacting the appropriate toll agency or board.When you complete your forms, attach any documents or other information that you intend to use as evidence to support your claim that you are not responsible for paying the toll or penalties., Typically you must file a request for a hearing with an administrative board to hear your dispute.


Pay attention to the deadlines for appeal. After you receive notice, you only have a brief period of time to request a hearing, and it may only be a couple of weeks.However, some states such as Illinois give you up to 30 days to request a hearing.Often this deadline is calculated from the post mark on the notice. Thus, it is possible that you only have a few days to request a hearing, depending on how long it took for you to get the notice after it was mailed to you.Some agencies may require you to pay a fee or deposit when you request a hearing. For example, the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency requires your request for an administrative hearing be accompanied by a deposit of either $250 or the amount of the toll evasion penalties assessed, whichever is less.Although hearings typically are less formal than an actual trial, you will exchange evidence with the administrative board. For example, if you file a request for a hearing with the Washington State Department of Transportation, you can pick up an evidence packet from any of the walk-in customer service centers three days before your scheduled hearing., Once your hearing is scheduled, you must appear at the scheduled time if you intend to continue disputing the violation.


State law typically requires the hearing to be scheduled within a certain amount of time after your request. For example, in California, the hearing must be scheduled within 15 days of the toll agency's receipt of your request.Often you have the option of appearing either in person or over the telephone."

Don’t put yourself in the position of getting into serious trouble and possible injuring other people. You can also minimize the possibility of getting stopped by making sure that your car is in good operating order, that all your headlights and taillights are working properly, and by obeying all the rules of the road., If a police officer does pull you over while you are driving, you may be able to avoid a DUI arrest if you are respectful and cooperative. You may not know why the officer stopped you, and it could be for something unrelated to drinking. If you can address the officer’s initial concerns, you may avoid further problems., As with any other criminal charge, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and you have the right not to incriminate yourself. If the officer asks whether you have been drinking or where you are coming from, you should politely decline to answer. Answering these questions is not likely to help you, but your answers could get you into further trouble.Understand that the familiar Miranda warnings do not generally apply to a DUI traffic stop because you are not deemed to be ""in custody"" at the time.Know that whatever you say may be used against you in court, whether or not the officer recites the Miranda warnings.

, It will be important for your defense later to try to recall as many details as possible from your traffic stop. Pay attention to what the police officer says and directs you to do.

, There are a few different tests that the police officer may instruct you to take at the time of the stop. If you participate in these, you should pay attention to as many details as possible about their administration. If the officer does not administer the tests properly, you may be able to challenge the results later in court. There are three primary tests that are likely to be administered:Nystagmus gaze test. The officer will position an object, usually a pen or a finger, about a foot in front of the driver’s face and move the object from side to side while watching the eye movement. This is generally a reliable test, although some people may successfully challenge it in court because the police officers are not medically trained.
The walk and turn test. This test is about 68% accurate in determining whether a driver is under the influence of alcohol. The officer will ask the driver to walk in a straight line and then turn around and return. The test can be challenged in court if the officer fails to administer the test on solid, level ground, or if the driver had some other condition that would interfere, such as leg or back pain.
The one-leg stand. The officer will ask the driver to lift one leg and stand still on the other, usually while counting. Drivers may be able to challenge this test if the ground was not level, if the driver was wearing high heels, or if the driver has leg or back problems.

, If the officer administers either a breathalyzer or blood or urine test, you should try to note the type of test, as well as the time that it is administered. Some states have certain requirements about when these tests must be administered in relation to the traffic stop. If too much time goes by, the test may not be valid. In some states, you also have the right to request an independent test of your own, and if this does not happen, you may challenge the test as well., Depending on your familiarity with the law of your jurisdiction, you may wish to refuse a breathalyzer or blood or urine test. However, be aware that many states have enacted “implied consent” laws, which basically say that when you get your license and operate a motor vehicle, you are giving your consent to a chemical test. If you are stopped in a state with implied consent laws, then refusing to undergo the test could result in suspension or loss of your license, regardless of the result. It is important for you to understand your local laws before making this decision.In many states with implied consent laws, simply refusing to take a breathalyzer test is treated as an indication of guilt, or is a crime by itself. Whether you are ultimately found guilty of DUI, you could have your license suspended just for refusing the test., As soon as possible after your traffic stop, write down your observations. Keep thorough notes of what the officer did and said, and how any tests were administered. These notes may provide you or your attorney with details that could help your case at trial and minimize an suspension of your license., A good attorney who is experienced in the field of criminal defense work, and particularly working with DUI charges, will be able to help you challenge your stop and may be able to reduce the charges against you.


If you have the resources to hire your own attorney, look for someone with experience in your area, in working with DUI cases. Try to get a referral from someone you know, or contact the bar association in your area for possible referrals.
If you cannot afford an attorney, the court is required to appoint you a public defender. If you are in police custody, ask for an attorney right there. If not, contact either the police station or district attorney’s office to find out how to have a public defender appointed to you.

, In most states, a police officer must have a valid reason for stopping you in the first place. If you were driving safely and there was no supportable reason for stopping you, then everything else that came from the stop may be inadmissible in court., Very often, a DUI conviction rests on the police officer’s own conclusion that you “appeared” to be under the influence. Usually, this will be based on such factors as slurred speech, watery or bloodshot eyes, or the smell of alcohol. You may be able to challenge these conclusions by providing alternative reasons. If you were ill, had been using mouthwash recently, or were overtired, you may be able to explain the officer’s observations., As noted above, the field sobriety tests have only about a 65% reliability level when administered properly.While this statistic alone is not likely to help you, you can question whether the officer administered the tests properly, or raise alternate explanations for your ability to perform well. If you had a recent injury, if you were overly tired at the time, or if you believe the officer did not explain the instructions adequately, you may be able to minimize the value of the officer’s testimony.

, If there was anyone else with you in the car, or if you were with other people before driving, those witnesses may be able to testify that you were not drinking or that there was some other explanation for the police officer’s observations.For example, if the officer stopped you because you went through a stop sign, a witness might testify that you went through the stop sign because you were distracted by the conversation in the car. (This doesn’t make running the traffic light acceptable, but the penalty is much less severe than DUI.)

, Share with your attorney all your notes and impressions of the traffic stop and answer any questions he or she may have about the incident. The attorney will be able to inform you of the legal proceedings that you can expect.

, Whether or not you are represented by an attorney, you will help yourself if you are familiar with the courtroom expectations. You may want to visit a courtroom and simply observe a trial in progress.

, After reviewing all of the evidence, you may wish to meet with the prosecuting attorney and enter into an agreement, called a plea bargain, for a lesser charge. By doing this, you may be able to avoid the harshest penalties and could prevent a suspension of your license. By avoiding trial, you avoid the uncertainty of whatever outcome a judge or jury may impose, and you gain a level of control. Depending on the evidence against you, the prosecutor may or may not be willing to offer a deal of this sort, but it is worth considering., If there is no plea bargain, then you will need to present your case at a hearing or trial. Whether you do this on your own or with an attorney, you will need to be organized and appear professional. You need to show the court that you are a responsible individual and raise doubts regarding the charges against you. You will have the opportunity to challenge any witnesses that the prosecution presents, and then to present your own witnesses or explanations for the incident., If this was a first offense, you may be able to convince the judge to assign some alternative punishment, rather than suspending your license. This could include having your vehicle fitted with an ignition interlock device, which prevents your car from starting if your blood alcohol level exceeds a certain minimum.Understand that many jurisdictions have harsh DUI laws, and the prosecutor and/or judge may have limited leeway in assigning the punishment.

, If you were successful in reducing the charge against you to avoid a suspension of your license, there may very likely be certain restrictions. You may be required to seek counseling or attend a program like Alcoholics Anonymous. Whatever the requirements, be sure to meet them in a timely fashion and report back to the court or prosecutor as ordered, in order to save your license., The original trial does not have to be the final word. If you are convinced that you are innocent of the charges, and if you believe that there were some irregularities that prevented you from having a fair trial, you can file an appeal. Understand that appeals can be costly, and time consuming, and that if the trial judge ordered a suspension of your license, then your license will likely be suspended pending the outcome of any appeal. However, in the end, if you succeed, then your record would be cleared., If your license is suspended, and if you choose not to appeal, then you should take steps to minimize the time that you are without it. In some states, in order to drive again, you need to file a special application to reinstate your license, and pay a fee.Make yourself aware of these procedures and take care of the reinstatement as soon as you can.

Subpoena witnesses.",How to Prepare for a DUI Court Hearing," Generally, you will appear in court several times for your DUI (unless you plead guilty). Each hearing will be different.



Arraignment. At the arraignment you will appear before a judge, who will read the criminal charges against you. You will be asked if you need an attorney. If you cannot afford one, then you will need to apply to see if you are eligible for a court-appointed lawyer. At the arraignment, you will also enter your plea—not guilty, guilty, or no contest. The judge will also decide whether to change the bail amount or release you on your own recognizance.Preliminary Hearing. After pleading “not guilty,” you will appear before the judge with the prosecutor. The prosecutor must convince the judge that there is “probable cause” to believe that you are guilty of DUI. The prosecutor can call witnesses. You may then cross-examine the witnesses. Not every state holds preliminary hearings.Trial. During a trial, the state and the defendant will choose a jury, deliver opening statements, present witnesses, and deliver closing arguments. The jury is then charged with their instructions and they retire to deliberate.;
, At the arraignment, the state does not have to prove anything. However, at subsequent hearings, the state has certain burdens of proof that it must meet. The burden to convict you at trial is higher than the burden at the preliminary hearing.


At the preliminary hearing, the state must present sufficient evidence to convince a judge that there is “probable cause” that you committed a DUI. If the state does not meet this burden, then the case is dismissed.
At trial, the state must prove that you are “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”This is a higher standard than probable cause. It generally means that the jury must be “firmly convinced” of your guilt., You should discuss whether or not you want to plead guilty at the arraignment. If you do, then you will avoid both the preliminary hearing and the trial. Instead, you will be sentenced for the crime.An experienced DUI attorney can help you consider your options.


To find a DUI attorney, you can ask any friends or family who have been charged with DUI. Ask if they would recommend their lawyer.
If you have no leads, then you can contact your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program.
If you are indigent and do not have the funds available to hire an attorney, you may be eligible for a public defender. If your state classifies a DUI as a criminal offense (either a misdemeanor or felony), you will be able to get a public defender so long as you qualify. If your state classifies a DUI as a civil forfeiture case (i.e., not criminal in nature), you may not be able to get a public defender.

To see if you are eligible, you will usually go to your county's public defender office and fill out an application., There’s nothing to be gained by fighting a DUI charge if you are actually guilty and the state has proof, such as results from a breathalyzer. In that situation, pleading guilty might be the only feasible option.

, States have different penalties for DUI. Generally, all states will impose large fines and could also imprison you for up to six months in jail. If this is your first offense, however, you will likely get a lighter sentence. You might serve a few days in jail and have your license suspended for a year.If this is not your first DUI, then the judge will look closely at the facts of your case. Typically, the more you were over the Blood Alcohol Content minimum, the stiffer the sentence.

, To shorten your sentence, you will probably need to attend drug or alcohol rehabilitation courses, like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).You can show that you are serious about rehabilitating yourself by volunteering to take a class.

, You want to look neat and clean when you appear in front of the judge. You need to remember that the judge is looking down on you to see if you are likely to commit an offense again. You should present a “pulled together” image to the judge that conveys you can get your life in order.


Men should wear long pants with a tucked-in collared shirt. Wear shoes and socks, and make sure that your clothes are pressed and clean. If you have a tie and sports coat, then wear those with your dress shirt.Women should wear slacks or a skirt with a nice blouse or sweater. You can also wear a dress provided it is not too provocative. Opt for flats or shoes with a short heel.For more information, see Dress for a Court Hearing.

, You should be prepared to post bail at your arraignment. If you are unprepared, then you will have to go to jail until you can get sufficient bail. Accordingly, you should contact a bail bondsman before your arraignment.For information on how to contact a bail bondsman, see Arrange Bail at No Cost.

, If you decide to fight the DUI charge, then you will need to make sure that you preserve all evidence of the incident. For example, if you did a field sobriety test, then police could have video of it. Generally, police will only preserve evidence for 90 days. After that, they will destroy it.To preserve any evidence that the police department has, you should send a letter to the police department requesting that the video be preserved.Send the letter certified mail, return receipt requested so that you will know that the department received it.

, To prepare for trial, you will want a copy of the police report.The report should contain all of the information the officer took down about you during the arrest.


You can make the request by sending a letter to the police department requesting the report. Keep a copy of the letter and mail it certified mail, return receipt requested.
If you do not receive a copy of the report within a couple of weeks, then you may need to go to the courthouse and file a motion to compel the release of the police report.

, If you are fighting the DUI, then you need to show that the state’s evidence is flawed in some way. There are many defenses that you can use. For example, you could argue the following:The officer lacked sufficient reason to stop you or to continue with the investigation. The officer may have relied on a faulty anonymous tip or have racially profiled you.
The officer's impression of your sobriety was not reasonable under the facts of your case. Officers need some sort of factual basis for inferring your lack of sobriety. If they do not have a valid suspicion, their case could be weak.
The officer administered the field sobriety test wrong. Perhaps he or she was not trained properly in how to administer them.
The breathalyzer results are not admissible. The machine may have malfunctioned or not been calibrated properly.
The chemical tests were compromised. To challenge a chemical test, you will generally argue that because of the science behind this curve, your blood alcohol content was lower at the time of the arrest than at the time of your test.You would argue that, at the time of your arrest, your blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but rose above the legal limit while you were being arrested and processed.

, Other people can be good sources of evidence. For example, if you spent all night with another person, they could testify that they did not see you drink. Alternately, a witness could argue that they never saw the police officer give you a breathalyzer test.


Generally, you can get subpoenas from the court clerk. You will have to coordinate getting them served on the witnesses.
Most often, you can serve the subpoenas by using a professional process server or by having them served by someone 18 or older who is not part of the case. To find a process server, search on the web or look in your phone book. A process server generally costs $45-75 per service."

Be heedful of vehicles that seem to be zigzagging or weaving back and forth across lanes. They may also drift in a straight line but at an angle to the road.
Look out for motorists who straddle the center of two lanes, drive on the wrong side of the road, or off the road altogether.
Be vigilant of vehicles without their headlights on at night.
Watch out for cars that are speeding or moving much too slow for the specified speed limit.
Beware of drivers who are drunk and are driving much too close to the car in front of them.
Be wary of drivers who use their signals in a manner inconsistent with the actions of their car. For example, if a driver constantly turns on his indicator signals, but doesn't make the turn.
Watch out for erratic braking or stopping for no reason in a traffic lane.
Be cautious of swerving cars or vehicles that turn away abruptly, make wide turns, or divert from a straight course.
Pay attention to drivers who are slow to respond to traffic lights. For example, they stop suddenly or are slow to start when the lights turn green.
Take note of cars that are heading into opposing or cross traffic, especially if they almost strike another car or object.
Be suspicious of drivers who show physical signs of intoxication, such as leaning forward in their seat so their face is close to the windshield, their eyes seems to be fixated, or they are obviously drinking alcohol while driving.;
,


Maintain a safe distance between you and the apparent drunk driver.
Make a note of the car's license plate and the description of the car, noting the color, make, and model, if possible. If there are any other distinguishing details, jot that down also.
Contact the police and tell them that you would like to report alleged drunk driving. Describe what you witnessed, along with the information you have collected. Let them know where you are, with road names if possible, and the direction in which the car is going.

, Your responsibility is to contact the authorities. It will be up to them to take care of the situation.

If you in any way admitted that you were speeding, then it will be very difficult for you to dispute the speeding ticket.


You can admit that you were speeding in various ways. For example, the officer may have asked if you were speeding. If you said “Yes,” then you will have a hard time getting out from under that admission.
The officer also may have asked you how fast you were going. If you gave a number that was over the speed limit, then you have effectively admitted that you were speeding.
If you don’t remember what you said, then wait until you get a copy of the officer’s notes. The officer may have made a notation that you admitted that you were speeding.;
, You need to know how the officer measured your speed. The most common methods of gauging speed are “pacing,” radar, laser, and VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer and Recorder). Each are vulnerable to different criticisms:


Pacing. Here, the officer follows behind you for a length of time and then looks down at his own odometer to measure your speed. You can attempt to discredit this speed reading by pointing out the officer was too far back to adequately follow you at a consistent speed. You could also argue that hills, curves, and traffic lights prevented the officer from following you for a sufficient length of time to get an accurate reading.Radar. Radar technology employs radio waves. These waves reflect off a car and then are picked up by a receiver. You can challenge a radar reading in a few ways. For example, radio waves can hit more than one car, so you can argue that it hit a car that was closely following you. Also, you could argue that the radar’s calibration was off. Furthermore, you could argue that rain, wind, and storm clouds sent back erroneous speed readings.Laser. Laser technology sends 40 beams of light over the course of a second toward the vehicle. The rate at which the light reflects back is then translated into a reading of the car’s speed. One weakness with laser technology is that all of the beams need to hit the same spot on the car. Also, like radar, light beams could reflect off other cars. Accordingly, you could argue that the officer didn’t know how to properly use the laser, or that the officer actually picked up a different car’s speed.VASCAR technology. With this technology, the officer measures the distance between two points (say, for example, a telephone pole and a mailbox). Then, the officer uses a stopwatch to measure the amount of time it takes cars to pass between the points. The time will then be mathematically calculated to produce a miles-per-hour reading. You can challenge a VASCAR measurement by pointing to possible human error—specifically, the officer didn’t start and stop the stopwatch accurately. Also, you could argue the officer did not accurately perceive when you crossed one of the markers., You should definitely read California’s traffic laws before going into court. The laws are available here, at the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles website.

, If you had someone in the car with you when you were pulled over, then that person could testify as to what speed you were going. You should contact these people and ask them if they are willing to testify as to how fast you were driving.You may also want to get a written affidavit from them. An affidavit is a statement signed under oath in front of a notary public.
If you need to compel a witness to attend trial, then you should ask the court clerk to issue subpoenas. These should be issued free of charge., You have the right to request the police officer’s notes.You can do this by filing a “Request for Discovery.” In your request you should cast a wide net and seek as much information as possible. For example, you can ask for the officer’s notes in addition to instruction manuals for how to operate any laser or radar technology. You may also want to know when the officer last had training operating the technology.


The discovery request should be mailed to the police agency that ticketed you as well as the local prosecuting attorney.A sample discovery request is available at Nolo’s website here. Revise it to suit your particular situation.
If you do not hear back in three weeks, then you should call the court clerk’s office and ask about scheduling a hearing where you can present a “Motion to Compel Discovery.” At the hearing, you should show the judge a copy of the written request sent to the police department., Pictures might help your case. For example, if you were pulled over for speeding on a stretch of highway that had many twist and turns, then you could argue that it would be impossible for a car to go as fast as the officer claimed.


You could also photograph the area where the officer was hiding and measuring speed. If the officer’s view was obstructed, then you could raise this issue as part of your defense.Take pictures of any possible obstruction.
Try to take pictures at the same time of day (and in similar weather conditions) as when you were stopped.

, At a court trial, you will be able to present evidence and question the police officer. If you think that you can rattle a police officer, then a court trial might work best for you.


Be mindful, however, that police officers are served with subpoenas to come into court and defend the ticket. Accordingly, you might want to seek a Trial by Declaration, since the odds are greater that the officer will not respond in writing and your case will be dismissed.

, You must pay the fine before reserving a court date for trial. California law requires that you pay ahead of time; if you win, then the money will be refunded. Contact the Superior Court for the county where the ticket was issued to find out acceptable payment methods.


In some counties you can pay online. Online payment is limited to tickets received in El Dorado, Mono, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties.The e-pay system is accessible here.
In other counties, you can send a check or money order (payable to the Superior Court) to the court clerk. In the letter, ask for a trial date.You can also have an in-person arraignment. To schedule one, visit the court clerk. If you choose this option, then you won’t have to pay the fine ahead of time., Arrive at the court early with your witnesses or any evidence. If you are late, then the trial will proceed without you.Make sure that you have written down what evidence you want to submit to the court and the order in which you want to introduce it. You should probably start by setting the scene: where you were pulled over, what the conditions were like, and how fast you were driving. Then move onto focusing on the weaknesses in the state’s evidence that you were speeding.


To make the best impression, you should dress professionally.Try to wear your “Sunday best” and avoid shorts, sandals, or loud jewelry.
Always address the Judge as “Your Honor” and stand when speaking. If you are asked a question, then answer directly., You will need to present evidence in order to raise reasonable doubt that you were actually speeding. A judge will be most impressed with evidence other than your own memories of the event. If you have photographs or witnesses, then use them.


One strong piece of evidence is to read the operator’s manual for whatever form of technology was used to catch you. Operator’s manuals often point out the weaknesses or limitations with their technology. For example, the manual for a radar gun might state that it is best not to use the gun on multi-lane highways. If you were pulled over on a multi-lane highway, then you can use this evidence to cast doubt on the accuracy of the speed reading.Read the operator’s manual for the technology that was used and try to find a limitation that you can use.

, You have a Constitutional right not to testify, which applies to disputes over speeding tickets.You should think carefully about whether or not you want to testify. Some considerations include:


How comfortable you are speaking under pressure.How strong your evidence is. If you can create reasonable doubt in the judge’s mind, then you might not want to testify and potentially give something away.
Whether you are the only source of evidence. If you do not have a witness, then you might need to testify. For example, only you can establish that any photographs you took were taken at a certain location. Also, if you are arguing that you had to speed out of necessity, then only you can supply the reason that created the necessity.

, You should draw together all of your evidence in order to convince the judge that there is a reasonable doubt that you were actually speeding. Make sure to point out all of the evidence that supports you.


Also try to poke holes in the state’s evidence. For example, you can cast doubt on the officer’s recollection by pointing out inconsistencies in his testimony. You also can argue that he was not in a position to accurately observe you.

, If you lose your case in a trial by declaration, you can request a new trial, this time in person.In effect, you are getting two chances to beat the ticket: the first change in a trial by declaration and the second in court.


Additionally, officers are not paid any money to defend a ticket by Declaration (though they are paid to show up to court). For this reason, the officer may not respond. If there is no response, then your case will be dismissed., You will need to fill out a “Request for Trial By Written Declaration” form, which is available from the California Courts website here. You can print out the form and type or print the required information, or you can fill in the form online and then save it.


You should also download the “Instructions to Defendant (Trial by Written Declaration),” which is available from the California Courts website here.

, The form will ask for basic information, including the citation number and case number (if available). You will also be asked to state what kind of evidence you have to support your case:photographs
medical records
registration documents
inspection certificates
diagram
car repair receipt
insurance documents
other

, The form will also require that you draft a statement of facts. If you need more space than that allotted on the form, then you should write on additional sheets and attach them.A compelling statement of facts will rely heavily on evidence apart from your own recollection. For example, you should rely on photographs, witness affidavits, limitations on the technology used to measure speed, and a mechanic’s report on limitations with your car (such as an inability to go above a certain speed).
Be sure to describe all of the evidence that you are including with the Request., You will also have to pay the full amount of the fine.Contact the court to ask about acceptable methods of payment.


Also keep a copy of the form for your records.

, After the judge has made a decision, you will receive a “Decision and Notice of Decision.” If you lose the trial by declaration, then you can seek a new trial by filing Form TR-220, “Request for New Trial (De Novo).” This form can be downloaded from the California Courts website.


You must file it within 20 days of the postmarked date on the “Decision and Notice of Decision.” You should not delay in completing the form and sending it in.

You should talk to your probation officer about why you want to remove the bracelet. If you can get your officer to agree, then you will have a stronger argument.;
, Generally, judges are not anxious to remove the bracelet. In fact, they might have given you a choice: wear the SCRAM device or go to jail. Before asking a judge to remove the bracelet early, you need to identify solid reasons for doing so:


The bracelet has issued “false positives.” This means the bracelet detects alcohol when you haven’t been drinking. You will need proof that you haven’t consumed alcohol, such as a hair test or a polygraph exam. You will have to pay for both. If you pass them, then they are solid proof that the device is inaccurate.The device is unnecessary. If you have gone several months without a drink, then you could argue that the device is no longer needed.
You would prefer to take in-person tests. The judge might have given you an option to wear the device or take tests in person.You might have initially chosen the SCRAM device but have now changed your mind.

, Anytime you want the judge to do something, you need to file a “motion” with the court. You can begin drafting your motion by opening a blank word processing document. Set the font to 14 point Arial or Times New Roman. Also double-space the document.Your court may have printed forms you can use. You should look on the court’s website or stop in and ask the court clerk.

, The caption information appears at the top of the first page of every motion filed with the court. It stays the same throughout the prosecution, so if you’ve never drafted a motion before, then you can look at any document filed in your case to find the caption. The caption includes:


The name of the court.
The names of the parties. Typically, the state is the “prosecutor” and you are the defendant.
The case number.

, You can title your motion “Defendant’s Motion To Modify Probation.” If you want to terminate probation, then you could title it “Defendant’s Motion To Terminate Probation.”You should insert the title underneath the caption.


You may have been ordered to wear the bracelet as a condition of bail. If so, you should title your motion “Motion to Modify Bail.”

, In your introduction, you should identify yourself and then state whether you are representing yourself (called representing yourself “pro se”). Then you should explain what you want the judge to do. Sample language could read:


“COMES NOW Defendant, Sam Smith, representing himself pro se, who moves this Court to modify his probation. In support of the motion, Defendant states the following….”, The judge might have forgotten who you are, so you should provide helpful information to catch the judge up to speed. Make sure to number your paragraphs. Provide the following information:


The date you were placed on probation.
How long probation should last.
The fact that you were given a SCRAM bracelet as one condition of your probation.

, You also have to give the judge a reason to remove the bracelet early. Decide whether you are seeking to only have the bracelet removed or if you want your probation to end early. You could argue:


The bracelet is unreliable. There is some proof that SCRAM bracelets are not as effective at detecting alcohol use as some judges might believe. You could argue that the bracelet is faulty and that it has registered false positives. Point to hair tests and polygraphs which show you didn’t drink. You could also mention an article by Judge Dennis N. Powers called “The SCRAM Tether as Seen Through the Eyes of Davis-Frye and Daubert.” In this article, a Michigan judge argues that the SCRAM device is not sufficiently reliable to qualify as expert evidence.There are alternatives that are less burdensome. You would have a stronger argument if you give the judge some alternatives for monitoring your alcohol consumption. For example, you could take tests in person.
You have satisfied all other conditions of your probation. For example, if you have been ordered to pay a fine and do community service, make sure you are diligently working toward completing those requirements.
Whether your probation officer agrees. If so, be sure to mention that fact.

, Briefly restate that you want the judge to remove the SCRAM device. Also be sure to include the date and your signature just below the conclusion. A sample conclusion could read:


“WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court grant the Motion to Modify Probation and issue an Order to that effect.”, You will have to provide a copy of your motion to the prosecutor and your probation officer. You will certify that you sent a copy of the motion to each. You can type up your certificate of service on a separate sheet of paper but include it with your motion.


The certificate should state how you sent the motion to the other parties. For example, it could read: “I certify that I sent a true and correct copy of this motion to this 20th day of April, 2016.”, The “order” is what the judge signs if he or she agrees that your SCRAM device should be removed early. You may have to draft a proposed order and submit it with your motion. You should type it up on a separate sheet of paper.


Insert the caption information at the top.
The order can read something like the following: “Hearing held on the motion this 20th of May, 2016, the Court finds good cause and it is hereby ORDERED that the Defendant’s Motion to Modify Probation is GRANTED.” Then include a signature line for the judge., It is best to keep one copy of your motion for your own records. You also will need to send a copy to the prosecutor and your probation officer. Some courts also require that you file copies along with the original.Contact the court clerk and ask how many copies you need to file.

, Before the judge can modify your probation, you must attend a hearing. For this reason, you should get a hearing date from the court clerk. Each court handles the scheduling of hearings a little differently. Ask the clerk how you can schedule a hearing.


You may also have to fill out a Notice of Hearing form. The clerk should have a form.
If there’s no form, then draft your own. Insert the caption information at the top and title the document “Notice of Hearing.” Then state the date, time, and location of the hearing. Sign the notice as well., You should take the original and copies to the court clerk. Ask to file.The clerk can stamp all of your copies with the filing date. Depending on your court, you may also have to pay a filing fee.


You should check with the clerk ahead of time and ask for the amount and acceptable methods of payment. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form.

, Use the method identified in your certificate of service to send the prosecutor (and probably your probation officer) a copy of your motion. They will also need a copy of the Notice of Hearing so that they can attend if they object to your getting the SCRAM device removed early., You want to look your best for your hearing. The judge will only agree to remove the SCRAM bracelet early if he or she is confident that you’ll not violate the other terms of your probation. You need to show the judge that you are responsible, and dressing in clean, neat clothes will help convince the judge.Men can wear business casual: dress pants and a dress shirt with a collar. If you have a conservative tie, then wear that as well. For footwear, men should wear dress shoes with dark socks.
Women can also wear business casual: dress slacks or a skirt paired with a blouse or nice sweater. Women can also wear conservative dresses, but they must not be too tight or revealing.
Men and women should both avoid wearing blue jeans, unless they have no other long pants. Also avoid shorts, baseball caps, T-shirts, and anything with writing on it.

, In addition to a copy of your motion, you should also bring any proof that you have completed other conditions of your probation.For example, if you performed a sufficient number of community service hours, then you should have some sort of signed document attesting to that fact.

, Give yourself enough time to find parking around the courthouse and to go through any security. Plan on getting to the courtroom 15 minutes before your hearing. If you are late, then the judge will reject your motion.


Also make sure to turn off your electronic devices before entering the courtroom.Nothing could be worse than having your phone ring or beep.

, When the clerk calls your name, you should go to the front of the courtroom. You will make your argument first. You should introduce yourself: “Your Honor, I’m Sam Smith, representing myself.”


Limit your argument to those you made in your motion. You can’t make new arguments during the hearing.
If the judge has questions, listen quietly. Don’t talk over the judge, and always call the judge “Your Honor.”, If either objects to the device’s removal, then they will tell the judge why. You have to quietly listen to them talk. If they say anything you want to respond to, then write down your objection on a piece of paper.


Don’t interrupt, and don’t raise your hand to ask to speak.Wait until they are finished, and then ask the judge, “Your Honor, may I respond?”

, At the end of the hearing, the judge should decide whether to remove your SCRAM device. If the judge agrees, then he or she will sign the order you provided. You should get a copy of the signed order from the clerk.


You will also have to coordinate a time to have the device removed.

Otherwise, you typically can locate your car by calling the police precinct where the person was arrested.If you live in a smaller town, this may be pretty easy to figure out. However, if you live in a larger city and don't know exactly where the person was arrested, you may have to call several precincts before you find the right one.
Typically you'll also receive a written notice in the mail about the impoundment of your car that will provide you with all the information you need.
However, it may take several days for that notice to get to you and you might not want to wait that long.
If you've been in contact with the person who was arrested, you also can ask them which precinct they were taken to after their arrest.;
, If there were drug-related crimes in addition to the DUI, or if the DUI itself was drug-related, your car may be subject to forfeiture in some states. Under the forfeiture laws, you typically will not be able to get your car back at all.If a police officer indicates that your car is subject to forfeiture, your best option is to contact a criminal defense attorney as soon as possible.
Even though you haven't been charged with a crime, a criminal defense attorney will understand how the forfeiture laws in your state work.
To get your car back if it's subject to forfeiture, you may have to prove that the person took your car without your permission.
This may mean reporting the stolen vehicle to the police. If the person who borrowed your car is close to you, this may not be something you want to do to them. However, it may be necessary to get your car back.

, The police precinct responsible for the person's arrest should be able to provide you with information so you can contact the impound lot where your car is located.You also may be able to get this information from the DMV. Typically, though, you'll need to go through the police department.
Particularly if you live in a larger city, you also may be able to find contact information for impound lots online. Just do a general search for ""police impound"" and the name of your city.

, Once you have contact information, call the impound lot to find out their hours of operation and what you need to do to get your car back. You also may want to verify that your car is actually there.The person who answers the phone will be able to provide general information about how to retrieve your car. However, they typically won't have specific information about your car in particular.
They will be able to tell you if your car is there. Be prepared to provide them with the make, model, and license tag number of your vehicle.
Usually they'll be able to tell you what the towing and storage fees are for your vehicle. They may be able to tell you the administrative fees as well, or direct you to where you should call to get that information.

, To have your car released from impound, you must be able to prove that you own the car. If you want to drive it off the lot, you also must show a valid driver's license and proof of insurance.You must provide documentation that you are the title owner of the car. Typically a certified copy of your vehicle's registration will suffice. You also typically must provide proof of insurance for your car.
If you have registration and proof of insurance in the glove compartment of your car, you may not be able to get them out – or you may have to pay a gate fee to do so. Generally it's better just to get fresh copies of the documents you need.
If your car is being held as evidence, you also may need a release letter from the police department before you're able to take your car off the lot. However, if a DUI was the only crime, there's typically no legal reason your car would be held as evidence.
You also may need a release letter if the law in your city or state requires the car to be held for a specific amount of time.
For example, if the law requires cars impounded because of a DUI arrest to be impounded for 30 days, if someone else was driving your car when they got arrested, you may be able to get your car released to you before the 30 days is up.

, Your city or state government charges administrative fees when cars are impounded. These fees are assessed to the owner of the vehicle and must be paid before your car will be released.Administrative fees vary greatly among jurisdictions. You can expect to pay anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars.
In some cities you may be able to pay these fees at the impound lot. In others, you'll have to go to the DMV or the courthouse to pay the fees, and then provide a receipt to the attendant at the impound lot.
If you can't afford the administrative fees, you may be able to contest the impoundment. If you are successful, the administrative fees will be waived.
However, you may still have to pay towing and storage fees, and storage fees will continue to accrue while you're contesting the impoundment.

, To retrieve your car from impound, you must go to the impound lot in person and bring originals of all required documents to prove you are the owner of the car before it will be released to you.You can call ahead to find out the total amount of towing and storage fees, and any other fees you need to pay, as well as the methods of payment accepted by the impound lot.
You typically can expect an initial impound fee of several hundred dollars plus storage fees ranging from $20 to $50 a day. There may be additional fees depending on the circumstances surround the impound of the car.
For example, some tow companies may charge additional fees if the car is towed after midnight or beyond a certain number of miles from the lot.

, Once you've paid all required fees and the lot attendant has reviewed your documentation, you'll be free to get your car and drive it home. Keep copies of all receipts and other documents you receive from the lot attendant.Check your vehicle carefully for any damages or any property missing from the vehicle. Take photos of any damage in case you decide to file an insurance claim or sue the person who was arrested for DUI while driving your car.
Even if there are no damages to your car, you may want to sue the person who was arrested for the administrative and impound fees you had to pay to get your car back.
Typically you can file this case in small claims court without having to hire an attorney. Contact the small claims clerk's office in your county to get the forms you'll need to file your case.
However, you may want to talk to an attorney just to get a better idea of arguments and strategies you can use in your case. Look for an attorney who specializes in civil suits for property damage and offers a free initial consultation.

, If you believe your car was unfairly impounded, you typically can request a hearing to contest the impoundment. You may have several options available that would allow you to reduce or even eliminate the fees you had to pay to get your car released.Keep in mind that you still must pay the fees if you want your car released in the meantime. If you are successful at the hearing, however, the fees you paid would be refunded.
If you can't afford to pay the fees, you may wait until after the hearing. However, storage fees will continue to accumulate while you're waiting for the hearing to be held – which could be several weeks.
Forms to request a hearing typically are available at your local DMV or at the court office where the administrative fees must be paid.

, A hearing to contest impoundment of your car is an administrative hearing, not a court proceeding. You typically don't need an attorney, and you may not even be allowed to have an attorney represent you at the hearing.However, you may want to talk to an attorney to get a better idea of your chances of success in contesting the impoundment, and what kind of evidence you'll need.
The laws in different cities and states vary in terms of what you'll have to show the hearing officer to prove the impoundment was unfair.
Keep in mind that in most cases, you must demonstrate that the person stole your car or was driving it without your permission to prevail.

, Before your hearing, take the time to make copies of any documents you intend to present to the hearing officer as evidence. Compile them in a folder or binder and arrange them neatly so you can find them quickly.For example, if you reported your car stolen, you should have a copy of the police report to bring with you to the hearing.
If the person merely took your car without your consent, but you didn't report it stolen, this still may allow you to recover some of the administrative fees you were assessed for having your car impounded.
In addition to any evidence, you also will need your license, registration, and proof of insurance to show that you're the owner of the car and can operate it legally.

, On the date of your hearing, arrive at the hearing's location at least 10 to 15 minutes early so you have time to find the room where your hearing will be held and get settled. Be prepared to wait, as there may be other hearings taking place before yours.Even though it isn't a court hearing, you still should try to dress and present yourself in a professional, conservative manner.
Generally you should try to wear the type of clothes you would wear to a job interview or a religious service.
If you're taking time off work to attend the hearing and have to wear your work uniform, just make sure it's as neat and clean as possible.
If there are other hearings ahead of yours, observe them if you can. It will give you a better understanding of the proceedings and what's expected of you.

, When the hearing officer calls your name, step forward and explain way you believe the decision to impound your car was unfair. You may want to prepare a statement or outline to which you can refer, particularly if you get nervous speaking in public.Speak slowly and loudly so that the hearing officer can hear you. Be polite and considerate to the hearing officer and all other office staff.
The hearing officer may be an administrative law judge, in which case you can address them as ""judge"" or ""your honor."" However, they might not be classified as a judge. If you're not sure, just address them as ""sir"" or ""ma'am.""
You may be asked to present your case, or the hearing officer may ask you a series of questions.
After you've explained the situation, the hearing officer will make a decision as to whether you should pay all impound fees.
There typically isn't any appeal from the hearing officer's decision. If there is, the hearing officer will explain that process when they hand down their decision.

If you don't qualify for a public defender, you should hire a private criminal defense attorney to represent you.It's important to find a defense attorney who specializes in DUI law, as they may know more about alternatives that exist.
Even if you qualify for a public defender, a private defense attorney may be better able to assist you if you want alternative sentencing.
Your attorney may have more information about the programs available. They also may be able to connect you with professionals and refer you to specific services.;
, Your eligibility for many alternative-sentencing programs depends on your personal background, especially your criminal history. You're much more likely to qualify for alternative-sentencing programs if this is your first offense.Your attorney probably will want to pull your criminal record, but any information you can provide in the meantime will be helpful to make a preliminary analysis.
You also should provide information about your work and educational history. Any other ties you have to your community also can be helpful.
For example, if you are an active member of a local church, or if you coach a youth baseball or basketball team, these connections can help establish your character and your ties to the community.
Often, someone who can demonstrate that they are an active and involved member of their community and have a steady employment history will have a better chance of getting into an alternative sentencing program.

, The details of alternative-sentencing programs vary greatly among jurisdictions. Since there may potentially be several options from which to choose, you need to make sure the program will meet your needs.Standard programs include a combination of voluntary probation and community service.
Because DUIs are strongly correlated to alcohol abuse, many jurisdictions have alternative sentencing programs available that combine some level of inpatient and outpatient addiction treatment.
Treatment programs also may be combined with electronic monitoring to ensure that you are not drinking alcohol.

, Once you've chosen an alternative-sentencing program that appeals to you, work with your attorney to identify reasons you would be a strong candidate for that particular program.Your attorney may have additional information about the types of offenders who typically are accepted to the various programs.
With information about typical participants, you can compare their stories to your own to get a better idea of how you match up and which aspects of your history you should emphasize.
Ideally, you and your attorney should look for offenders similar to you who have been successful in the alternative-sentencing program you want.
Even though all people and situations are different, you have a better chance of getting into a program if you can show how your situation is similar to someone else who has used the alternative-sentencing program to get their issues with alcohol under control and has not violated the law again.

, Character witnesses, such as your supervisor at work or a community leader, can be great allies for you in helping you get into an alternative-sentencing program.Keep in mind that witnesses aren't just people who were with you when you were arrested. People who know you and your character also can be strong witnesses for you.
Your attorney probably will ask you for names of witnesses who might have information that would be beneficial to your defense. Be sure you have full names, addresses, and phone numbers so your attorney can get in touch with them.
If you decide to start therapy with an addiction specialist, they also may be a good witness for you. They can testify to your progress and your commitment to rehabilitation.

, Particularly if you know addiction counseling or driver's training will be required by the alternative-sentencing program anyway, go ahead and enroll. It can help demonstrate your commitment.Going into therapy can be beneficial for you even if you aren't able to make a plea agreement with the prosecuting attorney and end up going to trial.
Making a therapy commitment sends a signal both to the prosecuting attorney and the judge that you recognize you have a problem with substance abuse and are doing everything you can to address the issue.
Many jurisdictions also require anyone convicted of a DUI to attend safe driving courses. These courses are offered by the state and typically cost several hundred dollars. Taking them beforehand shows that you're serious about making a change.

, If you want to negotiate a plea deal, you and your attorney will need to meet with the prosecuting attorney to go over your case. Based on their findings, the prosecuting attorney typically will have an offer for you.Particularly if this is your first offense, the prosecuting attorney may offer a better deal than alternative-sentencing programs.
For example, the prosecutor may be willing to reduce your charge to reckless driving. This is particularly likely if there are problems with the evidence in your case, or if the police behaved in such a way that you potentially have an argument that they violated your constitutional rights.
Your attorney will talk to you about your arrest at length before you meet with the prosecutor to ascertain if there are any possible defense arguments related to the initial traffic stop or your subsequent arrest.

, If the prosecuting attorney has not offered alternative sentencing as an option for you, make sure your attorney brings it up. By asking, you can find out the reasons the prosecuting attorney did not consider alternative sentencing for you.In some situations, the prosecuting attorney will be unwilling to lower the charges from DUI. If that happens in your case, you may benefit from alternative sentencing.
Particularly if it's your first offense, there may be probation options available that include a deferred sentencing option. Under deferred sentencing, if you successfully complete probation you won't even have a DUI on your record.
Other alternative-sentencing options are related to treatment of alcohol abuse and addiction. This may include inpatient or outpatient addiction treatment.

, The prosecuting attorney likely will have done their own research. However, you may be able to tell them information about your background that supports you as a candidate for alternative sentencing options.For example, if you've started outpatient drug rehabilitation or therapy, you may be eligible to enter a residential rehabilitation program.
Other information about your employment or your role in your community also may support alternative sentencing. These details typically wouldn't have been available to the prosecuting attorney beforehand.
If you have a child or other person, such as an elderly parent, who is dependent on you for support, this also can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.

, The prosecuting attorney's first offer typically isn't their last and final offer. You and your attorney can negotiate something closer to the alternative-sentencing program you have your eye on.Depending on the evidence against you, your attorney most likely will be trying to negotiate a plea bargain in which you plead guilty to a lesser charge, such as reckless driving.
However, alternative sentencing programs also may come into account. Your commitment to seeking addiction treatment and taking safe driving courses may help convince the prosecuting attorney to lower the charges as well.
Your attorney also may have information about various other defenses you have. Bringing this up to the prosecuting attorney may convince them that alternative sentencing is appropriate for you.

, You may be able to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to recommend you for the alternative-sentencing program that you prefer. However, keep in mind this agreement is preliminary and must be approved by a judge.Accepting a plea deal typically means that you must appear in court before a judge. The prosecuting attorney will present the deal to the judge, then the judge will ask you questions.
The judge wants to make sure that you understand what you are doing, and that you are pleading guilty to the charges because you are indeed guilty of the crime.
Your attorney will go over the process beforehand so you're prepared and know what the judge is going to ask you, but once you stand before the judge you're on your own – your attorney cannot answer for you.
However, if you are unable to get the prosecuting attorney to agree to alternative sentencing, you still have the option of arguing at trial to convince the judge that alternative sentencing is appropriate in your case.

, Eligibility for many programs is based on your personal history and criminal record. To convince a judge to grant you alternative sentencing, you must first introduce evidence that you meet those eligibility requirements.In a criminal trial, although the jury will determine whether you are guilty or not guilty, the judge typically is in charge of the sentencing.
Some jurisdictions have sentencing guidelines that help a judge determine the appropriate sentence, based primarily on your criminal history.
If this is your first offense, you typically are automatically eligible for alternative sentencing. If the prosecuting attorney did not offer those options to you, it may have been because there were aggravating factors involved in your case.
For example, if you were charged with a DUI after being involved in an auto accident in which someone else was injured, the prosecuting attorney may not be open to alternative sentencing – even if it was your first offense.

, Even if you're not an ideal candidate for an alternative-sentencing program, you may be able to sway the judge by discussing the changes you've made in your life since your arrest.For example, if you have a job and family members who are dependent on your income, this can weigh in favor of alternative sentencing such as probation.
Needing to maintain your job also can support your argument that any suspended license should be converted to a restricted license so that you can drive to work.
If you have children or other family members who depend on you for financial support, this also may weigh in favor of alternative sentencing.

, Family members, employers, and community leaders can strengthen your argument that alternative sentencing is right for you. These witnesses typically testify regarding your character and sense of responsibility.Keep in mind that your witnesses typically aren't going to be people who were with you when you were arrested for a DUI – although sometimes they might be.
However, even if they were, these types of witnesses aren't going to talk about your arrest, or what you were doing before you were arrested. Rather, they're going to talk about you and who you are as a person.
If you're in therapy or treatment for alcohol addition, your therapist or addiction specialist also will be a strong supporting witness for you. They can testify as to your progress in treatment and typically will tell the court that your progress would not be furthered by spending time in jail.

In every state, you are required to have a minimum amount of car insurance in order to drive. The cost of that insurance will vary from state to state. When you are convicted of a DUI, your insurance company will increase your premiums to take account of your increased risk. These premium increases can cost you thousands of dollars a year.


For example, in California, it is estimated that a DUI conviction for a teen will cost them around $40,000 in increased insurance premiums over 13 years.;
, When you get convicted, the court will most likely make you take classes as part of your punishment. These classes are meant to teach you about the dangers of driving under the influence and how alcohol affects your body. If classes are required, the court will make you pay for them out of your own pocket.


For example, in California, a DUI class runs about $650., After you are arrested and charged with a DUI, you will not be able to continue driving your vehicle. Therefore, police will have to have it towed and impounded. When police do this, they will send you the bill.


In California, for example, the towing and storage fee is around $137 per day, and your car is usually impounded for a minimum of five days. Therefore, the total cost associated with this aspect of a DUI is around $685., DUI convictions carry heavy fines, usually in the thousands of dollars. Each state will have different amounts. In addition to court ordered fines, you might choose to hire a lawyer to help you through the legal process. If you do so, this will cost money as well.


In California, it is estimated that legal fees and fines add up to about $4,000 in a DUI case., A lot of states will automatically suspend your drivers license when you are arrested for DUI or if you refuse to take a breathalyzer test. If your license is suspended as a result of a DUI, you will have to pay the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get it reinstated.


In California, the DMV reinstatement fee runs about $100.
In total, with every cost considered, a DUI can cost you around $45,435., Apart from money, a DUI can lead to a lot of consequences that cannot be monetized. These costs should also be considered when you are attempting to minimize your DUI footprint. For example, your license will be suspended and you will not be able to drive, you might spend time in jail, you could be put on probation, you will have to spend a significant amount of time in court, and you might hurt someone., When you are first arrested and charged with DUI, your first thought might be to hire the most expensive lawyer in town to help you. However, while the cost of a lawyer often correlates with their experience and expertise, it is not always true. In fact, if you search diligently, you can often find a great lawyer at an affordable price. When you start your search, ask family and friends for recommendations. This will help you avoid hiring a lawyer you know nothing about. When friends give you ideas, ask about the cost of the lawyer's services.


Once you find a few candidates, sit down with each one and discuss your case. If your case is straightforward (e.g., you are going to plead guilty or enter diversion), your lawyer might only charge you a small flat fee.
In more complex cases, the lawyer might charge by the hour. If this is the case, try to negotiate a reasonable fee. If you really like the lawyer but their fees are too high, ask if you can pay with property instead of cash. Some lawyers will accept cars, art, and other pieces of property in lieu of cash payments.

, If the lawyer you hire is being paid by the hour, sit down with them early and discuss your case. The complexity of your case will depend on the facts surrounding your DUI arrest. If you admitted to being intoxicated and you took a breathalyzer test that proved it, you may want to consider diversion or pleading guilty to a lesser charge. The earlier you do these things, the less your lawyer fees will be.


However, if you have a strong case because the police improperly collected evidence or in some other way made a mistake, it may be worth the extra legal fees to fight your DUI. If you win, the extra legal fees may be offset by the amount of money you save in insurance premiums and court fines.

, One of the best ways to minimize legal fees is to listen to what your lawyer says while they are representing you. If your lawyer tells you that you do not have a strong case and you should consider diversion, do not keep paying your lawyer to fight the case. On the other hand, if your lawyer tells you you have a strong case, do not plead guilty just to stop paying your lawyer.


Paying attention to your lawyer's advice can help you avoid unnecessary costs while making strategic legal choices.

, Soon after you are charged with a DUI and you hire a lawyer, you need to sit down with them and discuss your case. Your lawyer will talk with you to determine the strength of the government's evidence, defenses you might have available, and the risks of getting convicted of DUI.Based on these factors, your lawyer will decide whether you might have a good chance at getting a plea deal. In general, there are two types of plea deals you can make.


First, your lawyer can help you plead guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for the prosecution dropping the DUI charge. In a lot of cases, you will have to plead guilty to something like reckless driving.
Second, if the prosecution is moving forward with the DUI case, your lawyer can try to negotiate a reduced fine and/or sentence., During the early stages of strategizing, you and your lawyer will have to assess your case's likelihood of success. The stronger the prosecution's case is against you, the more you will want to make a deal. However, when the prosecution's case is strong, it also means they will not need to concede as much during plea negotiations. Therefore, the more you and your lawyer understand about your case, the more prepared you will be when you start negotiating.


The prosecution will have a strong case if you made some admission of guilt, you took a breathalyzer test that showed you were intoxicated, and the evidence shows that law enforcement followed procedure. In addition, the higher your blood alcohol content (BAC) was, the weaker your case will likely be.
You will have a strong case if you invoked your right to remain silent early, you refused a breathalyzer test, and when the evidence shows some misconduct or shortcoming on the part of law enforcement., Your lawyer or the prosecutor may initiate plea negotiations. If your lawyer is initiating, have them call the prosecutor and set up a time to meet. Before the meeting, make sure your lawyer is preparing by looking over sentencing guidelines and other court materials. These things will give your lawyer an idea of what the prosecutor might say. In turn, this will help your lawyer make convincing counter arguments and suggest a reasonable solution., Remember that the prosecutor does not need to agree to anything. While the prosecutor might have a motivation to save court costs and free up time, if you do not make reasonable concessions, the prosecutor will likely walk. Again, this is why it is so important to understand the strength of each side's case. The stronger the case is against you, the more you will have to concede.


However, do not give up everything. If your case is moderately strong and the prosecutor is trying to bully you into a bad deal, you can always say no., When a deal is reached, make sure you get it in writing and make sure it covers absolutely everything. Most prosecutors will have to get deal approved by supervisors, which can take some time. If you fail to negotiate a complete deal and the prosecutor has to ask for approval more than once, you could be wasting time and the supervisor may be less willing to accept it., During plea negotiations, try not to show your entire hand. Avoid laying out your entire litigation plan and telling the prosecutor how you plan to fight the case. When you do this, the prosecutor may take a deal off the table because they will know exactly how strong your case is. Additionally, never admit guilt during negotiations.While a lot of courts will not allow that type of statement to be used in court, it could indicate to the prosecutor that you have a weak case., If the judge signs off on your plea agreement, you will have hopefully minimized the cost of your DUI. When your plea deal dictates that you pay smaller fines, make sure you pay those fines on time and in full. When your plea deal dictates that you plead guilty to a lesser offense, make sure you do so.


If you fail to hold up your end of the agreement, the plea deal could be revoked and you could face the full DUI charge and possible penalties.

, A lot of states offer diversion programs to help cut certain people a break. Diversion can be legally advantageous because it allows you to have your DUI dismissed so long as you comply with your agreement with the court. In addition, while diversion costs a significant amount of money, it is undoubtedly cheaper than being convicted. However, not everyone is eligible for diversion programs. For example, to be eligible for diversion in Oregon:You must not have had a DUI in the last 15 years
Your current DUI must not involve injury to others
You must not have a commercial drivers license
You must have appeared for all court dates
You must have filed a petition for diversion within 30 days of your first appearance in court

, When you request diversion, you are entering into an agreement with the court. In exchange for a dismissal, you have to do certain things the court may require. In Oregon, the first thing you must do is pay $490 in diversion fees. If you cannot afford these fees, talk to the judge. They may have the ability to waive a portion of the fee if you qualify., The court might also require you to get checked out by a prevention specialist. During these assessments, counselors will determine whether you have an addiction to alcohol and/or an alcohol abuse problem. The court will require you to be truthful during these assessments and if you are not, the court can cancel your diversion.


The court will also require you to pay for this assessment. In Oregon, the assessment fee is $150., If your assessment determines you have an alcohol problem, you will be required to enter treatment. During treatment you will work with addiction specialists to try and get your alcohol problem under control. You will be required to pay for any treatment you receive. The cost of your treatment will depend on the length and intensity of your program. For example, an in-patient program will be more expensive than an out-patient one.


If you cannot afford to pay for treatment, talk to your judge. They will determine how much you will have to pay and whether any portion of the fee can be waived., As part of your diversion agreement, you will probably have to attend a discussion about how driving under the influence can affect others. Most of the panels will include speakers who are past DUI offenders, often ones who have injured or killed others because of their actions. Each panel member will speak about their experience and how the DUI has affected their lives. After the discussion is over, you will usually be able to ask questions and make comments.In Oregon, you will be required to pay to attend the event. The cost can range anywhere from $5 to $50., Throughout your diversion period, which can last 180 days or longer, you must comply with all laws concerning the use of illegal substances. Regardless of what type of DUI you were charged with, you must refrain from using drugs like cocaine and marijuana. While it may or may not be illegal to use these drugs in your state normally, the rules are more strict when you are in diversion.If you fail to stay away from drugs, your diversion privilege will be revoked and you will not receive a refund for anything you have completed prior to being kicked out.

, During diversion, you will also not be allowed to drink any alcohol. However, there are a few limited exceptions. For example, you can drink sacramental wine given to you as a part of a religious ceremony. You will also be able to take any drug, including alcohol, if it is taken pursuant to a valid prescription.If you fail to stay away from alcohol, your diversion might be revoked and you will not receive a refund for any money you paid up to this point.

, Some states, for example Oregon, require you to use an ignition-interlock device in order to drive. These systems require you to take a breathalyzer test prior to turning on your car. If you do not have any driving privileges, you will not have to install one of these systems.


You will have to pay to have the system installed. You will also have to pay leasing fees and maintenance fees. If you cannot afford these fees, talk to your judge. They may be able to waive some or all of the fees depending on your circumstances., Throughout the diversion process, the court will put your DUI case on hold. If you comply with all of the diversion requirements, the court will dismiss the DUI charge.Most people can complete the diversion program in around 180 days.


In total, diversion might cost around $4,000. However, this is a lot less than the $45,000 it might cost if you are convicted.

Obey the rules of the road.,
Practice defensive driving.,
Wear your seat belt.",How to Avoid a Traffic Ticket1," Don’t break traffic laws, and you won’t get ticketed. Ignorance is no excuse. Traffic laws also vary from state to state and even from town to town, so do some research if you’re driving away from home.;
, Aggressive or erratic driving can irritate other drivers and put both of you in danger. Even if you’re not breaking any laws, weaving in and out of lanes and stopping or accelerating quickly can bring you unwanted attention from police. Consider taking a defensive driving course.

, It's the law pretty much everywhere, and an iron-clad excuse for a sharp-eyed officer to pull you over.

"
Don't stand out.",How to Avoid a Traffic Ticket2,"


Maintain your vehicle. Cracked windshields, burnt-out taillights, and other minor maintenance issues can get you a ticket.
Look attentive. Being the one in the pack with a cell phone cradled on your neck and a burger in the other hand is not a good thing.
If you are buying a new car, choose a plain-colored sedan with economy styling over a sporty-looking coupe with bright, eye-popping colors and/or customized appearance. There are lots of economical-looking little cars with snappy power-to-weight ratios and safe, excellent handling.
Don't cover your car in eye-catching stickers and/or controversial slogans, no matter how mad or happy some politician makes you. A cop may be a big fan of the guy you loathe most, or loathe the guy you are fan of the most.
Remove license plate frames and dealer stickers that identify you as being from out of town wherever else you go in your state. People who travel a long way are less likely to show up in court to dispute a ticket. However, don't cover up your license plate - you can be pulled over for this infraction.
Don't drive a rolling pigsty. All windows should offer unobstructed views to the driver.

Watch for potential ambushes.,
Get a radar/laser detector.,
Remember that you can’t always see police along the road.,
Watch out for speed cameras.,
Be aware of other cars.,
Look inside the suspicious cars if you can.,
Get to know the roads you regularly travel.,
Beware of multiple cruisers.,
Check your rear-view mirror often.",How to Avoid a Traffic Ticket3," Constantly scan the road ahead for parked cars and police cruisers on the road. You can’t just look for the classic police car, though; departments everywhere are mixing up their fleets, so that SUV or sports car up ahead may be trouble. A few tips to spot these cars:


Look for roof lighting. Your brain should pop up a red flag anytime it sees any sort of junk on top of a car.
Look for a spotlight on the drivers side of the vehicle. Only police package vehicles have this option.
By law, officers are not allowed to endorse any ideology or group on their cars. The cars are owned by the city, so you'll be hard pressed to find a police car with a ""Total Princess"" sticker on the bumper.
Police license plates are made differently than regular plates. In some cases, they'll actually say EXEMPT. Find out what their license plates actually look like in your state.
Pay close attention to the brake light that most cars have at the top center of the rear window. Cops' center lights are larger because they function as blue and white lights as well. An easy giveaway is if that center brake light is visible but does not light up red when braking.
Cruisers often have multiple antennas on them.

, If you’re intent on being a speed demon, a combination laser/radar detector can help you hit the brakes in time. Be careful, though: detectors are illegal to have in your vehicle in Virginia, Washington, D.C., US Military bases and in many countries. They’re far from 100% effective, and if you do get pulled over, you won’t earn any brownie points when the officer sees the detector.

, It’s prudent to slow down a bit before potential hiding spots such as exit ramps, blind curves, or stands of trees, and be especially wary around potential speed traps, such as stretches of road undergoing work or places where the posted speed limit decreases. When you see a reduction in the speed limit, make sure to slow to the new limit before you reach the sign: police know this is one of the best place to find speeders.

, More localities are adopting photo radar, a system which automatically photographs the license plate and driver’s face of a vehicle which the radar determines is speeding. These systems are sometimes mounted inside a van which will be parked alongside the road, or they are often mounted permanently at trouble spots, such as intersections that have a lot of accidents.


Cameras are also used to photograph vehicles that run red lights or travel in the carpool lane without passengers. You can usually see these cameras if you look hard enough, especially if you travel the same route frequently.
You may be able to find the location of permanent cameras in your area via local government websites or internet search.

, The worst thing to do after narrowly avoiding the cop with a laser gun is to fly past the next cop driving on the same road as you. Be aware of every car in your vicinity.

, You might see a cage separating the front and back seats. Or you might see the officer's uniform.

, Police frequently choose the same hiding places over and over again, so make a mental note when you see a cruiser parked along the road and make sure you’re following the speed limit next time you come to that point.

, If you see another motorist stopped by a police cruiser, don’t assume the coast is clear. Slow down to the speed limit, and stay that way for another mile or two. It’s increasingly common for police to set up speed traps with several officers clustered in a short span of road.

, This will minimize the chance that a patrol car will sneak up on you. Also, if an officer pulls up behind you at night with his or her headlights off chances are that he/she is about to pull you over, so be prepared to stop.

Where possible, drive the speed limit.,
Stay out of the “fast lane.” Drivers in the “fast lane” (the left-most lane on U.S. multi-lane highways) are more likely to be ticketed not only because they’re typically driving faster, but also because of the psychological element: they appear to be going faster simply because they’re in the “fast lane”.,
Go with the flow of traffic.,
Pay attention to clues from other motorists, especially truckers.,
Find a guinea pig.",How to Avoid a Traffic Ticket4," Know, however, that the posted limit applies only to ideal conditions. Drive 5 or 10 mph (8.0 or 16.1 km/h) under if it is raining or there is snow/ice on the ground.

, In addition, many jurisdictions have laws that require you to drive in the right lane unless you are passing, so you can be ticketed for cruising in the left lane.

, If you’re going to speed, you’re less likely to be ticketed if everybody else is doing it. (However, if you are pulled over exceeding the speed limit, ""going with the flow of traffic"" cannot be used as an excuse for receiving a speeding ticket.) It’s not uncommon in many areas for the posted speed limit to be something of a joke. If everybody’s going 80 in a 70, chances are you can get away with it — in fact, if you’re going significantly slower you may be a hazard—but if you treat that as a license to go 85, guess who’ll get nabbed.

, If you see brake lights up ahead, especially on that car that just blew by you, there may be a speed trap just out of your view, or a radar detector may be alerting the driver in front of you. It pays to watch the behavior of truckers, in particular, because truckers down the road can use CB radio to warn those behind them. Additionally, motorists going the opposite direction might flash their lights at you to warn you about a cop.

, Take notice of someone driving roughly the same speed as you and let them get a good distance ahead, then watch them for any sudden stops or other behavior that may indicate a speed trap.

Be polite and know the protocol.,
Avoid admissions of guilt (or don't).,
Contest a ticket.,
Don't think that the cop will be unlikely to appear in court if you challenge your ticket.",How to Avoid a Traffic Ticket5," If you do get pulled over, you may still be able to get away with a warning if you’re courteous.


When the officer comes to your window, greet him or her with respectful words, such as ""Good evening, officer."" Do not use slang. Say ""want to"" instead of ""wanna,"" and whatever you do, don't refer to police officers as cops. Following these tips will make you seem educated and sensible. The officer may not give you a ticket just because you don't seem buzzed or you seem like a respectable person who made a small error.
Don’t start arguments or act irritated or belligerent, and don’t make dumb excuses.
Be nice and you may get some pity. If you’ve already broken a traffic law, you can’t make things any better by being a jerk.
Make the police officer feel safe if you get pulled over. Police officers have a dangerous job, and they know that any routine traffic stop can turn life-threatening. If you can put an officer at ease, it make his or her job a little less stressful and he or she may thank you for it by letting you off with a warning.
Pull over when you see the police officer signal for you to pull over. Look for a safe area where the officer can stand beside your car and not risk his own life with passing traffic.
Pull into a parking lot if you can; but always signal to the officer to show that you aren't avoiding him. This can be accomplished by flipping on your right blinker. If you must pull over to the side of the road, the right shoulder is almost always safer for both you and the officer.
Park your vehicle so that you cannot drive forward. For example, pull right up to a wall. Then the officer can park right behind you without worrying that you will try to drive away and escape.
Turn off your car, and possibly remove the keys from the ignition.
If it is nighttime, turn on as many interior lights as possible.
Remain in the car. Do not move to leave the car at any time during the stop unless you are asked to do so.
Sit still with your seatbelt on, and place your hands on the top of your steering wheel, in plain sight. Don’t fidget around before the officer approaches the vehicle or at any time during the stop.
The officer will request your driver’s license, registration and insurance card. Leave your hands on top of the steering wheel. Describe to the officer where the papers are, and ask permission to get them. When the officer permits it, move slowly and deliberately to retrieve the documents. Avoid sudden movements that may make the officer feel you're reaching for a weapon.
If an officer states you were speeding, it is OK to politely ask how they know. If the officer states that he used a radar gun, ask to see it. Most officers inadvertently turn the unit off once you are stopped - deleting the speed entry.
If you got a ticket via a radar gun, ask to see the officers daily log. He or she would need to state they calibrated the unit prior to beginning their patrol.

, When the officer asks you if you know why you were pulled over, never admit to anything if you intend to later fight the ticket. If you do get a ticket, your admission can be used against you in court.


If you think you might get away with a warning, you can try being completely honest. The officer may appreciate your honesty and be more likely to let you off with a warning. It’s a tough choice to make, but do your best to analyze the situation and the officer’s demeanor, and hopefully you’ll make the right decision.

, If you can’t avoid a ticket, consider fighting it through the legal system. Sometimes, just showing up indicates you are more responsible than other motorists. Dress well, and be prepared to argue your side of the case without emotion and with as much supporting material as you can provide. Depending on the judge and the jurisdiction, the judge may give you some leniency.

, Many jurisdictions pay overtime or more for time spent in court. In some circumstances since the officer is being paid overtime for being in court, he or she may act in your favor for dismissal of the ticket - that is, if you were polite and respectful when receiving the citation.

Always be conscious and alert when operating a motor vehicle.
,
Be attentive to the speed limit sign-boards and the speed of the other cars.,
Notice the flow of the traffic.,
In an unknown area pay attention to sudden changes in grade where your speed will increase going down a long hill or large vegetation in a wide median where police cars can hide easily.,
Look to the side of the road as far ahead as possible and pay attention to what you're doing.",How to Avoid a California Speeding Ticket,", In case you miss a signboard try taking a clue from other vehicle's speed so that you don't overspeed unknowingly., If your speed doesn't blend in the traffic, and if you're the one passing everyone else, you'll attract the attention of the traffic officer, even if everyone else is speeding too. Knowing your position is especially important in highway driving.

An easy place to pick up a traffic citation is right at the city or town limits and a school sign of any kind should be an automatic alarm-by habit.

, Bridges are often danger zones as well, so don't come off a bridge going more than 10 mph (16 km/h) faster than the limit., Most speeding tickets result from lack of concentration and you will be surprised how often you can spot police cars ahead if you're watching. This will give you enough time to slow down before the policeman can determine that it was your vehicle he spotted on the radar."

Try out websites and smart phone applications.",How to Avoid a Parking Ticket," The simplest defense against parking violations is not to park in areas that are heavily patrolled.;
, Watch for time limits, red curbs, and hours and days when parking is restricted, even for street sweeping. Also watch for driveways, fire hydrants, handicapped parking, loading zones, and other things that should not be blocked.

, Set a timer, and do not exceed the posted time limit.

, Then, set a timer in your phone or wristwatch, or carefully note the time before you walk away. Remember to allow enough time to leave and reach your vehicle before the time expires., Many cities have them, and paying for parking is generally cheaper than paying a ticket.

, Should you leave it visible in your car or on your dashboard? Should you take it with you and pay before leaving? If there is an attendant, ask questions before you leave.

, Especially if there is a big event or you anticipate heavy traffic, leave early. There may be more legal parking places available, and you will be less tempted to cheat or chance it.

, Depending on your location, there may be legal street parking available if you don't mind a walk.

, Even a legally parked vehicle may attract enforcement attention if it appears to be abandoned or if the tags are expired.

, This may mean making a U-turn or going around a block, but it may also mean avoiding a ticket.

, This is true even for parallel parking.

, Some can help you find parking; others can warn you if there has been heavy enforcement in an area.

Enter your plea in court.",How to Handle an Aggravated DUI on Arizona Navajo Nation Land," Arraignment in the Navajo tribal court follows a procedure similar to that followed in state or federal court. You will be brought to a courtroom, typically with many other defendants, for your initial arraignment after being arrested.When you enter the courtroom, you will be given a copy of the criminal complaint against you by a court officer.
When the judge calls your case name and number, you will move to the front of the courtroom, where a court officer will hand you a copy of the criminal complaint.
You must provide to the judge your legal name, date of birth, tribal membership, and census or Social Security number.;
, The judge will read the charges against you and explain the maximum possible penalty you could receive if found guilty. They will then explain the rights you have as a criminal defendant.The rights you have in Navajo courts are the same as those you have as a criminal defendant under the U.S. Constitution.
The judge will explain to you that you have the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to plead not guilty.
Your right to be released on bail will be explained, along with circumstances that would not allow your release.
The judge also will explain your trial rights, including that you have the right to a speedy and public trial by jury, and that you will be allowed an opportunity to confront and cross-examine all witnesses against you.

, After the judge has informed you of your rights, you must indicate that you understand those rights. The judge will make a determination that you are of sound mind and able to enter a plea.At your arraignment, you have the option of pleading guilty, not guilty, or no contest. Typically at this stage you want to plead not guilty.
Pleading ""not guilty"" at arraignment gives you time to hire an attorney and assess the case against you.
Although the prosecutor may offer you a plea deal at the time of arraignment, you are under no obligation to accept it.
You don't even have to talk to them, and you probably shouldn't, to avoid saying something that could be used against you later on.

, After you've plead not guilty, the judge will ask the prosecutor for their bail recommendation. The prosecutor will explain the amount of bail they believe is appropriate and the reasons for that conclusion.If the judge agrees with the prosecutor's recommendation, they'll set bail for that amount.
The judge may disagree with the prosecutor's recommendation. You do have the right to speak against the recommendation or argue for a lower amount.
To make bail in a Navajo Nation court, you (or a friend or family member) must make a bail agreement with a reliable member of the Navajo Nation that is approved by the court to make bail arrangements.
Once the bail agreement is endorsed by the judge, you will be released. The bail agreement will be filed with the court, and the amount of the bail indicated in the agreement will be immediately due if you fail to show up for a court hearing or trial.

, If your case is in a Navajo court, you must hire a criminal defense attorney who is a member of the Navajo Nation Bar Association. You may be represented by an attorney who has graduated from law school, or by a licensed lay advocate who has not graduated from law school but has been trained in the law.You can find licensed criminal defense attorneys by visiting the Navajo Nation Bar Association website at www.navajolaw.org.
Look for attorneys licensed to practice in Navajo Nation courts and in Arizona courts, who have experience handling aggravated DUI cases.
Hiring a lay advocate may be less expensive, but at the same time, you want to choose the person who is best able to represent you and get the outcome you want.
Keep in mind that aggravated DUI is a felony. Arizona DUI laws are among the strictest in the country, and if convicted, you could spend years in jail and pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines and restitution.

, There are more than 400 attorneys who are members of the Navajo Nation Bar Association. Out of those, you should be able to find at least two or three nearby who you can meet with.Most criminal defense attorneys provide free initial consultations, so this stage of your legal battle shouldn't cost you anything but time.
Handling the matter quickly is important, so try to schedule your initial consultations within a week or so of your arraignment.
If an attorney doesn't have time to meet with you within that period of time, they probably are too busy to take on your case and give it the time and attention it needs.
Keep in mind that if you are still in jail, you typically will need a family member to make these initial consultations for you.

, Before your initial consultations, write down a list of questions that you want to ask each attorney. Especially with a free consultation, you can ensure that you're getting all the information that's important to you by asking detailed and specific questions.You want an attorney who knows the law and has experience defending clients who were charged with an aggravated DUI. Ask how many clients similar to you the attorney has represented, and what the outcomes of those cases were.
You also want to find out if you'll feel comfortable working with the attorney, and get a good idea of what your attorney-client relationship will be like. Ask how they prefer to communicate with their clients, how often they communicate with clients, and how quickly they'll get back to you if you call or email with a question.
You also need to come out of the initial consultation with a good understanding of what the attorney's fees will be and how much it will cost for them to represent you in your aggravated DUI. Ask them what billing method they use and how much it will cost to hire them for your case.

, Before your chosen attorney contacts the prosecutor or does any work on your case, make sure you've signed a written retainer agreement with them. This agreement provides details about the services the attorney will provide you and what they will charge you.Ultimately, the attorney you've chosen is someone with whom you feel comfortable, and who you are confident will be able to get you the best possible outcome.
While fees probably will be an important part of your decision, especially if you have a limited budget, keep in mind that your attorney could save you from potentially paying tens of thousands of dollars in fines and spending years in court.
Have your attorney read the retainer agreement to you and explain it before you sign it. If there's anything you disagree with or don't understand, don't be afraid to speak up.
Once you sign it, get a copy of it for your records in case you need to refer to it later.

, Your attorney will request information and documents from the prosecutor so they can properly assess the evidence against you. They also will ask you to describe what happened when you were arrested.Navajo law provides similar rules regarding evidence as other American courts, so your attorney will assess the evidence against you to determine if any of it was collected in violation of your rights.
The possibility that your rights were violated weighs in favor of a lighter sentence for you, and can be valuable during the plea bargaining process.
However, even when the evidence is solid, you still may be able to plead down to a lower charge or a lighter sentence based on information about you and your background.
Your attorney will gather additional information about your criminal record and your life history. If this is your first brush with the law, you may be able to plead down to a lesser charge.

, Typically the prosecution will have an immediate offer based on the information in the police report and the statement from the arresting officer.Since aggravated DUI is a felony charge, there is plenty of room to negotiate – particularly if this is your first offense.
Keep in mind that the prosecutor may not be willing to negotiate with you if the incident that led to your arrest involved significant property damage or loss of life.
However, you still may be able to negotiate regarding the sentence you will serve, even if you have to plead guilty to the felony charge.
Showing remorse and a desire to seek treatment for alcohol abuse and perform community service within the Navajo community may help you get a better deal.

, Based on the evidence and the circumstances surrounding your arrest, there may be factors that prevent you from being convicted for an aggravated DUI.For example, suppose the evidence of your intoxication is based on a field sobriety test. If you were taking prescription medications, or have a disability that prevents you from completing a field sobriety test satisfactorily, this would be a defense.
Your attorney could present evidence of this to the prosecuting attorney while negotiating a plea bargain.
This information might convince the prosecuting attorney to offer a better deal than they originally did based on the information in the police report.
Since typically aggravated DUI charges stem from an auto accident, however, you'll have a more difficult time getting a good plea deal if there were injuries or loss of life involved.
Significant property damage also can play a role in a prosecutor's unwillingness to allow you to plead guilty to a lesser charge.

, Typically, a plea bargain means that you appear in court and plead guilty to a lesser crime than the one for which you originally were charged.With a lesser charge, you might have more leeway. However, with an aggravated DUI, don't expect the prosecutor to allow you to plead guilty to something relatively minor like reckless driving.
Provided there were no serious injuries or loss of life as a result of the incident that led to your charges, you should be able to plead guilty to a DUI. This still has significant consequences, but at least you won't have a felony on your record.
Keep in mind you will be asked questions in court about specific facts involved in your case, and you will have to admit to them under oath.
If taking a plea bargain means you must admit to things that you know you didn't do, you may want to consider taking your chances at trial – especially if you have a strong defense.

, Even if you and the prosecutor are in agreement on a plea bargain, it isn't final until it is presented in court and accepted by the judge assigned to your case. You must attend the hearing and answer the judge's questions.Typically, the prosecutor will speak first and present the plea bargain agreement to the judge. The judge will then ask you a number of questions.
Even though you are represented by an attorney, your attorney cannot answer these questions for you.
The judge will describe the crime to which you've agreed to plea guilty, and ask if you understand the crime and admit that you committed that crime.
The judge then will ask you questions to determine for the record that you are pleading guilty voluntarily, and that you fully understand the agreement and accept the sentence.

Accept the judge's ruling.",How to Fight a Traffic Ticket," Immediately after the officer gives you the written citation, make sure all the information is correct, including anything identifying you or describing your car.


Missing or incorrect information on your ticket may be grounds for dismissal.It has to be significant, however. For example, if the officer says you have a navy blue BMW when you, in fact, have a black BMW, this probably is not a big enough difference to justify dismissal of your speeding ticket. If the officer writes the ticket for a red Honda Civic when you actually have a navy blue BMW, that's a different story.;
, The officer will either check off or write down the exact sections of the city or state traffic code he claims you didn't follow.


If you don't understand what you did wrong, ask the officer on the scene before she leaves. You want to make sure you understand exactly why you were pulled over and why you're being given a ticket.

, Typically the citation itself will have contact information for either paying your fine or disputing the ticket.

, As soon as possible, make a record of the time of day when you were stopped, where you were stopped, what the weather was like, how much traffic was on the road, how long you were detained, and any other relevant information.


Since many laws rely on subjective judgment, all of these details can help support your understanding of the situation. For example, in 20 states – including California, Texas, and Utah– speed limits are not absolute and you can make a judgment call as to whether it is safe to exceed the speed limit. Although you could still get a ticket, you could use circumstances from the time of the incident to argue you were operating your vehicle safely., If you had anyone in the car with you, or if there were people nearby who saw you get pulled over, find out if they're willing to make a statement on the record about what they saw.


If you have eyewitnesses who are willing to testify on your behalf, make sure you have their names and contact information before you leave the scene.
Passengers or bystanders who will testify to your version of events can help you convince the judge that you were right and the police officer's observations were inaccurate., If the officer observed you from a different location before pulling you over, go there and take pictures of what he would have seen.


This is especially important if your case depends on an obstruction or other dangerous condition. For example, if you had to swerve to avoid a huge pothole and were pulled over and given a citation for an illegal lane change, photos of the pothole would support your argument that your actions were justified.
You can almost always argue that the officer was not in a good position to see what happened, especially if there are obstructions or if there was heavy traffic., If the officer's position that you violated the law is based on information provided by a piece of equipment, you will need to verify that the equipment was functioning properly.


Before you go to trial, request copies of maintenance records and schedules for any of that equipment. If the machines weren't calibrated or maintained according to industry standards, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed on the grounds that the officer's decision was based on unreliable information.
For example, most radar guns need to be re-calibrated either once a month or once every other month. If the gun was not calibrated, or if the officer did not check the calibration when he issued the ticket, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed., Make sure you have the officer's name, his badge number, and his patrol car number.


If the officer who issued your citation filed a report or made any notes about the traffic stop, you are entitled to copies of those as well.

, Given the time and effort it would take to fight a traffic ticket, if the infraction is minor and the fine is small, you might be better off simply paying the fine and moving on with your life.

, Although ignorance of the law is never an excuse, a legitimate and understandable mistake of a key fact may get you off the hook.For example, if you didn't stop at a crosswalk because the paint was so faded it was barely visible, the judge might cut you some slack. However, arguing that you didn't stop because you didn't know you were supposed to stop at a crosswalk won't help you.

, Even though you technically violated a traffic ordinance, in some circumstances you must make an illegal maneuver to avoid something far more dangerous.For example, if you were swerving to avoid hitting an animal crossing the road, you might be able to get a ticket for an illegal lane change dismissed.
However, keep in mind that you have to be able to prove that your version of events happened. If there was nobody else in your car who saw the animal and it's going to come down to your word against the word of the police officer, you're probably better off to simply pay the fine.
Your own inattention or personal need aren't the same thing as avoiding harm. The harm you avoid must be something you didn't cause.For example, if you were having a fight with your sister on your cell phone and ran a red light, that argument would not excuse your actions in the event a police officer pulled you over and wrote you a ticket.

, Find a copy of the code and break the section down into elements. If one of the elements is missing in your case, you can't be held liable.


Look at the portions of the code where personal judgment come into play. Many traffic laws are not absolute and rely on the driver to make an honest assessment of what conduct is best given weather and highway conditions. For example, speed limits aren't absolute in more than a dozen states – this means that even if you get a ticket for exceeding the speed limit in those states, you can still make an argument that the speed at which you were traveling was safe given the totality of the circumstances.Nearly any violation that has the word ""unsafe"" in it implies a subjective judgment was made on the part of the police officer. Any time you are cited for an unsafe movement, the door is open for you to argue that from your position, your actions were in fact safe.If highway signs or signals figured into your citation, check them against the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, published by the Federal Highway Administration. The MUTCD is a compilation of national standards for all traffic control devices.If you can demonstrate that the relevant sign or signal didn't meet applicable standards, your ticket may be dismissed on those grounds.

, Although you don't have the right to an appointed attorney, you may be able to hire a traffic attorney who can help you fight the ticket.

, In many jurisdictions, you can attend traffic school and have a minor violation dismissed. Typically this option is only available for first-time offenders or for relatively minor infractions.


If it's your first ticket in the jurisdiction, you may be able to take a special ""no contest"" plea in which you pay a reduced fee and the violation doesn't add points to your license or go on your insurance., In many states you can have a trial by mail. You write a letter explaining why you shouldn't be held liable for the violation, and then the officer writes in with his side of the story. If the officer fails to write in, you win by default. However, if you lose by mail you can still request an in-person hearing., You may have automatically been assigned a hearing date, or your city may require you to request a hearing date. If you're responsible for requesting a hearing, do so as soon as possible after you get your ticket so you have a greater choice on dates and times.


In most jurisdictions, the police officer who issued your citation is required to show up at your hearing. If he does not appear, your ticket may be dismissed automatically.
If your ticket already has a date on it, consider having it changed. Typically the officer who issued your ticket already has that date in his schedule and plans to attend several hearings that day. If you have the date of your hearing changed, there's a greater possibility the officer won't show up.
Requesting a continuance also may increase the chances that the officer isn't available to show up., Dress in clean, professional clothing and arrive early for your hearing. Bring copies of all documents along with any evidence or witnesses you wish to present.


Treat all court staff with respect. If there are other cases being heard before yours, take a seat and wait your turn. When you are called to come forward, address the judge as ""your honor"" and don't speak unless you are asked a question. 
Leave your mobile phone or any other electronic devices at home or in the car – don't try to bring them with you into the courtroom.
Organize your documents and evidence before you get there so you aren't shuffling through papers if the judge asks for something.

, When the judge calls on you, explain briefly why you are not liable for the traffic violation. Keep your argument succinct and stick to the facts.


If you've brought witnesses to testify on your behalf, keep your questions brief and make sure they stay in line with what you're trying to prove rather than digressing., You can make notes if there's something you want to ask her about. But don't interrupt her or argue with her.


Don't insult the police officer or accuse her of lying. If it comes down to an argument between you and the police officer without any factual evidence, the judge probably will believe the police officer.

, After the officer has finished her testimony, the judge will give you an opportunity to ask her questions.


You want to establish some doubt in the officer's mind, as well as in the judge's mind. The officer may have walked into that courtroom absolutely convinced that she was correct in giving you a ticket, but if you can place doubt in her mind she may become less sure of herself. If the officer isn't entirely sure, the judge won't be sure either, and might dismiss your ticket.
Create uncertainty in the officer's mind by challenging her subjective conclusions. Police officers often don't know the exact wording or interpretation of a law. The officer who pulled you over may not have realized that she has to make a judgment call every time she writes a ticket for violating a law that requires safe or responsible vehicle operation.Ask the officer how she came to the conclusion that your driving was unsafe or irresponsible, and then provide her with evidence she didn't have at the time.
For example, suppose she gave you a ticket for an unsafe lane change. She only saw you swerve erratically into the left lane and then back into the right; however, she didn't see the deer crossing the road that you swerved to avoid. This information might change her judgment, since it would be safer for you to swerve than to hit the deer.
You also can impeach the officer's testimony by challenging her observations.This is why you talked to witnesses and took photos of the scene.
For example, suppose you ask the officer to describe the weather conditions when she pulled you over, and she says it was bright and sunny. If you have a photo showing that the conditions actually were gray and cloudy, use it to cast doubt on her observations. When she later says she's certain your car was the one that was speeding, you get the opportunity to ask her how certain she is – as certain as she was that it was bright and sunny?

, After both sides have presented all evidence, the judge will decide if you are liable for the violation or not.


If the judge rules against you and you decide you want to appeal, ask the court clerk for information on the appeals process."

Attend your hearing.",How to Get Your Car Back After Aiding and Abetting a DUI," If you've been charged with aiding and abetting a DUI, you need an experienced criminal defense attorney on your side – both to defend against the criminal charges and to help you get your car back.Since you've been charged with a crime, you are entitled to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, you can have a public defender appointed by the court.
However, you should keep in mind that a public defender may not be able to help you get your car back, since that typically is a civil administrative process rather than a criminal one.
If you don't have anyone in mind, you might want to check on the website of your state or local bar association's website. They typically have a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice in your area.
You might also ask friends or family members if they know any attorneys they would recommend – but keep in mind that just because a particular attorney served someone else well doesn't mean they would work for you.;
, Once you've identified local attorneys you're interested in hiring, make appointments to meet with each of them so you can find out more about what they can do to help you defend against the charges and get your car back.Criminal defense attorneys typically offer a free initial consultation, so it shouldn't cost you anything (other than time) to talk to several of them.
Give each attorney as much information as you can about your case in advance, so they have sufficient information to appropriately analyze your case.
You also want to prepare a list of questions ahead of time so you can ask each attorney important questions about their practice and experience. Asking a lot of questions ensures you get enough information about each attorney to accurately compare them and make a good decision.

, The attorney you ultimately choose should have experience representing clients in situations similar to yours, with positive results. Ask each attorney you interview lots of questions about their experience dealing with aiding and abetting charges, as well as retrieving cars from impound.Not only should your attorney have experience navigating the criminal courts in your jurisdiction, they also should understand and have experience with the administrative processes involved in getting a car out of impound.
Technically, you have two separate cases that you need the attorney's help with – the criminal charges themselves and the administrative process of getting your car back.
Be sure to ask each attorney specific questions regarding whether they've represented people who were charged with aiding and abetting a DUI, whether they've assisted with getting a car out of impound, and what the result was in those cases.

, When your initial consultations are over, take some time to objectively compare each attorney to the others to find the one who will best represent your interests and whose fees will fit into your budget.While cost will be a factor in your decision, it shouldn't be the sole determining factor in who you hire.
Generally, you don't want to hire a less expensive attorney at the expense of experience handling cases similar to yours.
This is particularly true in regard to getting your car back. Considering that you may be facing thousands of dollars in impound fees and fines, any attorney who has experience in getting those fees and fines reduced is generally worth what they charge – and you may even end up saving money.

, Once you've chosen your attorney, make sure you have a written agreement in place before you give them any money or allow them to start working on your case. The attorney should give you time to review the agreement thoroughly.Make sure you understand everything included in the agreement, particularly the fees you'll be expected to pay, how those fees are computed, and when your payment is due.
If you have any questions or disagree with anything in the agreement, don't be afraid to speak up. While the agreement may be presented to you as a final document, everything in it is negotiable.
Once you're satisfied with the agreement, sign it and make sure you have a copy for your records.

, Before you can get your car back, you need to determine the specific impound lot at which it is being held. If you live in a relatively rural area, this may be easier than if you live in a large city.Typically, you'll receive a notification from the police department that provides your car's location, but you may not want to wait that long.
Additionally, any notice will be sent to the title holder of the car. This means you may not be notified if, for example, your car is owned by your parents.
To locate the correct lot, try calling the police station. The DMV also may have information on where impounded cars are taken.

, You must have specific documents to retrieve your car. Some of these documents, such as proof of insurance, can be copies. For others, such as your driver's license and your vehicle registration, you may need to provide an original or certified copy.If you intend to drive your car off the lot, you'll need to present a valid driver's license.
You also need sufficient documentation to prove you are the owner of the car. This typically means presenting your driver's license along with a copy of the vehicle's registration.
In most states you also must show proof of insurance since valid insurance is a legal requirement to drive a car.

, Before you can get your car back, you'll have to pay the impound fees that have accrued. This includes a base fee as well as daily storage fees, and can end up being several thousand dollars.There typically is an initial impound fee of several hundred dollars plus a storage fee of around $20 a day.
In addition to these base fees, there may be additional fines depending on the circumstances under which the car was impounded.
There also may be administrative fees involved for you to remove your car. For example, in Chicago you must pay at least $2,000 to get your car out of impound. This amount can be increased to $3,000 if the car was taken near a school.

, If your car is being held as evidence of additional criminal activity, you'll need a release letter from the police department before you'll be able to take your car from the impound lot, even if everything else is in order.The impound lot will have a ""hold"" on your car if it is being used as evidence. That hold must be cleared before you can take your car home.
Keep in mind that typically, storage fees will continue to accumulate as long as your car remains in impound – even if it is being held there by the police.
This is a situation where your attorney can help you, by contacting the appropriate authorities and working to get your car released. Typically, if the only crime was DUI, there's no legitimate reason to hold your car as evidence.

, In most jurisdictions, you have the right to a hearing if you believe your car was unfairly impounded. This hearing typically is an administrative proceeding, not a criminal court proceeding, but you are allowed to have an attorney represent you.Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have several options available to you that can help reduce or even eliminate the fees you were charged.
For example, if the person charged with a DUI stole your car, or took it without your consent, you can argue that you shouldn't have to pay any fees since you were not responsible for the events that resulted in your car getting impounded.
If the person took your car without your consent, this also may be a defense to the aiding and abetting charge.
However, keep in mind that this defense typically is unavailable to you if you were in the car when the person was pulled over – and generally, you must have been a passenger in the car to be charged with aiding and abetting a DUI.

, Once you've completed the initial paperwork to hire an attorney, they'll meet with you to discuss the charges against you and evaluate your options. It's important to be completely honest with your attorney so he or she can accurately assess your case.The arresting officer typically will have assessed your level of intoxication. If you had been completely sober, they probably would have let you take the car rather than impounding it – although there are other factors that come into play there.
For example, if the driver had previously been convicted of a DUI and was only allowed to drive a car equipped with a breathalyzer device, you could still be charged with aiding and abetting a DUI if you allowed that individual to drive your car, regardless of your level of intoxication.
Your situation may be even more complex if you have previously been convicted of a DUI. This sort of background is something it's important to let your attorney know.

, Your attorney will review the specifics of the aiding and abetting charge as related to your case and explain the possible defenses available to you, as well as your chances of succeeding on those defenses.Typically, your attorney will go through the criminal court process so you can understand what is to come and what will be expected of you.
Depending on how far you've progressed into the criminal justice process, your attorney may have information from the prosecutor regarding your charges, including the police report from the night the driver was arrested for DUI.
Your attorney will discuss with you the possible penalties you could face if convicted of aiding and abetting a DUI, which may include limited jail time but most likely will amount to fines and a period of probation.

, In most situations, the prosecutor isn't going to be very interested in taking a charge for aiding and abetting a DUI to trial. For this reason, you're well poised to negotiate a good plea deal.Keep in mind that the burden of proof for the prosecution is rather steep. Primarily, they must be able to prove intent, which can be exceedingly difficult in this kind of situation.
This is especially true if you were intoxicated at the time the driver was arrested. In that situation, you may have been incapable of properly assessing the person's level of drunkenness before giving them permission to drive your car – and that can be fatal to the prosecution's case.
If you've been charged with anything else in addition to the aiding and abetting charge, the prosecutor may be more willing to drop the aiding and abetting charge entirely. But depending on what those other charges are, this may not necessarily be to your advantage.
On a single charge of aiding and abetting a DUI, a deal may be your best bet and can save you the time and stress of a trial. This is especially true if this is your first brush with the law.

, Typically the court will call a preliminary hearing, in which the judge will read the charges against you and give you the opportunity to enter or change your plea. If you've previously been arraigned and pled not guilty, for example, you'll have to change your plea if you've accepted a deal from the prosecutor.If you've chosen to take a deal, your plea will depend on the terms of the deal.
Typically the prosecutor will present the deal to the judge, and then either the prosecutor or the judge will ask you a number of questions to make sure you understand the deal that is being offered and are accepting it voluntarily.

Plead guilty to a lesser charge.",How to Get DUI Charges Dropped," Even though you may be eligible to have a public defender appointed, hiring a private attorney may be better for you if you are looking to get DUI charges dropped. You may also want to ask friends or family for recommendations unless you don't want them to know about your arrest.
If you do look online, the website of your state or local bar association is a good place to start.
Look for a free attorney-referral program that will give you a list of area attorneys tailored to your answers to a few questions.
Many attorneys who handle DUI cases engage in extensive advertising, which means you might already know a few relevant names. Keep in mind, however, that the best or most affordable attorney for you won't necessarily have a great ad.;
, Ideally you should be able to find at least four or five attorneys that handle DUI cases in your area. Take an in-depth look at each one's background and experience to narrow your list. If the attorneys on your list have websites, read them in order to evaluate their backgrounds and experience.
You want an attorney who practices in your area, someone who is familiar with the judges and prosecutors. You're looking for an attorney who has been practicing in your area for several years.
You may be able to find information about the types of cases an attorney takes by looking at their website. Look for extensive experience with DUI cases.
Check an attorney's reputation by searching for reviews from past clients. You may be able to find these on general review sites or on social media.

, Generally it's a good idea to interview at least two or three attorneys so you can find one best suited to your case. Since most criminal-defense attorneys offer a free initial consultation, this shouldn't cost you anything but time. You should be able to schedule an initial consultation within a week. If an attorney doesn't have time to meet with you in the next week (two at the most), they probably are too busy to give your case the attention it deserves.
If the attorney has an information form for you to fill out, complete and return it as soon as possible. The more information the attorney has about you and your case, the better able they are to tailor the initial consultation to you and your needs.

, Particularly with a free consultation, you can't always count on an attorney to cover all the information that's important to you. Make a list of questions ahead of your first scheduled consultation so you can understand everything pertinent to your case. The types of questions you ask will depend on what is important to you in an attorney-client relationship. If this is your first time hiring an attorney, think about things that would be important to you if you were hiring someone to work for you in any other capacity. The questions you ask here would be similar.
For example, if you needed a plumber, you might want to know whether the plumber would do all the work herself or have an inexperienced apprentice doing most of the work.
Similarly, if you're hiring an attorney, you may want to ask them how much of the work on your case they'll be doing themselves and how much will be done by a paralegal or new attorney who recently graduated from law school.

, After you've completed your initial consultations, take some time to evaluate and compare the attorneys. This enables you to identify the one most qualified to represent you. Fees are an important consideration, especially if money is tight. Resist the temptation to select an attorney just because they charge the lowest fee. That person might not be your best choice.
Most attorneys are willing to negotiate if you can't immediately afford their fee. Some may be willing to create a payment plan or even lower the total cost.
When choosing an attorney, don't ignore your gut feeling. If you find one who's passionate, interested in your case, and who inspires your confidence and trust, they may be your best choice – even if they're less experienced than others you interviewed.

, When you've made your decision, let the attorney you want to hire know as soon as possible. He or she typically will meet with you again to have you sign a written retainer agreement (a contract). Don't let the attorney start working on your case until you've read and signed a written contract for their services.
Have the attorney explain the agreement to you. Ask questions if there's anything about it you don't understand.
There may be a part of the agreement with which you disagree or that's different from what you understood from the initial consultation. Say something about it. Attorneys typically are willing to negotiate, but you have to bring the issue up yourself.
For example, you might say ""This agreement says I'm paying you by the hour, but you told me during the initial consultation that you would take my case for an $800 flat fee. I planned my budget based on that flat fee.""

, Your argument for dropping the DUI charges depends on the type of evidence the prosecution has against you. If the charges are based on field sobriety tests, for example, you may have a stronger case. The prosecuting attorney must provide to your attorney all evidence they plan to use against you at trial. Your attorney will discuss this evidence with you.
DUI charges based on field sobriety tests can be the most difficult for the prosecution to prove, particularly if there is no other evidence of your intoxication.
The tests are relatively subjective, based on the officer's observations, and there are a number of conditions that can interfere with the results.
Breathalyzer tests also have weaknesses but are generally more difficult to challenge than field sobriety tests.
The specific results of a test make a difference. The prosecutor may be more willing to drop the charges if you were just barely over the legal limit than if tests showed you were significantly intoxicated.

, If the police officer who initially pulled you over did not have probable cause to stop you, that can be used as evidence to get the DUI charges dropped. If you went through a DUI checkpoint, this may not be as helpful to your case as if you were pulled over individually. For example, if you were obeying all the rules of the road and were pulled over anyway, you can argue that the officer did not have probable cause to stop you.
If the officer pulled you over for a non-moving violation such as a broken tail light, you may be able to argue the officer had no probable cause to believe you were intoxicated.
For that argument, you would need to look at the statements from the officer. Typically the officer will note in the police report that they administered a breathalyzer or field sobriety test because they smelled alcohol on your breath.

, Many physical and medical conditions can interfere with test results. This is so, particularly if the charges are based on the results of a field sobriety test or a breathalyzer test. For example, certain diets and medications can cause a false breathalyzer result. If you're currently on a strict Atkins-style diet, for example, your body may produce alcohol that the breathalyzer reads incorrectly. This isn't the type of alcohol that you can get drunk from, but the breathalyzer can't tell the difference.
You may also have registered a falsely high blood-alcohol content on a breathalyzer if you have certain medical conditions such as diabetes or acid reflux.
If your DUI charge is based on a field sobriety test, physical conditions may have caused you to appear drunk, even though your driving ability was not impaired. For example, you may have a recent knee or ankle injury.

, If anyone was in the car with you, they can testify regarding whether you had been drinking before you were pulled over. If you're arguing that a medical condition interfered with the test results, your attorney may want to produce expert witnesses. For example, if you believe that your acid reflux produced a false result on a breathalyzer test, you might ask a doctor to testify to the severity of your acid reflux disease and your use of medication in response.
Eyewitnesses can be helpful, especially if they were with you before you were pulled over and can testify that you were not drinking any alcohol. Keep in mind, however, that it will be their word against the word of a police officer. Generally police officers do well in a trial. A prosecutor (or judge) may not be convinced by a friend of yours who is contradicting a member of law enforcement.

, Even if this is your first charge, getting a prosecutor to drop DUI charges can be challenging. Your best defense is to work with your attorney to prepare for a trial on the merits of your case.Even if you and your attorney are fairly confident that you can get your DUI charges dropped, it's still important to be well-prepared for trial. If the prosecutor senses that you're not well-prepared, they may become less willing to negotiate with you.
On the other hand, the prosecutor will be more willing to strike a deal if you have a strong case and it appears likely that you could win at trial.
Since both sides are required to exchange information and evidence, the prosecuting attorney generally will have a good idea of how strong your case looks and your odds of beating the charges.

, Many jurisdictions have a driving school that those convicted of DUI or other traffic violations are required to complete. If you do so promptly, it sends a signal to the prosecutor that you're taking steps to be a more responsible driver. Your attorney can tell you what classes are required and where you can take them.
Expect these classes to cost several hundred dollars. You'll be expected to complete them in spite of the cost. Consider it part of the punishment.
Taking a driver-responsibility class does not mean that you're admitting guilt. On the contrary, the prosecutor may be more willing to work with you if you show that you're being proactive.

, If you got behind the wheel after drinking, that could be a symptom of a larger problem you are having with alcohol. Speak to a professional and seek out help if you recognize a need to do so. As with taking driving classes, getting a professional evaluation does not mean that you are admitting guilt.
The prosecutor may be more willing to work with you if you show a willingness to admit you have a problem and get help for it.
Keep in mind, however, that once you start a treatment program, the prosecutor may condition the dropping of DUI charges on continued participation in treatment.

, Your attorney likely will discuss possible plea bargains before your trial begins. The weaker the case against you, the more likely the prosecutor will be to drop charges. The prosecutor's opinion of the case, and what they're willing to offer you, may change depending on the evidence revealed as part of the pretrial investigation.
For example, the prosecutor may be unwilling to entertain any thought of dropping your DUI charges. However, upon learning that you have a medical condition that probably interfered with the breathalyzer results, the prosecutor may change their opinion of the case.
Prosecutors are usually unwilling to drop DUI charges. You may have more of a challenge plea bargaining than you would with another type of case. That's why having an attorney who understands the law and is familiar with the judge and prosecutor can be instrumental in getting your charges dropped.

, Even if you're able to convince the prosecutor to drop the DUI charges, you won't be able to get away penalty-free. As noted above, a driver-responsibility class can be expensive. However, you may be able to keep from having a DUI on your record by pleading guilty to a lesser offense such as reckless driving. This is where it can be to your advantage to have already taken driver safety or responsibility classes. These classes typically would be required for lesser moving violations as well.
Your attorney will explain to you the consequences of the lesser offense so you can decide whether it is in your best interests to take the deal.
Keep in mind that while you still may incur negative consequences such as increased car-insurance rates, these consequences typically will be less than they would be if you were convicted of a DUI.

Remember to hold onto copies of your medical records. These documents help prove the extent of your injuries.
Also follow the proposed medical treatment.If you don’t, then the boat operator could claim that you aggravated your injuries by not following doctor’s orders.;
, You can be reimbursed for any damage caused to your property.For example, you might have been in a boat when the other person rammed you. You need to document the damage to your boat.


Take photographs of damage to your property. This will help show the extent of the damage.
Get an estimate for repairs. If your boat was damaged, take it to a shop and ask for a detailed estimate of how much it would cost to fix the boat. If you already have had the boat fixed before trial, then hold onto the itemized receipt of what work was done.

, At trial, you will need to prove that the defendant’s conduct caused your injury. This generally will mean that you need to show that the boat operator was reckless or careless (“negligent”). You should get the names of people who saw the boat operator cause the accident.


Witnesses are often identified in police reports, so you should get a copy of the report filed on the incident.See Obtain a Police Report for tips on how to get yours.

, The boat might have hit something in the water, like a buoy or a coral reef. In that situation, take pictures of what you hit.You might also take pictures of the water, although this can be less helpful if the conditions on the day you take photographs are not the same as the conditions the day of the accident.

, You were also a witness to the accident, so you should write down your memories as soon as possible — the day of, if you are able. Document what the other person did and what you did. Try to remember important details, such as how you were exactly injured.


Be honest in your assessment.It is important not to exaggerate, which reduces your credibility.
For example, writing “The other boat was flying over the water” is less credible than writing “The boat was going faster than we were.”

, You can be compensated for any lost work as a result of your injuries.If you are permanently disabled, then you can be compensated for income you expected to earn in the future. You should gather the following documents, which will help show how much income you have lost:


W-2 forms
Pay stubs
Tax returns
Proof of self-employed income

, You can be compensated for any money spent treating your injuries. For this reason, you should put all medical bills in a big folder so that you don’t lose them. You can be reimbursed for the following:Rehabilitation costs
Doctor and hospital fees
Prescription medication
Costs of a therapist

, Another way to document your injuries is to take color photographs. At least a year or more could pass before your trial starts, so it is a good idea to document your physical injuries thoroughly using photographs.Make sure to take pictures from many different angles. Also take some pictures close up so that you can see the injury in detail.

, You can also get compensation for your pain and suffering.These injuries can be harder to prove; however, one thing you can do is keep a “pain journal.” In your journal, you write down daily where you feel the pain and its intensity.


Also note how the pain has influenced your life. If you have trouble sleeping, or if you can’t move as well as you used to, then note those facts as well. If your pain is causing you to miss out on experiences, like going out with friends, make sure you record that.

, At a minimum, you should meet with an attorney to discuss whether you have a strong case. You can find a personal injury attorney by looking in the phone book or by searching online. If you can’t get any leads that way, then contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral.Schedule a consultation and ask how much the attorney charges for your consultation.
You should also discuss how much it would cost to hire the attorney to handle the entire case. Although you can certainly represent yourself, your chances of getting compensation are much higher if you have an attorney represent you. If someone died, and you are bringing a wrongful death claim, then you certainly need an attorney.Discuss whether the attorney works “on contingency.” Under this agreement, the attorney doesn’t charge any fees. Instead, they take a percentage of any amount you win at trial or get in a settlement. They usually get 33 – 40% of the amount.Contingency fee agreements can make an attorney affordable; however, the attorney may not represent you unless you have significant physical injuries.

, You should gather all of your medical bills and proof of lost income. Add them together. Then multiply this amount by a number between one and five for any pain and suffering you have experienced (one if you have experienced little or no pain, five for an extreme amount). The more extreme the pain and suffering, the more compensation you can get.You also might be able to get “punitive” damages because the boat operator was drunk. This amount of money is awarded to punish the defendant. Punitive damages are available in many states for DUI cases, so they may be available in BUI cases as well., Often, the person who operated the boat also owns the boat; however, you might have been injured by a boat operator who does not own the boat. Depending on your state law, the boat owner may be responsible for your injuries, not the boat operator.Ask the boat owner and operator (if different people) for their insurance information.If the person does not have insurance, you can still negotiate with them for a settlement. The process is generally the same.

, You might want to negotiate a settlement. Settling a dispute is usually faster, cheaper, and less stressful than a lawsuit. You can begin the settlement process by writing a letter to the boat owner’s insurer. The demand letter should include the following:A summary of the incident. Provide the “who, what, where, when, and how.”
A claim that the defendant is at fault. Be sure to mention that the defendant was operating the boat with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit.
A description of your injuries and the treatment you have received. Go into moderate detail. Also mention any painkillers you received.
The total amount you have spent on medical treatment.
A demand for compensation. Remember, you are beginning negotiations. Accordingly, you should demand double the amount you think your injury is worth. For example, if your injuries are worth $40,000, then demand $80,000.
A threat to sue in court if you can’t reach a resolution.

, Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested so that you know when it is received. Remember to keep a copy for your records.

, The insurer should send you a letter in return, which should contain a counter-offer. Don’t be surprised if the counter-offer is extremely low. For example, you might have demanded $80,000 but the insurer will counter with $20,000.


You should avoid firing off an angry letter or picking up the phone and yelling at the insurer.Instead, put the letter aside and come back to it a day later.

, You should respond to any low counter offer by explaining in more detail your pain and suffering injuries and dropping the amount of your demand only a little.Ideally, you and the insurer will then go back and forth, each moving closer to what the other side proposes.


Unfortunately, you will likely not get very far in negotiations before litigation. Most insurance companies use software to determine their offer and will most likely not veer too far away from that first offer. They probably will not be willing to negotiate much, as pre-litigation they don't have much flexibility. You may have better luck negotiating after the discovery is complete, as much more information will be revealed during this time.
Remember that negotiation is voluntary. If the insurer cannot give you the amount that you feel you deserve, then you can break off negotiations.

, You should formalize any agreement in a settlement agreement signed by both parties. This will be the contract between the parties. As the person bringing the lawsuit, you probably have to give the boat operator a “release” from future lawsuits based on your injuries.If you negotiated without a lawyer, then take a draft of your settlement agreement to a lawyer and ask them to review it. You want to make sure you aren’t signing away important rights in your agreement.

, You can’t sue the boat operator anywhere. Instead, you can generally sue them in the county where they live or in the county where the accident happened. You may have other options — for example, if the boat operator does business in your area, you might be able to sue there. Talk to an attorney about where you can sue.


You should also think about suing in small claims court, especially if your injuries weren’t severe. Small claims courts are set up so that people can represent themselves without a lawyer.
Small claims courts have maximums you can sue for, which differ depending on the state. For example, in Tennessee, the maximum is $25,000. In Rhode Island, by contrast, the maximum is $2,500., You start a lawsuit by filing a complaint with the court. This document identifies you as the “plaintiff” (the person bringing the lawsuit) and the boat operator/owner as the “defendant” (the person sued). The complaint also includes background information on the dispute and makes your demand for money compensation.Many courts have printed forms you can fill in. You should check with the court clerk. Small claims courts in particular have these forms.If no form is available, then you will need to find a sample and use it as a guide.Of course, if you hire a lawyer, then they should do everything for you, including drafting and filing a complaint.

, When you finish the complaint, make several copies. You will want one for your records; you also might need to file several copies with the court. Take your copies and the original to the court clerk. Ask to file.The clerk should stamp your copies with the filing date.

, You probably have to pay a fee to file your lawsuit. The amount will differ by court, so call ahead and ask for the amount and the acceptable methods of payment. Don’t assume a court accepts cash, personal checks, or credit cards.


If you can’t afford the fee, ask the court clerk if a fee waiver is available. You typically will have to fill out a form and report your monthly income and living expenses., You need to give the defendant notice that you are suing them. This notice consists of two things—a copy of your complaint and a “summons,” which is a document you can get from the court clerk.You then need to arrange for service to be made. You can’t serve the papers yourself.


Generally, you can have someone 18 or older make hand delivery on the defendant. For example, you could ask a neighbor to deliver it. You might also be able to pay a professional process server to make hand delivery.
In some counties, you can pay the sheriff or constable a small fee to make delivery for you. Ask the court clerk.

, The defendant has a set amount of time in which to respond to your lawsuit. Typically, they will file an “answer.” In this document, the defendant responds to each allegation you made in your complaint, either admitting, denying, or claiming insufficient knowledge to admit or deny.The defendant can also raise “affirmative defenses.” In a BUI accident, there probably won’t be many defenses the defendant can raise; however, if you took too long to bring a lawsuit, then the defendant could argue you violated the statute of limitations. Generally, you have two years to bring the lawsuit, though this length of time will differ by state.
If you have a lawyer, they will receive the defendant’s response. Always ask your lawyer for copies of any document in your case so that you can keep up with what is going on.

, This fact-finding phase is called “discovery,” and it is a major part of any lawsuit in the U.S. During discovery, you and the defendant swap information so that there are no surprises at trial. The following are different discovery techniques you can use:Requests for Production of Documents. You can get a copy of any document, or inspect any object, if you think it would be helpful to your case. For example, you might want to inspect the boat that injured you.
Requests for Admission. You can state facts and ask the defendant to admit or deny them. For example, you could ask the defendant to admit that they drank beer while on the boat.
Interrogatories. These are written questions the defendant answers under oath. For example, you could use an interrogatory to ask the defendant what witnesses they intend to call at trial.
Depositions. In a deposition, you can ask a witness questions in person, which they answer under oath. A court reporter takes down the questions and answers. Depositions are a good way to feel out what a witness knows. For example, someone might have been on the water when the accident occurred. You can ask questions in a deposition to find out what they saw.

, After discovery ends, you may enter into negotiations again. It is very unlikely that the case will settle before discovery is complete, so now is the time when you can go back and forth with the insurance company or other party, describing your hardships in greater detail and lowering your demand slightly.


Consider using a mediator for this process. A mediator is an objective third party who will sit down with both parties and try to help guide them toward a mutually agreed upon settlement.Mediation is more informal and much quicker and less expensive than a trial. In addition, anything that is said in these sessions is private, whereas everything said in court is available to the public.The cost for mediation is split between parties. It is a voluntary process, so both sides must agree to take part.Mediation is a particularly good idea if you want to try and remain on good terms with the other person, because it allows both people to speak freely about their feelings and discuss practical solutions., Go through all of your papers and identify who you want to testify on your own behalf. Remember that a witness can only testify as to what they know personally. A witness can’t testify to gossip or second-hand information.Helpful witnesses typically include:


Anyone who witnessed the accident.
The police officer who investigated the accident.
Your doctor or therapist, who can testify about your injuries.
Family and friends, who can testify to changes in your mood or lifestyle as a result of your injuries.

, You can use a document as an exhibit and introduce it into evidence at trial. You will also have to give the defendant a copy of all of your exhibits. Make multiple copies — one for you, one for the court, and one for the defendant.


You can turn a document into an exhibit by placing an exhibit sticker in a corner of the document. If you have a picture, then you can put the sticker on the back.
You can get stickers from an office supply store or from the court clerk.

, There is a possibility that the defendant will file a summary of judgement motion before you get to trial. This may be done if you have more than one claim and the defendant wants to try to eliminate one of those claims. A summary of judgement motion is filed when one party feels that both parties are in agreement about the most important facts and that the law is on their side.You will have a certain amount of time to respond with an opposition to motion for summary judgement. You will need to submit evidence that either proves the defendant's arguments about the law are incorrect or evidence that the facts aren't as straight-forward as the defendant says and that a trial is necessary to determine the truth., If you didn’t settle your lawsuit, then you will need to go to trial. Personal injury trials tend to follow the same sequence. The common parts of a personal injury trial include:Jury selection. Either you or the defendant might want a jury. If you want a jury, then you should definitely have a lawyer represent you. Jury selection is a process of elimination. The judge questions a panel of potential jurors, and you can ask the judge to dismiss any juror that is biased.
Opening statements. These provide the jurors with a roadmap of what the evidence will be.
Presentation of your witnesses. You will present witnesses and evidence first. You will probably also have to testify on your behalf.
Cross-examination of the defense witnesses. The defendant gets to put on a case after you. You can cross-examine the defense witnesses.
Closing arguments. Each side sums up the evidence and explains how it supports their case.
Jury verdict. The judge will read the jury its instructions and then allow them to retire for deliberations. In many states, juries no longer have to be unanimous in personal injury lawsuits. Instead, you might win if nine or 10 out of 12 jurors agree with you.

, Winning at trial is only half the battle. You also need to enforce your judgment. Hopefully, the defendant will pay up or make plans to pay you in monthly installments; however, the defendant might resist paying you. You typically will only have to worry about this if the defendant is not insured or the award exceeds their insurance. In that case, you can do the following:


Garnish the defendant’s wages. You can file for garnishment with the court, which will then send notice to the defendant’s employer to withhold a percentage of the defendant’s salary each pay period.Put liens on the defendant’s property. You might also be able to get a judgment lien put on the defendant’s home or another property. If the defendant wants to sell the property, then he or she needs to pay you first.
Get the defendant’s licenses suspended. In some states, you can also get a defendant’s professional licenses suspended. You might also be able to get a driver’s license suspended. The threat of suspension often induces a defendant to pay up.

A sealed conviction, however, is not erased from your record and is still available for certain people to access.Some states also refuse to expunge DUI. In Illinois, you can only get a DUI conviction expunged by seeking a pardon.Most states which allow expungement for DUI convictions require that a certain amount of time have passed from either the date of the sentence or the completion of probation. For example, New Hampshire will allow you to apply to expunge a DUI conviction 10 years after the date of your conviction. In Arkansas, you can apply 5 years after you completed your sentence.
Other requirements typically include a history of no further alcohol-related convictions or arrests.Also, most states will only expunge a first DUI conviction.
To check whether your state allows DUI expungements, visit the DUI Process website for general information on each state’s expungement laws.;
, Some states may allow you to proceed on your own. In Oklahoma, however, the state strongly encourages that you have an attorney.You can find a lawyer who specializes in expungements by visiting your state’s bar association. The state should have a referral program.

, You should get either a “rap sheet” of your criminal history or certified disposition records. You should contact the appropriate agency, such as the Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Information.You will have to pay to access these records. In Rhode Island you have to pay $5 by check or money order. Call ahead before ordering to ask about the cost.

, In many states you can download the appropriate form from the court’s website. You must apply for expungement in the court for the district in which you were prosecuted.


You can get the expungement form by contacting the clerk of court. If you live out of state, then you should call.
If you need help getting the form, contact the attorney who handled your DUI conviction. She might be able to point you in the right direction.
In states without a form, your attorney will prepare a motion to file with the court.

, The form will ask for basic information. For example, most forms ask for:


Your name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and driver’s license number.The name of your attorney.A list of your convictions, including offense, date of arrest, county/municipality of arrest, name of arresting agency, case number, and name of court.Your signature and the date.

, Depending on the court, you may have to attach a copy of your rap sheet or certified dispositions. The form should tell you what to attach.


In North Carolina you must attach notarized affidavits from at least 2 people attesting to your good moral character. You must also sign a good character affidavit yourself.Attach copies unless the form specifies originals.

, You must send a copy to the district attorney who prosecuted you for the DUI. It is recommended that you call ahead and ask about their preferred method of service.If the prosecutor does not object to the expungement, she will sign the form and return it to you. The prosecutor may also try to find any victims to the crime and notify them that they can object.

, You can file the form with the court or mail it to the address provided on the form.


Always keep a copy for your own records. If you need to fill out a form again, you will now have a handy reference guide.

, Fees will vary depending on state and jurisdiction. You will pay $175 in North Carolina, and $100 in Kansas.In Rhode Island, you don’t have to pay to file, but you will have to pay $100 if you are successfully granted an Expungement Order.If you cannot afford the fee, ask the court clerk if you can apply for an indigent waiver. There should be a form to fill out.

, The prosecutor as well as other interested parties (such as victims) usually have a set amount of time to object. Generally, they have between 30-60 days.


If there is an objection, the court will schedule a hearing. The hearing will probably be set 30 days after the objection.

, You may want to retain a lawyer at the hearing stage, who will prep you for the hearing. Even if you do have an attorney, you can prepare by answering the following questions:


How do I show that I have the requisite good moral character?Have I participated in community service or volunteer activities? Am I actively involved in my church?
Have I done anything since my conviction that would make someone suspicious that I might drive drunk again?
Have I been successfully rehabilitated?What proof do I have? For example, have I completed a 12 step program?

, You want to project a confident, professional image. Your clothing should suggest you have yourself pulled together.


You should dress business casual: a dress shirt and pants for men; a blouse and slacks or a skirt for women.
Avoid loud jewelry and talking on your cell phone in court.
Do not chew gum in the court room or bring a beverage inside.

, Part of conveying good moral character is being honest. Answer questions honestly but also carefully. There is no reason to say too much.

, You may have to wait a specific amount of time before applying again. The timeline should be specified in any communication you received from the court.

, The state may tell you that it will notify agencies of the record. Unfortunately, the state may have a backlog or may simply forget. It is better that you reach out to agencies yourself.


First, send a copy of the court’s order to the Attorney General’s Office and the arresting police department.Then, contact your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and tell them about the expungement.

, In most situations you will never again need to disclose the DUI. For example, when you apply for a job or apply to rent an apartment, you will not need to disclose.


However, if you apply for a government job or a professional license then you may need to disclose an expungement. Government employers often ask explicitly about whether you have had a conviction expunged, as will professional licensing boards, such as the attorney bar.

, Many websites have sprung up that posts people’s mugshots. To get these removed, you have to contact the website and pay around $200-400.


Unfortunately, these websites will sell your mugshot to a sister website, which then will want to charge you $200-400 to remove the mugshot again.Check to see if your mugshot is online. The website Mugshotsonline acts as a clearinghouse for mugshots from around the country. If your mugshot has been posted, contact a lawyer who can aggressively pursue removal of your mugshot.

If you are over the age of 21, you should be able to enjoy alcohol responsibly without putting yourself or others in harm's way. If you have been drinking, call a taxi or a friend for a ride and never get behind the wheel.;
, If you find yourself getting pulled over after you have been drinking, you need to immediately start thinking about your actions. Any moves you make will be observed by law enforcement and can be used to establish probable cause to charge you with a DUI. It starts as soon as the officer's lights go on in their car. When this happens, find a safe place to pull over and do so responsibly.


Leave enough room on either side of your car so the officer can safely approach. Make sure you are not sticking out into the road. If you drive erratically, pull over unsafely, or brake to abruptly, the officer may make a note of it in their report., When the officer is approaching your car, do not make any sudden or unpredictable movements. Officers are trained to protect themselves and any surprising movements may cause an officer to react unpleasantly.In addition, an officer may perceive sudden or erratic movements as a sign of intoxication. These types of movements are likely going to be documented and used against you.

, While it may seem obvious, you should always be polite and friendly to a police officer.The officer you interact with is going to be a key witness in any DUI case against you. If you treat the officer with respect, you are more likely to have a favorable report. Understand that the officer is doing their job and you are doing yours. While you may not see eye-to-eye at times, never disrespect the person.


If you are belligerent, an officer may write a particularly harsh report and may put in extra time to make sure you get in trouble. In addition, you may be arrested or charged on unrelated matters (e.g., resisting arrest) should you act out physically or emotionally. Finally, these types of actions are signs of drinking, which you want to avoid at all costs.

, As soon as the officer starts interacting with you, you want to put up a mental barrier. While you are required to give the officer your identification, registration, and proof of insurance, you are not required to do much else. If the officer asks you any factual questions, for example ""where are you coming from?"" or ""how much have you had to drink?"", you should respectfully decline to answer. You can do this by saying, ""I apologize officer but I have been advised not to answer these questions."" While you do not have to answer these types of questions, you should never lie.


The officer will ask thee types of questions to try and get you to incriminate yourself. For example, if the officer asks you where you are coming from and you tell them you are coming from the bar, this is an indication that you have been drinking. Any answer you give them will be put in their report and used against you during your criminal and civil proceedings. Therefore, you should avoid giving an officer any information that may help them make a case against you., In Arizona, field sobriety tests are voluntary.Therefore, if you are asked to submit to tests including walking heel to toe, standing on one leg, or touching your nose with your finger, you should respectfully refuse. These tests are effective tools for officers when they are trying to establish probable cause to arrest and charge you with a DUI. However, these tests are incredibly subjective and officers can simply choose whether you pass or fail.In addition, the tests are not particularly reliable in gauging your level of intoxication. There are multiple reasons you may ""fail"" one of the field sobriety tests. For example, you may be tired, have a medical condition, or you may have anxiety.

, At this point, after you have refused to answer questions and take field sobriety tests, you are likely going to be arrested for DUI. However, under some circumstances, if an officer cannot establish probable cause, you will be allowed to leave. The less information you give the officer, the more difficult it will be for them to establish probable cause. However, based on the circumstances of your traffic stop, you may be arrested and taken into custody.


If you are arrested, you will most likely be read your Miranda rights. This process requires an officer to tell you about your rights to remain silent and to talk to an attorney. Even if you are not read your Miranda rights, as soon as you are arrested, or even detained, you should cease talking with any law enforcement official until you have spoken with an attorney.

, After you are arrested, you will be taken to the police station where law enforcement will administer a blood, breath, or urine test in order to determine your blood alcohol content (BAC). In Arizona, if you are lawfully arrested under the belief you have been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you automatically consent to taking a blood, breath, or urine test. This test must be taken within two hours of when you were driving and the officer in charge will choose which test to administer.


If you are arrested and refuse the test, your license will automatically be suspended.
Refusing to take the test is a judgment call you will have to make. While refusing to take the test will ensure law enforcement does not have any scientific evidence of your BAC, it will also lead to the suspension of your license. In addition, you can still be found guilty of a DUI even if the prosecution does not have your BAC available., After you have been booked and processed, you will be released from custody and allowed to go home. Being processed usually includes having your mugshot and fingerprints taken. If you did not do this, you will likely receive a court order at your arraignment requiring you to do so at some time in the future. Once released, call a friend or a taxi and have them pick you up.


During your processing, the officer may ask you more questions about the traffic stop. Make sure you remain silent and do not answer any questions posed to you.
Upon your release, you will usually get a criminal citation with a court name and date on it. Keep this as it is a record of what will happen next., As soon as you get home, write down everything you can remember about the traffic stop and arrest. The more you can remember the easier it will be for your attorney to help you. When you are writing down information, try and include the following:


What you were doing and where you were before you drove;
How much you drank;
When you were arrested in relation to when you were pulled over;
What you said to the officer;
Where you were pulled over;
When and if you were read your Miranda rights; and
When you took your chemical test in relation to when you last drank., Soon after you record your memories you should call an attorney. Many criminal defense attorneys will specialize in DUIs and you should look for an attorney who does. Ask friends and family members for recommendations. If you cannot get a referral, call your local bar association and ask about their lawyer referral services.


Hire an attorney that seems knowledgeable about DUIs and that has confidence in your case. In addition, choose an attorney that seems trustworthy. Finally, be sure you understand how the attorney will bill for their time and make sure the fee arrangement is acceptable.

, The arraignment will be your first court appearance following your arrest. It is the date, time, and place written on the citation you received the night you were arrested. At the arraignment you will be informed of the charges against you and you will be asked to make a plea. You will either plead guilty or not guilty. In almost every scenario, you should plead not guilty.


After you plead not guilty, you will be given your next court date, which will most likely be a pre-trial conference., In the time between your arraignment and pre-trial conference, your attorney should be working diligently to negotiate a deal with the prosecution.The type of deal your attorney will negotiate will depend on the strength of your case. If you and your attorney believe you have a strong case, you may not negotiate at all and instead you may ask to have the charges dropped or dismissed.

, Also during the time before your pre-trial conference, you and your attorney should be gathering information about your case. This may include:


Hiring expert witnesses;
Visiting the alleged crime scene;
Requesting samples of blood for retesting;
Interviewing the arresting officer; and
Requesting video and audio tapes of your police encounter., A pre-trial conference is an opportunity for the judge to talk with your attorney and the prosecutor. At the conference, the judge will assess the case and decide whether to allow each side more time to build their case or set a trial date.

, If you feel that policies or laws were broken during your police encounter, your attorney may want to file a motion to suppress evidence or a motion to dismiss the charges against you. These motions will usually be filed right after your pre-trial conference. Common scenarios where motions may be appropriate include when an officer had no basis to pull you over in the first place, when an officer mishandles evidence, or when your right to an attorney was wrongfully denied.A motion to suppress evidence is a motion asking the judge not to allow a specific piece of evidence to be admitted at trial because of some wrongdoing.
A motion to dismiss the case is a motion asking the judge to throw out the case altogether.

, If your case continues to trial, your attorney will present your case in front of the judge or a jury. Your attorney will present all of the evidence to the court, as will the prosecution, and the court will decide whether you are guilty or not guilty of committing a DUI. If found guilty, you will be sentenced and fined. If you are found not guilty, the matter will be over., The Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) portion of DUI case is a civil hearing conducted in certain situations when you driver's license has been suspended.


If you submitted to a chemical breath test and failed, you will be given an Admin Per Se Suspension, which is a 90 day suspension of your license that begins 15 days after the date of the test.
If the officer chooses to take a blood sample, as opposed to a breath test, you will not be served with an immediate suspension. Once the officer receives your blood results, and if you failed, they will send an Admin Per Se Affidavit to MVD. MVD will then send you a notice advising you of your 90 day suspension.
If you refuse to submit to any tests, the officer will serve you with an Implied Consent Suspension. This is a one or two year suspension depending on whether it is your first or second offense. The suspension will start 15 days from when you were served., A hearing must be requested within 15 days from the date the officer served you with the suspension or when you were served by MVD. If you do not timely request a hearing, your rights will be waived and you will lose your ability to challenge the license suspension.Directions for requesting a hearing will be on the suspension notice and your attorney will know how to help you.

, At your hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) will hear your case and will determine whether the officer was within their rights when they suspended your license.


In an Admin Per Se Suspension, the ALJ will look to determine whether: the officer had reason to believe you were driving under the influence; you were arrested for a DUI; your tests determined your BAC was .08 or higher; and the manner of testing was valid and reliable.
In an Implied Consent Suspension, the ALJ will look to determine whether: the officer had reason to believe you were driving under the influence; you were arrested for a DUI; you refused or failed to submit to testing; and you were advised of the consequences of your refusal., The ALJ will take your case under consideration and will give you a ruling in a matter of weeks. Keep in mind that winning or losing your MVD hearing has no bearing on your criminal case."

So, onward we march to a jury trial of the matter., The first and essential step in attempting this case is to get in touch with the NYS PJI 1192 (3) VTL. In particular, look at the pertinent PJI definition of ""intoxication"".

A person is in a drunk condition when such person has consumed liquor to the extent that she or he is incapable, to a substantial degree, of utilizing the physical and mental abilities which she or he is anticipated to have in order to operate a car as a reasonable and sensible motorist. (Emphasis added.)

,, Here is an example cross-examination:

You: Sir you observed Johnny drive past you, yes?
Cop: Yes.
You: You took out after him, true?
Police officer: Yes.
You: You activated your overheads, fix?
Cop: Yes.
You: And Johnny drew over, yes?
Cop: Yes.
You: So at that point he had the brainpower to recognize you were stopping him, correct Sir?
Cop; Yes.
You: And the physical ability to draw the vehicle over, yes?
Police officer: Yes.
You: You approached Johnny's vehicle?
Cop: Yes.
You: And requested him to produce license and registration, correct?
Cop: Yes.
You: So he had the mental ability to understand that demand, correct Sir?
Police officer: I think ...
You: That's a yes?
Police officer: Yes.
You: And he had the physical capability to find produce and hand you those documents, Isn't that also true?
Police officer: Well no, it took him a long period of time to discover them and he kept dropping his license...

, 'And it was going so well!' you tell yourself. Now exactly what do I do? Do not worry. What just took place is that your arresting officer just differed your script and is heading down the dark and lonesome roadway of decorating his/her observations of intoxication. It is a dark and lonely road because you constantly follow the cardinal guideline of cross examination: ""Never ever ask a concern you have no idea the answer to"". In truth, that rule needs to be ""never ever ask a concern you don't know exactly what the answer to needs to be"".,
Cop: Yes.
You: Which he 'kept dropping his license'?
Cop: Yes, Ma'am, he did.
You: I see.
You: Sir, you have training in the best ways to complete the essential documents pursuant to a DWI arrest fix?
Cop: Yes I do.

Police officer: It does not state that either.


You can repeat this procedure once again with his/her field notes, the misdemeanor information itself or his/her marvelous jury statement (if the case is a felony) to really pound your point home.

, When you return to your physical and mental capability line of questioning, the officer is not likely to decorate again, but if he/she does, be grateful, and simply repeat your unfavorable impeachment steps., Naturally you will include each physical task into your cross examination as the realities of the case allow., Once again, take a look at the facts and take what they offer you., In your summation, remind the jury that the law is not 'fuel and liquor do not blend'.

Then reiterate all of the evidence to support that he did., If you follow these methods of integrating the crucial buzzwords of the PJI into your case with cross examination of the apprehending officer, and using unfavorable impeachment to struggle embellishment, you ought to be returning Not Guilty verdicts regularly with these kinds of cases."

After stopping, turn your engine off and roll down your window.If it is at night, then turn on the light inside your vehicle. This will allow the officer to see you as he or she approaches.
After you turn on the light, don’t make sudden movements. The officer might believe you are trying to hide something, such as a beer bottle. Sit with your hands on the steering wheel.;
, You must give the officer your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance.If you keep them in a glove compartment, then tell the officer: “They’re in the glove compartment. Can I get them?”

, You have a right to remain silent, and you should exercise that right.However, the officer will still try to get you to answer questions. Typically, the officer will ask:


When did you last drink? You can say, “I don’t remember” or “I don’t want to answer that.” You might feel uncomfortable not answering, but remember that it is your right not to.
How much have you had to drink? Always answer “I don’t want to answer that.” Speak crisply and don’t slur your speech.
Where are you headed? If you’re headed home, you can say that.

, It is critical that you be respectful.If you are rude, then the officer might prolong the stop. You should always call the officer “Ma’am,” “Sir,” or “Officer.”


Also don’t try to speak over the officer. If he or she has something to say, then quietly listen.
You may be angry or nervous, but it is important to remain calm. If you aren’t calm, then it will be hard to stay polite. Take a deep breath if you need to and hold it for several seconds. Then release the air.

, The officer might want to search your car or belongings. You should decline. The officer is only looking for evidence that helps them build a case against you. Any evidence they find can be used later in court.


In order to search your car without permission, the officer generally needs probable cause that your vehicle contains evidence of a crime. However, the officer can also search if evidence of a crime (such as an open beer can) is in plain sight.Realize that the officer is asking for your consent because they don’t have probable cause and no evidence is in plain view. Instead, they hope you consent so that you can make their job easier for them.
You should say, “No, Officer, I don’t consent to a search.”

, The officer might ask you to step out of the car. If so, then you should comply. The officer might also ask that you stop smoking or turn your music off. You should always follow the officer’s instructions.If you get out of the car, remember not to lean against it. The officer might assume you are unsteady because you are intoxicated.

, These tests are designed to test your coordination. For example, the officer might ask you to stand on one foot or to walk in a straight line. However, many people lack coordination even when sober, so taking the test is probably not a good idea. Instead, you should refuse.You can say, “I’m going to decline, Sir, since they’re voluntary and too subjective.”The officer might claim that you should take the test so that he or she can let you go if you pass. In reality, the officer can’t keep you indefinitely without probable cause that you are drunk driving or committed another crime. The officer wants you to take the test in hopes that you fail, not that you pass.

, There are really two breath tests in California: a test before you are arrested and a test after you are arrested.The purpose of the first test is to build a case against you so that you can be arrested. You don’t have to take the preliminary alcohol screening test (PAS) unless the following applies:


You are under age 21. You can’t refuse a PAS if you are.
You are on probation for a DUI.

, There is generally little to gain by taking a PAS. If your BAC is 0.08% or higher, then the officer has probable cause to arrest you. However, even if you score below 0.08%, the officer can still arrest you if they think your driving has been impaired.


Generally, there is no real reason to take the roadside test unless you are absolutely sure you haven’t been drinking. Even then you probably shouldn’t take it, since the results could be tampered with.
If the officer asks why you are refusing, then say, “I know the test is voluntary and it is highly inaccurate.”

, If you’ve refused to answer questions and refused to take tests, then the officer has to either arrest you or let you go if they don’t have probable cause. Don’t just turn on the car and start driving away. Instead ask, “Can I leave now?”The officer might try to keep you by asking you more questions or waving a flashlight in your face.
Continue to refuse to answer any questions. Instead, answer a question by saying, “I’m not going to answer that. Can I leave?”

, If you get arrested, then you are required to take either a breath test or a blood test. You should be given a choice between the two, and you should take the breath test, because they are less reliable.


If you go to trial, you can argue that the breath test results are not valid.By contrast, a blood test is far more accurate. You can help build your defense by taking the breath test.
You gave implied consent to take a test after arrest when you got your driver’s license. If you continue to refuse, then your license will be suspended., You should continue to remain silent throughout the entire arrest and the time at the police station. However, you should also say, “I want an attorney” after you are arrested.


At the station, you will be booked. You may be able to call an attorney after the booking.

, You should look for someone who handles many DUI cases. This person will understand what kinds of defenses you can bring.An attorney who has a general practice might be an excellent attorney, but he or she will need extra time to get up-to-speed on the science of DUI cases.


You can ask friends or family if they have been arrested for DUI before. If they have, then ask if they would recommend their attorney.You can also contact the California Bar Association at 866-442-2529. They have information on referral networks you can contact to get a referral to an attorney.
Also look in the phone book. DUI attorneys often advertise in the Yellow Pages.

, Once you have a list, you should go down through and perform background research on each attorney. Look for any reason the attorney might not be qualified to represent you.


Check the lawyer’s practice experience by looking at the website. Check that he or she handles DUI cases as a large part of their practice. If not, then move on.
Look to see if the lawyer has been disciplined for an ethics breach. Each state has a board that investigates ethics complaints. In California, you can do an attorney search at the state bar’s website.Also read any online reviews. You can find these by doing a general Internet search.

, You should remove any unqualified attorneys from your list. Then you should call and schedule a consultation with those remaining on the list. Consultations usually last 15-30 minutes.Often, DUI attorneys provide consultations for free. If not, be sure to ask how much the attorney charges.


Check what information you need to bring to your consultation. For example, the attorney might want to see your bail papers, the police report, and any court document.You should also write down your memories of the police stop. Write down what the officer said and did, and what you said and did in return.

, At the consultation, the lawyer will ask you questions to get a feel for your case. You should answer honestly. Anything you say in your consultation is a client confidence which the lawyer can’t tell anyone else., You definitely want to know how much the lawyer charges.Unfortunately, they don’t publish this information on the Internet, so you might find out you’re talking to someone whose fee you absolutely cannot afford. Ask the following questions about fees:


What is the lawyer’s hourly fee?
Can you get a fixed-fee arrangement instead? This is a set amount of money you pay regardless of how much work the lawyer does.
What is the lawyer’s estimate for how much it will cost to defend you? The lawyer can’t make promises, but you can ask for a ballpark figure.

, To help you understand what will happen in your case, you should have the lawyer describe your case’s strengths and weaknesses. Also ask the following:


What is the likely outcome?
What options do you have? For example, could you get a plea deal?
What kind of community service or jail time are you looking at if you take a plea?
Does the lawyer think you could win at trial?

, Go through your notes and analyze each lawyer you met with. Compare them to each other. Did you feel comfortable with one lawyer more than the others? Did one lawyer explain things in a way you could understand? If so, then you should probably go with that lawyer.Call him or her up and say you want to hire them. They should send you an “engagement letter” or “fee agreement.” Read this closely and make sure you agree with everything in it. Raise any objections with the lawyer.
If you didn’t feel comfortable with any of the lawyers you met with, then you should get more referrals.

You should also remain silent after the police arrest you. Anything you say can and will be used against you. If the police ask you questions, say, “I don’t want to answer that.”


For example, if you admit to drinking some beers, then you can expect the prosecutor to use that statement in a trial.
The more you talk, the more a police officer can recognize slurred speech, which is a sign of drunkenness.
Once arrested, tell the police, “I want a lawyer. I don’t want to talk to you.”;
, As soon as possible, you should sit down and write out what you remember about the arrest. Be sure to write down the following, which could help you in your DUI defense:What was the weather like? You might be able to claim that you were driving poorly because of the overcast weather.
Did the officer tell you why you were stopped?
Were you read your rights after arrest?
What did the officer say, and what did you say? Try to remember specifically what you might have said.
Who was with you as a passenger in the car?
What tests did you take? A field sobriety test? A breath test? Blood test? Did the officer watch you for 15 minutes before administering a test, as is required by law?, You should receive a notice, probably in the mail, informing you of when you should show up to court. You may also receive this notice from the police officer directly., At your arraignment, you will need to plead “not guilty” to the DUI. The judge will then consider whether or not you will receive bail. Bail is a set amount of money you pay to secure your release until trial. If you attend all hearings and satisfy other conditions of your release, then the money will be refunded to you at the end of the case.


You must also fulfill certain other conditions of release, such as wear an ankle monitor or have an ignition interlock device placed on your car.If this is your first arrest for DUI, then you probably won’t have to pay bail. There probably also won’t be any electronic home monitoring.

, You might not know any attorney who can represent you. Accordingly, you will need to get referrals. You can find DUI attorneys in the following places:


The Yellow Pages. Attorneys still advertise in the phone book. Check to see if the attorney states they practice DUI defense.
Another attorney. If you used an attorney to draft a will, then call him or her up and ask for a referral to a DUI attorney.
Your county bar association. You can find links to each county’s bar association at the Washington State Bar Association website.Public defender. If your income is low enough, you may qualify for a public defender depending on the punishment you face. You can ask the judge at your arraignment if this is an option. You will need to fill out some financial forms.

, If you are looking to hire a private lawyer (instead of a public defender), then you should do some background research on the lawyer. Search online and check the following:The lawyer’s website. Most should have a website. Check to see how professional it is, and also what kinds of DUI or criminal law experience they have.
Client reviews. Many websites, such as Avvo, have client reviews. Look to see what former clients have said (with full knowledge that unhappy clients are more motivated to leave reviews).
Disciplinary history. You can check a lawyer’s disciplinary history by visiting the Washington State Bar Association and performing a Discipline Notice Search. Enter the lawyer’s name and click “Search.”, Call up any attorneys who interest you and ask to schedule a consultation. Also ask for the price. Many DUI attorneys offer free consultations.Ask what you should bring to your consultation. Generally, an attorney will want to see your bail papers, criminal citation, and other criminal history records.

, The lawyer should ask relevant questions that help him or her analyze your case and decide on the best course of action. For example, the lawyer will want to know the following:


Whether you have prior DUI convictions or other criminal convictions. If so, the date of those convictions.
Whether you have a professional license (such as nursing license) that could be impacted by a DUI conviction.
Whether you can get other evidence necessary to make a strong defense.

, DUI lawyers can generally charge anywhere between $2,500 and $25,000, depending on the case’s complexity.You should talk about how much the lawyer charges. Also ask these questions:


Does the lawyer only charge on an hourly basis, or does he or she also offer fixed-fee agreements?
Who else might work on the case in the firm? Does the lawyer bill for their time too?
What kind of payment plans does the attorney offer? Can you pay in monthly installments? With a credit card?

, If you felt comfortable talking to the lawyer and his or her fee was acceptable, then you should hire them. The lawyer will give you a fee agreement to sign.Read it over and make sure you agree with everything written in the agreement. This is your contract with the lawyer.


If you didn’t quite feel comfortable with the first attorney, then get more referrals.

, Although you want to beat the DUI charge, you should at least discuss the possibility of a plea deal with your lawyer. If this is your first DUI and the evidence against you is strong, then you might be better off taking a plea deal. You should talk this over with your lawyer.

, You can get the case thrown out if you can show the officer did not legally stop you. This might be the easiest way to win your case. In order to stop you, police must have a “reasonable suspicion” that you have committed a crime.This is not a difficult standard if the officer can point to any kind of driving infraction, such as having a burned out headlight, speeding, weaving in and out of lanes, or running a red light. However, you can challenge whether or not you really were speeding, for example, by having witnesses testify that you were driving under the speed limit.

, The officer might have given you a field sobriety test, which may have involved you touching your nose, standing on one foot, or walking in a straight line. These types of tests are not reliable, and you should identify other factors which might have caused you to fail the test:You’re overweight or have a physical disability. It should be no surprise if you couldn’t stand on one foot.
The weather conditions were bad. If it was icy out, then you might have slipped while walking in a straight line.
Your footwear was unstable.
You generally lack coordination. Some people are naturally clumsy, especially when nervous.

, If your BAC is 0.08 or above, then you have an uphill climb defending yourself. However, you can point to well-known defects in breathalyzers. For example, you could raise the following objections:The breath test machine was not properly maintained. For example, it might not have been calibrated in a while.
The machine malfunctioned. In Washington, your test results will be presumed inaccurate if the BAC machine malfunctioned within a certain amount of time before or after your breath test.The officer used the machine wrong. For example, he or she might not have been trained in properly using the machine.
You had just used mouthwash or other hygiene products which can trigger a high BAC.

, Many different medical conditions can cause an officer to believe you are intoxicated when you are not. You should look through your medical history and see if any of the following apply:Diabetes. Diabetes can make you appear intoxicated because you are shaking, disorientated, and have slurred speech. Also, the breath test might be inaccurate. The breath test doesn’t measure alcohol in your breath. Instead, it measures how much light is absorbed by different chemicals, including acetone. Diabetics produce elevated amounts of acetone.
Acid reflux. A breath test is intended to measure the alcohol content in your deep lungs. However, if you have acid reflux, then the test might be measuring the alcohol in stomach acid that has backed up.
Dentures. Your dentures, braces, or crowns can trap alcohol and release it back out when you take a breath test.

, Instead of taking a breath test, you might have given a blood sample to be tested for alcohol content. Blood tests are more accurate than breath tests. However, you can still challenge their accuracy by pointing to certain flaws:The person who analyzed your blood was unlicensed or hadn’t been trained properly.
The equipment used to analyze your blood was outdated.
There was a breakdown in the chain of custody. For example, the blood drawn from you might have become mixed-up with someone else’s blood. Your attorney can analyze the chain of custody.

, One thing prosecutors in Washington fear is that you are an alcoholic who will drink and drive again if they give you a break. For this reason, you need proof that you don’t have a problem with alcohol or drugs. You can get an alcohol evaluation done at a treatment agency.You might even take classes or undergo a treatment program, if necessary. You should be proactive fulfilling all requirements.

, Your defense would be stronger if you can get copies of video that show you were not behaving in an intoxicated manner when arrested. For example, both the police car and the booking room may have video.Your lawyer will be able to request copies of video.

, Your lawyer will be able to request copies of certain documents to help you plan your defense. Based on the particular facts of your case, your lawyer might request the following:


Information on the officer’s certification to administer a breath test. Your lawyer might also request information about the officer’s disciplinary history.
Your medical records, if you think a medical condition led to an inaccurate test result.
The arrest report and any video.

, You should look your best when you attend your hearing because you are being judged first on appearances. Court is a conservative place so dress accordingly.


Your lawyer will handle the hearing. All you will possibly have to do is testify.
If for some reason you chose not to have a lawyer, then you should sit in on a DUI trial, if possible, to see what happens. Call the court clerk and ask when a hearing is being held so that you can observe it.

, The state has the burden of showing that you were driving under the influence. Accordingly, the state has to put on evidence first. You can expect the state to call the arresting officer, as well as a BAC technician and a representative of the state’s Toxicologist’s Office.Your lawyer gets to cross-examine all of these witnesses.


For example, your lawyer might challenge the officer’s knowledge of the breath test and training to administer it.

, You have a Constitutional right not to testify. However, you might benefit if you do. Talk it over with your lawyer. Ultimately, it is your decision whether or not to testify.You might testify if you were the only person with knowledge of the police stop. For example, you might have been driving alone. If the officer lied on the stand and said you were speeding, then you might be the only person who can testify that you weren’t.
However, if you had a passenger with you, then they could testify to everything that happened during the police stop. In that case, you won’t be harmed if you don’t testify.

, After hearing all of the evidence, the judge or jury will deliver a “guilty” or “not guilty” verdict.The jury will not explain their reasoning, so you won’t know what evidence they found persuasive or not.


If you are convicted, you should talk with your lawyer about an appeal. With an appeal, you ask a higher court to review the trial transcripts. If the judge made a serious error, you can sometimes get the verdict set aside.

, Your punishment, if convicted, may consist of time in jail and fines. However, the judge might also order community service or alcohol treatment programs. If you want to get your license back, then you must follow the judge's orders.

Having these available and ready to hand over makes you look prepared and saves valuable time.Gathering and ordering your paperwork can give you a moment to calm yourself. Rather than digging through your glove compartment in frustration, take it slow and consciously look at each document until you find what you're looking for.
Use the time it takes the officer to walk from the patrol car to your window to calm yourself. Take a few deep breaths and stretch or roll your shoulders.
However, it's not a good idea to eat or drink. The officer may think you're trying to interfere with a breath test or disguise the smell of alcohol on your breath.;
, No matter what, it's important to be polite to the officer. This goes for you and any passengers in your car as well. As much as you may be upset that you got pulled over, avoid making smart comments or taking an attitude with the officer.When you speak to the officer, call them ""officer"" or use ""sir"" or ""ma'am."" Don't forget ""please"" and ""thank you"" where appropriate.
Even if you're refusing something, you can still do this politely. For example, you might say ""I don't have any comment on that, ma'am"" or ""I'd prefer not to go into that, sir.""
Look the officer in the eye when you are speaking to them, and speak in a loud, clear voice. It's possible that you're being recorded, so you want your words to be understood.

, You have the right to remain silent, and there are some requests that you can refuse as a matter of protecting your rights. However, the officer does have the right to ask you.There are some things that you don't have the right to refuse. For example, if the officer asks you to get out of your car, you don't have the right to say ""no.""
Asking the officer why they're asking you to do something or getting testy about it is just delaying the inevitable. You also may give the officer reason to tack on a charge of resisting arrest.
You do have the right to ask why the officer pulled you over. However, once you have this information, it's generally a bad idea to disagree with the officer or try to argue with them about it. Just say ""thank you"" and let it go.

, Generally, you should keep your hands where the officer can see them. If the officer believes that you are going for a weapon or trying to flee the scene, you could end up in a lot more trouble.If you need to reach for something, such as paperwork in the glovebox, tell the officer what you're going to do and ask them for permission to do it.
If you do have a licensed firearm in your vehicle, let the officer know as soon as possible – while keeping both hands visible.
Based on this information, the officer may ask you to get out of the car. You don't have the right to refuse this request.

, The officer is paying attention to your passengers as well as to you. When you get pulled over, urge your passengers to sit still, remain calm, and not say anything to the officer unless they are directly asked a question.Actions from your passengers can reflect badly on you. If someone else in your car is acting unruly or appears extremely drunk, the officer has all the more reason to suspect you of drinking.
Make sure your passengers understand that they can't help you in this situation – they can only hurt your case. They need to let you handle things on your own.

, In Georgia, you have the right to refuse field sobriety tests – such as walking a straight line or standing on one foot – as well as roadside breath tests. You cannot be punished for refusing these tests, but you may get taken to the police station.At the same time, you should tell the officer that you are willing to take a blood test. The officer must take you to the nearest hospital to get a test immediately.
At the hospital, you should request a test of the whole blood. This is the most accurate blood-alcohol content test you can get.
Field sobriety tests are subjective, and roadside breath tests can be unreliable. Either of these could put you in a situation of getting arrested for a DUI where you wouldn't have been arrested if you'd had a blood test.

, Once you're arrested (and even before), you don't have to say a thing to the officer. Even what seems like casual, friendly conversation can end up with you saying something you later regret.Officers know this, and they'll probably try to engage you in casual banter, such as talking about the weather or a recent game.
Even if it seems innocent, you probably are being recorded – especially if you are in the police car. If you don't say anything and don't engage in conversation, you can't possibly say anything that could hurt your defense later.
If you don't feel comfortable just sitting there silently, you can let the officer know what you're doing. For example, you might say ""No disrespect, sir, but I'm invoking my right to remain silent until I have the opportunity to talk to my attorney."" The officer will understand.

, If you have a smart phone, you may want to make a video or audio recording of the stop. You're perfectly within your rights to do so, and it can prove beneficial to your defense later on.It can be difficult to get a full copy of the police report and any video taken as a defendant in Georgia.
Some counties will give you these materials if you ask, but in others you have to wait for your attorney to make discovery requests before trial.
Recording the arrest gives you video of your own to work from. This can be helpful, considering that you may have difficulty remembering various details – especially if you ended up having to spend the night in jail.

, Even if you are arrested for a DUI, the officer does not have probable cause to search your vehicle based on that fact alone. However, officers often will ask if they can look in your car to see if you'll consent to the search.The officer can look around to see if there is any evidence of a crime – such as empty beer bottles or an open liquor bottle – in plain sight.
However, they can't look in the trunk, glovebox, or anywhere else without your permission.
Typically, the officer is not going to get a warrant to search your car – even if they threaten to do so. They're just asking to see if you'll agree.

, Soon after you're arrested, you must appear at arraignment. A judge will read the charges against you and remind you of your constitutional rights. You must indicate that you understand, and then state how you plead.Before your arraignment, use your phone call to connect with someone who is capable of making your bond and bailing you out of jail. You typically don't need an attorney at arraignment, because you're just going to plead ""not guilty.""
After you enter your plea, the judge will address bail and let you know when you're supposed to be in court next.
The prosecuting attorney may try to talk to you before your arraignment or offer you a plea deal. Don't take it.
You need time to evaluate the evidence against you and talk to an attorney about the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution's case before you make that kind of decision.

, In Georgia, you only have a few days after your arrest to request a license review hearing, or your license will be automatically suspended. This typically is one of the first deadlines you need to meet.To request a hearing, you must send what's known as a ""10-Day Letter"" along with a $150 filing fee. The letter got its name because it must be sent within 10 days of the date you were arrested.
You will be granted a hearing in which you will be given an opportunity to fight to keep your license until your trial is held.
Keep in mind if you're convicted of a DUI, your license will be suspended. This hearing only addresses whether you can continue to drive while you're awaiting trial.

, Friends and family can be the source of the strongest possibilities for you when you're looking for an attorney, because they have familiarity with you and your situation.You also might ask attorneys you know for recommendations. Even if an attorney practices in another area of the law, they tend to know other attorneys and can be good resources.
At the same time, keep in mind that just because an attorney was great for a friend or family member doesn't mean they're going to be great for you.
Ideally, you want to find a DUI specialist who has practiced in the city or county where you were arrested for a number of years.
That attorney knows Georgia's DUI laws well and is familiar with the courts, judges, and prosecutors that will be working on your case.

, The Georgia Bar Association's website is a good place to start your online search for an experienced criminal defense attorney in your area. From the state bar's website, you can find links to all the city and county bar associations.Many city and county bar associations have attorney referral programs. After answering a few questions, the program will connect you with attorneys in your area who are licensed and in good standing.
Apart from the public defender program, city and county bar associations often have additional resources that can help you find free or reduced-cost legal assistance if you have limited income.
Both state and local bar associations also have searchable directories where you can look up attorneys' professional and disciplinary records.

, If you live in a relatively rural area, you may not have many options. However, in general it's a good idea to schedule initial consultations with several attorneys so you can compare them and find the best fit for you.Most criminal defense attorneys will offer a free initial consultation, so interviewing several attorneys won't cost you anything but time.
However, you need to hire an attorney quickly so you can get your 10-Day Letter out, so don't put off scheduling these meetings.
Generally, if an attorney can't meet with you within a week of the day you call, they're probably too busy to devote appropriate attention to your case.
Make a list of questions to ask attorneys during the interviews. keep in mind that since the first consultation is free, it's often designed more as a sales pitch to get you to hire that attorney.

, Before your chosen attorney starts working for you, make sure you've signed an agreement that details the work they will do for you and how much they'll be paid. Typically you'll have a meeting at the attorney's office to go over this agreement.Expect the attorney to give you time to read the agreement and to explain each section in detail. If there's anything you don't understand, ask the attorney for clarification.
If there's anything you don't agree with, speak up. Even though it may not be presented this way, retainer agreements generally are negotiable.
When you're satisfied with the agreement, sign it and have the attorney make a copy for your records. Then you're ready to begin planning your defense.

Pay monthly fees as required.",How to Get an MDDP After a First DUI Offense in Illinois," You will receive a notice from the SOS office when your statutory summary suspension period begins. This notice lets you know how long your license will be suspended.The notice also will include information about getting an MDDP. However, keep in mind that this information is sent to everyone convicted of a DUI.
Just because you receive information about getting an MDDP does not mean you are eligible for an MDDP.
If you aren't eligible for an MDDP, you may be eligible for another form of restricted permit that allows you to drive when necessary for work or school, or only within a certain area or for short distances.;
, You are only eligible for an MDDP if you are a first-time offender. However, the phrase ""first-time offender"" can be confusing, because it is possible to qualify for an MDDP even if you've previously been convicted of a DUI.In Illinois, anyone who has not been convicted of a DUI within the past five years is considered a first-time offender. This includes convictions in another state.
Thus, if you were convicted of a DUI seven years ago, you still may be considered a first-time offender for purposes of qualifying for an MDDP. This does not apply if you've ever been convicted of reckless homicide or a DUI that resulted in someone's death.
However, not all first-time offenders qualify for an MDDP. Your license must otherwise be valid, without any other serious traffic citations within that five-year period.
If you're not sure whether you qualify, you can look at your criminal and driving records to determine whether you are eligible. Consult an attorney if you're still not sure.

, Even if you are a first-time offender, you may not be eligible for an MDDP depending on the circumstances surrounding your DUI arrest. If you got a DUI as a result of your involvement in a collision with another car, you may be ineligible for an MDDP.Illinois does not give MDDPs to offenders whose DUI came out of a car accident that resulted in death or serious injury as the result of an accident.
If you received your DUI as the result of your involvement in an accident, you may want to talk to an attorney about whether you qualify for an MDDP.

, Generally, you cannot drive a commercial vehicle with an MDDP. However, Illinois allows an exemption if you drive an employer-owned vehicle during work hours.The employer-owned vehicle cannot be issued to you, and will not be fitted with a breath-alcohol device.
You don't qualify for this exemption if you are self-employed or work at a business owned by a family member.

, You must complete an evaluation and educational courses to have your license reinstated after the statutory summary suspension period is over.If the evaluation reveals that you have a problem with drugs or alcohol, you may be required to complete a treatment program before your license will be reinstated.
Getting an MDDP is not the same as getting your license reinstated. However, the state still may request proof that you have been evaluated and are seeking treatment if necessary.

, Sometime during the first month of your statutory summary suspension period, you'll get an application for the MDDP in the mail from the SOS office. Typically this also is included with the initial notice you received when your statutory summary suspension period began.If you don't have that notice or if you've lost the application that was sent to you, go to the SOS office nearest you and request a copy of the application.
You can locate the nearest SOS office by using the facility finder on the SOS office's website.
You also can download a PDF copy of the application from the SOS office's website. You can print this application and mail it in just as you would the application that was originally sent to you. You cannot apply for an MDDP directly online.

, The initial MDDP application is a single-page form that asks for basic information about you, including your name, address, and phone number. You also must provide your driver's license number.If you want to apply for an employment exemption, you must include the name and contact information for your employer.
The SOS will contact your employer to verify the information and talk to them about the suspension of your license and the need for you to drive an employer-owned car.
The address to which you must mail your application is included at the bottom of the form. Make a copy of your completed application for your records before you mail it.

, Within 48 hours after your application is received by the SOS office, you'll be sent a requirements package in the mail that outlines everything else you must do to be issued an MDDP.You may have to submit additional information or documentation at this time. Make a copy of anything you send to the SOS office so you have a complete record of everything you've submitted to them.
To get an MDDP, you must pay a $30 per month monitoring fee. This fee as well as an $8 fee to print your permit must be paid to the SOS before your permit will be issued.
The amount of your fees will vary depending on how long your MDDP lasts. All monitoring fees must be paid in full up front. For example, if you have an MDDP for six months, you would have to pay $180 in monitoring fees plus the $8 printing fee.
Pay your fees using a cashier's check or money order made payable to the Illinois Secretary of State. Make a copy of your check before you mail it to the SOS office.

, Once the SOS receives your requirements package, it takes between seven and 10 days to process your application and issue your MDDP. During that time, the SOS office will review your application materials and the court order in your case.When your application has been processed, you'll get a notification from the SOS office in the mail. This notification will let you know if your application has been approved.
You also will receive a copy of the terms and conditions for your MDDP. This form must be signed before your MDDP will be issued.
Make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully and understand them before you sign the form.
Your permit won't be sent to you until you are within two weeks or less of the 31st day of your statutory summary suspension. The permit does not go into effect until that 31st day.

, Once you receive your MDDP, it is your responsibility to contact an approved vendor and have a BAIID installed in your car. The SOS office will provide you with a list of approved vendors.Which vendor you choose is up to you. You're free to shop around to find the vendor closest to you or with the lowest installation fees.
You only have 14 days from the date your MDDP goes into effect to have a BAIID installed. You cannot drive your vehicle, even with an MDDP, until the device is installed.
However, during that initial 14-day period, you are allowed to drive your car to the installation site using your MDDP.
If you cannot complete installation during the initial 14-day period, call the SOS office's BAIID Division at (217) 524-0660 to request an extension.
Keep in mind that if you get an extension, you are no longer allowed to drive your car to the installation site.

, You must blow in your BAIID before you start your car, as well as submit random breath tests while driving. Anyone else who drives your car also must submit breath tests through your BAIID.If someone else is driving your car, make sure they understand how to operate the BAIID before they get in the driver's seat.
Keep in mind that if you or anyone else tries to start the car before using the BAIID, it will register as an attempt to circumvent the device and you will have to explain what happened to the SOS office. Too many such attempts can result in loss of your permit.
When you use the device, it will take a photo of you breathing into the device. This provides evidence that you weren't attempting to circumvent the device.
If the device signals the need for a random breath test while driving, you should pull over to a safe place to provide your breath sample, rather than trying to do it while the car is in motion.

, The data from your BAIID will be sent to the SOS office, in 60-day increments. If a violation is reported, you will be sent a notice from the SOS office and given an opportunity to explain the violation.You are responsible for taking your BAIID to the vendor every 60 days so the data can be monitored.
If your BAIID registers a reading of 0.025 or higher, your car will not start. If the reading is 0.05 or higher, your car will not start for 24 hours.
Any time you get a notice from the SOS office that a violation has been reported by your BAIID, respond with a complete and truthful explanation as quickly as possible.
If you violate the BAIID program, the SOS office may extend your MDDP time (meaning you have to wait longer before you can get your license reinstated in full), or may revoke your permit and reinstate your suspension.

, Your continued enrollment in the BAIID program depends not just on whether you consume alcohol while driving. Any traffic citation issued while you have an MDDP can result in your permit time being extended.More serious traffic offenses, or repeat traffic offenses, may result in your MDDP being revoked.
If your MDDP is revoked, you will not be able to drive at all until the statutory summary suspension period is over and you've successfully applied for reinstatement of your driving privileges.

, While fees vary greatly among vendors, you can expect to pay around $85 for BAIID installation and an additional $80 a month to rent the BAIID. If you have extremely limited income and assets, some of these fees may be waived.To find out if you qualify for a fee waiver, ask the SOS office for an indigency application. If the court declares you indigent, they will waive some, but not all, of the fees involved in the BAIID program.
The frequency and method of payment of monthly fees vary among vendors. Some vendors may accept monthly payments, while others require advance payment of all fees before your device is installed.

Hire the lawyer.",How to Behave when Stopped for DUI," You might be stopped at a DUI checkpoint, which the police set up at various points to screen drivers coming through. However, if you are driving and suddenly see lights in your rearview mirror, you should pull over to the side of the road at the first opportunity.After pulling over, turn off the car. Don’t get out. Instead, stay in the car and roll down the window.You can turn your inside light on (if stopped at night) and sit with your hands on the steering wheel as the officer approaches.;
, As the officer approaches your car, he or she doesn’t know what to expect. Accordingly, the officer might be anxious. It is in your best interest to always remain calm throughout the encounter.








If you feel anxious, take a deep breath and hold it for two seconds. Then slowly release.
If you have passengers in the car, tell them to remain calm as well.

, The officer wants to see your license and registration, so have those handy.If you store them in the glove compartment box, then ask the officer if you can get them.









Don’t make a sudden movement or start reaching for something without getting the officer’s permission. The officer might think you are trying to hide something and might decide to search your car for that reason.

, You also need to avoid verbal aggression. Even if you think the officer has stopped you unfairly, you should always be polite.Call the officer “Sir,” “Ma’am,” or “Officer.”


Also remember to speak in short sentences, so that you don’t slur your speech.Slurred speech is a sign of drunkenness.

, The officer might tell you to get out of the vehicle. You should comply.There is no reason getting angry or asking the officer “What for?” These actions only increase the tension.









Get out of the car slowly. Remember to avoid sudden movements.
You should also avoid leaning on the car. This might make you look drunk. Instead, get out and stand comfortably with your hands visible.

, The officer might ask you to do certain things, like stand on one foot or walk in a straight line. These are part of a field sobriety test. In many states, they are voluntary. You should ask the officer if it is voluntary and refuse to take the test if it is.









You should also refuse any eye test the officer might want to give you. Drivers are rarely helped by these tests., The officer will probably ask you to take a breathalyzer test. This test measures the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Each state has set a minimum BAC which qualifies as being legally intoxicated. You should consider whether you want to take the test.The officer can’t force you to take the test. However, every state has “implied consent” laws. This means that you consent to take the test as a condition for getting a license.
If you refuse, then the state can punish you. For example, it might suspend your license or send you to jail.You might also be prosecuted for a misdemeanor for refusing to take the test.
Also, refusing to take the test doesn’t mean you won’t get arrested. In some states, the officer can arrest you simply for refusing to take the test.Nevertheless, refusing to take the test might be in your best interest in limited situations. For example, if you already have a DUI on your record, then getting a second could cause you to lose your license. In this situation, you might want to refuse to take the breathalyzer if you know you have been drinking.

, Many police cars are equipped with video cameras. Nevertheless, many officers don’t turn them on during a stop. You should ask the officer if the camera is on.You can politely ask the officer to turn on the camera if you think it would help your case. For example, you may be sober and want the camera to record your movements. You could then introduce the video later at a trial.

, You shouldn’t leave without the officer’s permission. If you took a breathalyzer and had a reading below the minimum, then the officer should let you go.Even if you refuse a breathalyzer, the officer can’t keep you indefinitely.


Ask the officer if you can leave: “Can I go now?”
If the officer doesn’t let you leave, continue to ask: “May I leave now?”

, You generally have to identify your name and address, although your license should contain that information. You have no legal obligation to answer the officer’s questions. Although you might feel talkative because you are anxious, you should resist the urge to talk.Any statement you make can be used against you later.


The officer might ask where you are going. If you are going home, then you can say so.
If the officer asks how much you have had drinking, you should either say, “I don’t remember the exact number” or say, “I don’t want to answer that.”Never guess how many beers you’ve had.
Some people feel awkward saying flat-out “I don’t want to answer that.” In that situation, you can respond to a question by asking a question of your own. For example, you could respond to a question about how much you were drinking by asking, “Do you want to see my insurance card?”, The officer might want to search your possessions or your car. Under the law, the officer generally must have probable cause that you committed a crime in order to search your car. Because the officer might not have probable cause, they often ask for your consent instead. You should not consent.


If you consent, it doesn’t matter if there wasn’t probable cause to search your vehicle, and you won’t be able to exclude any evidence found inside.
The officer might begin poking a flashlight in your face or in your car. Some of these flashlights have alcohol sensors, and the officer is trying to pick up whether there is alcohol on your breath or in your car. You can politely ask the officer to stop poking with the flashlight., Once arrested, you should continue to remain silent. If the officers start asking you questions, state that you want to speak to a lawyer and then remain silent.


You may be released from police custody after posting “bail.” Bail is a set amount of money which secures your release. You pay the money into the court and agree to attend all court hearings. If you fulfill your obligations, then the money is refunded to you at the end of your case.
Many states have specific, fixed bail amounts for a DUI. However, if your state doesn’t, then you may be held in custody until you appear before a judge for an arraignment. In this situation, you can call a friend or family member to get a lawyer for you.
You may also ask the judge for a lawyer when you appear before the court for your arraignment or initial appearance.

, You shouldn’t hire the first DUI attorney who you see advertising on television. Instead, you should gather a list of referrals. You can find referrals from a variety of sources:


Another lawyer. You might have used a lawyer when buying a house or writing a will. Ask him or her to recommend a DUI lawyer.
Friends or family. If you know people who have been arrested for DUI, then you can ask them if they would recommend their lawyer.
The phone book. Lawyers still advertise in the Yellow Pages. Look for someone who advertises that they practice DUI law as a specialty.Your local or state bar association. Bar associations are organizations of attorneys. They often provide referrals or can tell you how to get one.

, You might have several referrals. In this situation, you should do some basic research to narrow down your list. You should look for the following information:Disciplinary history. Each state has a board that reviews ethics complaints. At the board’s website, you can typically search the lawyer’s name and check to see if he or she has been disciplined.
Online reviews. A general Internet search should uncover any online reviews. Take them with a grain of salt, but look for complaints that crop up in multiple reviews.
The lawyer’s website. Check to see that the lawyer specializes in (or has extensive experience with) DUI cases. Also judge how professional the website appears.

, You should rank the lawyers from top to bottom, based on their experience and any reviews. Start at the top of the list and call up the lawyer. Ask to schedule a consultation. After meeting with the first lawyer on your list, schedule a consultation with the next.


Many DUI lawyers offer free consultations.At a consultation, you can discuss your case and ask the lawyer questions. It is a good way to feel out whether you are comfortable with the lawyer and whether they know their stuff.
You should avoid a consultation only over the phone. Instead, try to meet in person.

, You can prepare for your consultation by gathering relevant documents and writing down helpful information. The lawyer can then review this information at the consultation. For example, pull together the following:


Your traffic ticket or citation.
Your memories. Write down what you remember about the encounter and arrest.Information on prior DUIs or other criminal convictions. Your strategy will depend on whether this is your first DUI or a second.

, You should let the lawyer take the lead during the consultation. He or she knows what information is most important. However, there should be time at the end for questions. You should think about asking the following:How many DUI trials have they done recently?
What were the results of the DUI trials?
How likely is a plea deal? If this is your first offense, then there might not be much wriggle room for a plea.
Will only the lawyer work on your case or will other lawyers in the firm help?

, Costs are a big concern. You shouldn’t immediately hire the cheapest attorney. However, you should certainly comparison shop. Ask the lawyer the following questions about fees:


How much is the hourly fee?
Does the lawyer offer a fixed-fee arrangement? In this situation, the lawyer charges a set amount, regardless of how much work they do.
What is the billing rate for others in the firm? Do you get billed for work done by clerks and paralegals?

, You should pick a lawyer you feel comfortable with. Choose one who you could understand and who was focused on understanding you.When you settle on someone, call them up and say you want to hire them.


The lawyer should have you sign a “fee agreement” or “engagement letter.” Read it carefully to confirm you agree with its contents.
If you have a question, call up the lawyer and discuss it. You shouldn’t sign the letter until you agree with everything in it.

Factors influencing BAC include your gender, weight, and what type of alcohol you drink.The calculator can be a useful tool, but don’t rely on it to be completely accurate.

, Medications affect people differently, so make sure that any prescription (or non-prescription) drugs you take won’t impair your ability to drive., Instead of risking a DUI, call a taxi or ask a friend or family member to pick you up if you’re too impaired to drive. The consequences of a DUI conviction far outweigh the cost of a cab ride.

, Every state has laws that govern driving under the influence. There are certain basic DUI elements that you’ll find in these laws, such as:


BAC intoxication levels, some of which can trigger stiffer penalties
the possibility of jail time
fines
the possibility of suspension or restriction of driving privileges., This will enable you to learn the specifics of what constitutes a violation of the law where you live. It will also let you know the possible penalties involved. You can look up the laws for your state here.

, If you’ve been arrested for a DUI, the police will most likely let you know some of the details of your arrest, such as your BAC level. If they don’t tell you immediately, you should have access to this information within a few days. Once you have this available, compare it to what you’ve found in your state’s DUI law, to get a better idea of what you're facing. Knowing this may also influence your decision as to whether or not you want to retain an attorney.

, If a police officer stops you, and believes you may be under the influence, he or she will normally administer tests at the scene of the stop. Try to recall as much about this as you can. The typical tests are:


Nystagmus test. You’ll be asked to shift your eye gaze from one side to another while the officer shines a light in your eyes.
Walk and Turn (WAT) test. The officer will ask you to walk heel-to-toe on a line, while giving you other instructions.
One Leg Stand (OLS) test. You’ll have to stand on one leg for 30 seconds, so the officer can assess balance and coordination.

, If a police officer believes you’re driving under the influence, in all likelihood he or she will want you to take a chemical test. This is usually a breath test, but also could involve a urine or blood sample, depending on the circumstances. All states have laws that require you to take the chemical test (“implied consent” laws). As with the balance tests, try to remember as much as possible., As soon as you can, make written notes of everything the officer may have told you, and any responses you gave, from the time you were stopped until you were released. This includes how well you believe you did on the balance tests, and what you saw or heard during the chemical test. If the officer said or did anything to imply that you may have been stopped for something other than suspected DUI (such as race or gender), the evidence collected may not be admissible in court. This is also true if the officer didn’t read you your rights after you were arrested., Some attorneys advise against taking any of the field sobriety or chemical tests if you think you'll fail. Depending on your state, you may not be obligated to take the field tests or preliminary breath test at the scene of the stop. But be aware of the following:


If you don't take the formal chemical test at the police station or hospital, this could lead to a legal inference that you're guilty, which can be used against you in court.
There are separate penalties for refusing the formal chemical test, such as loss of driving privileges, fines and possibly jail.
You could end up with two convictions: DUI and refusal to take the test., If you have been arrested for DUI, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments.


If you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $1,000 and $5,000. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.
If you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.

, In order to stop a driver, an officer must have “probable cause”, such as erratic driving, for example. If probable cause didn’t exist, the stop could be declared illegal, and the evidence against you may be inadmissible in court.You should also note that some states have outlawed DUI roadblocks or checkpoints. So if this was the reason for your stop, check to see if it's permitted in your state., The officer will need a basis for his or her suspicion that you were under the influence. Usually these are facts such as an odor of an alcoholic beverage, slurred speech, and/or watery or bloodshot eyes. It might help your case if you were able to prove that none of these tell-tale signs existed, or that if they did, there were other, reasonable explanations for them. (Such as using mouthwash or having allergies.), An officer can establish probable cause for the administration of a chemical test, or even an arrest, if you fail the field sobriety tests. It can help your case if you can show that the tests weren’t valid field sobriety tests, or that the results were inaccurate. For example, perhaps you failed the Walk-and-Turn test because of a leg injury., If you can prove that any of the chemical tests were improperly administered, or that the results were compromised, you may be able to exclude the results from a trial.The primary basis for challenging chemical tests (i.e., blood or breath tests) relates to what is called the ""blood alcohol curve."" The blood alcohol curve helps determine what your blood alcohol content is at any given time.To challenge a chemical test, you will generally argue that because of the science behind this curve, your blood alcohol content was lower at the time of the arrest than at the time of your test. You would argue that, at the time of your arrest, your blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but rose above the legal limit while you were being arrested and processed. For more information about the blood alcohol curve look here.

, If you have been arrested for DUI and you are going to trial, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments at trial.


If you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $5,000 and $10,000. Lawyers are usually paid on an hourly basis so your costs may be more or less depending on how much work needs to be done. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.
If you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.

, If you’ve retained a lawyer, he or she will guide you as to what to expect, and how you should act. If you’re representing yourself, consider going to the courtroom where your trial will be held—before your actual trial date. Go inside when a trial is in progress, and pay attention to how the participants conduct themselves. Even though you may not be a lawyer, and even though a judge may give you a little leeway because of this fact, he or she will expect you to obey court rules and regulations., Make sure you have all your witnesses available for your trial date. If an important witness won’t be able to make it, ask the court if you can postpone your case. If you have a lawyer, he or she will review your testimony and your evidence with you in advance. Whether you’re represented by an attorney or not, have your evidence in order, including all documentation and photos you plan to use. You don’t want your case to fall apart because you left a crucial piece of evidence on the dining room table.

, If the prosecutor in your case is willing, consider a plea agreement. In this situation, you’ll plead guilty to an offense other than DUI. For example, the prosecutor may dismiss the DUI charge if you enter a plea of guilty to reckless driving. The benefit is that you avoid a trial, and you don’t have a DUI on your record. There’s no guarantee, however, that a prosecutor will go along with a plea bargain request., If you don’t have an attorney, introduce your evidence, and make your legal arguments, as professionally as possible. If you’ve retained an attorney, listen to his or her advice at all phases of the trial. Whether with an attorney or without one, always conduct yourself properly. Be courteous to the judge, the prosecutor, and any witnesses. The last thing you want to do is alienate a judge or jury by behaving badly. , If you’ve pleaded guilty to DUI, or were found guilty after a trial, the judge may order you to take certain actions, including participating in alcohol rehabilitation or education programs. This is in addition to the penalties imposed. Following through on these orders is required, and failing to do that could lead to more penalties, including not having your driving privileges reinstated, or even jail., If you have a DUI, at some point down the road you may be able to have that conviction removed (expunged) from your criminal record. Not every state allows a DUI conviction to be expunged, and even if it’s removed from any criminal record, it might still remain on your driving history. It’s probably best to consult an attorney to determine if you’re eligible to have your DUI conviction expunged."

Determine whether you were Mirandized.,
Hire a good attorney.,
Disprove the field sobriety test results.,
Present valid reasons for impairment.,
Prove that bad weather hurt your driving.,
Challenge the blood alcohol content results.,
Be respectful in court.",How to Beat a DUI Charge in Illinois,"


Any police officer that arrests you on suspicion of an Illinois DUI must inform you of your Miranda rights. These are the rights to an attorney, remain silent, and others. If you weren’t mirandized at the time of the arrest, anything you said or did and all field sobriety test results could be invalidated and inadmissible in court.;
,

Tests like walking in a straight line or standing on one foot are not valid for obese people or people with physical disabilities or injuries.

,


Erratic driving or weaving in the lane can also be explained by physical impairment or fatigue, conditions that a police officer might not have considered.

,


Bad weather that causes low visibility, such as rain, snow, fog or heavy wind, can be used to explain unusual driving or weaving in the lane.

,


Factors such as improperly working breathalyzer machines, misinterpretation of test samples and preexisting medical conditions can be used to invalidate the blood alcohol content test results.
Breathalyzer machine operators are required to be licensed and to use a machine that works properly. If the operator isn’t license or the machine can be proven faulty, the test results are no longer valid.

Wear protective gear.,
Start on a flat, paved road.,
Use a proper stance.,
Push off the ground with your strong leg.,
Balance both feet on your scooter when you have enough momentum.,
Brake smoothly when needed.,
Rotate the handlebar to turn.,
Exercise safety precautions.",How to Ride a Scooter1," Make sure to put on a bike helmet. Even though you may feel you don't need one, a helmet will keep you safe, especially when learning. It is also advisable to wear knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards to protect you if you fall., Find a long stretch of a flat road, with as few cracks and ruts as possible. This ensures a smooth ride and is easier to learn on. It will require less effort to move yourself forward too., Place your weak leg on the middle of the scooter’s deck. It should be facing straight ahead. Your knee should be bent. Lean forward slightly and grip the handlebars with both hands. Keep your other foot on the ground.Keep the front tube (the front part of the scooter that supports the handlebars) straight at all times while riding unless you're doing a trick that requires otherwise. That's the key to balancing on a scooter.

, While your planted leg is securely in place on the deck and bent at the knee, use your strong leg to push off of the ground. This will propel you forward. As you kick, straighten your planted leg to generate more momentum, then bend it back for your next kick. To kick, use long, powerful strides as opposed to small, quick ones. Make contact with the ground on the ball of your foot and push back almost like you would while running.To glide, keep your kicking foot up, maybe a few inches off the ground, so that you can stabilize yourself in case you start to tip.

, Once you have your balance and have picked up speed, move your kicking foot onto the scooter, behind your other foot. Turn your feet at a ninety degree angle, similar to riding a skateboard. This will help you to travel at speed more aerodynamically., To stop, hit your brake with your back (kicking) foot. Keep your foot there for a few seconds until you come to a complete stop. Press down on the brake gradually so that you don’t stop too quickly. If you only tap the break, you'll stop for a second and keep going.To use handbrakes, simply squeeze on the brakes gradually with your fingers. They will be on your handlebar.
To control your speed, don’t rely on brakes alone. Be sure you aren’t kicking too quickly. You can also drag your kicking foot lightly on the ground to slow down. Make sure you are wearing solid shoes when doing this.

, Take a curve by slowly rotating the handlebar in the direction you wish to turn. If you make a sudden swerve, you may fall., Ride at a safe speed. Be aware of pedestrians, especially in urban areas. Make sure you are always in control of your scooter and able to stop when needed.Don’t go at top speed down a hill, you will likely lose control. When going downhill, keep one foot on the brake and press it lightly as you go down. This will keep you from going too fast or losing control.
Always yield to cars; pull over to the side of the road when you hear a car behind you.
Make sure to obey stop signs and other traffic laws.
If you're going to crash into something, just jump off your scooter. To do this, jump and land so that the scooter's deck is between your feet. Then let go of the handlebars. It's a surefire way to not get hurt in a scooter crash.

Be aware of your scooter’s limitations. The UScooter has a 21-mile range.

, Electric scooters can travel up to 18mph without any kicking required. Make sure to wear a helmet even if you already know how to ride a scooter., Your feet should both be planted on the deck and should not need to leave the deck unless you need to get off of the scooter. Place your feet next to each other, facing straight forward in the middle of the deck.When going at speed, you can angle your feet to the same side for a more aerodynamic stance.

, Press the throttle button with your ride thumb to speed up. Continue to press the throttle to go as fast as you desire., Press the brakes with your left thumb to gradually slow down. Use the foot brake at the back of your scooter as another way of slowing down. Simply press down on the brake by moving one foot towards the back of the scooter and keeping the other one planted in the front., Be sure to make gradual turns or you will fall! Slowly rotate your handlebars to the right or left, depending on which direction you wish to turn., Press your scooter's release button with your foot and fold the scooter in half until it clicks in place.

It will also train you on how to avoid problems and what to do in special or dangerous situations. You can find one at the Motorcycle Safety Foundation or your local DMV.You could even get a discount on insurance by taking a safety course.

, License requirements vary in each state. In general, if your scooter is over 50cc (which most scooters are), you will need a license. It generally entails getting a “motorcycle endorsement” on your regular driver’s license. Go to your local DMV to get this taken care of.To get your license, you will need to take a written test. Your DMV can provide a motorcycle manual for you to study and prepare.
If you don’t have a driver’s license, it can be more difficult to get a motorcycle license. But some states will allow you to get a license strictly for motorcycles. Check with your local DMV.

, Many states require you to register your motor scooter, especially if it is above 50cc. This can also be done at your DVM. You will pay a small fee (around $30) and they will give you your paper registration and license plate., You will likely need basic liability insurance to legally operate your scooter.

, Besides licensing, registration, and insurance, depending on the size of your scooter, there are some places where it will be allowed, and other places where it might not be allowed (such as taking a small scooter on a highway). It is important to know the laws in your area. Since laws vary across each state, make sure to find out your local laws at the DMV., Always wear a full-coverage helmet anytime you go on a motor scooter. This is the most important safety precaution you can take. Be sure that it has a visor to protect your eyes. If it doesn’t, use goggles. Your eyes need to be protected when traveling at high speeds.Protect yourself by fully covering your body. Wear a thick jacket, such as one made of leather, and thick riding pants, which can be leather or a tough synthetic material.
Always wear gloves, even if it is hot out. They will protect your hands and allow you to grip the controls easily.
Wear sturdy boots that cover your ankles, preferable ones made of strong leather. The ankle is a very vulnerable area in case of a fall.

Use caution on the road.",How to Ride a Scooter4," To speed up, simply twist the hand-grip throttle with your right hand. Twist the throttle away from you until you are at your desired speed.You will be able to go different speeds depending on the size of your motor scooter. A smaller scooter (125cc to 150cc) can travel 65mph., To brake on a motor scooter, press the hand brakes with both hands, similar to how you would on a bicycle. The right hand will usually control the front brake and the left hand will control the rear brake., When turning on a motor scooter, you must tilt the handle bar towards the side you wish to turn and actually lean your body in that direction. Your scooter should naturally lean in the direction that you are pressing the handlebar and it is important to get used to this.Practice turning slowly at first. As you increase the speed of your turns, you will also need to lean more.

, Getting comfortable on a motor scooter can take some time. Go to an empty parking lot and spend time driving your scooter around. Practice accelerating, braking and turning until you are comfortable doing so. Then try out your scooter on a slow street and gradually progress to higher speeds., Scooters are lightweight and not the most stable at high speeds. When going fast, use extreme caution. Always yield to cars. Keep in mind that there is nothing protecting you from the road should you fall. Always follow all motor scooter laws. To find out these laws, ask your local DMV.Keep in mind that driving laws for motor scooters are more similar to cars than bikes. If you are used to riding a bike, it might be difficult to break these instincts. Motor scooters are driven in the middle of the road and obey all traffic signals and signs just as you would in a car."

Practice while in motion.,
Jump into the air, and push the brake sideways with your pushing foot.,
Land the tail-whip.,
Practice doing a heel whip.",How to Do a Tailwhip on a Scooter," To do tricks, you need to develop the right foot placement to ensure that the scooter will land where you want it to land. Typically, if you are right footed, your left foot will be your riding foot, placed forward on the scooter, and will not leave the scooter unless you're jumping to do a trick. The right foot will be used to push off and move the scooter, and will stand near the brake toward the back of the scooter when you're cruising.


Practice riding your scooter around and do what feels comfortable. Even if you're right footed, the ""fakie"" placement, with your right foot as the riding foot, might feel more comfortable.;
, Before you start kicking the scooter out from under your feet while in motion, practice the basic ""kick"" while you're standing still on the ground. With your riding foot on the scooter, use your other foot to push the side of the scooter abruptly and firmly so it spins around under you and comes back to its original position.


Practice jumping out of the way of the scooter as you kick it back behind and around your body with your pushing foot. When you can do this regularly, you're ready to start trying a tail whip in motion.

, It'll happen quickly, but you can lift the handle bar slightly with your hands to make sure the scooter raises off the ground. Try to keep the scooter as parallel to the ground as possible while you do this.


Practice by picking up the scooter and getting a feel for its weight. As you practice, get a feel for how high you need to lift the scooter (if at all) and how much you'll need adjust the scooter so it stays level.
Your hands should never leave the grips for this move.

, Place your riding foot on the scooter and start pushing off until you maintain a good speed. Stay balanced without going too quickly. Put your riding foot forward and position your pedaling foot on the opposite side of the brake, slightly hanging over the edge.

, This will cross your legs slightly, so the trick is to get them back uncrossed and land the trick at the same moment the scooter makes it's full rotation. When you first get started, practice your timing by landing on the ground and move on when you can do that regularly.

, When the scooter comes around towards your riding foot, place your riding foot on it, and pull it the remainder of the 360 degree rotation to land straight, then position your pedaling foot in a comfortable position.


This will take lots of practice. Steady the scooter and stop its rotation with your riding foot before planting the scooter back onto the ground with your pushing foot.

, To do a heel whip, or a ""opposite"" tail whip, you'll do essentially the same move, but kick the scooter in the opposite direction. Push out with your pushing foot, using your heel to push the scooter forward, instead of behind you. Stop the rotation of the scooter with your riding foot and land the trick with your pushing foot like normal.

Pull the handlebars up as you jump.,
Land.",How to Do Tricks on a Scooter1," Jumping on a scooter is a little easier than jumping on a skateboard or snowboard, because you have handlebars to help you pull the scooter up. Still, you’ll want to know the basic jump backwards and forwards, because it’s the basis for other tricks. This trick is also called a bunny hop due to its simplicity., Stance is very important when performing a jump, because you need solid footing to push off of the ground. Your back foot will become your kicking foot, and your front foot will hold your weight. Which leg you choose depends on your own comfort and stability.Put your non-dominant foot on the front of the deck, facing straight towards the handlebars. This foot is your supporting leg, and holds the majority of your weight.
Your back leg is your pushing leg. When you’re not using your back foot to push off, rest it on the deck next to your front foot or a bit behind it, facing out at a 45 degree angle.

, Get a little bit of speed by pushing yourself forward with your back foot. Having some speed while learning the basic jump is important, because the more momentum you build going forward, the more you’ll be able to translate that momentum into height., Place it beside your front foot or behind it. This will depend on how long your deck is, or which version feels more comfortable. Make sure that your stance is stable and that you are still moving at a moderate pace., Continue to hold the handlebars while bending at the knee. The lower you get to the ground, the more upward “springing” action you’ll get when you jump up. Maintain your stable footing with your front foot facing forward and your back foot next to it or just behind.

, Kick upwards with both feet, jumping as high as you can. Continue to hold onto the handlebars, and make sure that they’re still facing forward. Keep your feet in their same positions, and don’t move them.

, If you’re already maintaining a good grip on the handlebars, the scooter should come up off the ground as the rest of your body does. Keep holding them tight and pull the bars up as you launch into the air.To get more height, pull the handlebars up further and draw in your knees. This extra momentum will help you get a little more air and clear obstacles.

, Let gravity pull you back down to the ground. Keep your feet in their places on the deck, then bend your knees as you hit the ground to absorb the shock of the landing. Continue riding forward, and adjust your handlebars if you accidentally moved them during the jump."

Consider how many people will be living in your house and decide how many bedrooms you need. Mobile homes typically come in 3 different sizes, single wide, double wide, and triple wide.


Single wides are typically long and narrow with their rooms connecting without hallways.
Double wides are twice as wide as single wides and have hallways connecting some of its rooms.
Triple wides are much larger and typically have 3 to 4 bedrooms with hallways and much more open space.
Most mobile homes or trailers require a foundation. For a truly mobile experience, a recreational vehicle, or RV, or camper trailer will provide the greatest mobility.;
, You can purchase a new mobile home from a mobile home company, or you can purchase a used mobile home. Buying a used mobile home can be much more affordable, but you have to do your research in inspecting the home to make sure you are getting a quality home. New or used, you need to research the conditions of the floors, walls, roof, plumbing, and the bottom of the home.Make sure a used home will pass all of the necessary codes in your area. You can find out the building codes in your area by contacting your local government’s building division.
If you’re buying new, check to make sure you’re buying from a reputable company that sells homes compliant with local building codes.

, Look for companies that sell mobile homes locally. This will reduce the shipping cost and distance traveled of your home. Buying locally also ensures you can easily return to the company if anything goes wrong with your home.

, Make sure you do your homework by researching different companies. You can find the same types of homes for different prices if you look around. Check for sales and specials being offered so you end up with the best deal.You can negotiate the price of a new mobile home just like you can a car. Most mobile home dealers have the price of the home marked up about 15 to 30 percent, so they have some room to lower the price for you.

, A down payment is money you pay for the home before applying a loan. This will make your monthly loan payments smaller so the more you can put down the better. Many financial companies require a down payment of a certain amount, such as 5 percent.

, Home loans include interest and can be paid back over different amounts of time depending on the terms, so the monthly payments can be very different with different loans. Decide what monthly payments you can afford, and then use a loan calculator to find out how much you can finance.It is a good rule to keep your home loan payment to under 30 percent of your net income. The payment should include money for the loan, the taxes, and any insurance on the home. The total of these should be under 30 percent of your net income.
The total cost of a mobile home, land, delivery, and land preparation can cost between $75,000 to $300,000, and sometimes even more if you get all of the upgrades., Many different institutions offer loans to buy a mobile home, but they all will have different terms so make sure you do your research before committing.Some larger financial institutions don’t do loans for mobile homes so you may have to look at smaller banks and credit unions. Local financial institutions might be best to get a good loan on a mobile home.
The government issues loans for mobile homes for qualified individuals from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Visit their website to find out their qualifications for a loan.

, Some financial institutions will have the option of rent to own loans. Theses loans let you pay a higher rent payment that let’s you end up owning the home. In a rent to own home, the buyer gets to move into the house before purchasing it. The buyer pays the seller monthly rent money while securing the money to purchase the home when the rent period is up.Some rent to own agreements let the buyer have the option of not buying the home when the lease contract is up, but some are binding agreements that the buyer will definitely purchase the home. Make sure you read the agreement thoroughly before getting a rent to own property. It’s a good idea to have a lawyer look over the contract as well.

, Make sure that the property where you want to place your home is zoned for mobile structures. Each county has different ordinances governing where mobile homes are permitted.Check your local zoning and tax laws to make sure you can put the home where you want.You can find out the zoning ordinances from your county tax assessor's office.

, Although mobile homes can fit on very small lots, you may want to purchase a large amount of land if you can afford it. Determine what you want to use the property for to know how much land you need. At minimum, you’ll want enough land for your entire mobile home to fit on your property with an extra couple of feet around the perimeter as well., Make sure that there is enough flat ground to place your mobile home on your lot. If the lot is not level you, expect to pay more in installation fees to excavate the lot and provide the proper grading to install a mobile home.


You can hire a surveyor to provide you with a topographical map detailing the exact measurements of slopes on the land.

, Look for home builders that are located close to where you are purchasing property.

, Mobile and manufactured homes come with many different floor plans. Pick a plan that suits your lifestyle.Decide how many bedrooms you need. Think about how many people will be living in the home, and if you will want an extra bedroom for guests.
Consider how the floorplan is divided. Think about whether you want the bedrooms next to each other or on opposite sides of the home. Some floor plans are better set up for roommates with one bedroom and one bathroom on either end of the home, and others lend themselves more to a family set up with a couple of rooms together on one end.
Pick a floorplan that has enough space for you and your family. You will want enough sleeping space as well as living space for your family to move around in.

, Different levels of fixtures and appliances can be chosen for a mobile home. When choosing your finish level, consider your budget and what items you need to include.

, Select a manufacturer that offers warranties on the interior, exterior and appliances. A warranty can protect you in case of defective craftsmanship or extreme situations., File paperwork with the county to obtain building permits for your home. Be prepared to pay the necessary fees for your permits.Before constructing a permanent foundation on a land you will need a building permit.
Some municipalities also require special permitting to connect to city utility lines.
If you plan to use your land for any business or agricultural purposes, additional land use permits may also be required.

, Hire a contractor to prepare the lot for the installation of the mobile home. Depending on the slope of your property, excavation may be required.

, Contact the manufacturer of the home to learn how much advance notice they need in order to deliver your home.Be sure to schedule delivery for a day when you have a full day free. Delays may occur, causing your delivery to take longer than expected.
Ask the company about any fees that may be associated with rescheduling your delivery due to unforeseen circumstances.

, Contact the utility companies in the area your home is being installed. Arrange a date to have the utilities connected after your home is delivered.


Use registered contractors to connect your utilities to the city supply lines.

, Push off with your back foot and get moving at a comfortable pace. Stay relaxed and make sure that you’re heading straight forward. The more speed you build up now, the faster and more impressive looking your tailwhip will be.

, Do the simple jump trick by crouching down, jumping up and pulling the scooter behind you. You’ll need plenty of air time to perform the tail whip, so make sure you jump as high as you can., With your back foot, kick the tail of the scooter out, either right or left. The direction doesn’t matter, choose what is most comfortable to you. Since the scooter deck is attached to a pivot point (the handlebars), it will move away from you on a circular path., Once you’re airborne and you’ve kicked the tail to start the circle, you’ll need to make sure the deck returns under your feet so that you can land. Momentum will do most of the work, and the deck will continue to rotate back to you, but you’ll need to help it out by moving the handlebars. Push them in a circular motion, moving in the same direction that the board is moving in., The deck will continue turning, so you need to catch it with your feet. When the deck returns to its original position, catch it with your front and back foot. Return to your original stance, with front foot facing forward and back foot just behind it.

, Stay relaxed as you fall to the ground, and make sure your stance is solid. As you connect with the pavement, let your knees buckle a bit to absorb the shock. Straighten up your handlebars a bit if you need to, you may have changed course in midair on accident.

Find a rail.,
Get some speed.,
Jump up.,
Land on the rail.,
Slide on the rail.,
Jump off.,
Land.",How to Do Tricks on a Scooter3," You’ll need a decent rail to grind on before you learn this trick. Look for rails over five feet long, preferably close to the ground. Local skate parks often have grind rails made just for tricks, so check there. You can also grind on curbs, but they'll need to be painted or waxed., Start about 10 feet away from the rail, or as far away as space allows. Push off and get some speed, making sure to line up your feet in their correct stance. Stay relaxed as you get closer to the rail., Once your front wheel is even with the rail, jump up and towards the rail. Jump as you normally would, crouching down and springing up to get a lot of height, but spring slightly towards the rail so you can position yourself over it. More height isn’t necessarily better here, just jump high enough to get over the rail.

, Let gravity pull you and your scooter down to the rail. You’ll want to land so that the bottom of your deck lies across the railing, either perpendicular or at a slightly smaller angle. Keep your foot position solid as possible, which will make balancing a lot easier., The momentum that you built up will carry you across the rail, pushing you forward to “grind” along it. Keep your balance by actively shifting weight either left or right. Your foot placement will be essential here, because your feet are anchoring you to the deck and to the rail. It might take a couple practice runs to get comfortable balancing.

, You can either ride to the end of the rail or jump off mid-rail; it depends on your preference or any trick combo you have in mind. Pick your point to jump off, then plant your feet firmly on the deck. Continue to maintain your balance, then perform the simple jump up and out away from the rail. Don’t make this a super high jump: you only need it to clear the rail a bit and make sure your wheels don’t get caught on it., Land the trick with solid foot placement, keeping them in the same places they were when you jumped from the rail. Bend your knees to absorb the shock of landing. Correct for any changes of handlebar positions, then continue on.

Try riding some ramps.,
Use the ramp to get some air.,
Try “The X-Up”.,
Try the Barspin.,
Do a Tail Grab.",How to Do Tricks on a Scooter4," Skate parks are pretty all inclusive, and most welcome scooter riders as well as skateboarders or BMX riders. There are also some parks made specifically for scooter riders.Look for a park near you, then pick out some ramps to practice getting some air. Once in the air, you can use “flair moves”, or tricks that you do in the air while before landing.

, Ride up the ramp or the bowl, making sure you’ve got enough speed built up. Once you hit the coping, or the metal railing around the lip of the ramp, jump. Jump as you normally would, putting both feet on the deck and jumping straight up. You’ll be in the air, ready to try some tricks.

, Once you’re in the air, twist the handlebar so that your left handle is on the right side and the right handle is on the left side. Keep holding onto the handlebars, and your arms will create an “X”. Make sure to turn the handlebars back before you land., While in the air, let go of one handlebar and use your free hand to grab the opposite handlebar. Begin to spin the handlebars all the way around. Use your other hand to reach around and grab the handlebar you first let go of. Return the handlebars all the way around to their starting position., The tail grab is a trick borrowed from skateboarders, and it looks just as cool on a scooter. Once you’re in the air, bend slightly at the knees, then take one hand off the handlebars. Use that hand to grab the back of your deck. Hold on for as long as you can, then let go before landing."
"
Choose a quality scooter.,
Select the right size.,
Pick a wheel size.",How to Do Tricks on a Scooter5," Razor is the most famous scooter manufacturer, but many of their scooters are built with simple riding in mind. Stunt or trick scooters require better quality materials and construction, because they take more of a beating when you jump, land and grind.Make sure the deck is steel. Many low end scooters feature aluminum or wood decks. While these are light and work for simple commutes, you’ll want a steel deck for your trick scooter. It will be heavy, but it will stand up to more stress.
Check online reviews. Online reviews are a good indicator of quality. Look for reviews that mention quality and durability. If people mentioned a scooter breaking or falling apart easily, be wary of that model., Try out different scooters in a store, or measure yourself if you’re buying online. The scooter’s handlebars should come up to your waist when you stand on the deck. Also, make sure that the handlebars are fixed and not adjustable. While adjustable handlebars are great for young riders, they could become unstable if you put a lot of pressure on them when you land jumps., Scooter wheels come in a variety of sizes, ranging from a standard 98mm to a large 200mm. While the larger wheels are good for cruising, professional stunt-scooter riders prefer 110mm wheels. They’re fast, last longer than smaller wheels, and allow for better brake-control."

Locate a metro station.,
Refer to a metro map.,
Buy a ticket at the machine by the desk.,
Once you have your ticket or 'Navigo' contactless card, proceed to the tolls.,
Follow the signs to your platform.,
Wait at the platform.,
Find somewhere to sit/stand.,
Stay away from the door when the buzzer goes off.,
Keep an eye out for your stop.,
Get off the train when your stop comes, and look for the appropriate sortie (exit).",How to Take the Paris Metro," As mentioned, you are never too far away from one, but here are a few tips to spot them. They will normally have a sign saying ""Metro"" or a big, yellow ""M"" on them. There are some stations (Like Miromesnil) whose entrances are within a building. So if you swear you cannot see one, look at the nearby buildings- the station could be hiding in them.;
, Find a place to sit down inside the station and look at a map on the wall or, if you have one, a pocket map. Decide where you want to go, and try to locate the appropriate stop on the map. Check what line it is on, then locate your current position and see what direction (what is the last station) you will need to follow.

, A carnet is a bundle of 10 tickets. You can also buy tickets by 20. Consider the following packages:


The ""Navigo Decouverte"" is a contactless card that allows you to travel by Metro, Bus, RER and Tramway in a selected set of zones of Paris and the Ile de France for at least three days.
Paris Visite is a card that will get you entry to museums too (not the Eiffel Tower, before you ask).
A Carte Mobilis will get you a day's ride on Metro, Bus and RER.

,


If you have a ticket, insert it in the slot in front of the machine and it will instantly pop out on top of it. Get it back as you proceed through the machine and store it in your pocket.
If you have a Navigo card, briefly present it about half an inch above the purple area of the machine as you proceed, a sound and a green arrow will notify you that you can go through.

, There will be signs showing the number and color of the line, and the terminus where it stops (the Direction). Make sure you get the correct Terminus direction. For example, if you want to get to the Arc de Triomphe on line 1 (Yellow), look for a sign saying ""Direction La Défense"". This means that the train is heading in the direction of La Défense, and will pass through and stop at all the stations on the way.


If you are in a big station like Nation, Châtelet, Gare de Lyon, Montparnasse etc, you may walk through a lot of intersections, corridors and stairs, that is okay, just make sure to carefully follow the signs, for example, if you have to take Line 1 in the direction of La Défense, in a big station, you may at first see a sign like , follow it. later one, it will clarify to , and then, just before the two corridors to the platforms split, you will choose the one indicated by a sign entitled with all the stations to it listed underneath. (Just make sure your station is in the list).

, Once on the platform, locate the overhead sign near the middle on the platform which must wear the number and color of the line along with the Terminus. Check if you are on the right platform and see how long you have to wait before the train comes (first set of 2 digits, typically 00 to 04 minutes). Keep an eye out for people too close to you, and wait for the train. When the train arrives, keep behind the white line. Let people leave the train first, and then you can get on it.


On most lines, you have to open the doors of the train if no-one else does. You either have to push a button or pull up the handle.

, The ability to sit down on the Metro is determined by the time which you go on it. So if you go on at around 8am or 5pm, you will probably be standing up. When crowded, do not be tempted to sit on the fold down seats. You will be making a nuisance of yourself. You can check on the line maps above each door how many stations are left before yours. On some lines, the map has a yellow light for each station, the light is off for passed or closed stations, lit for the remaining ones, and blinking for the next or current one.

, If you are approaching the train when the buzzer goes off, do not follow suit to others. Stay on the platform and wait for the next train.

, While traveling on the train, keep an eye out for the stops you stop at, and try to predict when your stop comes. If you want to remain unnoticed, do not make eye contact with anyone. Do not whistle or talk loudly.

, #*There will be maps of the area nearby with the location of the sorties nearby.


If you are in a big station, find the map ""Plan du Quartier"" (""District Map"") on the platform and locate which exit (""Sortie"") you want. In regular stations, a street name will do the trick, but it big stations with up to 15 different exits, you may need to remember the exit number as you may come across signs like: . Follow the blue ""SORTIE"" signs. As you come closer to the exit, it will have the street or place name instead of a number, though.

Stand to the edge of the street, and look for an unoccupied cab.,

Raise your hand in the air as the cab approaches.,
Make eye contact with the driver when your taxi pulls over.,
Find a taxi stand, if you cannot find an unoccupied taxi.,
Call for a taxi instead of hailing one.,
Download a cab-hailing app for quicker service.",How to Use Taxis1," When you're ready to hail a taxi, stand at the edge of the sidewalk away from oncoming cars. Make sure you're at a spot where cabbies can see you, like at a street corner with great visibility. If you make it easy for drivers to see you, you will hail a taxi faster.

Stand on the side of traffic moving in the direction you want to go.;
, Cabs usually have a light or sign on the roof to indicate whether they are occupied. Unoccupied taxi signs will light up or otherwise indicate that they're ready for service. Signs vary based on the area. If you're not sure what the cab signs mean, ask a local for help., Do not wave your hand frantically. Raise your hand firmly and confidently so cabbies know you want to be picked up. Keep your hand raised until a taxi driver spots you and pull over. Step back onto the curb once you have caught a driver's attention, and wait for them to park before approaching., Once your driver has stopped, approach the taxi and make direct eye contact as you do so. Open the backseat door and enter the taxi, where you can tell the driver your destination. Have your address ready (either memorized or on a piece of paper) so you can communicate with them clearly.

If you're traveling, you and your taxi driver might not speak the same language. Writing down your address is important so they know where to take you., Taxi stands are spots where cab drivers wait for passengers in an orderly line. Stand in line with other customers to wait for an oncoming taxi. When your turn arrives, approach the taxi and let the driver know where you want to go.Usually, taxi stands are located in places with lots of traffic, like airports, hotels, or popular tourist attractions.
Cabs working with taxi stands are a safe option because they have to be authorized by the stand company.

, If you cannot find any taxis in your area, search online for a local cab company. When you've found their number, call the taxi company and give them your current address. Wait outside until your cab arrives, and let the cabbie know where you want to go as you enter the backseat.

Call the taxi company 15-20 minutes before you plan to leave, especially during times of high traffic.
Although most cab companies are available 24/7, some are not. Always check their company policies before you call.

, Most cities have cab-hailing apps available in your area. Download one for your city and order a cab. Make sure your phone's location-sharing services are on so your cabbie knows where to pick you up. Stay where you are until your taxi driver arrives.

Most cab-hailing apps allow you to pay via the app using your credit card.

Keep food and drinks to a minimum.,
Don't ask drivers to take on more passengers than they have room for.,
Be polite when talking to your driver.,
Leave a tip.",How to Use Taxis2," Ask your driver about what their food and drink policies are. If they have a no eating or drinking policy, adhere to their rules. Some taxi drivers prefer to have a strict policy to prevent spills. Alcohol is a big ""no-no,"" as passengers drinking from open alcohol containers is illegal in many areas .Do not bring and pungent foods with you into the taxi, as smells tend to linger in cars.
Clean up after yourself before you exit the cab, and take any wrappers or trash with you.

, When traveling in a group, don't ask the cabbie to accommodate more than three people. Every passenger must have a seat belt. Cramming more people than the taxi has room for can get your driver in trouble. Split into several groups if you have four or more people., If your driver tries to make conversation, be kind and agreeable. Let them know if you're tired or don't feel like talking. In most cases, your driver will accommodate and give you space. Do not insult the taxi driver if traffic puts you behind schedule, and avoid disruptive behavior like yelling, insensitive comments, or vulgar jokes.

Never ask your taxi driver to speed or break the law in any way. Driving safely is an important component of their job, and driving recklessly puts their employment status at-risk., Beyond the overall fare, tipping a cabbie is polite. 20 percent is standard in most areas, but feel free to give more if your driver was especially helpful. Late at night is a common time for passengers to forget, so pay extra attention to tipping if you hailed a taxi at night."
"
Ask a local what taxis look like in the area.,
Look for a radio or meter.,
Check for your driver's ID badge.,
Keep your bags close.",How to Use Taxis3," Taxis within a certain city often have similar makes/colors. Taxis in New York City, for example, are often yellow so city-goers can see them from a distance. But taxis in Munich are sleek and cream-colored. Generally taxis in London are black, as are taxis in Japan. A unique-looking taxi isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but you may want to check other indicators of authenticity, like a meter or your driver's ID badge., Authorized taxis will usually have a meter for determining the charge. Usually, the meter is located on the cab's hood or in the car, near the driver's seat. Taxis are also often equipped with radios to take calls from dispatchers. If you can't see a meter or a radio, do not get in the car.Sometimes, especially in new car models, taximeters can be hard to spot. If you're not sure, ask your cabbie to point it out.

, Taxi drivers are required to carry and display their ID badge in most countries. Their badge should have their name, a recent photo, and the company they work for. In most cases, the ID badge will be visibly hanging inside the video. If this is not the case, ask your driver to see their ID.

Do not enter the car under any circumstances if they refuse., Illegitimate taxi drivers may try to steal from their passengers. Do not put your bags or luggage in the trunk. Instead, ask to keep them on the floor by your feet if there's room. If you're carrying expensive items, make sure you know where they are at all times."
"
Listen for the fare.,
Calculate the tip as a percentage of the fare.,
Add a few dollars if your driver helps you with baggage.,
Give the cab driver an even bill.",How to Tip a Cab Driver1," When the trip is over, the driver will tell you how much you owe. Calculate the tip as a percentage of this fare, or ""eyeball"" the amount by rounding up to the nearest $5 or $10 bill increment.Most cabs feature a fare ticker which allows you to watch the price of the ride rise as you approach your destination. If you're in a hurry, you can use this to predict, calculate, and prepare your tip before it's time to get out of the cab.;
, 10-15% of the overall fare is usually fine. If the bill is less than $10, feel free to give a 10% tip, but do not tip less than $1. If the bill is more than $10, give at least a 15% tip.Any percentage-based tip will be a rough representation of the duration and quality of the ride, made slightly arbitrary for the sake of convenience. Try to choose the tip percentage that best fits the situation.


If the driver did an exceptional job, consider tipping her 20% or more. Perhaps you had a great conversation, or she gave you useful advice about sightseeing in the city, or she worked hard to get you to your destination on time despite an awful traffic backup.The credit card machines inside some cabs suggest default tip percentages between which you can choose. In New York, for instance, cabs offer three default tip levels: 20%, 25%, and 30%. Feel free to choose any of these options or to choose your own amount., Add $1 per bag if you have five bags or fewer. Add $2 per bag if you have five bags or more, or if your bags are extremely heavy. Remember that these are not hard, fast rules – these are guidelines within which you will work on a case-by-case basis., If the amount is close to an even amount, just give the driver an even bill and tell him/her to ""keep the change"". For instance: $17.28 is close to $20, and $2.72 is slightly more than 15% of $17.28. You don't need to calculate the exact tip percentage as long as you give the cab driver a reasonable amount.This strategy is useful if you find yourself in a hurry. From the cab driver's perspective, a $20 bill may be easier to store and spend than a few crumpled bills and a handful of loose change.


If your fare comes to less than $4, give the cab driver a $5 bill. You should not tip less than $1, and a %15 tip for any amount lower than five dollars will come to less than $1.
If your fare comes to $7-9, give the driver a $10.
If your fare comes to $11-13, you can give the driver $15.
If your fare comes to $33-35, just give the driver $40.

"
Review the quality of the ride.,
Consider the speed of service.,
Ask yourself whether your driver went the extra mile.,
Think about the driver's demeanor.,
Gauge the driver's area knowledge.",How to Tip a Cab Driver2," Weigh factors like the driver's knowledge of the area, the speed of his service, his extra effort, and his general demeanor. These indices are absolutely subjective – so follow your gut and adjust your tips on a case-by-case basis. Follow these general guidelines for tipping based on quality:


Tip 5-10% (or not at all) if the service was particularly poor. Perhaps the driver took the longest route to get you to your destination; perhaps he was rude to you, or made you feel uncomfortable.
Tip 15% for a solid, middle-of-the-road cab ride. The driver brought you to your destination in a reasonable amount of time and made you feel comfortable, but didn't do anything exceptional. 15% is acceptable in most cases.
Tip 20% or higher if this was one of the better cab rides you've ever had. Maybe you had a great conversation with the cabbie, and s/he gave you some interesting ideas for exploring the area; maybe s/he took a lesser-known back-road that got you to the airport much faster than if you'd sat through traffic; maybe s/he helped you haul your bags to the doorstep.

, A driver should take the most efficient route to get you to your destination on time. If the ride took longer than expected, but there was a lot of traffic, it probably wasn't the driver's fault. However, keep an eye out for drivers who intentionally drive slowly or take detours to hike up the fare.

, If the cab driver doesn't offer to help out with your luggage, don't feel obliged to tip any more than normal. If s/he goes above and beyond to get you to your destination, or if s/he gives you useful insider tips about local attractions, s/he may have earned a higher tip than the average cabbie.

, Consider how friendly and helpful the driver was. If s/he was nice and provided helpful information, s/he's earned a higher tip. If the driver was rude to you, or if the driver brusquely demanded a tip, s/he may have earned a lower tip &ndash or no tip at all., The cab driver should not need to ask for directions, and s/he should know which routes to take to make the ride as quick as possible. The driver should be aware of alternate routes in case of accidents and traffic jams. If you are a tourist, your driver should be able to suggest attractions and activities for you to check out while you're in town.

Use a tip calculator app if you are riding with multiple people.,
Tip an Uber or Lyft driver.,
Consider tipping the cab driver with an item or gesture that is equivalent in value to the amount of money you would tip.,
Be polite and respectful.",How to Tip a Cab Driver3," It can be difficult to determine what everyone owes, but tip calculators can easily split the tip according to the fare, the tip percentage, and the number of tippers.You can download these apps to your phone, or access a tip calculator site through your phone's web browser.


Some such apps give you the option to choose your location to better calibrate the tip amount. This way, if you aren't sure, you can try to base your tip on local factors: the cost of housing, the minimum wage, and the going rate for service tips.

, The taxicab industry is rapidly changing; depending on where you live, you might be much more likely to use a peer-to-peer ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft than to hire a traditional cab service. The payment process for these services runs entirely through the app, so the tip protocol is murky. Be aware, however, that these drivers do not receive tips through the service unless you give it to them in person. Unless you are using the uberTaxi service, there is no way to tip your Uber driver through the app – so feel free to tip him or her with cash, exactly as you would a traditional cab driver., Make sure that you give the driver something that he or she actually wants – an unwanted gift can be more of a burden than a blessing. Do not present a non-monetary tip as a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum; instead, if you have something worth offering, give the cab driver the option to take the object instead of a traditional tip. Try to leave a cash tip unless you have spent absolutely all of your available funds on the fare.


For example, if you have an old (but unexpired) $10 gift card to a restaurant you will never visit, offer it to the driver in lieu of money. Say, ""I can give you a cash tip for the ride, but I have this Applebee's gift card that I'm never going to use. Would you take that instead?""
Bear in mind that many cab drivers are hustling to pay their bills. They must pay a daily or weekly lease on their cab, plus rent on their house or apartment, plus gas – all out of their own pockets. Card-swipe fare payments don't usually pay out in the same day, so it's common for drivers to take rides on credit unless you pay them in cash. Thus: a non-monetary tip may feel unique and whimsical, but odds are that most drivers will prefer cash.

, Trust begets trust. Tell the cab driver where you want to go as soon as you get into the cab, and respect the vehicle while you're inside. Pay promptly when you reach your destination, and tip the driver before you leave the vehicle. Thank the driver, and perhaps even tell him/her to have a great day. Monetary tips are great, but a few kind words can take your tip to the next level.

Make sure you have the right tools.,
Be sure to mark down the points where to bend your wire with a marker or a pencil.",How to Bend Wire1,"

The simplest method of bending wire is by hand.






For more precise and comfortable bending, use pliers.







, Thicker wire may require larger tools and specialized machinery."
"
Making 90 degree bends.,
Start by marking down where you want the bend, taking into account a small error as making a corner-like sharp bend into a piece of wire is not easy.,Secure the wire, preferably by the larger part of the wire.,
Grip the wire, taking into account a small error.,
Make the bend by turning the pliers to the direction needed.

,
Using a vice is also an option.,Check the angle of the wire with a square.,
Another option would be to make yourself a jig for checking the wire for 90 degree angles.",How to Bend Wire2," The easiest method is to use square pliers with sufficiently wide jaws.
, Most likely the wire will have a slight curve at the 90 degree angle.,, To prevent the wire from developing marks from the pliers, wrap a piece of cloth around the wire or grip the wire with 2 small glimpse of wood on either side of the wire.

Another option would be to grip the wire with pliers made of a softer material than the wire but finding pliers like that can be difficult as strength and durability are important aspects of pliers.

,, Use a block of wood to ensure even bending.

,,

The simplest method to make one of these is to drill 2 crossing holes through a piece of wood. By cutting the wood at 90 degrees through the centers of the holes, you will end up with 2 pieces of wood with crossing grooves.
You could make the grooves by hand if you're confident in your abilities of cutting precise grooves.
A third option would be to use some sort of saw to make the grooves. For example a bandsaw or table saw.

"
"Follow the same general steps as you would for 90 degree bends.,
Check the angles with a protractor.",How to Bend Wire3,", There are various printable protractors available on the internet, allowing you to make one to suit your needs out of wood or plywood for example."
"A regular curve is a line which follows the curvature of one specific circle.,
Make a template of the circle or curve.,
Consider a french curve.,
Consider making a template with a compass.,
Use specific machinery.",How to Bend Wire4,", There are several options for making templates., A french curve is a template made out of metal, wood or plastic composed of many different curves. It is used in manual drafting to draw smooth curves of varying radii.


The shapes are segments of the Euler spiral or clothoid curve.
There are printable templates of french curves available on the internet if you wish to make one yourself.

, A compass can easily be used to draw circles and curves.

Draw the necessary curve or circle onto a piece of paper.
Cut the paper along the line you drew.
Now, you could use the paper as a template or make a sturdier version by gluing the paper to a piece of wood or plywood and cutting the wood along the line.

, There are specialized machines for bending wire and tubing."
"
Follow roughly the same steps as you would for making regular curves or circles.,Make the template out of paper or wood.,
Bend the wire according to the template.",How to Bend Wire5," Specific templates will be required as irregular curves follow multiple circles.,,

You could freehand the curve if precision is not required and the wire is malleable by hand.

"
"Straightening can be done in multiple ways, taking into account the properties of the wire.,Straighten thinner and softer wire by hand.,
Straighten thicker and stronger wire on an anvil or similar surface.,
Straightening thin and soft aluminium or copper wire is easiest with 2 pieces of wood and a vice.,
Straighten thin steel wire by pulling it through a row of nails.,To check the straightness of a shorter piece of wire, use a ruler or roll the wire on a smooth surface.",How to Bend Wire6,",, The hammer needs to be made of a softer material than the wire, otherwise there is a risk of flattening or damaging the wire. Wood or brass is a good choice.


Start from the end of the wire. The straight starting section will be your baseline for the rest of the wire.

,

Sandwich the wire in between the wood and secure it in the vice, don't apply too much pressure. The straightening is done by pulling the wire through the 2 pieces of wood.






Another option is securing one end of the wire in a vice and then pulling along the wire with 2 pieces of wood.







,


Start by securing a U shaped arch into a piece of wood. This arch can be made out of a sufficiently strong staple or a nail. The arch should have just enough distance between the wood to allow the wire to pass through underneath it.
Hammer nails into 2 straight lines with the width of the wire being the distance between the lines.
Pull the wire through the row of nails.
Repeat if necessary.

,"
"
Use pliers with round jaws.,
Choose the gripping point on the pliers according to the diameter of the noose you wish to make.

,
Bend the wire in 180 degree increments at the most.

,After that, rotate the pliers so that the bent part is not being gripped by the jaws.,
Repeat the previous step until the circle is complete.

,
Bend the noose back.

,Cut off the excess with wire cutters, a specialized chisel or a hacksaw.,
File the end of the wire smooth.,
Flatten the noose to finish it.

",How to Bend Wire7," The conical jaws will make it possible to make nooses of varying diameter.


Square pliers can be used to make square nooses.

,,,,,,, Make necessary adjustments to the noose.,"
"
Obtain the things you'll need.
,Cut your styrofoam ball in half and cut a small hollow in the center.,

Place a small jingle bell or noisy object in the center and place the two halves together again with the jingle bell inside.
,
Cut two rectangles from your batting or old blanket.,

Wrap the rectangle around the styrofoam ball.
,

Pin the two rectangles to your styrofoam ball.,

Wrap them around and place pins to hold them in place.

Use the ball as a decoration, as a gift, or as a child's toy.
",How to Make a Temari Ball,",,, They should wrap 3/4ths of the way around the balls circumference lengthwise and be at least half the ball circumference in width.,, Place the short end of one against the middle of the longer side of the other.,,,,,,,, The example was made extremely simple for ease of explanation, but there are many more complicated and interesting designs ""out there"". (see citations below),,"
"
Use a vice.,
Turn the rod and wind the wire onto the rod.",How to Bend Wire8,"

For turning spirals in a vice, a cylindrical metal stick or rod is used. The rod has a slit on one end, matching the thickness of the wire and a lever for turning it on the other end.






The rod is secured between 2 hardwood blocks with grooves according cut in them according to the grooves.
















The diameter of the rod dictates the diameter of the spiral.
An alternative method would be to use a threaded rod with a slit and some nuts. The nuts would be turned onto the rod and fastened in the vice. The rod could be turned by turning 2 nuts onto the rod and tightening them against each other, after that the rod could be turned with vice grips, pliers or with a suitable wrench.
A lathe with a metal or wood cylinder in it could also be used in place of the rod. The wire could be wound onto the cylinder by turning the lathe by hand or at very low RPM. Optionally, the wire could be guided through a stack of 2 pieces of wood to straighten the wire.







, Adjust the threading density and spacing according to what kind of wire you need.

This can be difficult if the wire is thick or strong.

Allow to dry.",How to Make a Pinboard from Unwanted Polystyrene," If you cannot get a box with a lid, cut down the sides of the box and use the base instead (or the sides if they are the right shape and size for your needs). In fact, you can make several pinboards out of the entire box if you like!;
, Give it a wipe down with warm, soapy water and leave to dry.

, Using a pencil with an eraser end, gently push a design into the board. The indentations should be very minor but distinctive enough that you can make out the design. It is important to plan the design on paper in advance. Shapes, animals, patterns, etc. are good choices.

, The paint should be acrylic. A little pot of test paint is perfect for this project.

, Paint over the imprinted design and paint to the edges of the pinboard.

, Once dry, hang the pinboards in place (hang string through two little holes or use stick-ons suitable for a wall) and use as wished.

Choose a white, ceramic teapot.,
Wash and dry the ceramic teapot.,
Gather your quotes.,
Use Sharpies (permanent marker pens) or paint pens for writing the quotes.,
Test drive the pen before applying it to the teapot.,
Begin writing at the top of the teapot.,
Use your shortest quote or most meaningful word to top the teapot.,
Identify the shortest quotes to line the teapot lid.,
Write the next set of quotes at the top of the teapot rim and begin working your way down and around the teapot.,
Finished.",How to Create a Quote Teapot," The teapot needs to be large enough to hold all your quotes. Depending on how large you write and the number of quotes you’ve gathered, base the teapot's size on the amount of writing that will be transferred to the teapot.


The quotes will be written using a permanent marker, so check that the teapot material will hold the ink and allow for quick drying.
For a standout look, go for white. Otherwise, if you find a dark colored teapot, use reverse (white, metallic or light colored) markers.;
, Remove any dust or debris before writing on the teapot. Simply wipe clean with warm, soapy water, rinse with clean water and then dry with a soft cloth.

, If you're creating this for another person, find a book penned by his or her favorite author and dig up as many quotes as possible. Or, use online quote websites for fasting sorting.


You might even like to ask directly for quotes that your recipient holds dear, in order to make the teapot extra special.
It's a good idea to write out or type up the quotes to keep on hand as you create the teapot. You can reference your sheet as you write, making it easier.

, It's up to you whether you want a single color or a variety of colors. Just be aware that while using more than one color can produce a “designed” effect, too many colors may disrupt the flow of the quotes.


Choose markers that have a strong pointed felt tip. If you can’t find a Sharpie pen, look for a permanent paint pen that gives you the same command as a ballpoint pen.







, You don’t want the first mark to be on the teapot, as your pen may not be fully inked. Write a few words on a separate sheet of paper first and get a feel for how the pen writes first. Once you're happy that it's flowing properly and that you can write with it comfortably, then apply it to the teapot.


Try an inconspicuous part of the teapot first, to see how it looks and to test how it sets.

, Begin with the lid and work your way down and around the teapot in a swirling, descending motion.


Add a symbol or mark to denote a break in between quotes. A simple dot (.), asterisk (*), tilde or hyphen (~ or -) in between the quotes will suffice.






Change pen colors in between quotes (if using different colors). For example, write one quote in blue and the next quote in black.







, You may want to write the first word in a different script so it stands out.

, Make sure the entire quote fits on the lid.,

Take breaks in between quotes so your hand does not get tired––you risk leaning into the ink and smudging it.






Aim to maintain a consistent word shape and design. Write words close together in order to fit all your quotes on the teapot.







, Heat the teapot in the oven at 150 °F (66 °C) for 30 minutes to make it permanent. Ensure that the quote teapot has cooled properly before packaging as a gift or using.


If giving as a gift, consider accompanying it with a book of the author whose quotes you've used and a package of fresh tea.

Prepare the master part.,
Melt your reusable molding materials in a microwave.,
Pour the melted material over the master part.",How to Mold Plastic1," The master part is the item that you will use to create the mold.


To prepare the master part, first wipe down or wash the item.
Once clean and dry, apply a release agent to the original item—this will ensure that the master part will pop free from the mold.
Coat the item with a layer of bubble buster—this product prevents the formation of air bubbles around the master part.
Place the master item into a heat safe container. The container must be slightly larger than the item.;
, Reusable molding material is easy to use and mistake proof; you can melt, mold, cast, and de-cast reusable molding material up to 35 times. Place the container of reusable molding material into a microwave. Follow the instructions on the product to properly melt the materials.


Heat the material for short intervals, roughly 15 to 20 seconds, until you understand how the microwave affects the materials.
If you do not have a microwave, you may use a double boiler., Carefully pour the melted molding material over the master part. Allow the product to cool and harden. Gently remove the mold from the heat safe container and the master part from the mold."

Create a catalyzing solution with soap and water.,
Catalyze the silicone.,
Knead the 100% silicone in the catalyst bath.,
Form the mold.,
Allow your mold to cure.",How to Mold Plastic2," When a high concentration of dish soap is combined with water, it forms a catalyst bath for silicone—it allows the silicone to cure faster. In the large bowl, combine approximately 64 ounces of water with 4 ounces of blue dish soap. Mix the soap and water together with your hands., Use a pair of scissors to cut off the tip of the 100% silicone. Insert the bottle into a caulk gun. Empty enough of the 100% silicone into the catalyst bath to surround your master part.


If you are unsure how much you will need, use the entire bottle of 100% silicone., Submerge your hands into the catalyst bath and slowly gather the strings of 100% silicone into a ball. Massage the ball with your fingers. Pull, stretch, and fold the 100% silicone as you knead it. Continue to knead the 100% silicone until it stiffens and becomes less malleable., Retrieve your master part. Carefully flatten out the 100% silicone so that it is ½ inch thick. Cover the master item with the 100% silicone—press the 100% silicone into all of the knocks and crannies of the master part. Once you have formed the mold, attempt to wiggle the master item out and back into the mold. If you can easily achieve this, the mold is ready to cure. If you can not, reform or cut away parts of the mold.Applying a release agent to the master item will make it easier to remove from the mold.

, Pour soapy water onto a paper plate so that it just coats the surface—this will prevent the silicone from adhering to the plate. Set your mold and master item onto the plate and allow it to cure for 1 hour. When the mold is no longer tacky to the touch, remove the master item.


While the mold is curing, it is essential that the master item remain within the mold."

Retrieve your master item, a permanent marker, and a ruler. Draw a straight centerline around your master item., Set a block of non-toxic and non-drying molding clay on your work surface. Embed the master item into the clay up to the centerline. The top of the item should line up with the top of the clay bed. There should be a 1 inch border of clay surrounding the remaining 3 sides of the item., Alignment keys join the 2 halves together perfectly. Retrieve four ½ inch alignment keys and a bottle of temporary adhesive. Apply a thin layer of temporary adhesive to the flat side of the alignment key. Place the key in ¼ inch from the top left corner and adhere it directly to the clay. Place 1 key in each of the remaining 3 corners., In order to fill the mold, you must provide an opening. For this mold, the opening will appear at the top of the clay bed. Apply a thin layer of temporary adhesive over the top of the master item—the side not embedded in clay—and the top side of the clay bed (the side directly below the top of the master item). Press this side flush against a wooden or metal retaining wall. Allow it to dry., A layer of silicone mold putty will form 1 of the mold’s inner walls. Coat the master part with a release agent. Apply a layer of mold putty to the exposed half of the master item. Apply mold putty to the clay bed’s surface, carefully covering the alignment keys. Extend the molding putty ½ inch up the retaining wall., Apply a thin layer of temporary adhesive to the bottom side of the clay bed (the side parallel to the top of the master item). Press this side flush against a wooden or metal retaining wall. Allow the adhesive and the molding putty to cure for 1 hour., Due to the flexibility of cured molding putty, it is necessary to create a second more durable shell, known as a mother shell. You will create the mother shell with plaster sheets.


Cut 4 to 6 sheets of plasters. Each sheet should be 6 inches longer than the mold.
Layer the sheets on top of eachother.Dip the sheets in bowl filled with room temperature water for 1 second.
Remove the excess water by squeezing the sheets over the bowl. The sheets should be wet, not dripping with water.
Lay the sheets over the mold and up the retaining walls.
Press the sheets into the mold so that they form to the shape. Crease the edges along the retaining walls into crisp 90° angles—the plaster sheets lining the retaining walls will serve as feet.Allow the plaster to cure for 30 minutes., Once the plaster has hardened, remove the two retaining walls. Flip the entire mold over so that it is resting on the 2 plaster feet. Carefully remove the clay bed and any remnants remaining on the master part.


If the key alignments do not come off with the clay bed, remove these as well., When creating the second half of the 2 part mold, you will repeat the process you just completed:


Apply a release agent to the master part.
Attach the top of the mold to a retaining wall.
Coat the master part in a layer of molding putty.
Attach the bottom of the mold to a retaining wall.
Create a mother shell out of plaster sheets., Once the plaster has cured for 30 minutes, you can safely disassemble the mold. Remove the two retaining walls from the mold. Place the mold upside down on your workspace. Remove the mother shell and carefully peel away the silicone mold. Set aside the master part and reassemble the mold."

Dry your jars completely by preheating them.,
Assemble the candle wicks.,
Take the jars out of the oven and attach the wicks.,
Secure each wick in place.",How to Make a Scented Candle in a Glass1," Glass jars that are heat resistant work best because you will be pouring hot wax into them. If you're recycling old mugs, plant holders, or other containers, inspect them for cracks so that the wax won't aggravate the infrastructure.;
, Set the jars on a baking tray and place them in the oven on the ""keep warm"" setting or a low heat while you prepare the wax. Leave them in the oven for a few minutes to make them warmer than room temperature., You can buy pre-made candle wicks from a craft store with the metal collar attached at the end or put together your own. Buy the metal collars and uncut wicks separately, thread the wick through the collar, and use pliers to squeeze it tightly shut.It's best not to place a wick in a candle without a collar. The metal prevents the flame from heating the bottom of the glass jar to the point of breaking.If you use uncut wicks then you won't be limited to candle size or height.
For best results, buy pre-waxed wicks.

, Be careful as they may still be hot. Melt a few wax flakes in the microwave and place a few in the bottom of each jar. Before the wax cools, place the metal end or bare end of your wick in the wax and let it set.

, Lay a pencil or chopstick across the top of your jar and wrap or tape the wick to it. You want to make sure the wick remains upright so that when you pour the wax in, the wick won't fall down into the candle."

Measure out your wax flakes.,
Make a double boiler to melt the wax.,
Turn the stove to a low to medium heat.,
Test the temperature of the wax.,
Add color to your candle.,
Take the wax off the stove.,
Add the essential oils.",How to Make a Scented Candle in a Glass2," You want to have two times the amount of wax flakes than your jars' ounces.For example, an 8 oz jar will need 16 oz. of wax flakes. Use a heat-resistant glass measuring cup with a handle, such as a Pyrex cup, to measure and then later melt the flakes.


When choosing wax flakes, soy based wax burns longer than paraffin and some people prefer it as a natural ingredient.
Make sure that you buy wicks that are meant for soy candles if you choose to use soy instead of paraffin wax.

, All you will need is a medium sized pot or saucepan and a stovetop range. Place the measuring cup on the side of the pot and fill the pot with water. You want a lower level of water so that the water doesn't splash into the wax as it boils.

, You don't want a full rolling boil because that may cause the wax to overheat. Stir the wax with a wooden spoon as it melts so that all of the flakes are equally liquefied., You want to keep the temperature of the wax between 150°-180° F or 65°-80° C. Do not leave the wax unattended. This is so that it doesn't overheat but is mostly for safety. At these temperatures wax can burn skin easily.

, Break off small pieces of non-toxic wax crayon pieces to add a hue to the wax. A little bit goes a long way, so add the crayon in increments of a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) piece at a time.You can test out the color intensity as you go by dropping a little wax onto some parchment paper and letting it cool as the wax finishes melting.

, Once it reaches these temperatures and is fully melted, set the measuring cup aside. Let the wax cool down to 125° F or 50° C. You cannot add the essential oils or scents at a higher temperature because the scent can evaporate away. , For every 16 oz. of wax flakes, use ten drops of essential oils.You can mix and match scents and oils for a unique candle. For scent ideas, reference your own favorite candle scents or smell different oil combinations to determine what meshes and what clashes.

Place a tray or newspaper under your jars.,
Pour the wax into your jars slowly.,
Leave space at the top of the candle as you pour.,
Top off the candle with a little more wax.,
Trim the wick before burning.",How to Make a Scented Candle in a Glass3," In case the wax spills while pouring, protect your surface so that clean up is simple and easy. Dried wax is easier to clean up since the large pieces can be picked off and the residue spot-cleaned.

, Going slow and steady will prevent the wax from cracking when it settles and avoids creating air pockets within the jar., When the candle burns, the top layer of wax will melt and pool around the wick. You don't want the wax to overflow when you first start burning your candle.

, There can often be a sinkhole of wax that forms around the wick as it begins to set.Simply pour a little more wax into the sunken area and give the jar a light shake to settle the wax evenly.

, Leave about a quarter of an inch of wick above the top of the candle.If the wick is too long, will flop over and burn incorrectly. If it is too short, you will have trouble getting it to light and it may drown in the melted top layer of wax.

Cut 5 to 6 lengths of wire that are at least half-again as long as your crystal's circumference.,
Lay the wires out together in a single, flat bundle.,
Use your round-nose pliers to bend the end of each shorter length into a J-shaped hook.

,
Slide the hook around your flat bundle of longer wires.,
Repeat with the other 3 shorter wires, keeping the long wires in a flat bundle and spacing your perpendicular wrappings evenly around the length.

,
Wrap the flat wire bundle around a dowel, pen, or anything else that's slightly smaller in diameter than your crystal.,
Fit your crystal into the loop you made.,
Clip another short length of wire and use it to bind the 2 angles you just made together, closing the loop.

,
Bend the foremost wire on the flat bundle in from the sides; creating a rough setting for your crystal.

,
Set the crystal into the setting and tighten the other wires around it.,
Fold the loose wires at the top of the setting down to either side, creating twin loops.,
Thread a chain or cord through the twin loops to hang your wire-wrapped crystal.

",How to Wire Wrap a Crystal,";
, Cut 4 shorter lengths of wire.

,, Wrap the shorter wire around the longer wires several times, working as tight as possible against the long wires. Then snip the shorter wire off as close as possible to the bundle.

,, Cross 1 end of the wire over the other, and make sure you've positioned the loop you just made midway between the ends of the wire.

, Note where the wires cross at the top of the crystal, remove the crystal, then use your chain nose pliers to bend each side of the wire wrap at a 90-degree angle just where the wires cross.


Each bend should face out, so you create a rough ""V"" shape at the top of the loop. In other words, don't cross the wires yet.

,,,


If you position the wires carefully, you can hide the out-of-shape wires on the backside of the store, or bend them into intentional, decorative shapes for display on the front.

, Clip the excess wire away.


If you're using semi-hard wire and the crystal isn't very heavy, the loops may hold on their own. For extra security, wrap 1 or 2 of the wires around the binding you made at the top of the setting before you clip.

Choose the type of wire for your crafting needs.,
Match your crochet needle hook to the gauge, hardness of the wire and desired loop pattern.,
Avoid cutting the wire into long strands.,
Keep the wire rolled up in its original spool and keep it as close to you as you can.",How to Wire Crochet1,"


Annealed wire is one of the most pliable and easy to use for most wire-crafting needs.

Another good example to choose from is copper wire, it is flexible, strong, and shines.
Galvanized wire is very strong and resists corrosion, however it is harder to bend and shape it.

;
, The thickness of the wire gauge you use will influence how big or small you will be able to form the loops. As the wire gets thicker it will also be harder to bend.


Avoid using wooden or plastic hooks. The tension of the wires will dent and deform the wood needles and the plastic needles will break very easily.
Select Aluminum or steel needle that is smooth and have a thicker flat section near the grips. You will use this part of your needles to check and maintain an uniform size for your loops.

, Having loose wire that is longer than 18 inches (46 cm) can cause the wire to get tangled or kink. It is also a safety hazard; someone could trip over it or it can injure someone.


Calculate the wire length that you will need for the pattern or size of your job. It is best to use one single length of wire for the entire piece.
Don't waste excess wire or end up cutting the length of wire too short to complete your piece.

, If the spool is too big roll a sufficient amount of wire onto a smaller spool or wind it into a small loop that you can hold with your hand.

"
"
Plan the right number of stitches for the pattern of the piece you intend to make.,
Cut out a 18 - 24 inch strand of wire.,
Do not wind the wire on your pinkie or bend it around your forefinger.,
Tie a slip knot.,
Holding the wire with one hand and the hook with the other stick the crochet hook through the slipknot and grab the wire with your hook.,
Continue making the desired number of chain stitches and checking the diameter of each loop using the wide part of the crochet hook to keep an uniform shape.,
Turn your work and slip stitch a row.,
Repeat until you finish the slip stitch row.,
Keep practicing until you can also crochet more intricate stitches like single crochet, Half double crochet, Double crochet, Treble crochet, etc.

",How to Wire Crochet2," To start with your piece you first have to crochet a chain of stitches before you crochet the loops that the pattern calls for.

, You will have to practice holding the wire and needle in a way that the wire won't bend unnecessarily until you are comfortable and feels natural.


Although, the principle of crocheting with yarn and wire is similar, wire behaves differently. You will find that even though you may have experience crocheting yarn, the properties of wire will require you to handle it differently.

, Wire hardens slightly when it is bent and can also create kinks that will make your pattern sloppy and uneven.


Hold the wire straight between your forefinger and middle finger sliding it instead.
Pinch the end with your thumb and the other two fingers pulling just enough to create the tension needed to keep the wire straight from the spool.
To maintain the tension needed for good even stitches you must secure the spool allowing it to slowly unwind and reel it in towards you using your forefinger and middle-finger. You are now ready to cast on and begin to crochet.

, Leaving at least a 4 inch tail at the end, loop the wire twice around your forefinger and middle finger.Then, with the crochet hook grab one piece of the wire and pull it through the loop towards you. Pull from the tail end until it tightens around your hook. You just made the slipknot.

, The wire should be under the crochet hook and twisting counterclockwise coil the wire around it so that it begins to bend into a loop.


Once the wire takes the circular shape twisted around your crochet hook, you can pull it towards you through the loop hole. You have made your first wire chain stitch.

, You may have to lay them down and flatten it to keep the shape neat.

, With one loop on your hook stick the crochet hook through the chain stitch loop and catch & coil the wire and pull through both loops towards you. You made your first wire slip-stitch.

,


Keep checking your loops with the wide part of the crochet hook often to maintain the pattern shape.

Check the hardness of the wire.,
Consider the ductility of the wire.,
Get used to malleability as a key element for wire work.,
Consider the rigidity of the wire.,
Learn about tensile strength of wire.,
Learn about the different wire shapes.",How to Understand the Characteristics of Wire," Hardness refers to the ease with which the wire can be shaped, scored, indented, or pitted. Hardness impacts the final look or sheen of a wire project and can impact on how well the project presents. If you are using copper or aluminium, you are working with soft metals, whereas iron is hard.;
, Ductility refers to the ability of a metal to be turned into a wire width. Finer wires are made from the most ductile metals, and less ductile metals produce thicker wires. The order of ductility is (most to least):


Gold
Silver
Platinum
Iron
Copper
Aluminium
Zinc
Tin
Lead

, Malleability refers to the ability of the metal to be flattened without breaking or splitting. This is often a very important aspect of wire work! If you are not sure, always practise on a test piece first and hammer it flat to see what happens. The order of malleability is as follows (most malleable to least):


Gold (so malleable it can be made into foil and gold leaf for cakes)
Silver
Aluminium
Copper
Tin
Platinum
Lead
Zinc
Iron

, Rigidity is the opposite of malleability. It will be important in some projects that your wire does not have any give so that the shape of the project is maintained for a long duration.

, Tensile strength refers to how much stress a wire can take when stretched at either end. This can be important for stretched jewellery projects, or for sculptures that require balancing or holding up of some elements. Copper has an excellent tensile strength.

, When purchasing your wire, it can come in a variety of possible shapes, such as round, half-round, square, and flat. Also, you will need to familiarise yourself with the differing gauges of wire available. The thinness and thickness of the wire you choose will be dependent on the projects you are making. Visit a store and check them out, feel them and see what works for you. It can help to purchase a range of samples to play around with in your workshop to see what works best for your creativity.

Design the stickers.,
Cut out the stickers.,
Make the glue.,
Paint the stickers.,
Lick the stickers.",How to Make Stickers1," When you're making your own stickers, the sky is the limit in terms of design. Use whatever drawing materials you want: colored pencils, markers, pastels, crayons, anything. Make sure the markers, pastels, or other drawing utensil are not washable.Draw the sticker designs on a thin piece of paper, such as loose leaf paper or paper from a notepad. Consider these creative options when you're thinking up sticker designs:



Draw a self-portrait, or portraits of your friends or pets.
Cut out neat pictures and words from magazines and newspapers.
Print out pictures you find online, or pictures you've uploaded to your computer. Print them on thin computer paper, rather than photo paper, for best results.
Use sticker sheets you find online with premade stickers you can print out.
Make pictures using rubber stamps.
Decorate the picture with glitter.;
, Use scissors to cut out the designs you drew or printed. Make the stickers as large or as small as you like. For fun edges, use scrapbook scissors that cut in fun designs.









Try using a paper puncher to make heart, star, and other shaped stickers from patterned paper.

, This glue is safe for kids to use as they brush and lick the stickers. It acts as an adhesive that will bind the stickers to most surfaces but doesn't include harsh chemicals.To make it, mix the following ingredients in a bowl until they are thoroughly combined:









An envelope of plain gelatin
4 tablespoons boiling water
1 teaspoon sugar or corn syrup
A few drops of peppermint extract or vanilla, for flavoring.Use different kinds of extract for fun flavors! Apply different flavors to different kinds of stickers, make stickers for your friends with surprise flavors, or use certain holiday-themed flavors for Christmas, Valentine's Day, or Easter.
When you are finished with the glue, store it in a pill bottle or airtight container in the refrigerator. The glue will gel overnight. To liquefy it, place the container in a bowl of hot water.This glue can also be used to seal envelopes, too.

, Turn the stickers upside down on a sheet of waxed paper or aluminum foil. Use a paint brush or a pastry brush to paint the backs of the stickers with the glue mixture. When you're finished, let the mixture dry completely.









There's no need to soak the stickers completely with the adhesive; just brush on a light coating.
Make sure the stickers are completely dry before you use them.
Store your stickers in a plastic bag or a box until you are ready to use them.

, When you're ready to stick the stickers to various surfaces, simply lick the back, like you would a stamp, and press them down against the surface for a moment. The homemade glue is quite strong, so be careful where you stick them.

Cut stickers out of magazines or print your own designs.,
Cover the sticker designs with packing tape.,
Rub the front of the stickers.,
Run the stickers under warm water.,
Let the stickers dry.",How to Make Stickers2," For this method, you'll need designs that have already been printed on paper with water-resistant ink. You can use shiny magazines or books, or you can experiment with the ink your printer uses to print out designs from your computer. If you are printing pictures, make a test copy to get a little wet before you try to make a print sticker.Cut out pictures and words you like using a pair of scissors.









When choosing pictures, think about the width of the packing tape. Each sticker should be able to fit on one strip. The picture can be the size of the packing tape or smaller.
If you want a larger sticker, you will have to place two pieces of packing tape stacked on each other. This can be tricky. You will have to align the tape so that they overlap just a little bit so you have no paper peeking through. This can mess up your sticker. You will have a seam where the two pieces of tape meet.

, Cut a piece of clear packing tape large enough to cover an entire cut-out design. Place it on the front of the design that you cut or printed out. Press down so that the tape adheres to the design.









When placing the tape on the sticker, make sure to carefully place the tape over the design. Moving the tape after you have started to adhere it can tear the picture. Also, try to not have any bubbles or wrinkles in the tape when you apply it.
Consider using double-sided tape. Double-sided adhesive comes in many forms - rolls, sheets or even sticker maker machines such as Xyron
Consider using Washi Tape. Washi Tape is similar to packing tape; it's great to use for stickers because it sticks when you want, and easily peels off when you want. If you are looking for a stronger sticker, you could even use duct tape. Washi Tape is available in various colors and patterns.

, Use a penny or your nail to press on the front of the stickers and rub the surface, so that the tape starts to bind with the ink on the paper. Continue for a couple of minutes to ensure that the ink and the adhesive become one.








, One at a time, run them under the water with the paper side facing the stream of water until it begins to fall apart. The ink won't wash away, but the paper should completely dissolve. You can help it along by scratching some away.









Make sure you get all of the surfaces of the tape wet instead of only focusing on one spot. If you focus on only one part, only that part will be visible.
If the paper won't come off, continue running it under warm water.
An alternate way is to submerge the sticker in a bowl of warm water. Place the sticker completely in the water and allow it to soak for a few minutes.

, Once the paper is gone, let the stickers completely dry so that the tape's adhesive will become sticky again. Use scissors to trim away any extra tape around the design, then stick the stickers to the surfaces of your choice.








"
"
Buy sticker paper.,
Design your stickers.,
Cut out the stickers.,
Remove the paper backing.",How to Make Stickers3," Craft or office supply stores sell paper that has adhesive on one side. It's usually lined with a paper backing that you can peel off when you're ready to use the sticker.


Alternately, you can buy tacky sticker sheets. These sheets allow you to place a picture to the glue, then peel the sticker off, transferring the glue to the back of the sticker. This is great if you want to use sticker sheets with pictures you already have or those cut from magazines.Buy paper that fits the specifications of your printer.
If you don't have a printer, you can still use sticker paper by drawing your own designs on the surface of the paper or cutting out pictures from magazines and books.

, Design the stickers on your computer or use markers or a pen to draw directly on the surface of your sticker paper. You're only limited by the size of the paper - if you want, you could make an 8 1/2"" by 11"" sticker!









Design stickers on your computer using Adobe Photoshop, Paint, or another program that allows you to draw. You could also simply save some photos from your personal album or the internet to use as stickers. When you're finished, print the sticker designs onto the sticker paper.
If you have a physical photograph or drawing that you want to make into a sticker, you can scan it onto your computer or upload a digital photo. Format this file on Photoshop. Paint, Word, or Adobe Acrobat, then print it onto the sticker paper.
Draw directly on the sticker paper with pens, pencils, or even paint. Just make sure you don't get the paper too wet, or it may interfere with the adhesive.

, Use scissors to cut out the designs you printed or drew. Cut simple square shapes or use scrapbook scissors to give the designs interesting edges. Space all designs of stickers at least 1/8 an inch apart to prevent cutting accidents.









When using tacky sticker sheets, simply pull back the protective liner, revealing the glue. Place the back of your sticker to the glue. Press down to make sure the sticker adheres to the glue. Then, peel the sticker - the glue will now be on the back of the sticker. Stick on any surface. You will need to use the sticker right away because there is no protective cover on the back.
You can cut slightly wide to leave a white border around the image, or you can cut it close. More advanced sticker creators sometimes leave no border and cut with an Exacto-knife.

, When you're ready to use the stickers, peel away the paper protective liner and stick them to the surface of your choice.

After designing and cutting your stickers, brush some of the repositionable glue on the back of your sticker. Let them completely dry. Then stick and peel and stick again!







, Draw pictures, shapes, or words onto printable mailing labels. These can be purchased at office supply stores. Cut around the shape, then peel the label off. Place the sticker on wax paper if you don't want to use it right then.








, Draw your design on any paper, or cut pictures from magazines. After the sticker has been cut to the shape you want, place double back tape on the back of the sticker. Cut the tape down so it doesn't go over the sides of the sticker. Place on wax paper until you are ready to use the sticker.







, Draw your designs on the shiny side of the contact paper using sharpies. Cut out the stickers around your designs. Peel off the paper backing and stick to whatever surface you choose.








Contact paper stickers are translucent. They are good to use on colored construction paper.

, If you want to make a lot of stickers and you're willing to spend a little more money ($15 - $20), you can buy a sticker maker machine from a craft store or the Internet. Place your sticker (a drawing, a photo, even a ribbon) into the sticker maker and then pull it through the machine. Some have a crank and you just crank it through, or some you stick it in one side and pull it out the other, and it will apply the adhesive for you. When the stickers run through, they're ready to use: just peel and stick."

Making decals from contact paper is more inexpensive than using a computer and requires fewer materials.
This method is better for simpler designs which don't require a detailed rendering.;
, You can also work on it using photo editing software.


For wall decals, create a sketch of the room where you plan to put the design.
Make sure it's somewhat to scale and includes furniture.
If you are using software like Photoshop, scan in a picture of the room and add the design to the photo digitally.

, Do this based on your drawing and the scale of the room or item where you are putting it.


Contact paper is available in various roll sizes and colors from online stores and home improvement stores.
Make sure you buy enough for your project and allocate for mistakes and waste.
If you are working on a large area, it's a good idea to buy in bulk to save money.

Laminate the page with a cold press laminator.,
Cut out the decal and apply it to your object.",How to Make Decals2," You will need a computer or graphics tablet, scanner, photo editing software, a printer, vinyl sheet paper, laminate sheets, a laminator, scissors and/or an X-acto knife.You don't necessarily need to use a graphics tablet, but editing images can be simpler on these devices as you use your finger or a stylus to make changes rather than a mouse.
An optional thing to use is a Pantone color guide. This can standardize colors.
You can use this color guide to select a color and then use the Pantone color settings on your photo editing software to get the right color when you print your design.

, If you are skilled at digital design, another option is to draw the image in Photoshop or another graphic design or photo editing software program. Make sure you scan in the highest quality possible to make sure your image does not get distorted.
It is recommended that you scan your decal into your computer at 600dpi resolution and no lower than 300dpi resolution.
You can also obtain images on the internet to edit or use.

, You can use popular software such as Photoshop or GIMP to do this.


Make adjustments as needed to colors and shapes.
Resize the image so that it fits the space you want to cover.

, Make sure it's facing the right way since printing on the wrong side may make the paper unusable.


If you aren't sure whether the paper should be placed face down or face up, use a plain white piece of paper to test.
Make a mark on one side, and then print to see which side is printed.

, This way you can fit as many decals onto one sheet of paper as possible.Make sure the designs don't overlap as you'll need to cut these out later.
This is a good way to prevent wasting vinyl paper, as it can be costly.
You can create these using photo-editing software.
Print your decal sheet. Make sure you print this on the white vinyl paper.

, Check the color, brightness and contrast to make sure the printed version has the results you want.


Sometimes colors and shapes don't look the same on screen vs. on paper, so it is a good idea to do this step to check your design.
Make any adjustments to your design and print it again to double check it.
Hold the mock-up next to the wall or object you intend to put the decal on to make sure it looks correct.

, Make sure it's facing the right way since printing on the wrong side may make the paper unusable.If you aren't sure whether the paper should be placed face down or face up, use a plain white piece of paper to test.
Make a mark on one side, and then print to see which side is printed.
If the printer ink won't stick to the vinyl paper, you have printed on the wrong side of the paper.

, Follow the instructions for the laminator to feed the image correctly.The laminator will protect the design and keep the colors from fading.
Press the laminate sheet down onto the decal sheet, sticky side down. The backing sheet from the laminate should be folded back several inches.
Feed the laminate sheet through the cold press laminator. As you do this the backing sheet from the laminate will separate.
Trim the excess laminate from your decal sheet before sending it through the laminator for best results.

, You can do this using sharp scissors.


Cut the decals out carefully, making sure to stay close to the outline of the decal.
You can trim any excess decal after it was been applied with an X-acto knife.
Peel off the backing from the vinyl sheet and stick the decal to your object.

Cut eight 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) long strips of duct tape.,
Lay four strips down on the table, sticky-side up, with the long edges overlapping by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter).,
Lay down the rest of the four strips on top of the sheet, one at a time.,
Consider making a border for your wallet.,
Trim the narrow ends of the sheet until it is 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) long.,
Fold the sheet in half lengthwise so that you end up with a long, skinny rectangle.,
Cut a 4-inch (10.16 centimeters) long strip of duct tape, then cut it in half lengthwise.,
Tape the sides of the wallet shut.,
Fold your wallet in half, widthwise, if desired.",How to Make a Duct Tape Wallet (Easy Method)1," You can lay them out on your table sticky-side-up, or you can tape them to the edge of your table. This will keep them out of the way while you work.;
, Try to align the side edges as much as possible, but don't worry if they aren't perfect. You will be trimming the wallet down later.

, Be sure to overlap the edges by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter) again. To make your wallet smoother, lay the first strip ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter) down from the top. This will stagger your tape pieces, otherwise, your wallet will be four layers thick in some areas. This can make it hard to fold.If you staggered your tape pieces, fold the top and bottom edges down so that the sticky side doesn't show., Cut a 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) strip of duct tape, then cut it in half length-wise. Fold one of the strips over the top edge of the sheet, and the other strip over the bottom edge of the sheet. This will give you a cleaner edge.This border can match your duct tape sheet, or you can use a contrasting color.
You can also use two 10-inch (25.4 centimeters) strips of narrow or thin duct tape (also called ""mini"" duct tape). It is already the right width so you don't have to cut it in half.

, Be sure to trim both ends of the sheet. This will get rid of any unevenness.

, Try to fold it so that the back part is a little bit higher than the front. This way, your wallet will look neater when you close it., You will be using this to tape the edges of your wallet shut. You can make it the same color as your wallet, or you can use a contrasting color. If you added a border to your wallet earlier, consider using the same color.


You can also use narrow or thin duct tape for this instead. Simply cut two 4-inch (10.16 centimeters) strips of narrow duct tape.

, Align the 4-inch (10.16 centimeters) strip along one of the narrow edges of your wallet, then fold the excess over to the back. Repeat this step for the other side of the wallet with the other strip.

, You can also leave it unfolded, so that it is a bi-fold wallet. This way, you won't have to worry about your money getting a crease in the middle.

Cut six 12-inch (30.48 centimeters) long strips of duct tape.,
Lay three of those strips down, sticky-side-up, with the long edges overlapping by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter).,
Lay the other three strips on top of the duct tape fabric, sticky-side-down.,
Trim the sides of the duct tape sheet so that it is 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) long.,
Cut one of the narrow edges into a point or curve to make the wallet flap.,
Fold the sheet into thirds, widthwise.,
Cut a strip of duct tape, then cut it in half lengthwise.,
Seal the sides of your wallet with the narrow strips of duct tape.,
Use a Velcro dot to close the flap.",How to Make a Duct Tape Wallet (Easy Method)2," You can spread the strips on your work surface, sticky-side-up, or you can place them along the edge of your table.


This will give you a simple, square-shaped pouch. It is perfect for holding coins. You can also use it to hold paper money if you fold them up first.

, You should have a sheet of duct tape when you are done. This is part of your duct tape sheet.

, Remember to overlap the edges by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter). Try to align the side edges as much as you can, but don't worry if they aren't perfect. You'll be trimming the wallet down later.

, This will not only get the sheet to the right size, but it will also get rid of any uneven edge.

, Draw the lines using a pen first, then cut along it using a pair of scissors. If you are having troubles drawing a neat curve, use a cup or plate as a template., When you are done, you should end up with a square shape. This is the body of your wallet.

, Each strip needs to be the same height as your wallet. You will be using this to seal the edges. It can be the same color or pattern as your pouch, or it can be a contrasting one.


You can also use narrow/thin/mini duct tape. It is already the right width, so you don't have to cut it in half lengthwise. Simply cut two equal pieces.

, Be careful not to tape down the flap! If you have any excess tape hanging over the top or bottom of your wallet, you can trim it off with a pair of scissors.

, Open up the wallet, and place a Velcro dot on the point of the triangle (or the top center of the curve). Place the other Velcro dot on the corresponding spot on the body of the wallet.

Wash out a jar with a tight-fitting lid.,
Find some craft glue.,
Open the bottle of glue, and pour it into the container.,
Add the water into the container.,
Add gloss or varnish to make it shiny.,
Consider making sparkly Mod Podge.,
Close the lid tightly and shake it.",How to Make Mod Podge1," You will need a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid that can hold 12 ounces (355 milliliters). The jar can be made out of glass or plastic.


If you plan on making glossy or glittery Mod Podge, you will need a slightly-larger jar.;
, You will need about 8 ounces (225 milliliters) of white, liquid glue—the sort kids use in school. If your bottle already contains 8 ounces/225 milliliters (or close to it) then you will not need to measure it out. If your bottle contains more glue, however, then you will need to pour the glue into a measuring cup to make sure that you have the right amount.


Consider using an acid-free scrapbooking glue. It is more durable and less-likely to yellow than regular glue., You can simply rest the glue bottle over the rim of the jar and let the glue drain on its own, or you can squeeze it out. If the glue is thick and will not come out easily, you can pour a little bit of hot, boiling water into the glue bottle, close the cap tightly, and shake. The hot water will help loosen the glue. Open the glue bottle again and pour it into the jar—it should come out easier now.


Consider warming the glue in a microwave for about 30 seconds (or fewer, depending on the strength of your microwave). This will help the glue bottle empty easier and faster.

, Once the glue has completely drained, pour 4 ounces (112.50 milliliters) of water into the jar and stir to combine it.

, Your Mod Podge will be matte by default, but you can make it shiny by adding 2 tablespoons of a water-based gloss or varnish. Simply add the gloss or varnish after you have added the water., If you wish to make glittery Mod Podge, add 2 tablespoons of glitter into the mixture. This is most effective when combined with the water-based varnish or gloss., Once You have added everything into the jar, close the lid tightly and shake it to mix everything together. If any of the Mod Podge seeps out from under the lid, simply clean it off with a damp cloth.

Consider the requirements of your project.,
Find a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid.,
Combine flour and sugar in a pot.,
Add the water and stir.,
Turn on the stove and stir the ingredients.,
Remove the pot from the stove and let it cool.,
Transfer everything the mixture into a jar.,
Close the lid and store the Mod Podge in a cool place.",How to Make Mod Podge2," Because the Mod Podge you will be making in this section uses flour and sugar, the finished texture may be a little grainy. Keep this in mind when using this version as a sealer.

, You will need a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid. It should be able to hold 12 ounces (355 milliliters). The jar can be made out of glass or plastic.

, Sift 1 ½ cups (210 grams) of flour and ¼ cup (56.25 grams) of granulated sugar into a pot. Do not place the pot on the store, and do not turn the stove on just yet.

, Pour 1 cup (225 milliliters) of cold water into the pot and beat rapidly with a whisk to mix everything together and get rid of any clumps.


Consider adding ¼ teaspoon of oil. This will help make the product glossier in the end.

, Use medium heat and do not let the contents of the pot boil. You want to end up with a thick, glue-like consistency. If the mixture starts to become too thick, then add more water and keep stirring.


Consider adding vinegar. Adding ¼ teaspoon of vinegar can help control fungus and mold from developing in your Mod Podge. If you choose to add vinegar, do so after you have removed the pot from the stove, and give the Mod Podge one, final stir., Once the mixture has thickened, turn the stove off, and set the pot down onto a heat-resistant surface. Let the mixture cool completely before proceeding to the next steps, or else the Mod Podge may begin to ferment.

, Hold the pot over your jar and carefully tip the contents into the jar. You can use a spoon or spatula to help guide the mixture. If necessary, you may give the mixture a stir once everything is in the jar.

, Once again, make sure that your Mod Podge is completely cool before you place the lid on. Because you have made your Mod Podge out of natural ingredients, you will need to store it in a cool place, such as a refrigerator. Use it within a week or two. If it starts to rot and mold, discard it."
"
Consider adding a label the jar.,
Use Mod Podge to decorate boxes and other items.,
Consider tinting your Mod Podge.,
Consider sealing your project.",How to Make Mod Podge3," You can design and print a label using adhesive paper, or you can make a label from scratch using a piece of paper and clear tape. Make the label after you have poured the Mod Podge into the container and shaken it up. Here is how you can make a label from scratch, without a computer or printer:Write ""Mod Podge"" or ""Decoupage"" on a small piece of paper.
Cut a piece of clear, packaging tape that is bigger than your label.
Place the label face down onto the middle of the piece of tape.
Wrap the packing tape around the glass container. Smooth the tape down to rid the label of any air bubbles.

, Simply apply a thin layer of Mod Podge to the area you want decorated using a paint brush. You can also use a foam brush as well. Press your fabric or paper onto the wet Mod Podge, making sure to smooth out any ripples, bubbles or creases. Apply a second, thin layer of Mod Podge on top of your fabric or paper. You can always apply another coat of Mod Podge after the first one has dried., If you made Mod Podge out of glue and water, you can add a few drops of food coloring, and then paint it over some mason jars. This will create colored mason jars. Be sure to add 2 tablespoons of water-based gloss or varnish to your Mod Podge, or else the jars will be matte and frosted-looking.


If you wish to create tinted mason jars that look like sea glass, then omit the varnish.

, Your homemade Mod Podge will not be as durable as the store-bought variety. You can make it more durable by wait until it has dried completely (several hours) and then applying spray-on acrylic sealer.


Simply hold the can six to eight inches away from the surface and spray the paint on using light, even strokes. Once the sealer has dried, you may add a second coat, if necessary.
If you added varnish or glitter to your Mod Podge to make it glossy, be sure that you use an acrylic sealer with a gloss finish.

Know that homemade Mod Podge is not the same as store-bought Mod Podge.,
Keep in mind that homemade Mod Podge costs less than Store-bought Mod Podge.,
Understand that the quality between the two is different.,
Know that the finish differs between the two.,
Understand that flour-based Mod Podge is perishable.",How to Make Mod Podge4," When making and using these recipes, keep in mind that homemade Mod Podge is not the same as store-bought Mod Podge. There are several differences between the two, and this section will address them.

, Store-bought Mod Podge can be very expensive, so it is no surprise that many crafters attempt to make their own recipes out of materials many of them already have at home.

, Homemade Mod Podge is usually made using watered-down glue, so it lacks some of the properties that store-bought Mod Podge has. Store-bought Mod Podge can be used as both an adhesive and sealant, making it durable. The homemade version is less-adhesive, and lacks varnish or sealer.To make your homemade Mod Podge more durable, consider spraying your project with an acrylic sealant after the Mod Podge has dried., Store-bought Mod Podge comes in all sorts of finishes from glossy, to satin, to matte. It even comes in glow-in-the-dark and sparkling varieties. Unless you add varnish or glitter, your homemade Mod Podge will be matte.


Flour-based Mod Podge will may leave behind some residue or a grainy texture., It is possible to make Mod Podge out of completely edible and non-toxic materials, such as flour. Unfortunately, this also makes the final product perishable. You must store it in a cool place and use it within a week or two, or else it will expire and begin to rot."

Add a Velcro closure.",How to Make a Woven Duct Tape Purse," This will be for your horizontal stripes. You can use solid colored duct tape or patterned duct tape.;
, This will be for your vertical stripes. To make a more interesting looking bag, use a contrasting color. It would not be a good idea to use patterned duct tape for this, because it will make your bag look too busy.

, This will make a crease, which you will later use as a guideline. Use the same color as your long, vertical strips., Make sure that the vertical strips do not go past that creased guideline you made earlier. Also, make sure that the vertical strips are placed side-by-side so that their edges are touching. You will have an inch or so of excess duct tape to either side of your vertical strips, which is fine.

, If you'd like, you can trim off any excess tape at this point.

, Weave the strips over and under, from one side to the other. Every so often, push your horizontal strips down so that there aren't any gaps.

, It might be a good idea to do this every couple of inches to keep your work neat. To prevent any gaps, overlap each strip by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters). You can use the same color or pattern as your horizontal strips, or you can use the same color as your vertical strips.


The lining adds extra security to your bag. It will prevent items, like pencils, from poking through the weaving and falling out., Run the tape along one of the longest edges, with half of the sticky side out. Flip your weaving over, and fold the rest of the tape down. Repeat this step for the other side.


Match the color to your vertical strips.

, For this, you can simply cut a 12 to 14-inch (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) long strip of duct tape, and use it to cover the last, raw edge at the top of your weaving. Alternatively, you can also cut the top into a slightly rounded shape, and then cover the edges with duct tape. This will create the flap part of your purse., Use the same color as the vertical stripes on your bag.

, Overlap the long edges by ¼-inch. This will make one side of your duct tape sheet.Putting the tape sticky-side-down prevents the tape from sticking to your fingers while you work, making things easier., Remember to overlap the long edges by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters).

, Cut the narrow edges down until the sheet is 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) long. Then, cut down the long edges at an angle until the sheet is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) at one end, and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) at the other end.


Repeat the first few steps to make another trapezoid sheet just like this one.

, Be sure to use a color that matches the edging and side panel. For extra security, flip the bag over, and place a strip of tape on the back of the seam.


Repeat this step for the other side of your bag.
If you cut one of the narrow ends of your weaving into a rounded shape, make sure that you start from the other end.

, Place a strip of tape (about 8 inches/20.32 centimeters long) over the edge of the 8 rows that you counted earlier, so that half of it is sticking out over the edge. Fold the side flap and the woven material towards each other until the edges meet. Press the tape onto the side panel of the bag. If you'd like, you can add another strip of tape on the outside of the bag.


Make sure that you are using the same color as your edging/side panel.
Repeat this step for the other side of the bag.
You'll notice that the weaving is longer than your side panels. This is fine; your purse closes with a flap!

, You can use the same color as your lining, or a contrasting one.

, You might find it easier to place the strips sticky-side-down. This way, the tape won't stick to your fingers as much, and make it easier to work with.

, Remember to overlap the edges by ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters). Try to be as neat as possible, especially along the long edges. Don't worry if the narrow, side edges are messy.

, Be sure to trim the tape off on both sides. This will get rid of any unevenness.

, This will give you a cleaner edge. You can use the same color as your sheet, or a contrasting on.

, Cut 2 strips of tape, about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) long, and use them to tape down the side edges of your pocket. Make sure that the tape does not go past the top of your pocket, or it won't open all the way. Cut another strip of tape, and use it to tape down the bottom edge of your pocket; make sure that it covers the tape you used on the sides as well.

, These will become your strap, so you can make it as long as you'd like. The color can match either the vertical or horizontal strips you made earlier.


Consider measuring the shoulder strap of your favorite bag, and using it as a guide.

, To keep the strip steady, you can tape it to your table at either end with small pieces of regular tape., Each of these strips will be hanging half-way over the edge of your first strip. They should be touching in the center of your first strip, but not overlapping.

, You should now have a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) wide strip made out of duct tape. At this point, you can trim off any unevenness at either end.

, Be sure to apply tape to both the inside and the outside of the purse.

, Find the center of the top flap of your bag, and place a Velcro dot or square. Find the corresponding spot on the body of your bag, and place the matching Velcro dot or square on it.

Allow the leaves to dry.",How to Make Skeleton Leaves1," The best type of leaves to work with have a waxy, glossy surface, like magnolia or gardenia leaves., You will need ½ to ¾ cups (70 to 105 grams) of washing soda and 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water. Give the solution a gentle stir to combine it.Do not use baking soda; it is not the same thing.Washing soda is also called ""sodium carbonate."" You can find it in the laundry section of grocery stores and supermarkets., Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat first, then reduce it to a simmer. Cook the leaves until they turn soft. This will take about 90 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the type of leaf you are using.The water will evaporate as you simmer it. Add more water to the pot as needed so that the leaves don't dry out., Put on a pair of plastic or rubber gloves first. Next, use a pair of tongs or a spatula to remove the leaves from the water.If the leaves are pulpy and gloopy, soak them in a tub filled with water; this will make cleaning them easier later on.

, Hold the leaves by the stem with tweezers, and use a paintbrush or a soft toothbrush to gently brush the pulp away. Turn the leaf over, and scrape the other side clean too.It would be even better if you work while the leaves are under water.Be very gentle during this step; the leaves will be fragile., The leaves will be very delicate at this stage, so be gentle with them. Fill a tub with water, and soak the leaves in the water. You can gently swish them about, but only if you are careful. Change the water and repeat the step, if necessary.

Do not rinse the leaves under running away; the force of the stream will damage them.

, If you want the leaves to dry flat, you will need to place them between two paper towels and heavy books. The paper towels will help absorb the excess moisture while the books will help make the leaves dry flat.

Use bleach to turn the leaf skeletons white.,
Soak the leaves in food coloring or liquid watercolor for a dyed effect.,
Paint the leaves with liquid watercolor or food coloring.,
Spray paint the leaves if you want a metallic effect.",How to Make Skeleton Leaves3," Soak the leaves in a solution of 1 cup (240 milliliters) water and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) bleach. Once the leaves turn white, take them out of the bleach water, and rinse them in fresh water. Let them dry completely between two heavy books.This process should take about 20 minutes., Mix water with enough food coloring or liquid watercolor to get the shade you want. Soak the leaves in the solution for up to 20 minutes, then lift them out. Rinse them in fresh water, then left them dry between two books., Pour your desired colors into small cups or caps. Use a soft, watercolor paintbrush to paint the leaves with the dye. You can paint the leaves a solid color, or you can paint bands to create an ombre effect.Let the leaves dry between two books when you are done.

Avoid using brushes with stiff bristles; they can damage the leaf skeletons.

, Set the leaves down onto a paper towel. Lightly spray them with metallic spray paint. Use a pair of tweezers to lift the leaves up. Transfer them to a clean paper towel, and let them dry. Repeat the process for the other side.

Don't let the leaves dry on the spray painted paper towel, or they will stick.
Use floral spray paint for even better results.

Add some bling with seed beads, glitter, or rhinestones.,
Use dried leaves to make a bowl or box.,
Use the leaves in scrapbooking and card making.,
Decoupage the leaves onto glass votives or vases.,
String the leaves onto a garland.",How to Make Skeleton Leaves4," Outline the leaf and/or the center stem with liquid glue, then sprinkle on extra-fine scrapbooking glitter. You can also use tiny, glass seed beads or tiny rhinestones instead. Alternatively, you can draw designs onto the leaves using glitter glue.

Don't use the regular kind of glitter. It will be too chunky for this project.

, Cover your bowl or box with plastic wrap. Mix equal amounts of glue and warm water. Dip the leaves into the glue, then smooth them onto the bowl or box. Let them dry, then lift the leaves off; peel away any plastic wrap stuck to the leaves.Add a sprinkle of extra-fine glitter to the glue for some sparkle.

, You can glue the leaves to cards and scrapbooking paper using a glue stick. You can also paint the back of the leaf with a thin layer of liquid glue, and stick it to the project instead.For a fancier touch, use a shaped hole puncher or a craft blade to use an interesting shape (ie: heart, star, moon, etc) out of the middle of the leaf.You can also use the leaves to make prints instead. Paint the back with watercolor, press them against paper, then peel them away.

, Wipe the glass object with rubbing alcohol first. Paint it with glossy decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge). Apply a thin layer of decoupage glue onto the back of the leaf, then paint it onto the glass object. Coat the leaf with a final layer of decoupage glue., Thread the leaves right through the joint where the center stem meets the base stem. You can even make several garlands, then hang them from vertically to create a backdrop."

Gather the materials.,
Cut the ribbon.,
Position the strands.,
Make the loops.,
Add a button.,
Make a stem.",How to Make Satin Ribbon Flowers1," You can make a simple flower with ribbon by forming loops for the petals, and securing them with a stitch or some glue. If you want to try this method you will need to gather up your ribbon, a button for each flower you want to make, some thread and a needle. You can also use a glue gun if you have one.


If you want to make the optional stem, you will need floral wire and floral tape.For this method you should use a heavy double-faced satin ribbon that will keep its shape.;
, Now cut the ribbon strands to the desired length. This will depend on how big you want your flowers to be. Try 13-inch strips for a large flower and 6-inch strips for a small flower. The number of strips you use will also depend on the size of the flower, and how many loop petals you want it to have.









A simple flower could be made from just four lengths.For a flower with a fuller look and more petals, try eight using 8 lengths of ribbon., Now you need to place the ribbon strands down in a star pattern, before making the loops. Start by placing one ribbon in a vertical line down the centre and then placing a ribbon horizontally across the middle of this ribbon to form a cross.









Then you can lay the other ribbon strands in diagonal lines evenly across the cross to create the desired flower pattern.
If you are struggling to visualise the pattern, it might help to think of the asterisk symbol.
Once you have them in a position you like, fix them together by stitching or gluing the centre., Now you can make the strands into the petal loops. Take a strand at one of the ends away from the centre, and fold it up and in towards centre of the flower. Depending on how many strands you are using, you may need to secure a few of the loops before moving on the next one. If possible, just hold the loops in place until you have made them all so that you can secure them all in place at the same time.









Make some stitches through the centre of the flower to secure all the ribbon loops in place., Once you have created all the loops, you can secure them in place and create a nice central point to your flower. Get the button and either stitch it into the centre, or glue it in. Stitching it in will make it easier for you to tie all the loops in together.







, You can add a stem to this flower with floral wire. Bend the wire in half and slide it under the stitches at the back of the central part of the flower. Now the wire should extend down from the centre of the flower and look like a stem.









To finish it off, wrap the floral tape around the wire.
This will give it a nicer finish."
"
Get everything you need.,
Glue the centre.,
Wind the ribbon around.",How to Make Satin Ribbon Flowers2," You can make flowers with pleated satin ribbon fairly easily. You will need a length of ribbon between about 18 and 24-inches long. You will also need some quick drying and strong glue. If you have a glue gun, you can use that. To form the base of the flower, you need a chipboard circle, and for the centrepiece you will need a button.The diameter of the chipboard circle will depend on the size of flower you want to make.
A few inches diameter should be okay for a length of ribbon that is 18-inches long.

, Start rolling up one end of the ribbon in a spiral in one hand, so you have the beginnings of your flower. Place a blob of glue at the centre of the chipboard backing and press the centre of the small spiral onto the glue. The glue will dry quickly so you need to be able to work fast to stick the ribbon down.







, Once you have stuck down the centre of the flower, you will wrap the ribbon around in a growing spiral. Add more glue to chipboard backing as you go and stick the ribbon down. This is tricky work, but you will still need to act quite quickly.









As you wind the ribbon and stick in down, you will see that it is developing into a flower pattern.
Once you have covered the chipboard backing circle, trim off any excess of ribbon.
Finish it off by gluing your centrepiece button into the heart of the flower."
"
Cut the ribbon.,
Weave a threaded needle through the ribbon.,
Make it into a flower shape.,
Add the centrepiece.",How to Make Satin Ribbon Flowers3," You can make a straightforward satin ribbon flower using just one piece of satin ribbon. Cut the ribbon into one strand that is approximately 12-inches long. You will also need to gather together a needle and some thread, some scissors and some glue. Find something to use as the centre of the flower, such as a button., Take the ribbon and a threaded needle. Weave the needle through the ribbon along one of the long edges. Weave the needle, in and out, all the way through the length of the ribbon.








The stitch to use here is known as a basting stitch., Once you have woven the needle all the way along the ribbon, pull the thread through and pull it tight. When you do this you will see the ribbon bunch up and begin to take on a flower shape. Cut the thread and tie it off with a double knot at one end.









Pull it as tight as you can, and then tie off the other end of the thread.
Fix the two ends of the ribbon together with glue, or by stitching them. Glue might be neater, but be sure to glue on the side of the ribbon you want to be on the back., If you used glue, leave it to dry before flattening it out. It should now look like the petals of a flower. To finish it off, get your centrepiece button and place it over the hole in the centre of the flower. Use a glue gun or some superglue to stick this to the ribbon, taking care to keep it neat and tidy.









You may find it helpful to use two buttons, one or either side of the flower.
You can then glue the two buttons together to secure the flower."
"
Cut the ribbon to length.,
Make the first folds.,
Keep folding.,
Pass the end through the gap.,
Twist the end.,
Tie it off.",How to Make Satin Ribbon Flowers4," You can make satin ribbon flowers by folding a long strip of ribbon. Start by cutting your length of satin ribbon so that it is 40-inches long. Cut diagonally along each end of the ribbon, so that each end has a sharp point. You can stitch over the edges if you are concerned about fraying.








You will also need a threaded needle ready to go.

, About 8-inches from the left-hand side of the ribbon, fold the ribbon over so that the long end is horizontal and the shorter end is vertical. It should look like an upside-down L.








Now take the long right-hand end and fold it down so that it is vertical, and parallel with the shorter end.
The fold should create something that looks a bit like an arrowhead.
You should have a little gap of around 1/8 of an inch between the two ends., Then bring the long end over the short end, so that it is horizontal again and the arrowhead shape becomes more like a square.You will then need to repeat this folding pattern, bringing one end up over the other, and then vice versa.









You will notice a concertina pattern developing as you fold.
Do this until you have at least three layers of ribbon., Once you have folded it over so you have at least three layers, carefully lift it up. Take care to ensure that it all stays together, pinching the area where the folds are between your thumb and forefinger. Then take the end of the longer end of the ribbon and pass it through the square gap at the centre of the folds.








Gently pull the ribbon through, but leave a little bit at the top on the other side of the folded area., Now take the long end of the ribbon that you have passed through the hole in one hand, and hold the folds with your other hand. Twist the long piece of ribbon near to the folds until you see the folds begin to curl and twist.









As you twist you will see each layer of folds curl around to become a flower shape.
Take the hand that you are holding the folds in, and move up a layer each time as you twist and see it curl., Once the flower is completed and all the layers of folds have curled up into petals, grab the bottom of the flower and hold it tightly. Then take a threaded needle and stitch directly underneath the bottom of the flower to keep the folds in place.









Keep the stitches tight and neat, and be sure to hold it all tightly in place as you work. You can use floral tape to attach the finished flower to a wire.
Make a series of flowers like this of different shapes and colours to make a satin ribbon bouquet.

Cut the loops of the flower with scissors.,
Comb the yarn out with the fork.,
Fluff the flower.,
Trim away any unruly bits.",How to Make Yarn Tassel Flowers," The tip of the pipe cleaner should be sticking out just past the tip of the fork.A bright green pipe cleaner would work best, but you can use a standard dark green one as well.
, Choose some basic yarn. Place the end across the middle of the fork and pipe cleaner. You can use any color of yarn you want. Yellow or white is great for dandelions while pinky-purple is perfect for clover. Orange is great for marigolds., Wrap it around the fork and pipe cleaner 25 to 30 times. Try to keep the wrapped area about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick.It's okay if the yarn overlaps itself.

If you want to make puffy white dandelions, wrap the yarn 35 to 40 times., Fold both ends of the pipe cleaner together so that they stick out perpendicular to the fork. Twist them together, pinching the wrapped yarn together., Use a yarn needle to thread a short piece of green yarn between the last two prongs on your fork, right next to the pipe cleaner.Remove the needle, then tie the yarn into a secure knot.

Use yarn that matches the color of your pipe cleaner.

, Be careful not to mess up the tassel or pull it apart. Set the fork aside but don't put it away. You will use it once more at the very end., Wrap the ends of the yarn to the back of the flower first, then tie them into a tight, double-knot. Trim the ends off as close to the knot as you can., Cut an 8-inch (cc-centimeter) piece of more green yarn. Place a drop of glue on top of the knot, then press the end of the yarn into it.You can use hot glue or liquid glue, such as tacky glue or fabric glue.

Hot glue sets up the fastest, but it will also look the messiest in the end.
Tacky glue and fabric glue will give you the neatest finish. Fabric glue is more expensive, but it dries faster.

, At this point, you will have some of your flower showing between the green yarn and the green pipe cleaner. Wrap your green yarn tightly around the bottom of your flower to hide this portion., Stop when you are about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters) away from the bottom of the flower.If you have any excess green yarn leftover, start wrapping it back up towards the flower again., When you run out of green yarn, place a drop of glue onto the wrapped part, then press the yarn into it. If you are using a liquid glue, such as tacky glue, you may have to secure the yarn with a clip or clothespin until the glue dries., Open a pair of scissors and slide them through the top loops of your flower. Working a few loops at a time, carefully snip them with your scissors., Use the fork to gently comb the bits of yarn on your flower. This will help open them up and make your flower appear fuller., Gently fluff the flower using your fingers. You can also gently roll it between your palms., Take a look at your flower. If you notice any bits of yarn sticking out, trim them down using a pair of scissors."

, Alternatively, if you are familiar with oven or microwave drying, you could substitute these methods.

, There needs to be a little moisture left to help with the moulding.

, You can test this after each mince or blend by rolling in your hands. If the mixture stays together in a bead shape, the mixture is ready to work with.

, Do this firmly so that the little bead balls stick together well. Remember that the plant material will shrink as it dries to half the original size, so make account for this in your bead size. Continue until you have made as many beads as required.

, Use a long hat-pin, a thin skewer or a piece of wire to create a hole through each bead. Leave the beads to dry on this to ensure that the hole remains stable and of a good size as the beads dry.

, Place in a warm, dry and well-ventilated place to dry.

, Take the dry beads and thread them onto a necklace thread. Intersperse with a gold or silver bead between each or every 2-3 rose beads for added effect.

,, The necklace will keep well for many years. The scent can be retained and heightened by storing the necklace in a small wooden box that is closed and fairly air-tight. Keep the lid closed when the necklace is in storage.

Pick out fabric.,
Make flower stencils.,
Pin the stencils to the fabric and cut out the shapes.,
Stack the layers.,
Sew the flower stack.,
Make a stamen.",How to Make Fabric Flowers1," The sky's the limit when it comes to making fabric flowers. Use fabric scraps you already have or hit the fabric store to pick out new fabric. Remember that the thickness of the fabric you use will affect the final look of the flower.


To make a flower with floppy petals, use silk, thin cotton, or another thin, floppy material. For stiff petals, choose felt, denim, linen, or another thick, stiff material.
Fabric flowers have more than one layer, and there's no need for every layer to be made out of the same fabric. Make contrasting petals by choosing two or more types of fabric for your flowers. For example, you could choose a plain blue fabric and one with a white background and blue polka dots.;
, Use a pencil to draw flower shapes on a piece of thin paper. The flower can be any shape you want. Create a daisy, a sunflower, or a dogwood flower. Space the petals evenly or create a wilder look by making the petals less uniform. Cut out the shape with a scissors when you're finished.









If you don't want to draw your own stencil, check online for stencils you can print out.
Make more than one stencil if you want contrasting, layered petal shapes. For example, you could make one stencil with large, long petals, and another one with twice as many small, short petals. Layering these two petal types together will create a neat effect.

, Use straight pins to secure the paper stencil, or stencils, to the fabric you chose for your flowers. Make sure each petal is securely in place. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric along the edges of the stencil. When you're finished, unpin the stencil and examine your fabric flower shape.









Make as many layers as you want by repinning the stencil to a new section of fabric, cutting it out, and repeating until you have enough.
You can make more than one flower shape at once by folding the fabric and pinning the stencil through both layers of fabric before carefully cutting out the flower shapes.

, Arrange the layers in a stack that shows off the multiple petal sizes and shapes. If you have different sized flower shapes, stack the smaller ones on top of the larger ones.








, Thread a needle with thread that matches your flower fabric. Pass the needle through the center of the flower petal stack, then pull it back through to the other side. Repeat a few times until the flowers are sewn together in the very center of the stack.








, You can end your project there or create a stamen, the middle of a flower, using a button, a bead, a gem, or some other small item. Glue the stamen on with fabric glue or hot glue, or sew it on using the same needle and thread.

Gather fabric scraps.,
Fold the fabric scraps in half lengthwise.,
Make slits in the folded edge.,
Stitch the fabric.,
Pull the fabric into a flower shape.,
Add the stamen.,
Add a decoration.",How to Make Fabric Flowers2," To make loopy flowers, which have petals that loop backward for a pretty effect, gather several pieces of fabric scraps that are about 4 inches (10.2 cm) long and 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide. This type of flower looks best with stiffer fabric, such as felt.

, Place pins along the bottom, where the two edges of the fabric scraps meet. Place the pins about an 1/8 of an inch from the open edge.








, Use a scissors to make evenly spaced slits along the folded part of the fabric. If you want your flower to have many petals, make the slits every 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). For fewer petals, make the slits every 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).








, Thread a needle with thread that matches the fabric you chose for your flower petals. Tie a thick knot at the end of the thread so it won't pull through the fabric. Starting at one end of the row of petals, insert the needle at the corner of the fabric where the two ends meet, near the first straight pin. Sew a running stitch along the length of the fabric, so that the two layers are now sewn together.









For a neater final look, make sure your stitches are evenly spaced, and that they are all the same distance from the bottom of the fabric. Run the stitch just above or below the straight pins you used to hold the fabric in place.
Remove the straight pins once you're finished stitching to the end of the fabric.

, Slide the fabric toward the knot in the thread so that it becomes cinched. As you slide and push it down, the fabric will begin to form into a circular shape, and the petals will spread apart. Continue cinching the fabric until you have formed a flower shape. Finish sewing the flower by folding it in half and securing the first and last petals together with a few whip stitches. Secure the thread with a knot and cut it.







, Now that you have a circle of flowers, it's time to add a center. Cut out a circle of the same fabric you used to make the petals, or use a contrasting fabric. The circle should be large enough to cover the hole at the center of the flowers, but not so large that it obscures the petals. Dab fabric glue around the edge of the fabric circle and secure it in the center of the petals.







, Use hot glue or fabric glue to add a button, bead, rhinestone, or another decoration to the center of the flower.

Choose a silky fabric.,
Cut circles from cardstock.,
Trace the circles onto the fabric.,
Make slits in the circles.,
Light a candle and singe the petals.,
Stack the petals.",How to Make Fabric Flowers3," For this method, which requires singing the edges of the fabric to create an organic, realistic effect, you'll need light, silky fabric. Avoid felt and other thick fabrics when you're using this method.

, You'll need one circle that is about a half an inch larger than the diameter you want the finished flower to be. The other circle should be half an inch smaller in diameter than the first circle, and the third a half an inch smaller than that. Continue cutting smaller circles until you have 5 or 6.








, Use a fabric pen or chalk to trace the circles. Since the edges will be singed, it's ok if the markings show up at the edges of the fabric. Cut out the shapes you traced with fabric scissors.







, Use scissors to make slits around the edges of the circles to create petals. The petals don't need to be rounded; all you need for this method are simple slits. Space the slits so that there are about 6 petals when you are done cutting. The slits should end about 1/3 way into the circles.








, Working one at a time, hold a fabric flower approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) over a candle flame. Rotate the flower continuously so that it does not catch on fire. The flame will melt the edges and give the fabric a realistic look. Repeat the process with each layer.







, Place the circles on top of each other so that the largest is on the bottom and the smallest is on top. Place a bead on top as a stamen. With thick thread and a sewing needle, bring the needle through the center of the flower, securing the bead in place and the layers together. Make several stitches so that the layers are securely in place.

Enjoy!",How to Make an Autumn Bunch," Remember that there’s no strict list; you can mix and match what you like. You can gather a variety of differently sized and coloured autumn leaves, or make them all identical. It’s generally best to stick with medium sized to small leaves though, as you want the bunches to be graceful, not oversized and untidy. As for autumn plants, you can take your pick depending on where you live; pine cones, berries or flowers.;
, Make sure that the ribbon you select adds the ultimate touch – a deep red or gold ribbon, or perhaps a striped or checked one, will be perfect. When gathering your items, remember the following:


Your flowers should be removed from sunlight as soon as they are cut so that they will dry with their colours preserved.






Your flowers should also not be fully mature; else they will lose their petals quickly.







, You can use the microwave technique for drying daises or roses, or tie your flowers in small bunches and hang them upside down in a dark, dry area such as an unused closet. Allow your flowers to dry for two to three weeks. Yes, this takes time and patience, but it ensures that your bunch lasts longer and makes it look all the more attractive.

, In the meantime, take care of your autumn leaves. There are various methods for drying and preserving autumn leaves, and they don’t take the same amount of time as flowers, so get to work. You can choose to:


Microwave them. Try microwaving your leaves until they’re completely dry, between double layers of paper towels. Be careful, though, as they could catch on fire.







Use wax paper. Place a leaf between two pieces of wax paper, place a towel on top and press it with an iron to seal the wax paper. Do both sides and then cut around the leaf. Carefully peel the wax paper off.







Soak them in glycerine solution. Mix glycerine and water so that it’s one part glycerine and two parts water - you'll need about one cup of solution. Pour the solution into a flat pan, place the leaves in and put some kind of weight (such as a plate) on the leaves to keep them submerged. Soak them for 2-6 days and then dry them gently with a paper towel. This method helps keep the leaves more flexible.






It also helps to spray the leaves with hairspray once you’re done with drying them, to keep them preserved.







, Shades of gold, silver or white are all great colours to add. This is optional.

, The hardest part - waiting – is over, and your bunches will be complete in minutes. Gather up your flowers and leaves and work on arranging them how you would like. Keep in mind the colours and sizes and what kind of look you’re trying to achieve – graceful, pretty, bright? Be gentle and carefully with your plants.

, Once your bunch is perfect, carefully tie it with your ribbon. To secure the bunch, you may want to tie it with thin but strong string first, because the silkiness of the ribbon may not hold the bunch together as well. Then tie the ribbon around it for decoration. You can simply tie it and let the two sides of ribbon dangle, or tie it in a bow. You could also thread small charms or beads along your ribbon, which work especially well if you’re going to hang the bunch up.

, You can keep the bunch in a cool, dark and dry area for a week or so to ensure it is preserved and dried properly.

, You can make several bunches, drying flowers at different periods, and then use them to decorate your house for a special occasion. Or you can hang these bunches from your window, or car mirror, or add them to a gift or basket for that final autumnal touch.

Continue adding small petals until the center is full.,
Cut small squares of mesh.,
Roll the mesh into a tube and stick a pin in it.,
Fold the tube in half and attach to the center of the flower.,
Repeat the process until the flower is full.",How to Make Deco Mesh Flowers," To make one large deco mesh flower, you’ll need a 10-yard (9-m) by 21-inch (53-cm) roll of decorative mesh. Use a pair of scissors to cut approximately 12 to 15 21-inch (53-cm) squares of the mesh.To give your flower some depth, you may want to use two different colors of mesh for the large squares. It’s best to use shades from the same color family, though, such as rose and baby pink.;
, After you’ve cut out the large mesh squares, fold opposite corners of the square in toward the center. Use your fingers to pinch the square together at the center to form petal-like shapes on either side so it has a bow tie-like appearance.Try to fold the corners in as evenly as possible, but don’t worry about the petal shapes being perfect. The flower will have a more natural appearance if the petals are slightly irregular.

, Once the mesh square is resembles a bow tie, fold the pieces in half. Both of the “petals” should point in the same direction so they can form the outer layer of the flower., To attach the petals to the foam disc that serves as the flower’s base, you’ll need U-shaped floral pins. Use a hot glue gun to add a dab of glue to the center of the pins so you don’t have to worry about the petals coming loose.You can use straight floral pins to attach the petals as well. Be sure to add some glue just below the head of the pin, though, so the petals are secure.

, For the flower’s base, you’ll need a 6-inch (15-cm) styrofoam disc. With the glue on floral pin, insert it through the bottom of the petals and press it into the foam along the outer edge of the foam disc.You can move the mesh around to arrange the petals as you like, but wait 5 to 10 minutes after you pin them so the glue has time to set.

, After you’ve pinned the first set of petals to the foam disc, take another square of decorative mesh and repeat the entire process of folding and pinning it. Continue adding large squares of mesh until the entire outer edge of the foam disc is covered., To fill in the center of the flower, you’ll need smaller squares of mesh to form petals. Use the scissors to cut approximately 10 to 12 10-inch (25-cm) squares from the decorative mesh.Depending on the look that you’re going for, you can either use the same color mesh as the outer layer of petals or choose a contrasting shade.
White and yellow make ideal shades for the flower’s center.

, Just as with the large mesh squares, fold opposite corners of the smaller square in toward the center. Pinch the center with your fingers to gather it together and then fold it in half., Take another U-shaped floral pin and add a dab of glue to the center. Insert the pin into the center of the mesh petals and press it into the center of the foam disc.As with the larger petals, allow the hot glue to set for at least 5 minutes before you try to play with the arrangement of the smaller petals.

, Once you’ve added the first set of smaller petals to the center of the flower, repeat the procedure of folding and pinning the small mesh squares. Keep adding the petals until the entire center is filled in.If you prefer, you can tuck the ends of the petals in the center of flower underneath to give it a puffed appearance.

, If you prefer to fill in the center of your flower with tubed mesh, you still need to cut out squares from the mesh. Use scissors to create approximately 15 to 20 10-inch (25-cm) squares from the mesh.Because the tubes are more compact than the fluffier petals, you will need more squares to fill in the center of the flower.

, After you’ve cut out all of the mesh squares, roll s square up into a tube. Next, take a straight floral pin and insert it the center of tube.Because the tubes are more compact, it isn’t necessary to add hot glue to the pin. However, if you want to ensure that your flower is sturdy, you can add a dab below the head of the pin.

, When the pin is in the center of the tube, fold the mesh in half to form two “petals.” Press the pin into the foam disc at the center of the flower, making sure that it’s secure., To fill in the rest of the flower’s center, take another square of mesh and repeat the rolling and pinning procedure. Continue the process until the center is filled in.If you like, you can use the tube method to create the outer layer of petals as well. Just cut the 21-inch (53-cm) squares and roll them up in the same way you would the smaller pieces of mesh.

Begin by pulling apart three silk flowers with large, full blossoms.,
Hold two pipe cleaners together and with one of the large blossoms upside down, thread the blossom onto the pipe cleaner.,
Thread two 1"" wooden beads from the top onto the two pipe cleaners.,
Continue working from the top and add one more 1"" wooden bead for the head.,
Hold another pipe cleaner horizontally under the head bead and twist twice to secure it to make the arms.,
Return to the top and create a hook for hanging the flower lady.,
Separate the two legs and thread on tiny flowers for ankle bracelets.,
Hang your petal girl where she will be seen as you pass through a room.",How to Make Flower Petal Ladies,"  Do this by grasping the stem in one hand and the flower part in the other and pulling in opposite directions.  Some can be stubborn, so tug hard.  They will come apart, and small plastic pieces such as stamens will fall out.  Keep these little pieces to use later.
,  Look inside and you will see a tiny hole where the flower was once attached.  The two pipe cleaners might be a tight fit, but the chenille will flatten and they will go through the hole.  This makes the skirt, repeat with up to two more blossoms for a fuller skirt.

,  Push the skirt to approximately half way on the pipe cleaners and allow the two ""body"" beads to rest against the skirt.  Thread on a small flower part to act as the collar.,  Thread on another small blossom for a hat.

, Cut 1"" off the ends of the arms.  Thread the small plastic flower pieces that fell off when you took the flower apart onto each of the arms as bracelets.,  Separate the two pipe cleaners and bend one down until it touches the head bead to form a loop.  Wrap the other piece tightly around the base of the loop to secure it.  Thread a 12"" piece of curling ribbon through the loop and tie for a hanger.

,  Bend back the ends and twist to form feet.  Bend the feet upward.,  She will make you smile.  Draw on a face with fine line Sharpie.  Her perky little skirt will never need pressing.

Select your favourite herbs and flowers.,
Place the flower or flowers in the centre of the arrangement.,
Use a rubber band to tie everything together at the top of the stems.,
Tie a ribbon bow around the stem.",How to Make a Tussie Mussie," Good choices include pelargonium (scented geranium), lavender, pansies, mint, thyme, lemon balm, mint, rosemary, bay leaves, violets, etc. When picking them, ensure that you keep a little stem on each one to help keep its place in the tussie mussie.;
, Arrange the various herbs in a circular way around the flower. Try to maintain each herb at an even level with each other herb. Let the stems stick out downwards to form one stem or holding point.


If wished, arrange the leaves and flowers on a foil doily to help create the circular shape and keep everything in place. If doing this, make a small hole in the middle of the doily to allow the stems to poke through.

, At this point, decide whether you'd like to add another layer of herbs to build up the tussie mussie. If so, add the layer and tie again with another rubber band.

, This completes the tussie mussie, although it's a good idea to trim the stems to ensure that the base is even.

Cut your rib­bon.,
Weave a needle and thread through the upper part of the ribbon.,
Gather your thread.,
Double knot your thread.,
Glue the ends of your ribbon together.,
Glue a button at the center.",How to Make Ribbon Flowers1," Cut about 12 inches of ribbon. Get creative with the colour and pattern of ribbon. Purchase ribbon at your fabric store, dollar store, or arts and crafts store. Use thicker ribbon to create a more pronounced effect.;
, As if you were inserting curtains onto a rod, weave your needle and thread in and out of the top third of the ribbon. Keep the thread on the spool so you don’t have to worry about running out of thread or if the thread falls off the needle.Continue weaving your needle in and out the top of the ribbon until you reach the end of the ribbon.

, Once you are at the end of your ribbon, pull the thread all the way through the ribbon so that it gathers, similar to a curtain. You want it to bunch in order to create a blossoming effect. , Make sure you leave some excess thread for you to create a double knot before you cut it from the spool. Gather the ribbon as tightly as you can and double not the thread to hold it in place., Glue the ends of your ribbon together by overlapping one end of the gathered ribbon over the other end, as if you were bending a curtain rod into a circle. Make sure that you apply the glue to the underside of the flower so that it is not visible. Wait for the glue to dry and flatten out your flower., The gathered ribbon should form a circle at the centre of the flower. You may glue a button or two buttons, one on top of the other, at the center of your flower to cover the glued portion of ribbon. You may also glue fake gems or anything else that you feel makes your flower bloom. Get creative.Puff out the outer petals to give your flower the blooming effect. The tighter you scrunch the inner circle of the ribbon, the greater the bloom effect.

Cut your ribbon and felt.,
Pull the bottom wire and gather the ribbon.,
Glue the ribbon down.,
Create a spiral pattern.,
Fold the ribbon into place.,
Seal the ribbon.",How to Make Ribbon Flowers2," Cut two circles from your felt. Each circle should be about two inches. You may also trace an old spool of ribbon to help you create a smooth circle. Then cut around five feet of ribbon. Be sure to use ribbon with wire in its construction. Use thicker ribbon for a greater blooming effect. Be sure to pull a bit of the wire out of the ribbon and fold it over so that it doesn’t pull through the ribbon when you gather it.Choose felt that complements the colour and pattern of your ribbon. You can buy both at your arts and crafts store or dollar store. The length of the ribbon depends on how large you want to make your flower. For a very large flower use about two arms' lengths worth of ribbon. For a smaller flower, use about half an arm's length of ribbon.

, Pull the bottom wire from the other side of the ribbon. You should be pulling on the same side that you kinked the wire. Gather the whole ribbon by pulling the wire in one direction and the ribbon in the other.Push as you gather the ribbon to push the gathered bunch of ribbon along the wire.

, Fold the raw edge of the ribbon down and glue it onto the felt. On the outside of the circle, glue the ribbon so that it covers the edge of the entire circle. Don’t put too much glue. Glue about an inch at a time.To add extra ruffle, gather more ribbon as you glue. You can also pull out more wire if the ribbon is gathered too tightly. This is entirely personal preference.

, Continue gluing to create a spiral pattern around your circle. Cut off about two inches of ribbon once you reach the center of the flower. This will create the center of the flower., Place the raw edge of the ribbon down and squish the ribbon. The wire in the ribbon keeps the ribbon in place so fuss all you want until you get the look you like. Once you’re happy, lift up the petals and dab some glue at your desired points to set your look., Glue the ends of the ribbon to keep it sealed. If you are using the flower as part of a bouquet or on a headband, you can also glue the ribbon down onto the stem or headband."

Press down to make sure it catches and is secure., Add more glue to the chipboard as you continue to spiral the ribbon around the circle. Wrap the ribbon around the chipboard circle until you come to the end of the ribbon. Trim the excess ribbon and tuck the end into the rest of the spiral., Glue your button in place to create the center of the flower. Glue your bottom at the centre of your spiraled ribbon. Make sure the bloom puffs out towards you. You may also glue leaves at the back of the flower for added effect.You may also cover the chipboard with a piece of matching felt or mist the chipboard piece with paint that matches your ribbon before gluing your ribbon onto it.

Bring the ends to the center.,
Create the center of your flower.",How to Make Ribbon Flowers4," You may choose ribbon of any width; however, you will need to vary the number of ribbons to adjust for ribbons with thinner or thicker width., If you’re using a thin ribbon, cut about eight pieces that are about six inches long. Arrange the ribbons so that you make a star like shape where each ribbon is layered at the center. Evenly space out these strips and stitch one or two stitches at the center to hold the strips in place., Fold each strip in half and stitch the ends of the ribbon to the center. Continue to do this with each strip to create the petals of your flowers from the folded loops of ribbon.You want to fold the ribbon lengthwise to create two loops at either end of its centre. All loops should meed at the same place, the centre of your flower.

, Glue a button at the center of your flower to create the center. You want to use the button to cover where you have glued all the ends of the ribbons together.On the back of the flower, slide floral wire through the stitches. Secure the flower by bending it in half. Use floral tape to wrap the wire and create the stem. Either stitch to secure the button or use hot glue."

Cut the tulle into strips.",How to Make a Tulle Rose1," You'll need to adjust the strip length according to how large or small you want the tulle rose to be, and the smaller it is, the fiddlier the rose-making will be. A standard size for the strips would be about 90cm/1 yard (0.9 m) and 7.5-10cm (3-4 inches) wide.


Cut lots of strips if you're making lots of roses.;

Finished.

",How to Make a Tulle Rose2," Choose something to wrap the tulle around, for example your finger or a pencil. Wrap around and around until you're happy with the amount and consider that it appears ""rose-like"".


Tight wrapping means a smaller rose, looser wrapping means a larger rose (as well as the amount of tulle used).

, Wind the tulle length a few times around the ball to complete and glue the end piece in place.


An application of hot glue in the center of the rose can help to keep the flower shape intact.

, Depending on what you're adding the tulle rose to, use the right affixing method to keep it snugly in place.

Choose a white rose.,
Trim the stem.,
Split the stem into sections.,
Divide the stem into two to four sections.,
Mix several colors of food coloring into cups of water.,
Place each stem section into a different container.,
Position the containers of colored water directly next to each other.,
Let the roses sit for a few days.",How to Make a Rainbow Rose1," Start with a white or very lightly colored rose for making a real rainbow rose. For the purest color, a white rose is best.


If you cannot find a white rose to use, try a peach, pale yellow, or light pink rose. Avoid using red roses or dark pink roses; dark colors will not work because the deep shade prevents the color from showing through.
Note that the stage the rose is in will affect how fast or slowly the dye takes hold. A rose that is near its blooming stage, or already in its blooming stage, will accept the color more readily. On the other hand, a rose in its bud stage will take much longer.;
, Cut the stem of the rose down so that it is roughly the length you want it to be.


Use sharp scissors or a sharp knife to cut the bottom of the stem at an angle.






To determine the proper length, base the stem height on the height of the containers you will be dyeing the rose in or the height of the vase you plan to store the rose in afterward. The stem of the rose needs to be only a little taller than the length of the final vase. It should not be too much taller than the height of the dyeing containers though, or else the rose will become top-heavy and will not sit well inside the containers.







, Use a sharp blade to split the end of the stem into multiple sections. You can use either scissors or a knife, but either way, the tool you choose must be sharp. The stem of a rose is fairly woody, and if you use a dull blade, you could end up causing the stem to break or tear the rose.


The cut should extend from the bottom of the rose up to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the base of the petals., If you cut too many sections into the stem, you risk weakening the stem.


Note that the number of sections you cut the stem into will determine the number of colors in your rainbow rose.







, Fill a few tall, narrow containers with water and mix in a few drops of food coloring into each container. Choose one different color for each container.


As mentioned already, the number of colors should match the number of sections you split the stem into.
The more food coloring you use, the brighter the colors will be in the resulting rainbow rose.
The best containers will be narrow and sturdy. Avoid using containers with wide lips since the split sections of stem will need to stretch into each container, and wider lips might be harder to stretch the stem sections into. A popsicle mold works well, as do small votive glasses.

, Carefully place each split stem section into a different container of colored water, making sure that the cut ends are fully immersed.


Exercise extra caution when bending and positioning the stem sections. The split stem is especially weak, and if you move the sections with too much force, you might end up snapping them by accident.







, This will keep the entire structure more secure and limit the amount of space you need to stretch the stems over.

, You should notice some color change within the first 30 minutes, but for a vibrant rainbow rose, you will need to let the rose sit in its dye bath for a few days.


It may take a full week before the colors become notably vibrant, but after a single day, each of the petals should be tinted with color.The dyed water will be absorbed through the stem of the rose just like standard water would be taken in. As the dyed water travels throughout the parts of the rose and hydrates the petals, the dye will be deposited in the petals. Since the petals are white, the dye shows through easily.

Select a square of rainbow paper.,
Cut the beginning of a circle shape.,
Divert the circle into a spiral.,
Cut a tab shape into the center of the spiral.,
Remove the outside square.,
Roll up the spiral from the outside in.Roll the entire spiral up toward its center, rolling along the top-side of the paper.,
Glue the tab to the bottom of the rose.,
Repeat to make more!

",How to Make a Rainbow Rose2," In order to enjoy the most color from your paper rainbow rose, choose a square of paper with a rainbow print on the front and back.

You could also choose a square sheet of paper with a white side, plain color side, or a pattern on the opposite side. Play around with different types of paper to find the look you like best.






Origami paper works especially well. The standard size for origami paper is 9 by 9 inches (23 by 23cm).






If starting with plain white paper, you can use crayons or colored pencils to color a rainbow pattern over the entire sheet of paper. For best results, try layering the colors diagonally across the square from one corner to the opposite corner.







, Start from the middle of one edge and begin to cut a circle into the square paper, coming as close to the other three edges as possible.


Do not yet cut the edges off at this point.







, Once you get close to the starting point of your circle, shift the cutting line in by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Continue cutting around the inner perimeter of your spiral until you reach the center.


The thickness of the spiral should be similar all the way around, meaning that the approximate thickness of the spiral should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) evenly.






Cut the spiral free-hand. You do not need to be precise with this technique. In fact, this rose looks best when you maintain a principle of “wabi-sabi,” a Japanese aesthetic focused on the beauty of the imperfect.







, At the end of the spiral, which should fall out at the exact center, you will naturally end up with a little tab that looks a little wider than the thickness of the spiral.


The tab should be fairly circular with a slight notch in it.







, Snip off the outside square shape simply by cutting it off at the point where you began your spiral circle shape.


The sharp angles and edges of this section will only get in the way of the final rose shape.

,


As you start, the roll should be as tight as possible. Use both hands to roll up the paper spiral. Hold the developing roll in between two fingers on one hand and use your other hand to maneuver the remaining paper around the roll to incorporate it.






Initially, the final roll will look very tight and not very rose-like.






Adjust the tightness of the spiral. Slowly release the tension holding the spiral together, allowing the roll to loosen and unravel slightly while still maintaining its basic form. Let the tension drop less for a tighter roll and let it drop more for a looser rose.







, Add a drop of hot glue onto the top-side of the tab and firmly press it against the bottom of the rose. Make sure that each spiral is caught on the glue.


Make sure to use hot glue or a glue that dries almost instantly.






You also need to make sure that the edge of each spiral sticks to the glue. Otherwise, the rose may unravel once you release it.






As soon as the glue dries, set the rose down. Your paper rainbow rose should be complete.

Find your silk leaves.,
Purchase your glitters of choice.,
Create your workspace.,
Use your foam brush to paint the leaf with glue.,
Sprinkle your glitter onto the leaf.,
Add another layer of glue.,
Repeat these steps for the backs of the leaves.,
Scatter them around.,
Create a fall wreath.,
Hang them with ribbons.",How to Make Glittered Leaves," You can typically find plenty of fake plants at your local craft store, but it’s all about finding the perfect leaves. Look for strands or branches of greenery that you can cut individual leaves from. Big maple leaves work perfectly for this, but you can use any silk leaves that you want.


If you want to save money on leaves, use the real ones. If you can find some leaves in the shape and size you want on the ground outside, there is no reason why you can't just glitter these!;
, Make sure you purchase enough to cover the surface of the leaves entirely. Warm fall colors like red, yellow, orange, and gold are perfect for fall décor. You can opt for other colors, depending on the occasion or holiday you’re decorating for. The great thing about silk flowers is that they don’t die, so you can create holiday décor that you can use year after year!

, If you’ve worked with glitter before, you know it can get a bit messy. Cover the surface you’re working on with newspaper. You may want to cover the ground with newspaper as well. Then, place a smaller piece of paper on top. This is where you will shake excess glitter from the leaves, and you can pick up this smaller paper to reuse the glitter for other leaves.

, Mod Podge, a water-based glue and finish, is perfect for this craft.If you have regular, everyday glue that you want to use, you may want to try thinning it out with a bit of water to make it more easily spreadable. Use your foam brush to coat one side of the leaf completely., You can use your fingers to sprinkle a bit of glitter at a time, or gently pour the glitter from the container directly onto the leaf. Add glitter until the entire surface of the leaf is covered. Then, pick up your leaf and gently shake it so that the excess glitter falls off onto your paper.You will probably need to repeat this process a few times to ensure the entire leaf is covered in glitter.
You can then lift up your paper on either side and pour the glitter back into the container to use for other leaves.

, The leaf may look perfect now, but it will likely leave a mess behind if you stop here. Let the first coat of glittery dry, and gently brush on another coat of your glue. This will dry transparent, and seal the glitter to the leaf. You won’t have to worry about your new décor leaving traces of glitter wherever you put it., This may or may not be necessary, depending on how you plan on displaying your leaves. If only one side of them will show, you don’t need to coat both sides with glitter. Otherwise, let the fronts of all the leaves dry, and then repeat the process on the reverse sides of the leaves.

, This is a simple way to add a bit of pizazz to a holiday table or display. You can arrange them around candles or a vase of flowers for a simple yet eye-catching centerpiece. For the autumn months, glittery maple leaves look great scattered around your pumpkins. Arrange them on your bookshelf, throw them into a bowl on your coffee table, and so on. Get creative!

, Glitter leaves add instant glitz to a typical DIY fall wreath. You can add one or two glittered leaves within regular fall leaves for little pops, or you can use only glittered leaves for a really attention-grabbing display. Purchase a wire wreath base and some foliage or grasses to create a beautiful wreath to hang in your home.

, If your silk leaves have stems, use them to your advantage. Tie a bit of ribbon or twine to your stems, and hang them in your home. You can hang them in a doorway like some fun, flashy garland, or hang them from your mantle to complete your holiday display.You can go nuts and hang them from doorknobs, kitchen cabinets, potted plants, and lampshades… you’ll certainly add some excitement to your space!


If your leaves don’t have stems, you can punch holes and thread your ribbon or string through these."

Clean the outside of a vase.,
Dampen the leaves lightly.,
Adhere the leaves to the vase with hot glue.,
Decorate the top of the vase.",How to Make Leaf Vases1," The leaves may not adhere properly if there is dirt, oil, and other debris on the outside of the vase. Wipe down the surface with rubbing alcohol on a piece of paper towel to ensure that it’s clean.You can use a clear or colored vase, depending on your preference. However, be sure that it’s made of glass or ceramic.
If you don’t have a vase, you can use a mason jar and turn it into a vase.;
, In order to position the leaves on the vase, they need to be slightly bendable. Wet the leaves lightly to loosen them up so they’re easier to position.Don’t overwet the leaves. Instead of running them under the faucet, try using a spray bottle filled with water to lightly mist them.
For the best results, use freshly fallen leaves that aren’t too dry or fragile.
The vase looks best if you remove the stems from the leaves.
You can use faux leaves if you can’t find any real leaves that you want to use.

, When you’re ready to place the leaves on the vase, use a hot glue gun to place several dots of glue on the back of the leaves. Next, press the leaves to the vase, smoothing out any air bubbles. Hold them in place for 5 to 10 seconds to give the leaves time to adhere.You can add as many or as few leaves as you like. Covering the entire surface of the vase with leaves creates a distinctive look, but having some space between the leaves can also be pretty.
It’s best to apply a single layer of leaves. If you try to place several layers on the vase, the leaves may fall off.

, Once you’ve placed the leaves on the vase in your desired arrangement, allow the glue to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. If desired, you can tie raffia or a ribbon around the neck of the vase to complement the leaves.Using ribbon that matches the color of the leaves creates an simple elegant look for the vase. However, a ribbon in a contrasting color can make a bolder statement.

Wipe down the outside of the vase.,
Bend the faux leaves to loosen them.,
Cover the back of the leaves with decoupage medium.,
Press the leaves onto the vase.,
Apply decoupage medium over the leaves on the vase.,
Allow the vase to dry.",How to Make Leaf Vases2," To ensure that the faux leaves will adhere properly, the surface of the vase must be clean. Wet a piece of paper towel with rubbing alcohol, and clean the entire vase to remove any dirt and oil.It’s best to use a glass vase for this project. Decoupage medium can work on some plastics but not all of them, so you may have trouble if you use a plastic vase.

, Faux leaves are usually made of a combination of fabric and plastic, so they can sometimes be a little stiff. To make it easier to adhere them to the vase, loosen up the leaves by bending them back and forth. They should become more malleable.You can find faux leaves at craft stores and online craft retailers.
You can use real leaves for this project. However, if they’re too dry, they may crumble and break when you apply the decoupage medium.

, Place a piece of foil down on your work surface and lay the leaves on it. Use a foam brush to spread decoupage medium all over the back of the leaves, making sure that they’re entirely covered with the adhesive.Choose a decoupage medium that is an adhesive, sealer, and finish all in one. You can find those types of products at craft stores.
It’s best to spread the decoupage medium over one leaf at a time. If you slather it on a bunch of leaves at once, they may dry out while you’re placing the other leaves on the vase.

, Once the back of the leaves are covered in decoupage medium, place them on the vase. Use your fingers to smooth them into place so there are no wrinkles or bubbles. Continue placing the leaves on the vase until you’ve covered it as you desire.You can completely cover the vase with the leaves or leave some gaps between them.
With the faux leaves and decoupage medium, you can overlap the leaves slightly if you prefer.

, After you’ve placed all of the leaves in the arrangement that you like, use the foam brush to cover the entire surface of the vase with another layer of the decoupage medium. A thin coat is all you need.Applying too much decoupage medium as a sealer can leave bumps in the surface of the vase.

, Once you’ve sealed the leaves on the vase, let the decoupage medium dry completely. It should take two to three hours.When the decoupage medium is dry, you can embellish the vase with ribbon or a bow.

Clean the vase.,
Find leaf images online.The best place to find leaf images for your vase is online.,
Print the leaf images out on decal paper.,
Cut out the leaf images.,
Set the leaves in cold water.,
Remove the backing from the images and place on the vase.,
Let the vase dry.",How to Make Leaf Vases3," To ensure that the decal paper adheres to the vase, the surface must be clean. Use rubbing alcohol on paper towel or a rag to wipe down the vase and remove any dirt and grime.


Decal paper adheres to most surfaces, so you can use a glass, plastic, or ceramic vase.

, Do an image search to find leaf images that fit the design that you’re trying to create, and save them on your computer.You may need to resize the images, so it helps to have basic photo editing software.

, When you’ve found the leaf images that you want to use, place some decal paper in your printer. Print the images out on the paper, so they’re ready for the vase.You can usually find decal paper at craft stores, office supply stores, and online retailers.
If you’re not sure how to use the decal paper in your printer, consult the instructions on the packaging.

, Once you’ve printed out the leaf images on the decal paper, use a pair of scissors to cut them out. Be as precise as possible as you cut to keep the leaf shapes as sharp as possible., After you’ve cut out the leaves, place the images in a large bowl of cold water. Allow them to soak for 30 seconds and remove from the water. That will help loosen the images from the backing paper so they’re ready to adhere to the vase.It’s best to soak just one or two images at time, so they don’t wind up soaking in the water for too long.

, After you take the leaf images out of the water, gently peel away the paper backing. Place the images on the vase in whatever arrangement you prefer.Use your fingers to smooth out any air bubbles or wrinkles in the leaves. If the paper is starting to dry, run a damp rag over them to smooth  them into place.

, Once you’ve added all of the leaves that you want to the vase, allow it to dry completely, which should take one to two hours. When the vase is dry, you can add ribbon and other embellishments or just set some flowers inside.If you want the vase to dry more quickly, you can use a hair dryer.

Decide on a theme.,
Go hunting for leaves.,
Press your leaves.,
Pick your craft materials.",How to Make a Leaf Collage1," Before you go out looking for leaves, ask yourself what type of collage you'd like to make. Do you just want to make something pretty? Or do you want to make it informative? Decide between making an art project or a science project so you know what leaves to look for, how many you'll need, and whether you want to include stems or just the leaves themselves.


For a science project, you could try to collect a leaf from every type of tree that grows in your area. Or you can try to find find leaves from different individual trees of the same type to show the difference between the size of a sapling's leaves versus a full grown tree's.
For an art project, you can a landscape with leaves standing in for trees, with the leaf's stem standing in for a trunk. You could also make a wreath with lots of layers and differently colored leaves. For a landscape, you only need a few. For a wreath, the more the better!
To identify specific types of leaves, there are plenty of field guides you could use, as well as websites like https://www.arborday.org/trees/whattree/.;
, Take a stroll outside. If you live in a woodsy environment with lots of trees right outside your door, great! If not, visit a local park or any buildings with landscaping or potted trees outside. Look for whole leaves without any tears, holes, or diseased spots.You want to keep your leaves as pristine as possible, so don’t stuff them in your pockets or a bag. Bring a manila folder, notebook, or something similar to slide them inside without folding them over.
If it’s spring or summer, search the trees and pluck the leaves directly from their stems.
If it’s autumn, search the ground, too, but avoid damp leaves if possible, since these may smell a little funky and start decaying faster than dry leaves.

, This isn’t a must, so if you like the look of curled leaves (or if they’re so dry and brittle that they’re more likely to crumble), feel free to skip it. But if you’d like your leaves to be flat as possible so they make full contact with the paper that you’ll be sticking them to, wait a couple days before making your collage. In the meantime, once you bring your leaves home, do the following:Lay your leaves as flat as possible inside a manila folder or between sheets of paper that you don’t mind getting a little damp or dirty, like old newspapers.
Place a heavy object with a flat bottom on top of them, like a big, thick hardcover book or a stack of board games.
Give your leaves a couple of days to flatten under the weight.

, There’s no one way to make a leaf collage, so explore your options! Choose whatever you think would be prettiest, easiest, and/or the least messy to work with. You can use:


Colored or plain white backing paperCardboard or foam backing boardContact paperPens, colored pencils, markers, etc.
Various forms of glue

"
"
Choose your backing paper.,
Decide on a design.,
Color in your background if you like.,
Glue your leaves to the backing paper.,
Add some finishing touches.",How to Make a Leaf Collage2," Leaves and glue may not seem heavy on their own, but together they’ll add some weight to your paper. So opt for something thicker than notebook sheets or printer paper. Choose between:


Craft paperCardboard, new or usedColored construction paperFoam backing board

, Before you start gluing leaves in place, know exactly where you want them so you don’t second-guess yourself after it’s too late to move them! Lay your backing paper down and arrange your leaves however you please. You could try:Grouping them by the type of tree they came from.
Creating a wreath.
Making a landscape with leaves standing in for trees.

, If you only have plain craft paper or cardboard to work with as backing, consider sprucing them up by painting them or adding other touches of color before you begin gluing. Or, even if you’re using colored construction paper or backing boards, think of other elements that you may want to include behind your leaves. For instance:


If you’re making a wreath, you can trim sheets of other colored paper (or use crayons or markers to color in plain white paper) into thin strips. Arrange these like sunbeams pointing outward from where your leaves will go and then glue them into place.
If you’re making a landscape, you can draw other features in the background, like buildings, mountains, or a setting sun.

, Once you have touched up your background, attach your leaves to the paper. First, decide between using liquid glue or a glue stick. Then stick each leaf to the paper.If you’re using liquid glue, apply a thin bead around the back of your leaf. Keep a little distance between the glue and the leaf’s edges. This way the glue won’t squirt out from underneath when you stick it to the paper.
A glue stick can be a neater alternative, since it’s transparent and won’t goop up anywhere. Rub it onto the back of the leaf, the paper itself, or both, and then press the two together.

, This isn’t a must, so if you’re happy with your collage as it is, feel free to call it day! But there’s plenty you could do to spruce your collage up even more. For instance:


If you’ve grouped your leaves together by type, consider labeling. You can use pens or markers to write the type of tree directly on the backing paper where there’s room. Or you can glue separate labels written on a different colored paper so they’ll stand out even more.If you’ve made a landscape, you can still draw in features like grass, clouds, or the sun or moon where space allows. You can even glue other materials to the backing paper for these, like green yarn for grass or cotton balls for clouds.
You could also apply spray-on glue to the whole thing once you’re finished. This will help preserve the leaves’ original shapes and colors.Glitter, stickers, and similar materials can also be added to make your collage even more eye-catching.

"
"
Decide how to use it.,
Seal glued collages.,
Use contact paper instead of glue.,
Make a transparent collage.",How to Make a Leaf Collage3," Contact paper comes in transparent sheets, each with a sticky adhesive side. This makes it a great protective cover for flat collages, plus it can also be used instead of glue! You can either use it to:


Seal a finished glued collage.
Stick leaves and other materials directly to it.Create a collage that’s totally transparent except for the leaves., Give your glue time to dry once you’re finished attaching everything to the backing paper. In the meantime, use scissors to trim your contact paper to match the backing paper’s size. Once the glued materials feel firmly in place, remove the backing to the contact paper’s sticky side. Lay the contact paper facedown, with the sticky side up. Then line up your backing paper with its edges and press the two together, with your leaves sandwiched in between.This is only a good idea for flat collages. If you’re using stuff like cotton balls and yarns, or if you like the way your leaves curl, this would only flatten them out and ruin the effect.

, First, lay out your backing paper and decide on your design. Because contact paper is so sticky, correcting mistakes will be even more difficult than with glue, so definitely take the time to figure out how you want to arrange your leaves before you begin. You’re also going to use the contact paper’s sticky side to fix your backing paper in place, so leave the edges clear so the two connect. Once you’re satisfied:Peel off the backing to the contact paper’s sticky side and lay the paper down with the sticky side facing up.
Take a leaf from your backing paper and press it facedown into the contact paper’s sticky side.
Because the contact paper is facedown, remember that sides are reversed. For example, if your backing paper and contact paper are side-by-side, the leaf that’s lying faceup all the way to the right of your backing paper should be placed facedown all the way to the left of your contact paper.
Continue sticking leaves (and any other materials) one at a time so you don’t lose track of which goes where.
When you’re finished, flip the backing paper over, line its edges up with the contact paper’s, and press the two together.

, Say you know exactly where you want to hang your collage, but instead of obscuring the wall with backing paper, you want your leaves to accent the wall itself. In that case, use two sheets of contact paper: one for the front, the other for the back, with the sticky sides facing each other. To do this:Use two sheets of contact paper of equal size, trimming one to match the other if needed.
Arrange your leaves on any surface to settle on a design. Again, contact paper is pretty sticky, and removing your leaves once they’re in place will be pretty tough.
Remove the backing to one sheet of contact paper. Lay that sheet facedown, with the sticky side up.
Stick the back of each leaf, one by one, to the contact paper, following your design exactly.
Once you’re all done, remove the backing to the other sheet of contact paper. Line their edges up and press the two together, with the leaves sandwiched between the two sticky sides.

Gather your materials.,
Cut and fold your ribbon to create your flower.,
Create the flower petals using pins.,
Place the crosses together at a 45 degree angle.,
Stitch your beads or pearls to create the center of your flower.,
Stitch the flower onto clothes or use it as a brooch or barrette (optional).",How to Make a Flower Out of Ribbon1," Check the dollar store before you purchase your materials online or an arts and crafts store. Make sure you know exactly how many flowers you will need in order to budget how much material you will need to purchase. Grosgrain is a heavy ribbon with a corded texture that is usually made of rayon or cloth silk. To create grosgrain ribbon flowers you will need:


22 inches of ¾ inch wide grosgrain ribbon. Grosgrain ribbon comes in a variety of colours.
⅛ inch pearls or beads. The number of beads will vary depending on their diameter.
Thread to match the colour of the grosgrain ribbon.
Brooch pin or barrette and hot glue (optional);
, Cut 4 pieces of ribbon that each measure 5 ½ inches long. Create a loop with each piece by folding with the ends meeting in the center. The loop will measure 2 ½ inches long while there will be a ¼ inch overlap of ribbon at the center., Hold each loop in place with a pin and create two crosses by pinning two pieces of ribbon at their center and repeat with the two remaining pieces of ribbon., Stitch the four pieces of ribbon together with matching coloured thread. The eight loops should look like eight petals once you’ve stitched the two crosses together.Your stitching should resemble a box at the center point at which the two crosses come together. The box makes sure that the loops do not come loose and your flower remains secure.

, Ensure that the bead hole won’t be visible as you loop the thread through it. Begin at the center and continue outward to create a circle of beads. Stitch another circle around the first. This will use twice as many beads.You only need to penetrate the first layer of ribbon as you stitch your beads or pearl.
The number of beads and pearls will vary depending on the diameter of the beads or pearls but generally you will be using about 5 - 7.

, If you are using the flower as a brooch or barrette, simply use a glue gun to add a clasping barrette pin to the back of the flower, opposite the pearls or beads."
"
Gather your materials.,
Create a strong but flexible band using the foil paper wrapped over wire.,
Wrap the band in your ribbon.,
Remove the paper but leave the wire.,
Use the open end of the ribbon as the center of your flower and roll.,
Sew the final end to keep the flower closed.",How to Make a Flower Out of Ribbon2," Choose your prefered colour of ribbon from your arts and craft store or fabric store. You will also need a sewing machine, scissors, a wire and foil paper. Choose wire that is very flexible., Fold the foil paper horizontally several times over a piece of wire. Create a band about 1.5 - 2 cms thick. You need the band to be thick enough so that it holds it shape as you spiral out to create your flower., Wrap the band vertically by holding one end of the ribbon at one of the band with your thumb and pulling the length of the ribbon up and around the band. Repeat the process until the entire band is covered and the ribbon overlaps about ⅓ of its width each time you loop it around the band. The band should now look like it is scaled by the ribbon.Keep the wrap as tight as you can.

, Gently slide the paper off the wire and the wrapping by pinching one end of the wrap and wire with one hand and pinching only the foil paper with the other hand. Sew the side you are pinching closed once you have removed the paper completely. Make sure that the ribbon is tight and none of the scales are loose making the wire visible., Keeping the ribbon tight, roll the ribbon as tightly as possible as you keep the open side at the center. Be sure to gently but firmly pull the length of the ribbon each time you create a new layer of the spiral. Pinch the center to keep the spiral tight with each new layer., Create a subtle stitch to secure the end of the ribbon onto the rest of the spiraled bloom. You may only stitch the bottom of the final scale or outer layer of the spiral to keep it inconspicuous. Once secure, you may also play with the petals to spread them out along the wire to create the appearance of a more open bloom.You may use a hot glue gun instead of stitching to keep the flower together.

Gather your materials.,
Create a knot and gather the ribbon.,
Use the pencil to roll the ribbon.,
Tighten and form to your preference.",How to Make a Flower Out of Ribbon3," Choose your prefered colour of 1 ½ inch wide wire edge ribbon from an arts and crafts store. You will also need a pencil and needle-nose pliers., Tie a simple knot at one end of the ribbon. Gather the ribbon so that it becomes ruffled along the wire. Gather the ribbon by pinching one end of the wire and pulling the other end of the wire as you move the material of the ribbon toward where the knot is, which is the pinched end.Use your fingers to create more of a ruffle as you keep the material of the ribbon tightly gathered along the wire and fluffed out in a ruffle as you move away from the wire.

, Create a tight center around the pencil as you roll the ribbon around it. Start just after the knot and keep the knot below the roll and alongside the pencil. Once secure, remove the pencil but continue to create the rest of the rose by rolling the rest of the gathered ribbon around the center that you have created with the pencil., Secure the rose by wrapping the pulled wire around the base of the flower as tightly as you can. You should wrap the wire above the knot. Use needle-nose pliers to grasp the center of your creation as you tighten and secure the layers by twisting the wire. Use your fingers to enliven the petals by flattening and spreading the material of the ribbon to your preference."

Pick your daisies.,
Slit the stem with your thumbnail.,
Thread the stem of another daisy through the slit.,
Repeat with any number of daisies.,
Air dry the daisy (optional).",How to Make a Daisy Chain1," Look for daisies with thick stems at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Look for healthy, fully open flowers for a more beautiful chain.;
, Cut a small slit through the middle of the stem, without breaking it in half. You can cut this just below the flower, or halfway down the stem.


If your fingernails are too short, use a plastic knife.

, Push the base of the stem through, until the flower is snug against the slit.

, Make a slit in the next daisy and push the third stem through it. Repeat until you've made a bracelet, crown, or necklace. When you think your daisy chain is long enough, cut a second slit through the first stem. Push the last daisy through this slit to make a loop.

, To keep your daisy chain for a long time, hang it up to dry in a windy area. It might wither or change color, but it should stay together."
"
Pick the tallest flowers you can find.,
Strip off leaves (optional).,
Choose three flowers with strong stems.,
Bring the right stem to the middle.,
Bring the left stem under the right stem.,
Continue braiding.,
Add more flowers as you go.,
Tuck in the end of each stem.,
Finish with plain stems.",How to Make a Daisy Chain2," The longer the stems are, the easier the braiding. Daisies work wonderfully, but you can use any flower with a long, flexible stem and no thorns.

, Pinch the stem under the flower and moving your fingers rapidly downward. Repeat until the leaves are torn off. This will make it easier to see what you're doing.


After you've made a couple chains, you can try keeping the leaves.

, Place three flowers in a row on a flat surface. Pinch the stems together, just below the blossoms.


If any of these three stems break, you'll need to start over. If later stems break, you're probably okay., Press your thumb down over the point where the stems cross. Pick up the stem on the right and bend it in between the other two., Move the left stem over the new middle stem, and under the stem on the right. Pull the stems gently to make the braid tight. Don't pull too hard or it might break.

, Move the right stem into the middle. Bring the left stem over the middle and under the new right stem. Repeat this braiding pattern three or four times.

, After a few braids, pick up another flower. Lay it down next to another stem. From now on, braid as though those two stems were one thick stem. Add another flower every 2–5 crosses, depending on how clustered you like them.

, When you come to the end of a stem, tuck it into a gap between the others. Keeping them all well-tucked makes the chain less likely to unravel.

, Once you're reaching the length you want, stop adding new flowers. Keep braiding until you've got about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of bare stem. Bring this back to the beginning of the braid. Gently pull apart a couple flowers near the beginning, and wrap the two ends together several times."

Cut a length of wire.,
Thread the teardrop beads onto the wire.,
Wrap the beads into a loop.,
Secure each bead.,
Feed the wire ends into the round bead.,
Twist the wire.,
Use as desired.",How to Make a Flower1," Unwind roughly 6 inches (15 cm) of 0.5 mm brass craft wire. Cut the wire using side cutting pliers.


If you choose to use smaller or larger beads for this project, the amount of wire you'll need will also change. The length of wire you cut should always be approximately twice as long as the combined width of your teardrop beads, if not a little longer.;
, Feed six 1-inch (2.5-cm) long teardrop beads onto the cut length of wire.


Ultimately, the pointed ends of all the teardrop beads must point in the same direction. The beads should also be positioned toward the center of the wire.
You can alter the size of the teardrop beads as desired to create smaller or larger flowers, but the beads must all be the same size.

, Wrap the center of the wire into a tight loop, drawing the points of your teardrop beads together.


There should still be some space at the center of the formed circle. The teardrop beads should be side by side, but they should still lie flat when placed on a flat surface.
If you need help forming the loop, you can wrap the wire around a pencil or wooden towel.

, Wrap the ends of the wire around one side of the top portion of each bead to help hold the beads in place.


Feed one wire end into the hole of the bead, then wrap it over the top side of the same bead before feeding it back into the hole again. Repeat for all six beads.
Wrap three of the beads with the right wire end and the other three beads with the left wire end.
Note that the wrapped side of the beads will be the back of the flower.

, From the front of the flower, thread both wire ends through the center of a 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) round bead. Pull the wire ends until the round bead rests in the center of the flower structure.


Pull the wire ends up from the back of the flower to the front. Direct the ends so that they cut through the center of the flower structure.
Feed the right wire end through the right side of the round bead and the left wire end through the left side of the round bead. Pull the ends in opposite directions to draw the round bead down into the center of the flower.
If you use smaller or larger teardrop beads, the round bead will need to be smaller or larger, too. Choose a round bead that roughly matches the width of your teardrop beads.

, Draw the ends of the wire back down to the bottom of the flower. Twist them together beneath the round bead to secure the entire structure.


If necessary, use round nose pliers to twist the wire tightly.

, You can use this flower to decorate jewelry or other crafts. Simply position the flower over your chosen backing and twist the excess wire ends over and around that backing to hold the flower in place.


Once you've mounted the flower, use cutting pliers to trim the remaining wire. Hide the sharp wire ends beneath the beads.

Cut nine lengths of wire.,
Bend each wire into a petal shape.,
Cut squares of plastic.,
Wrap the plastic over the wire frame.,
Secure the petal with floral tape.,
Roll one petal.,
Wrap three petals around the first.,
Position the remaining petals.,
Wrap the wire ends with floral tape.",How to Make a Flower2," Use wire cutters to cut nine 9-inch (23-cm) lengths of jewelry wire.


Each length of wire will be used to form one petal. You can create fewer or more petals as desired, but nine will allow you to make a simple rose.

, Use your fingers to bend one wire into a 2-inch (5-cm) loop. Twist the ends together at the bottom of the loop two or three times to secure the shape.Repeat with all nine pieces of wire.
To create smaller or larger petals, simply form smaller or larger loops.

, Use scissors to cut nine 4-inch (10-cm) squares of colored plastic.


You need one square per petal. Each square must be large enough to wrap around the length and width of the petal frame.
Plastic bag material works best for this, but you could also use cellophane or plastic wrap.
For a completely different look, sheer colored tights could be used instead of plastic.

, Center one wire petal frame over one plastic square. Wrap all sides of the plastic over the wire frame and twist the ends of the plastic together at the base of the frame.


Try to keep the plastic as flat as possible as you stretch it over the frame. It will bunch up slightly as you twist it, however.
Twist the ends of the plastic together like you would twist the paper onto a lollipop.
Repeat with each wire frame and square of plastic.

, Wrap the twisted base of the plastic petal with a few layers of floral tape.


Repeat with each petal.
To make the petals look neater, you should also carefully trim away any plastic sticking out from beneath the bottom of the floral tape.

, Take one plastic petal and carefully bend the wire around itself into a loose spiral.


Roll the petal from side to side, leaving the excess wire hanging down to serve as part of the flower's stem.
This petal will sit at the center of the flower.

, Take a second plastic petal and position it next to the first rolled petal. Use your fingers to bend the wire slightly so that this second petal curves around the spiral center.


Repeat this process with two other petals. All three petals manipulated in this step should overlap slightly and completely surround the spiral center petal.
Wrap the wire ends around one another at the base of the petals as you work. You should only need to wrap the wires two or three times to keep the petals secure.

, Arrange the remaining five petals around the entire center structure. Bend the wire of each petal slightly so that the entire petal curves gently around the center structure.


These five petals should slightly overlap and must also completely surround the center structure.
As before, you should wrap the wire ends around one another at the base of each petal as you work with it.

, Hold all of the wire ends together, then wrap the bundle tightly with a long length of floral tape.


Start at the petal base and wrap the floral tape in a spiral down the entire length of the exposed wire. Mold the tape around the wire and continue until all of the wire is covered, including the sharp ends.

Wrap a pencil with green washi tape.,
Fold and cut the first wrapper.,
Repeat with four more cupcake wrappers.,
Cut the leaves.,
Stack the layers.,
Attach the flower to the stem.,
Bunch the petal layers.",How to Make a Flower3," Start toward the eraser end of the pencil and wind green washi tape all the way down to the graphite tip.


You can use solid or patterned green washi tape. Wrap the washi tape in a slight downward spiral so that the layers just barely overlap one another.
Pencils are the easiest option to use for this craft, but you could also use a wooden dowel trimmed down to pencil length, 7.5 inches (19 cm).

, Fold one colored cupcake wrapper into eighths, then use scissors to trim the open edge into a rounded triangle.


This cupcake wrapper can be any color and will be used to create petals.
You will need to fold the cupcake wrapper in half three times. This will create a flower with eight petals.
Alternatively, you can fold the wrapper in half four times and round off the top in a similar manner to create a flower with 16 petals., Repeat the folding and cutting step with four more cupcake wrappers to create four more layers of petals.


To create an aesthetically even flower, use identical cupcake wrappers and cut the same number of petals for each one.
If desired, you can also experiment by using different colors or by varying the number of petals.

, Fold a green cupcake wrapper into eighths, then round off one long edge.


You will need to fold the wrapper in half three times.
Round off the open long edge of the folded wrapper. Make sure that the point stays intact.

, Unfold the cut wrappers and stack them on top one another. The green leaves should be placed on the bottom, but the petal layers do not need to go in any specific order.


Turn the petal layers slightly so that there are no visible gaps when viewed from above.
Consider using a small dot of hot glue in between each layer. Place the glue directly onto the center of one layer before placing the next layer over it.

, Center the flower, leaf-side down, over the eraser of the wrapped pencil. Drive a small push pin through the center of all six flower layers and into the eraser.


If you are using a wooden dowel or are otherwise unable to use the push pin method, simply adhere the bottom of the flower onto one end of the stem with a small dab of hot glue.

, Use your fingers to carefully gather and bunch up the petal layers toward the center of the flower.


Continue manipulating the layers as desired to create the appearance of a full bud.

Cut two large strips of fabric.,
Press the edges.,
Fold both strips in half.,
Tie a knot with the thinner strip.,
Roll and twist the smaller strip around this knot.,
Pin everything together.,
Repeat with the second strip.,
Sew the two stacks together.,
Check the layers.",How to Make a Flower4," The first strip should be 45 inches (114 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide. The second strip should be 45 inches (114 cm) long and 5 inches (12.5 cm) wide.


Experiment with different types of fabric to produce different results. Most medium-weight or heavy-weight fabrics will be easy to work with, especially if they are fray-resistant. Avoid lightweight materials, stretchy materials, or materials that fray easily.

, Fold the long edges of both strips. Use a hot iron to press along the folded edges, holding them in place.


For each edge, you should fold down roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). The exact measurement doesn't matter too much for this project, but the fold must be even along the entire edge.

, Fold both strips in half crosswise, halving the total length from 45 inches (114 cm) to approximately 22.5 inches (57 cm).


Use an iron to press this fold, as well.

, Tie an overhand knot into one end of the thinner strip. Position the knot as close to the end as possible.


This knot will give you a starting point for the rolls you'll need to form. It should also prevent this end of the material from fraying.

, Roll the fabric around the knot one full rotation. After that, continue rolling the fabric behind the knot until you reach the end of the strip.


Make sure that each consecutive layer stays behind the starting knot. The covered knot will need to be positioned at the top center of the flower.
After the first few rotations, you will need to begin twisting the layers as you wrap them to create rounded points along the perimeter.
Each layer should gradually extend further out, and the back of the flower should look fairly flat.

, Insert a few straight pins through the stacked layers of the first strip to hold the entire thing together.


Set this first strip aside temporary.

, Follow the same steps used to roll the first strip to roll the second, wider strip.


Tie a knot on one end of the strip.
Wrap the strip around this starting knot.
Continue wrapping the strip around this point, twisting and stacking the layers as you go.
Pin the layers together when you finish stacking them.
The final circumference of this wider strip should be almost twice as large as the circumference of the thinner strip.

, Place the smaller stacked strip on top of the larger one, keeping the two aligned at the center. Use a sewing needle and thread to stitch the two stacks together.


Thread the needle with thread that matches the color of the fabric.
Start from the center of the flower and work outward, crossing across as many layers as possible.
Keep your stitches hidden beneath overlapping layers.
When you have stitched through the entire flower, tie a secure knot at the end of the thread.

, Remove all remaining straight pins and check the layers to verify that none of them are loose.


Loose layers can be tacked together with a needle and thread or a dot of hot glue.

Assemble the supplies needed.,
Make the flowers first.,
Loop the wire up through one side set of aligned holes, then bring it down the other side (only two sets of holes is needed).,
Measure enough of the wire length that you wrapped the wire around to create a stem.,
Repeat for more flowers on stems.,
Create the container for the flowers.,
Arrange the button flowers in the container.",How to Make a Button Flower Arrangement," These are listed below. In particular, you will need to match three buttons in descending size to make each button flower. Choose buttons according to their interest and colors. You may wish to color theme them, or make a more eclectic arrangement.;
, Assemble three buttons on top of each other. They should be in descending order, with the largest at the base and the smallest on top.

, Pull the loop firmly into place to draw together the three buttons and wrap the wire neatly in place underneath the large button, around the wire length. Use pliers to help you wind it, if needed.

, Cut at the end to form the stem. The button flower will be sitting pretty at one end, the other end ready to be inserted into the arrangement.

, Vary the stem lengths to make the result reflect a real bunch of flowers in a container.

, Cut down the florist's foam to size and insert into the container. Cover the foam with dried moss or other floral cover to prettify it.

, Simply insert the wire stem end into the florist's foam in different places. Rearrange until you're happy with the final look.


If you don't want to use florist's wire, find a pretty bottle and simply slip the wire stems into it.

Choose your blooms.,
Choose your colors.,
Prepare your colored water.,
Prepare your flowers.,
Place your flowers in the water and wait.,
Remove your flowers from the dye solution.",How to Dye Flowers1," The process of dying fresh flowers involves adding a color to water, and waiting for the flowers to absorb it. The dye will be absorbed by your flowers so it's best to choose light colored flowers. Popular choices include roses, daises, orchids, mums, and Queen Anne's lace but you can try any pale colored flower.;
, Decide what colors you want. If using a liquid food color you can blend the colors to get what you want. Typically, food color sets come with yellow, red, green, and blue, but you can mix these to create other colors. Alternatively, you can use powdered floral absorption dyes.

, Fill a vase with enough warm water to submerse the stems. Add flower food and dye to the water. There is no right or wrong way to add the dye; the more dye you add, the more vibrant the color of the flowers will be, the less dye, the more subdued the color.








, Before putting your flowers in the dyed water, you’ll need to cut the stems. Use a pair of gardening shears or sharp scissors to cut an inch or two off the stem 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) at a 45-degree angle. At this time, remove any extra leaves that you don't want. This will allow for optimal water absorption, expediting the overall time it takes your flowers to change color.









After picking your flowers you can leave them sitting out without water for a couple of hours. They will get thirsty and once you cut the stems and put them in your dye solution they will absorb the color pretty quick.

, Put your bouquet of flowers in the prepared vase The color won’t show up in the flower petals immediately, but it won't be long. Depending on the flower it could take 1 to 6 hours for them to be nicely dyed. The longer you leave the flowers, the more intense the color will be.








, Re cut the stems and put them in a vase with fresh warm water and flower food. To keep the flowers looking fresh, you should put new water in the vase at lease every other day, adding fresh flower food each time. The color will remain in the flowers until they eventually wilt and die."

Purchase floral dip-dye.,
Select your flowers.,
Prepare your dye.,
Dip your flowers in the dye.,
Put the flowers in a vase of warm water and flower food.,
Repeat the process.",How to Dye Flowers2," For dip dying fresh flowers, you’ll need to use specialty florist dip dye. This is available on-line and from some wholesale florists. Your florist can order this for you. Typically, these dyes come in ten colors, but you can easily mix dyes to get the right color.

, Because you’ll be coating the outside of the flower petals with dye instead of having them absorb it, you can use nearly any color and species of flower. Dip dye isn’t totally opaque though, so keep in mind that white/pale flowers will have a bright, bold hue while darker colored flowers will end up a rich, dark hue. Choose flowers that are fully in bloom, so that each of the petals will have easy access to the dye.


You can create very dark flowers by using dark blooms to start; red flowers dipped in purple dye will end up a dark plum color, for example.

, Pour your dye into a bowl or small bucket – any container with a wide brim will work. For a more subdued color, add Isopropyl alcohol to your dye mix. Place newspaper or a drop cloth under the container, to prevent splatters and drops from staining your workspace.








, Hold a single bloom upside-down at the end of the stem, so that the bud is facing down. Lower the flower into the dye, and hold it in the dye for a few seconds, making sure that every petal is exposed to the dye. Then, lift the flower out of the dye, and rinse it in fresh water. Avoid shaking the freshly dyed flower or you'll end up with dye stains on yourself and your work area that won't come out.








, Put the vase out of the way on a protected surface until they are dry to touch. It is important that you let the flowers dry completely before handling them, otherwise the dye will transfer from the flowers to your hands, clothes, and furniture, causing a stain.








, Follow the aforementioned steps for each of the flowers in your bunch, until they have all been dyed. If the flowers aren’t as dark

Purchase floral spray dye.,
Choose your flowers.,
Set up your work space.,
Prepare the spray dye.,
Spray your flowers.,
Set the flower aside to dry.,
Repeat this process on the remaining flowers.",How to Dye Flowers3," Floral spray dye is very similar to spray paint, except that it is made so that it won’t kill fresh flowers and adheres to flower petals. Floral spray dye (or floral spray paint) comes in a variety of colors, and is safe to use on both fresh and dried flowers. Keep in mind that it can get quite messy, spray painting a bouquet of flowers.

, Spray dye is opaque when applied, and will completely cover the color of the flower petals underneath. As a result, you can use any color, shape, or species of flower you want.

, Using spray dye is messy business, so it is important that you set up a special work area to do it in. Move into a well-ventilated space – like your garage or driveway – and put down a drop cloth or newspapers. Put on rubber gloves and old clothes that you don’t mind getting a bit dirty and stained.








, With the lid still on, shake the can of spray dye well for 20-30 seconds. Remove the cap and turn the nozzle so that the black dot is aligned with the direction you want to spray.








, Hold each flower up individually, so that the bud is facing away from you. With your other hand, hold the can of spray dye 15–18 inches (38.1–45.7 cm) away from the flower bud. Hold down the nozzle to release the dye, turning the flower as you do so to spray it evenly. Spray the flower until it is completely covered with an even coat of paint.








, Put the freshly painted flower into a vase or other container that holds it upright. The dye will take 1-3 hours to dry depending on the temperature and humidity. Don’t touch the flowers until they are completely dried, or else the dye will rub off onto your hands and clothes.


Put the flowers in a warm, dry room to help them dry faster.

, Continue working through your bouquet, spraying each flower individually and then putting it in a vase to dry. You can add multiple coats of the dye to the flowers if you aren’t happy with the density or brightness of the color.

Choose your fabric dye.,
Select your dried flowers.,
Prepare your dye.,
Dip each flower into the dye.,
Hang the flowers to dry.",How to Dye Flowers4," Fabric dye will successfully dye any type of flower, but because it involves boiling water and harsh chemicals, it will ruin fresh flowers. If, however, you have dried flowers that you are wanting to brighten up, you can use fabric dye to accomplish the task. Select any powder or liquid fabric dye; they all typically use the same process of mixing the dye with boiling water. Keep in mind that you can choose how light or dark your flowers will be based on how long you leave them in the dye.

, Flowers that are dyed tend to brown, making them a bit more difficult to dye. As a result, you should look for light-hued flowers, as dark color flowers will be too dark to dye effectively. White, cream, and light blue flowers are the best for this. Popular dried flowers include hydrangeas, baby’s breath, and roses. Keep in mind that your flowers need to have been fully dried for at least 2 weeks prior to dying them.


Avoid flowers that are damaged or discolored, as this will still show even when dyed.

, Each brand of dye will differ slightly in terms of instructions, but will involve mixing the packaged dye with a proportional amount of boiling water. While the dye is boiling, set up drop cloths or newspaper in the work area to avoid getting dye on your clothes or countertop.








, Hold a single dried flower by the stem so the bloom is pointed downwards. Slowly dip the flower into the dye, and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Pull it out and examine the color; if you’re happy with the hue, remove it completely. Otherwise, put the flower back in the dye until you reach the desired color, checking frequently.








, Using a clothesline or a drying rack, hang each of your flowers upside down to dry completely. Put them in a warm, dry room for the fastest drying time; leave them for at least 24 hours before using them as decorations."

Air-dry the leaves if you don't need to keep them flat.,
Press the leaves flat and dry with this slow but simple method.,
Use a flower press instead for faster drying.,
Dry large, thick leaves quickly in the microwave.,
Iron fresh leaves to preserve their color.,
Preserve the texture of leaves with glycerin.",How to Dry Leaves1," Place leaves in a shallow container or tie them in bunches. Expose to direct sunlight for a few days, checking every day or two to see whether they're dry. The sunlight will dry out the leaves, but the edges may curl. This makes them hard to use in some craft projects, but works well for dried flower arrangements.



Do not place the leaves in direct sunlight if you wish to retain the full rich greens of the natural leaf. Direct sunlight will cause the colors to fade and become less vibrant.
Air flow from a fan or window will dry the leaves faster.;
, Place one large leaf or several small leaves between two sheets of paper towels, making sure none of the leaves overlap. Open a large book such as an encyclopedia and place the sheets between its pages. Shut the book and lay it flat somewhere out of the way. Stack other books or stable heavy objects on top of it. Check once a week to see if the leaves are dry and change the paper towels if they feel damp.


If the leaves are wet with rain, blot them dry first with paper towels. Use additional layers of paper towels if the leaves are especially wet or if you're worried about staining the book's pages.When drying multiple leaves in the same book, leave at least 1/8 inch (3 mm) of pages between each sheet of leaves to provide enough weight for each leaf., You can either buy a flower press large enough to place your leaves in, or build your own out of plywood and cardboard. This is more expensive and uses more materials than simply pressing your leaves in a book, but the better air circulation can speed up the drying process by a few days.Spread the leaves out between two paper towels. Put the paper towels in between two sheets of blotter paper or several additional sheets of paper towels. Place the whole stack on the open flower press, then close and tighten. Check every few days to change damp towels and check if the leaves are dry.

, Place a thick leaf between double layers of paper towels on a microwave safe plate. Insert the plate and a small cup of water into the microwave and microwave it for 30 seconds. If the leaf isn't dry yet, microwave it again for 10 seconds at a time, taking the leaf out to check between each microwave session.Warning: the leaf can easily catch on fire in the microwave, which is why you should only use this method on large, thick leaves. The cup of water helps prevent this, since some of the microwave's energy is used to heat the water.

, This method works best on fresh leaves that have not yet changed color or begun to dry, although you should pat them dry with paper towels if the surface is wet. Place one leaf between two sheets of wax paper, and put a towel on top of the wax paper. Heat a clothes iron, then move the iron over the towel while pressing for 2-5 minutes or until that side feels dry. Flip over the stack of wax paper, put the towel over it again, and repeat.



Warning: children should have an adult iron the leaves for them, as the iron can get dangerously hot.
Make sure the clothes iron is not set to produce steam.
Once the leaf is ironed, cut a circle of wax paper out around it and peel off each layer of wax paper. This will leave wax on the leaf to preserve its color., This only works on wide, evergreen leaves such as magnolia, lemon, and eucalyptus leaves.This method will turn the leaves brown, but keep them soft and supple indefinitely. Combine one part glycerine with two parts water in a shallow dish, only filling it just enough to cover a layer of leaves. Place the leaves into the liquid, making sure the surface is completely covered. The leaves will be usable in craft projects after about 4 days, or can be soaked for several weeks to preserve them permanently.This method works by replacing some of the water inside each leaf with glycerine, which won't evaporate like water does.
If the leaves float to the top, place a paper plate or other object you don't mind getting wet on top of them to keep them weighed down under the liquid.
Add more glycerine and water if the liquid drops below the leaves.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your flowers.,
Make your acrylic dye.,
Dye your flowers.,
Repeat the process.",How to Dye Flowers5," Silk flowers cannot be dyed using fabric dye, because the fabric cannot be boiled. Although you can attempt using food coloring, it will likely rinse off the fabric because it is not permanent. The most success has come from dying silk flowers with acrylic paint. Therefore, you will need a tube of acrylic paint in a color of your choice, a container of gel medium, and water.

, Depending on the type of silk flower you use, you may need to prepare them a bit. If your flower has a stamen in the center, you’ll need to use painters tape to block it off in order to prevent it from being dyed. Anything else you don’t want colored should be blocked off with painters tape as well.








, To make the dye for your silk flowers, mix 2 parts acrylic paint with 1 part gel medium, Use a stir stick or spoon to fully incorporate this, and then add a small amount of water to thin it down. The amount of water you add to the mixture is dependent on how bright you want the dye to be; the more water you add, the paler the final color. When you’re done, put the dye in a wide-brimmed bowl or container, and place newspapers around it to prevent leaks.








, Place a single flower in the dye, and hold it so that it is completely covered in the color. Carefully lift it out of the dye using the stem or tweezers (if there is no stem), and place it onto the newspapers. Use a paper towel to pat the flower and remove the excess dye. Then, leave the flower to dry on the newspaper for 2-3 hours.








, Work through all your flowers, dying them using the aforementioned methods. After they have dried for about 3 hours, remove any painters tape you might have applied.

Rinse dirt off fresh-picked herbs.,
Spread out wet herbs until the water evaporates before using any other method.,
Dry small amounts of herbs or tea leaves quickly in the microwave.,
Dry thick or sturdy herbs by hanging them indoors.,
Dry moist or soft herbs in a low temperature oven.,
When the herbs are crisp and crumbly, store them in an airtight container.",How to Dry Leaves2," If you have a bundle of fresh herbs that look clean and dust-free, you don't need to wash them. However, if you just picked them from your garden, it's likely they contain some dust and dirt. Rinse them in gentle running water, then shake off the excess water.

, Whether you just rinsed your herbs or they were wet when you received them, you should first dry off the obvious moisture. Spread them out on a paper towel or clean dishcloth until there are no more water beads on the surface of the herbs.

, If you'd like to use your herbs right away, use this method to dry a small handful at a time. This method is also suitable for tea leaves that have just been used to brew tea. For either material, spread small leaves or pieces of herbs out between two dry paper towels. Microwave for 30 seconds at a time until they are brittle, paying close attention for signs of burning.Moist, fleshy herbs such as mint and basil won't dry easily in the microwave unless they are already partly dried., Some herbs don't have much moisture to begin with, and can be dried over the course of a few weeks by tying the stems in bunches and hanging them upside down. Do this indoors in a dark place if possible, because sunlight can harm the color and flavor of the herbs.Herbs in this category tend to have stiff or thick leaves. They include rosemary, parsley, sage, and thyme.
If you'd like to dry soft, moist herbs in this way, hang them in small bunches inside a paper bag. Poke holes at the base of the paper bag and place in an area with good air flow so the herbs dry more quickly and mold has less chance to grow., Herbs with soft, juicy leaves need to be dried quickly or they will grow mold. Pluck the leaves off the stem and lay them between paper towels so that no two leaves are touching. You may stack up to five layers of leaves if you need to, alternating between paper towels and herbs. Place these in an oven safe dish and place in an oven at the lowest possible temperature setting.They may take up to 8 hours to dry.


Turn your oven dial just enough that only the pilot light or electric oven light comes on.
Herbs that dry well in this method include basil, sage, bay leaf, and mint.

, Crumble the herbs between your fingertips before storing or before adding to food. Store dried herbs in an airtight container and place it in a cool, dark, dry place to keep the herbs flavorful as long as possible.Dried herbs have a stronger flavor than fresh herbs. When substituting dried herbs in a recipe that calls for fresh herbs, use 1/3 the amount listed, or 1/2 the amount if the herb is basil.Tea leaves can be dried immediately after used to brew a pot of tea. The microwave method above works best, as you usually have a small amount and a longer drying time could lead to mold. Use dried tea leaves as you would herbs, or use them to cover unpleasant smells around the house."

Transfer the disintegrating leaves to a pan of cool water.,
Use a small, stiff brush to remove the remaining pulp.,
Wash all materials used while wearing gloves.,
Let the leaves dry.",How to Dry Leaves3," In this method, you'll be removing most of the leaf and leaving just a network of veins behind. A sturdy leaf that doesn't bend or flop around is a good choice for this project. Freshly fallen autumn leaves from maple or oak trees work well, as do waxy leaves like ivy or magnolia leaves., You can use a smaller pot if you only have a few leaves. If you do, remember to reduce the amount of other ingredients proportionately, or simply use half the amount listed below.

, The mixture you'll be making can damage your skin, so put on latex or rubber gloves before handling the other ingredients. After you're done, remember to wash all utensils used thoroughly in running water while wearing gloves.

, These chemicals are usually found in grocery or drug stores. Whichever you use, two tablespoons (or 30 grams by weight) should be enough.Either of these chemicals will slowly turn the leaf into pulp while leaving the stem and veins alone., You can fit a couple handful of leaves or more, as long as you can easily stir the pot without spilling.

, You may set the heat to low and leave it to eventually simmer, or bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. The mixture should barely or occasionally bubble.


If you can measure the temperature, aim for about 175ºF (80ºC).

, Depending on how thick the leaves are, this could take up to a full day, but should probably only take a couple hours. Stir occasionally with a gentle motion, checking to see whether the leaves are soft and falling apart.


You'll need to add more water as it boils away. Optionally, you could replace the liquid with a fresh water and baking soda mixture every four hours to speed things along., A glass baking dish works well for this step, since it will make it easier to see what you're doing.Carefully remove each leaf with a spatula or other utensil and lay it out onto the baking dish without overlapping the others., The leaves should be thin, with a mushy layer of pulp stuck to them. Gently and patiently remove this pulp from the leaves, leaving only a network of veins or, depending on leaf type, a thin translucent layer.


You may need to rinse off the leaves in a trickle of cold water to remove the pulp one or more times during this process.

, Rinse out the pot, stirring utensil, and other objects that came into contact with the simmering mixture. Wear gloves and use soap and warm water., You can either let them air dry on paper towels, or pat them dry gently and press them between book pages or a flower press. After a day or two, you will have a unique way to alter the appearance of a dried leaf crafts project. Because these are transparent, they work particularly well on glass surfaces."

Gather the corks.,
Slice each cork in half, lengthwise.,
Create the bathmat base.,
Arrange the cork halves around the perimeter of the line or mat.,
Add the remaining corks to the mat.,
Allow to dry completely before using.",How to Make a Bathmat from Corks," If you've been collecting corks, check that you've got enough, as you'll need around 150 to 200. If not, additional corks can be purchased from brewing or wine-making suppliers, craft stores or through online retailers. Also check your local thrift store as sometimes they get people's collections of old corks. If using used corks, check that they're clean. They should be free of dust, wax or any build-up. Warm soapy water is best for cleaning them––just ensure they're thoroughly dry before beginning the craft project.


For wine-stained corks, simply soak them overnight in a bowl of water to which you've added a touch of bleach. This should remove the wine. Rinse clean, and allow to dry thoroughly before using.;
, Be especially careful not to slice your fingers when doing this. It helps to wear work gloves during this part of the process and lay down a non-slip surface for the cutting board to sit on, such as a silicon map, before beginning. Take plenty of breaks, as there are a lot of corks to get through––grab a friend to help if possible. To slice the corks in half:


Stand the cork up on the cutting board or cardboard, then cut downward. Hold the top of the cork with your finger and slice it neatly in half.
Sand the sides of the cork if they become too jagged. Gently run the sandpaper down the sides and along the middle to ensure a smooth, clean surface.

, Use a plastic shelf liner or shower mat to serve as the base––a previously designed rubber shower mat may be the best option, as it will provide structure. However, your mat will be more flexible if you choose to use a plastic shelf liner. A more solid alternative can be to use a piece of water-resistant wood, like marine-ply (or wrap the wood in plastic or oil it––the latter option may make gluing hard though).


Determine the size by either using another shower mat as the guide or measuring the custom size you desire. Consider your bathroom dimensions when determining size.
Cut the liner using either the box cutter or the sharp knife. If you need to size the base, use a ruler or straight edge to mark areas to cut.
Lay the shower mat or cut shelf liner down flat on the floor or on another flat surface. Cut the liner or mat either on a work table or on an outside patio so you don’t slash your floor or any furniture. Placing a self-healing cutting mat underneath can be helpful.

, Begin by creating a border with cork halves lining up vertically along the edges of the mat:


Line the corks up so the bottom of each cork (end) butts up to the sides of the mat or liner.
Complete the entire perimeter of the mat with corks until the entire mat/liner has been lined with corks. If you don’t achieve a perfect fit, cut some of the corks to fit.
Apply hot glue to the flat half of each cork and press the cork into the liner or mat. Use a dab of glue at the top and bottom of each cork and press firmly into the mat. Use a rag to wipe any excess glue that may ooze out from beneath the corks.

, Create a pattern or design with the cork layout, working your way from the outside inward with the remaining cork halves. Continue either with the vertical pattern or consider laying corks in a horizontal fashion and then alternating for each surrounding row.


It's probably a good idea to lay out the cork halves first to determine a pattern and then glue the corks to the mat after you're sure they will all fit. That way, you won’t start your mat and then get stuck if your pattern doesn't work out or if you don’t like they way it looks.
Trim corks if needed to accommodate the size of the mat/liner. Keep your knife/scissors handy in case you need to customize cork size.

, It might be a good idea to apply a coat of protective sealant such as polyurethane or cork sealant across the top of the cork bathmat, to waterproof it. However, corks can withstand small brushes with liquid (after all, they are in wine bottles a lot of the time), provided they're not constantly soaked. You might find the mat lasts okay if you don't end up with a floor awash with water each use and if you drop a small hand towel over the top of it before stepping on it from the shower. On the other hand, as with all bathroom items, there is a risk of mildew growth over time. This can possibly be avoided by placing the mat up somewhere that allows air circulation to dry it, and leaving it in the sun once a month or so, to ensure it dries out well. Whether or not you add a sealant is really a personal choice, and you might like to ask your local eco-hardware supplier if there are some eco-friendly choices for sealants available.

Place one half of the cut cork round side down under the extra piece of elastic at the head end of the snake.,
Lay the elastic flat down on this cork half.,
Glue the other cork half down on top of the cork half with the elastic on it.,
Finish the tongue.,
Done.",How to Make a Cork Snake," This is really the only part that the kids can't do, so you'll need to prepare this first.;
, Discard any corks that split during the drilling process.

, This will be the head piece (the slit becomes the snake's mouth).

, Painting is a messy job, especially when the kids muck in! Use newspaper, a tarpaulin, etc. to cover the painting zone.

, Choose a suitable color for the snake––good colors include yellow, green, brown, black, red, etc. But your snake can be hot pink or neon orange if you want!


Allow to dry before assembling the cork snake.

, This step is optional but adds to the interest of the snake. Patterns can include stripes, zig zags, spots/dots, diamonds, triangles, etc.


Again, allow to fully dry before assembling.

,,, Again, add another bead.

,, Thread 4 to 6 beads onto the tail end to make the snake's tail. Knot firmly in place.

, Don't pull too tightly though; allow some give so that the snake can twist and turn. There should be a good amount of elastic left at the head end, which will both hold the head and form the snake's tongue.

, Thread two eye colored beads onto the pipe cleaner.

, The cork should face the same way as all the other corks (that is, the long way, not sideways).

, Let the overlapping part stick out over the end of the cork half to become the tongue. Wrap the pipe cleaner around the cork half in such a way as to have the beads sit at the sides, evenly. These are the snake's eyes. Cut off any excess pipe cleaner.

, This completes the snake's head. Wrap a rubber band around the head to keep the cork halves together until the glue dries firmly.

, Cut the elastic down to a length that is suitable for the snake's tongue.


Cut a V shape into the end of the elastic to mimic the forked tongue that snakes have.
Paint this end piece of elastic a good tongue color, such as red, pink or blue.

, The snake is now ready for play. If you want it to last longer, varnish the whole snake and allow this to dry before playing.

Choose a plain bench that you want to modify.,
Clean the bench with a damp cloth.,
Wipe the bench down a final time with rubbing alcohol.,
Paint the legs, if desired.,
Paint the underside of the bench, if desired.,
Trace the top and sides of the bench seat onto a sheet of thin cork.,
Cut the panels out.,
Coat one of the cork panels and matching bench side with spray adhesive.,
Press the cork panel onto the matching bench side.,
Continue gluing the rest of the cork panels to the bench.,
Let the glue set.,
Consider adding stencils to the side edges.,
Seal the bench with acrylic sealer.,
Screw the legs back on if you removed them earlier.",How to Make a Cork Bench," Simple benches with straight edges rather than curved would work best for this. You can also use a long, low, narrow table instead, as long as you can sit comfortably on it. Avoid anything slatted or cushioned.;
, Even though you will be covering it, you still want to clean it. Any dirt and grim may prevent the adhesive from sticking properly. Wipe the entire bench down with a damp cloth first, then dry it with a clean towel.

, This will remove any residual oils. Don't worry if the rubbing alcohol removes some of the original paint. You will be covering the bench with cork, so it won't be noticeable in the end.

, You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add a fresh look to your bench. Remove the legs first, if possible, then paint them using spray paint. Set them aside so that they can dry while you complete the rest of the bench.If you can't remove the legs, it might be easier to paint them with a paintbrush instead.

, You won't be covering the underside of the bench with cork, but it may still be visible from certain angles. You can paint it any color you want, but it might look better if you match it to the legs. A dark, neutral color, such as black, brown, or espresso would also work well. Let the paint dry before moving on.


You can use spray paint or regular liquid paint.

, Place the bench down on top of the cork, then trace around it with a pen. Flip the bench onto its side, and trace it again, Continue tracing around the other three side panels as well. You don't need to trace a panel for the bottom of the bench.


I you cork has a front and back, trace onto the back of the cork.
If your bench is too heavy to move around, measure the top and side panels first, then draw rectangles on the cork based on those measurements., Set the cork down onto a cutting mat. Then, use a craft blade and a metal ruler to cut the rectangles out. The metal ruler will help make your cuts nice, crisp, and even. It will also help keep you from accidentally nicking the rectangles., Wait about 30 seconds for the glue to get tacky. Don't do the other cork panels and bench sides just yet., If the cork panel is peeling away, flip the bench over so that the cork is against the floor and the bench is weighing it down. Let it sit like that until the glue sets before moving on. This should only take a few minutes.

, Again, work one panel at a time. If you do everything all at once, the glue will start to dry and lose its tack.

, How long the glue takes to dry depends on the type of glue you used, so be sure to check the label on the can. This should only take 30 to 60 minutes for most brands.

, Place a stencil over one of the side edges of your bench. Dab acrylic paint over the stencil, working your way from outside-in. Peel the stencil away, then do the other sides. Let the paint dry completely before moving on.If the stencil is not self-adhesive, secure it with painter's tape first.
You can paint the top panel, if you want to, but keep in mind that the paint will wear away faster.

, You don't have to do this, but it will make the cork easier to clean. Simply apply a clear, acrylic sealer over the bench, then let it dry. You may need to apply another coat or two; be sure to let each coat dry fully before applying the next. For best results, choose a matte or satin sealer; a glossy sealer may not look good with a cork finish.


If you painted your bench (including the legs or underside), then this is a must.

, Once you have the legs back on, your bench is ready to use!"

, However, you can use larger or smaller squares to make different sizes of flowers, depending on the end use you're looking for. Note that the larger size is easier for the beginner to work with and learn from. The breakdown is basically: one petal for each square and a flower can be 5, 6, 7 or 8 petals. So, if you have 1 yard (0.9 m) 44-45"" (91.44cm) fabric and cut to 3"" (7.6cm) squares, you can make 24 flowers.

Glue the folds together.,
Continue to fold and glue petals.,
Stop folding when you have six to eight inches of loose burlap.,
Wrap the rest of the burlap around the base.",How to Make Burlap Flowers1," The wider you cut the strip the larger your rose will be. The same reasoning goes for how long you cut the strip. Use burlap ribbon or cut material around two inches wide and 45 inches long, or about two and a half centimeters by 11 and a half decimeters. Don’t follow the grain of the fabric for a slightly frayed look.





;
, Take one end of your burlap strip and wrap the entire two inches around a craft wire. You can find wire that is used to make flowers at your local craft store or order it online.







, Place a line of hot glue on the burlap next to the wire that is not yet rolled between it. Fold the wire and rolled piece of burlap over once to lay it over the line of hot glue. Press down lightly and let the glue cool down.







, Repeat the previous step about three more times, until the roll is about a half inch thick, or one and a quarter centimeters. This will be the middle of your rose.








, Hold the burlap strip about two inches from the wire roll. Fold the two inches, or 2.54 centimeters, of fabric over and away from the roll. Make sure you pinch the fold at the bottom of the flower base. This is your first rose petal.








, As you pinch the first fold with one hand, slightly turn the stem as you make another fold about a half inch, or one and a quarter centimeters, from the first with your opposite hand. Gather this second petal at the base, along with the other one.








, Place a drop or two of hot glue between the folds towards the flower base to secure them together. Be sure to hold the folds together as the glue dries and cools down.








, Repeat steps five, six and seven several more times. Remember to hold the fabric at the base of the flower, until you secure it with glue. Continue to turn the wire as you work around the entire stem.








, This length is also about one and a half to two decimeters. You should have what looks like a rose at this point, but keep some fabric loose in order to finish it. Make sure you secure the last folds with hot glue.

, To really make your rose stem look finished, wrap the rest of it around the base of the rose so that it’s just cupping it. You can wrap all the way around the base and secure it with glue, or use the end to create one last petal.

Size the flowers correctly.,
Fold a burlap strip in half lengthwise.,
Roll one end inward several times.,
Twist the burlap away from the center.,
Apply hot glue to the end of the burlap and twist underneath the flower.,
Glue a felt center on the flower base.",How to Make Burlap Flowers2," You may want to reconsider placing a burlap flower on a silk blouse. Hold a piece of burlap up to the material you want to use it on and make sure they match.

, Sometimes bigger isn’t always better so make sure you are sizing your flowers appropriately for your project. Fabric that is one and a half inches wide by 30 inches long, or about four centimeters by seven and a half decimeters, is a good size to start with. The longer strips of burlap you use the more petals you’ll have., Lay your strip of burlap flat on a table and fold it in half lengthwise. If you are working with a strip that’s one and a half inches (almost four centimeters) wide, it should be three-quarters of an inch (a little less than two centimeters) wide after you fold it.








, Pick up one end of the folded strip and begin rolling it inward. Continue rolling several more times so you have approximately two or three center layers This will create the center of your burlap flower.








, As you hold the rolled center with one hand, start folding and twisting the burlap down and around the centerpiece. Do not keep the rest of the burlap folded in half anymore. Continue to roll and twist the burlap around the center and restart if you need to.








, Hold in place for several minutes or until dried so your flower doesn’t unravel once you start working on the base.








, Place hot glue on the bottom of the flower and along the sides to ensure it is fully contained. Cover the bottom with a felt center and hold both pieces together, until the hot glue is dry and set.

Glue both ends together.,
Trim loose strings.,
Add a button or stone to the middle.",How to Make Burlap Flowers3," Make sure you cut along the same direction as the fibers. The width and length of the strip you cut will determine how big your end result will be. One and half to three inches, or 3.81 to 7.62 centimeters, is good for the width. Choose between 15 to 30 inches, or 3.81 to 7.62 decimeters, for the length.








, Secure one end of your flower by placing a strip of glue down the length of one end along the edge. Fold the edge over one time and lightly press down to set it in place.

, Find one string on the opposite end of the strip between the middle and bottom part of the width. Pull the string away from the rest of the strip. You should end up with a strip of bunched, gathered burlap.







, Take each end of the bunched strip of burlap and circle them around to connect them. Glue the ends together with a dollop of hot glue.








, You will likely have lots of frayed ends after you bunch and glue your burlap together. Even though you’re going for the frayed look on this one, trim any ends that look especially out of place.








, To add a decorative touch and make your flower look finished, add a rhinestone or button to the middle. You can also use another piece of fabric or anything you can think of to make your flower daisy-like.

Wait until you are finished with the roses, and put them in a standing position (vertical upward position) in a vase.,
Make sure that the flowers are completely dry before completing this step.,
Finished.








,Share your results.",How to Make Flowers from Old Bread," Dry them under the sunshine (in the windowsill is fine) for about half an hour. If there is no sun, dry in an oven on very low heat. Make sure that both sides of the slices are dried. When dry, each slice should be very crispy.









Separate the middle part from the crust. This is to make sure you get the color you want. The middle part is whiter, while the crust or outer part of the bread is almost brownish. You can use the middle part to make the rose petals and the brownish part for the leaves. You can mix them however, depending on the color you want your flowers to be. So, if you want white roses, use only the middle part for the petals.;
, You can use a food processor to do this.








, Mix them well to form dough (similar to pastry dough). The texture of this dough should also be similar to pastry dough.









At this point, you can add in the oil color of your choice. Again, work the dough well so that the color is evenly spread and mixed with the dough.














, It is recommended that you make thin petals, at least while you're learning. While thick petals are alright, the thin ones dry faster. For a rose:









Work from the inside first. Create the inner part of the rose, and decide on how big or small you want it to be.













Then, use your palm to make each of the rose petals. Alternatively, press the dough over the curve of a bottle or a rolling pin to form the curved shape instantly.













Use the artificial stem as the holder or stem for your rose base (or your own choice of flower). When using the artificial stem, bend the edge a little bit to form a curve. This prevents the petals from slipping away from the stems once they are dried.

, Put these flowers under the sunshine to dry (again, the windowsill is fine). They will harden and dry in a day or two under direct sunshine.








, Dip each rose into the wood varnish to cover completely. Then let them dry again. This varnish acts as a protector or a shield for the flowers and helps them to last longer. It also makes dusting them much easier.









You can also use spray varnish but it is much more expensive.

Add some petals to your food.",How to Dry Rose Petals," You can harvest flowers that you want to dry at any time during the growing season, but keep in mind that when they are at their biggest and brightest, they will also smell their best. Avoid picking roses that have browning petals--they will become fully brown when they dry.;
, This period of time is after the dew has dried, but before the midday sun has reached its strongest rays. Rose petals with any sort of moisture on them could potentially turn brown when dried because they will begin to rot. The hours before the midday sun are when most roses produce their strongest fragrance., Be sure to cut around the entire flower. You can also pluck the petals by gently pulling each one from the base of the stems.

, A mesh screen such as an old window or a flat metal strainer from your kitchen will work well. Make sure that the petals are in a single layer and that none of them are overlapping. If they overlap while they are drying, they will stick together and you will have to break them apart later., The best place to put your petals is on flat surface out of direct sunlight that has good air circulation. Placing petals directly in the sun will cause them to fade so avoid doing this. Avoid putting the petals in a damp area, as moisture in the air could cause them to rot.

, Air drying petals generally takes a couple of days. During that time, you should turn your petals over at least once a day. Rotating your petals will ensure that both sides of each petal will get enough air exposure., Only remove the petals after they have become crispy (almost the texture of corn flakes.) If they are not fully dry when you store them, they will begin to get moldy.

, Once you have done this, place the petals you would like to dry on the paper towels. Make sure that they are in a single layer without any overlapping petals. The petals will dry together if they are overlapping and will rip if you try to pull them apart., Once you have laid the petals in a single layer, cover them with another layer of paper towels. Place another plate on top of all of this so that it acts as a lid for the bottom plate.

, Heat on high until the petals are no longer damp to the touch, approximately 40 seconds. Microwave ovens tend to vary, so you may have to experiment to find the correct length of time for drying the rose petals., After the allotted amount of microwaving time, lift the top plate and layer of paper towels. The petals should feel dry but not crispy. If the petals still feel damp, place them back in the microwave and continue to ‘cook’ them.

, If you wish to make them crispier, spread the petals onto paper towels arranged on a flat surface. Choose a drying location away from breezes, moisture, light and dust.

, Make sure they are not overlapping. Depending on the type of dehydrator you use, the drying process could take a couple of hours (like if you use an Excalibur,) or a whole day (if you use a Nesco 600-watt machine.) However long it takes, you house will be filled with the wonderful fragrance of the roses., It is important to set it low because otherwise your roses could burn.

, As stated above, this can take a couple of hours or a whole day. When they are done, they should have a texture similar to corn flakes or very thin potato chips.

,,

,

,, The dried petals can be stored that way for extended periods. Make sure the storage containers seal tightly to prevent insects from entering and eating the petals. Do not store them in direct sunlight.

, The options are endless. Use them in your wedding, create a sensual experience, or add them to potpourri or try one of the following.

, Enhance a rose cocktail, create a festive rose petal punch, or indulge in some refreshing rosewater.

Buy a wire wreath base.,
Gather fall foliage.,
Design the wreath.,
Assemble the wreath.,
Add accents.,
Hang the wreath.",How to Create a Fall Wreath1," Wire wreath bases are circular shape and have bendable prongs that are used to hold wreath materials in place. They are perfect for making fall foliage wreaths, since you can twist the prongs around small leaf branches, bunches of flowers, and other items you may want to use. Wire wreath bases are available at craft stores.;
, To find gorgeous materials for crafting a fall wreath, all you have to do is step outside and look around. If you live in an urban place without many trees, go to your local nursery or craft store to look for supplies like these:


Bright fall leaves. Choose leaves that represent fall in your region, whether they're bright red maple leaves, yellow birch or hickory, or purple black gum leaves.
Evergreen foliage. Evergreen branches from firs, pines and other green trees will give your wreath a lovely scent.
Stalks of wheat or golden-hued grasses. Fall is harvest time, and stalks of wheat and other wheat-colored plants are a pleasant reminder that the seasons are changing.
Fall flowers. Chrysanthemums are a good choice in many regions, especially those that come in fall hues like red, maroon, orange and yellow.
Other regional foliage. Don't limit yourself to traditional symbols of fall; choose plants that are special to you. In some places fall comes with a burst of pink and blue nettles, and in other places it is characterized by evergreen branches dripping with rain. If something has meaning to you and you think it would look good on a wreath, bring it home.

, Now that you have an array of materials to choose from, lay out your wreath design. Arrange the materials in a circular shape to determine how your wreath will look. Consider the following arrangements:


Go for a wild, natural look. Alternate leaves, flowers, grasses, and branches using no particular pattern. Try to contrast colors and textures; for example, consider placing few strands of grass behind a bunch of red leaves to offset the colors.
Create an ordered look. Alternate leaves with flowers in a circular pattern, or arrange the items in threes: maple leaf bunch, chrysanthemum bunch, and wheat stalks, for example.
Make a color wheel design. Place all the red foliage together, then the orange, then the yellow, then the purple.

, Begin inserting the stems of the plants at an angle into the wreath base. Use the wire fasteners to hold the stems in place. Continue until your entire design is fastened to the base.


Hide the wire prongs by wrapping foliage around them and tucking it in behind other pieces that have already been fastened.
Use extra wire or string to make more fasteners if necessary; simply twist or tie it to the wreath base.

, Wrap a ribbon in circles around the wreath, or tie one in a bow and fasten it at the bottom of the wreath. Add decorative fake birds, pine cones, corn husks, and other fall items to fill out the spaces between the foliage you collected.

, The wire wreath base may have come with a hook or loop on the back to be used for hanging. If it didn't, make a hanging loop by twisting a piece of wire or tying a piece of string to the back of the wreath. Hang the wreath on your door or the side of your house.

"

Buy a 4-foot length of heavy gauge wire.,
Collect miniature pumpkins and gourds.,
Skewer the pumpkins and gourds on the wire.,
Bend the ends of the wire into hooks and connect them.,
Add accents.,
Hang the wreath.",How to Create a Fall Wreath2," Make sure the wire is pliable enough to be bent into the shape of a circle, and sturdy enough to hold its shape under the weight of mini pumpkins and gourds.

, Grocery stores and farmer's markets are brimming with tiny orange squashes throughout the fall season. Pick out small, lightweight pumpkins and gourds for your wreath.


Try to find pumpkins and gourds with interesting colors and textures. Choose orange, yellow, brown, green, and mottled pumpkins and gourds.
If you want a more uniform wreath, choose pumpkins that are all the same size and color.
For a longer-lasting wreath, go to a craft store and buy faux pumpkins and gourds instead of using fresh, perishable items.

, Create a pretty pattern with contrasting shapes, colors and sizes. Choose to alternate pumpkins with gourds or make a more random assembly of squash.


To skewer pumpkins, place the wire on one side of the pumpkin (an inch or so below the stem) and push it through the pumpkin horizontally so it comes out the other side.
To skewer gourds, place the wire at the largest part of the squash and push it through so that it comes out the other side.

, Use your fingers or a pair of pliers to bend the ends into c-shapes, then hook them together.

, Tie an autumnal ribbon at the base of the wreath, or add a sprig of evergreen as an accent.

, Fasten a string or a piece of wire into a loop, with its base tied or wrapped around the c-hooks you created to hold the wreath together. Hang the wreath from a nail on your front door or on your house.

Buy a wooden wreath base.,
Collect nuts and berries.,
Heat up a hot glue gun.,
Glue the nuts to the wreath base.,
Add the berries to the wreath.,
Hang the wreath.",How to Create a Fall Wreath3," Craft stores carry wooden wreath bases that are simply flat pieces of wood cut into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. If you can't find a wooden base, buy one that is plastic or styrofoam.

, If you live in a neighborhood with nut-bearing trees, you're in luck - just walk around the block with a paper sack and toss in acorns, walnuts, pecans, and buckeyes. Try to find nuts with intact shells and minimal bruises and cracks. Trim red berries from holly bushes and other plants that bear red, blue and blackberries in the fall.


You can use unshelled walnuts and pecans from the grocery store if you don't have access to nut trees.
Consider using faux berries from a craft store if you want your wreath to last more than one season.

, Hot glue guns are plugged into the wall and fed with clear hot glue sticks that melt and securely fasten craft items. Heat it up over a newspaper, since hot glue tends to get messy.

, Start by gluing a circle of nuts around the hole in the middle of the wreath. Glue a second circle around the first circle. Continue gluing nuts to the base until the entire wreath has been covered.

, Apply a bit of hot glue to the stem on a sprig of berries. Poke it in between a few of the nuts and hold it there for a few minutes so the glue has time to set. Continue adding sprigs of berries until you're satisfied with the way the wreath looks.

, A nut wreath is the perfect fall wreath to hang on a door in the kitchen. Hang it from a nail or rest it against the mantle, then enjoy the festive fall decoration you have created.

Note that the basic potpourri ingredients are derived from the following constituents:

Scented flowers and/or their petals



 


Fragrant woods, roots or barks






Herbs






Spices






Fixatives (vegetable origin): roots such as orris root and vetiver root; barks/woods such as sandalwood or cedarwood raspings; resins such as patchouli, gum benzoin (gum Benjamin) or frankincense; seeds such as vanilla pods/beans, tonquin or tonka beans; peels from citrus fruits (orris root and citrus fruits tend to be the most commonly used as they're the cheapest and easiest to obtain)






Essential oils or quality fragrance oils.,
Be artistic about what you use as ingredients.,
Choose appropriate display containers.",How to Make Potpourri1,"





;
, While scented flowers, woods, etc., should form the majority of what is added to a potpourri, modern forms of potpourri tend to be as much about appearance as scent, so there is still room for adding unscented items that look lovely.


Unscented items can often be made into scented ones by the addition of essential oils. For example, nuts or cones can be rubbed with essential oils to improve the scent.







, Potpourri can be stored in an amazing array of containers, just so long as they can hold the potpourri material and allow for the odor to escape freely. While there are custom-made potpourri holders, many household items can be used to hold potpourri too, such as trays, bowls, baskets, jars, large shells, sachets, platters and stuffed inside such items as cushions and sleep pillows.

Combine the fixative mixture with the dry ingredients mixture in the larger bowl.,
Place the ingredients into a container with a lid or seal.,
Place the dry potpourri into the display container.",How to Make Potpourri2," All plant matter must be dried out first, so as not to impart moisture when mixed.


When gathering plant materials, do this after the dew has dried off but before the sun has shone on the plant for too long, as this can reduce the volatile oils. Note however, not every potpourri maker finds this to be an issue; if you live in a mild and dry climate, afternoon picking may well work for you.
Always use the freshest and brightest flowers and herbs. Discard any plant material that looks damaged or is deteriorating in any way.
Both flowers and petals can be dried on sheets or paper or wire screens.
Petals are ready for use in dry potpourri when they are crisp to the touch. When drying them, toss regularly to ensure even air circulation and faster drying.
If using citrus peel, always remove the pulp and pith before drying the peel, as these moister elements can cause mold to grow.

, The standard, affordable fixative is orris root, available from craft stores or florists. The ratios will depend on the recipe you're following but as a general rule:


Every 4 cups of dried plant material requires 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of powdered spices, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of ground orris root (or other fixative), one strip of citrus peel and 2-3 drops of essential oil.

, The more oil added, the stronger the resulting scent.

, To distribute the essential oil evenly, rub the mixture together using your fingertips.

, The components will be determined by your recipe but usually this will be dried petals/flowers, dried leaves, whole spice pods, barks, dried moss, pine cones, herbs, etc.

, Mix with your hands to distribute everything evenly.

, Set aside in a dark, dry place for four to eight weeks, or for the length of time required by the recipe. This will give the scents time to mingle and form a mature fragrance.


For the first week, shake the container daily.
Leave as long as you like beyond the suggested time; the fragrance will continue to strengthen.
Any part of the mixture that is not required for use can be left in the sealed container until needed.

, After tipping the potpourri in, always rearrange to ensure that the most appealing pieces are visible at the top of the arrangement. Place where you want the scents to waft forth.

Begin to dye.,
Repeat the submersion and removal technique until you are happy with the colour and shade of the harakeke.,
Remove and cool.,
Finished.

",How to Dye Harakeke (Flax) With Crepe Paper," Have all of the equipment within reach for when the dye is ready. This is the most important thing you need to do before you begin.
If you are going to be using your kitchen as a work space, it may be worth while placing an old towel over the portion of bench you will be using to stop any dye from staining the bench top.
In addition, ensure that you have a bucket or container at least half filled with cold water, along with the harakeke you wish to dye, and a pair of steel tongs to hold the harakeke, close at hand.;
, Fill the pot you will be using to dye the harakeke with cold water to at least halfway. Once filled halfway, put it on the stove element. Turn on the element and wait for the water to begin boiling.
Aim for a medium to high heat; avoid using extreme heat because the water will boil too quickly.

While you are waiting for the water to boil, remove the crepe paper from its packaging and cut it into strips 3 centimeter (1.2 in) wide.






Once the water is boiling, add the crepe paper to the pot and leave boiling for a further 10 minutes.







, Remove the excess crepe paper from the boiling water with the tongs after the 10 minutes are up. Depending on what you want do, you can either put the boiled crepe paper to the side on a tinfoil plate for later use, or discard it. You will be able to tell when it is ready by looking at the tongs; when they come out of the dye, the colour will stick to them.

, Pick up the harakeke you want to dye, by using the tongs, and slowly submerge it into the pot of boiling dye. You can either dye something you have already made (as the example shows), or you can use fresh harakeke that can be woven later. Either way, do not submerge it too quickly, as it may cause the dye to splatter. To ensure an even coat, leave the harakeke submerged for five or six seconds, then remove so that it is still over the pot, but not in the dye. Try not to leave the harakeke in for any longer than the five or six seconds as leaving it in for too long will cook it and affect the final product.

, If you want a light colouring, then two to three dips may be enough. However, if it is a darker, richer colouring you are after, then it may be necessary to repeat six or seven times.

, Transfer the harakeke using the tongs; place into the bucket of cold water you prepared earlier as soon as you are satisfied with its level of colouring. Taking the harakeke out of the boiling dye and immersing it into cold water stops it from cooking and helps to seal in the colour. Once you have done that, lay the harakeke on the towel and allow it to dry for up to three hours.

Powdered fixatives work better in sachets or bags where the powder can be evenly distributed and kept confined; finely chopped fixatives are better for container-held potpourri where it blends in well and does not fall the base of the potpourri as the powdered fixative would do. However, it can be harder to find the chopped or whole version of your fixative; if so, the powdered version will still work, albeit a little more messily. Naturally, availability and price will also impact on your choice.;

Create a starfish pin.",How to Preserve a Starfish for a Decoration," Of the nearly 1500 species of starfish in the world, they all have one thing in common: they're slow. It can be very difficult to tell if a starfish you find is living or dead, but you can look for a few key signs that you'll be paying tribute to the beautiful animal by preserving it, not killing it.


If you come across a starfish on the beach, wait to touch it. Look at it closely. Is there any movement? Is there any bubbling from the sand underneath? If so, do it a favor by returning it into the water. Watch closely for several minutes to look for signs of life before picking it up.
If the starfish is brittle and unmoving, it's dead and safe to take home for preservation and decoration.;
, An optional step before preserving the starfish is to take some time to clean it up for display. While not essential, some collectors like to submerge the starfish in slightly soapy water and dry it thoroughly before soaking in alcohol or drying in salt.


If you want to do a pre-soak, dilute a tiny squirt of liquid detergent in several cups of water and soak the starfish to get it clean. Don't scrub or otherwise over-handle the starfish, which is fragile.
Dry the starfish thoroughly in the sun, taking care to weigh down each arm of the starfish. They tend to curl up some as they dry, so it's important to flatten them gently between two plates to maintain a uniform flatness.

, Generally, most collectors will go straight to the alcohol soak, but do whatever seems appropriate for the specimen you've collected. When you get your starfish home, soak it in enough isopropyl rubbing alcohol to cover the starfish and leave it alone for 30-48 hours.


Alternatively, some choose to soak their starfish in formalin, one part formaldehyde and five parts water. If you do this, be warned that the starfish will maintain a fairly strong chemical odor for a while until it dissipates somewhat. It might not matter if you're going to put it behind glass, but be aware. The process for this method is the same.

, Whatever series of steps you do to prepare the starfish and whatever you soak it in, you need to let it dry very thoroughly in the sun before taking it inside. Especially hot sunny days are perfect for drying starfish and ensuring that they'll last.


Weigh them down with plates (you shouldn't need to weight them with books or any extra weight) to ensure that the arms stay flat and even. Check on them regularly to make sure it's drying in the shape you want, if you want it to look a certain way for display purposes., One easy alternative method of preserving the starfish is to lay it out flat on a plate and cover it with a generous sprinkling of natural sea salt. Top it with a plate to keep the arms straight.


The salt crusting can work to suck any moisture out of the starfish and dry it out, preserving it quite nicely. You might consider doing this outside in the sun to avoid any smell and to dry it out more quickly.

, Whatever you end up doing with your starfish, displaying prominently or using for a craft project, make sure it stays dry and has time to dry down to a lower level of stinky-ness. There shouldn't be a considerable odor, but it can carry with it the smell of the alcohol for a while after you preserve it. Keep it in a dry place and don't jostle it too much.

, A common way to display starfish is alongside other shells, urchins, sand dollars and driftwood in a decorative shadowbox. This can be a nice accent to an office, living room, or other space, especially in houses near the beach.

, Instead of a bow, use a starfish. Gluing a preserved starfish can be a cool way to highlight your gift-wrapping. You could also hang it with ribbon from a gift bag to liven up the package. Pair it with an ocean-themed present for an added touch.

, Creating an ocean-themed centerpiece for your table is a nice way to use your preserved starfish. Placing shells and starfish in a simple and elegant bowl looks nice on your table from Christmas to summer, reminding you of the beach.


Glue starfish to napkin rings for a nice livening up of the place setting.
Ornament wine glass stems with starfish by tying them gently to the glass with ribbon. Make sure you remove them before washing the glasses.

, One of the simplest and most elegant ways to display your starfish and other sea preserves is to just fill a glass. It looks nice inside or outside, in formal settings or on end tables. It's an instant reminder of sunny days and waves.

, Carry your starfish with you by creating a nice broach or a pin and wearing it prominently. Clip it to your beach bag or your purse, your scarf or your jacket.

You can find rocks that have similar qualities at creeks, lakes, and on beaches. You can choose any rock that appeals to you, but rocks that are smooth are ideal for painting. Weathered rocks that that have been in the water for a long time are great for painting because they have tumbled, which has left them smooth and rounded.You can’t take rocks from state and national parks.
Be careful when you are searching for rocks. Do not get too close to the water unless you are sure that you will be safe or have someone watching you.;
, Make sure that no dirt is stuck to it, and it is not flaking off in any place. To clean the rock, put it in warm, soapy water and scrub it with a toothbrush. Then rinse it and pat it dry with a towel.








For tough spots use 100 grit sandpaper, followed by 150 then finally 220 grit sandpaper.

, Prepare the space where you will be painting the rock. You can paint anywhere you like, but a table or desk is ideal because it gives you space. Make sure to lay newspaper or paper towels out so that paint doesn’t get on the table., Choose any design that you desire. You can make the entire rock resemble something, like an animal, or paint a (very) small scene on the rock. Some options for animals are a cat, dog, fish, or owl. For a scene, you could paint a house or tree branch with a bird sitting on it. If the rock is big enough, you can paint an inspirational word, like “believe,” or “hope.”You can also paint monsters on the rock, like Frankenstein’s monster, to put out during Halloween.

, Once the rock is clean, use a pencil to sketch the design on the rock. You can start with paper first if that it helps you lay out your idea better than going straight to the rock. Sketching your idea on the rock will help you paint the design with better accuracy.








H grade pencils are great to use for light sketching with clean lines.
Use the pencil lightly so that it doesn’t show through lighter paint.

, Use acrylic paints from a tube, such as Liquitex, or a paint made for outdoor use such as Plaid paint. An acrylic patio paint, however, is ideal. It Is ideal because the paint is made to handle porous surfaces, like rocks, and weather the outside elements. A regular acrylic will work if you are planning to keep the rock inside, though.The paint has a bird house shape on the top to indicate that the paint is outdoor safe.
Make sure you have a palette to mix paint on. If you don't, you can use an old plate, wax paper, or foil folded around a piece of cardboard.

, The rocks will wear down the brushes as you paint them, especially if it is a hard rock. Get an inexpensive pack of brushes to use that has several sizes in it. This is so that you will have brushes to use for larger areas, then details can be painted with a smaller brush.If you want to use a specific type of brush, buy acrylic semi stiff brushes.

, A common problem is wanting to start on the details and then having to paint around it. First, paint the larger parts, like the base color or colors. When large areas are finished, let them dry before trying to paint next to or on top of them. It is your choice if you paint one or both sides of the rock.








If you paint both sides, allow at least a few hours to one day for the paint to dry on the first side before painting the second side.

, Layer colors, add texture, and paint the small details. You can also do this with a Sharpie or other permanent markers. This is also the time to go over small mistakes you may have made.








Wait until the paint is dry to layer colors. Don’t use dark colors on top of dark colors or light colors on top of light colors. Layer colors that have enough contrast so that the second layer won’t cancel out the first layer.
You can use a sponge to add texture that looks like foliage. Tear up a kitchen sponge, dab it into the paint, and sponge it into the rock.
To correct mistakes, you can paint a solid color on top of the mistake until it is not noticeable, or turn the mistake into something else. For example, you can paint over a bird in the “sky” and make it look like a cloud.

, Put it somewhere safe to dry where it won’t be touched or moved. Once you have painted everything, allow it to dry for at least several hours or one day. Check the rock when you think it is ready to make sure every part of it has dried., You can sign your name and date to remember when you painted the rock. This is especially good to do with children. Use a sharpie or other permanent marker so that it won’t rub off and will work on the rock.







, When the rock has had at least a day to dry, spray it with a clear urethane finish. This will prevent the paint from cracking and peeling. Do this outdoors or in a well ventilated area so you do not breathe the vapors.








This should be done by an adult or older child under adult supervision.

, You can either put the rock out for show, or put it to use. You can set it out on a tray, or put it on a windowsill. You can use it as a paper weight, or if the rock is big enough, use it as a stepping stone in a garden. The rock can also be a gift or token to give to a friend."

Store in a refrigerator to reuse later.",How to Make Glue1," Use your measuring cup and measure ½ cup of flour and ⅓ cup water in a medium sized bowl. This simple flour glue is great to make if you are making crafts for a party or something short-term. This glue, however, will not usually last on long-term projects because it will dry out.;
, Blend the mixture until it as thick as pancake batter. The paste should not be too thick or too drippy.









If you need more glue, simply double the recipe.
If you need less glue, start with the amount of flour you will use, then add water, a teaspoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency.

, Pour your glue paste in a saucepan and stir constantly until the mixture bubbles. Take it off the heat when the paste starts bubbling, and wait until the mixture cools before you use it.








, You can use a brush or your fingers to apply the glue to your crafts. The glue paste can be used to stick paper together for a variety of craft projects and decorations such as making greeting cards and kids projects.









This glue can become moldy over time. To prevent mold, you should dry your craft project completely over a heater.

, Keep any unused glue in a tightly-sealed container in the refrigerator. The glue should last a week or two.


If the glue gets dry, add a little warm water to reuse it.

If you want a smoother paste, you can sift the flour before you make your paste.

, In a small saucepan, mix the flour and sugar with a spoon or whisk until well-blended.








, Blend the mix until it is very smooth and lump-free. It will have the consistency of a thick paste. When smooth, whisk in the rest of the water, ¼ cup to ¾ cup depending on how runny you want your paste, and mix thoroughly. Blend your ingredients until your glue is smooth and a little runny but not watery. Your paste should not be too thick or too drippy.








, Pour your mixture in your saucepan and turn on the heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Once your mixture starts to boil, you can turn off the heat.








, When the mixture has cooled, use it for any craft projects including paper mache. Once you have finished, keep any unused glue in a tightly-sealed container in the refrigerator. This glue will keep for 2 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.

, When cooled, you can use this glue to make paper mache, craft projects, and anything else. It's totally non-toxic, too.









Make sure to dry thoroughly any of the crafts you make with this glue. If the project stays damp, it may grow moldy over time. Mold needs water to grow so as long as you pat your products dry or heat them over an oven, you will keep mold away.

Strain the curds from the whey.,
Place the curds left on the top of the paper towel between two dry paper towels.,
Combine the curds with 2 teaspoons of water and 1 teaspoon baking soda.",How to Make Glue5," Mix ingredients together well in a small bowl, and give the mixture 2 minutes to sit. The protein in the milk will clump together into small white lumps. And the chemical reaction will turn the protein of the milk into lumps or curds. The liquid that remains is called whey. 







, Put a paper towel over the top of a cup with a large mouth. Push down the paper towel in the middle so that it caves in. Then take your rubber band and put it around the top of the cup and paper towel to hold your paper towel strainer in place.








Choose a larger cup that you can pour the whole mixture of the curds and whey onto. Or pour the mixture onto the strainer, wait for it to strain and then pour on the rest., Carefully pour the curds and whey on top of the paper towel. The whey will drain into the cup while the curds will stay on the top of the paper towel.









Leave the curds and whey on the paper towel strainer for about 5 minutes to give it time to strain., Scoop the curds off of the top of the strainer and onto two paper towels. Press down on the curds so that all of the liquid whey is squeezed out. You want to make sure that you get out all of the whey to make the glue.







, In another small bowl, add the curds, water, and baking soda. Stir the mixture together well. You will be able to hear the sound of bubbles popping if you listen closely because the reaction of the baking soda with the curds creates carbon dioxide.

If you don't like the look of the rock, before it dries, wipe off the whole rock (or just a part of it) with a slightly dampened towel.,
After all the coloured paint has dried, add a coat of clear acrylic paint.",How to Paint a Rock Using Toothpicks," If you find the rock outside of your house, make sure it is clean. Give it a quick soapy wash to remove dirt or bugs from it to ensure it's easy to paint on.;
,, Use acrylic paint instead of other types of paint because it lasts longer and provides a thicker coat of paint. It will make it easier than using dry-style paints when painting with a toothpick. You may also want to buy some clear paint.

, Have a cup of water handy to dip your toothpicks in for instant cleaning.

,, Rocks will often have a lot of bumps and dents in them, so you need to smooth out the surface in readiness for painting. Paint a coat of white paint (with a paintbrush) onto the rock and let it dry. You will paint your designs on the white paint, so that the rock looks smooth and your painting will look much better.

, Use a soft-led pencil to sketch your design of the rock in place, if needed.

, Make sure you pick up a thick coating of paint.

, Just be sure to use a different toothpick for each new colour. Examples of what you can do include:


Drag the tip of the toothpick through the rock to mark a design of choice through the paint. That is a really good reason for painting with a toothpick, to carve a design through the paint.
Make dot art. Place many dots in a formation or pattern of choice. Change colours to form different parts of the design, such as brown paint to form a kangaroo's body, blue paint for its eyes and green paint for a plant next to the kangaroo.
Draw shapes, lines or letters. Or, draw a person, animal or object, all using the tip of the toothpick.

, Or, just use another new toothpick, so that the colours stay looking their best.

, This will lift off the paint, allowing you to begin again. You will need to be quick to do this though, as once the paint has dried, your only option is to repaint the rock white and begin again.

, This seals the paintwork in, helping to make it last longer. It will also cause the paintwork to glisten under light.

You can use the classic grey duct tape if you want to give your coin purse a homemade feel.
Make sure the width of your duct tape is two inches.;
, Cut an eleven inch strip of duct tape from your roll. Lay it sticky side up on your flat work surface. Cut another eleven inch strip of duct tape. Lay it sticky side up parallel to your first strip. It should overlap the first strip by a half inch. Repeat this two more times until you have four parallel strips of duct tape overlapping each other by a half inch. Make sure your strips of duct tape are stuck firmly together where they overlap. You now have the first side of your fabric.If you’re using multiple rolls, make sure you are alternating them with every strip to achieve your desired pattern.

Place half of one of your strips on a side of your purse with the other half of the strip hanging off. Fold the half inch of your strip hanging off onto the back off your coin purse so that it holds the side together. Run your thumb and forefinger over the strip so that it sticks. Repeat this process on the other side of your coin purse with your remaining strip.


After your sides are fastened, cut off the extra duct tape and throw it away.
You may prefer to rip your initial strip of duct tape in half rather than cut it with scissors to get a more equal split.
Using a different color or pattern of duct tape to fasten your sides can add flare to your coin purse.

, Open the flap of your coin purse. Put a small magnet in the center of your open flap. Cut a small piece of duct tape and put it on top of your magnet to keep it in place. Smooth out the small piece of duct tape over the magnet so it sticks securely.

, Lay a small piece of duct tape face up on top the area where your first magnet is. Hold your second magnet above the first. Depending on which way the magnets are facing, they can either repel or attract each other.Drop your second magnet on top of the first to make sure it’s facing the right way. If it lands away from your first magnet, turn it over and drop it again until it connects securely to the first magnet.


Don’t drop your magnet from too high a distance or you could end up losing it. About an inch should be an adequate distance.

, You’ll already have a layer of duct tape on top of your second magnet. Press the duct tape over your second magnet tightly so that it holds it in place. You want to make sure the layer of duct tape is strong enough to hold the second magnet down when you open your coin purse.

This will later become an internal pocket with an opening facing the central crease of the wallet.









Side pockets are great places to store cards you don’t use often and other odds and ends.
Note that a side pocket is the same height as (but slightly narrower than) half of the wallet body. This is to ensure that the wallet can still fold in half once the side pocket is installed.
If you modified the size of your wallet body, you will have to do the same with the side pocket. For example, if your wallet body is 3 inches high by 8 inches wide (7.5 x 20cm), make your side pocket 3 inches high by 3.75 inches wide (7.5 x 9.5cm).

, This will sit on the opposite side of the interior of the wallet, meaning its opening will face the opening of the other pocket.

, With the wallet body unfolded in front of you, place each side pocket over one side of the fold so that the outermost sides and bottoms line up. Fold tape over the bottoms and the two outermost sides, taking care to leave the interior edges (where the openings will be) uncovered. To tape the tops, place a 3.75-inch (9.5cm) piece of tape along the top of the side flap, then fold it over the interior flap of the wallet body, making sure not to tape the opening of the wallet shut.

Make another rectangular sheet measuring 1.5 by 3.75 inches (4 x 9.5cm).,
Create additional card pockets if necessary.,
Tape the bottom of the first pocket to the bottom of one interior side of the wallet.,
Tape the bottoms of any additional pockets to the wallet interior, placing each pocket slightly higher than the one before it.,
Tape the side edges of all the pockets.,
Put your money, ID, and other cards in your wallet.,
And your wallet is finished.",How to Make a Duct Tape Wallet3," Use the flip-and-fold method (like you did to construct the body) to make a slightly oversized rectangle, then trim it down to size. This will later become a pocket in which to hold a card.


Note that the card pocket is slightly narrower than half of the wallet body. This is to ensure that the wallet can still fold in half once the pocket is installed.
The standard bank/credit card is just over 2 inches (5cm) high. Making your card pockets slightly shorter than your cards will allow you to see and retrieve them more easily.
If you would like to have an ID card on display, make a rectangular sheet 3.75 inches (9.5cm) wide by however high that card is, then cut the center out so that the card information is displayed but the remaining frame still holds the card in place. You may even want to tape a piece of plastic (e.g. cut out of a clear document cover) behind this frame for a more finished effect.

, It’s best not to make more than three per side or the wallet will become bulky.

, Align it with the bottom-most edge of either the left- or right-hand side and run a thin strip of tape over the edge to secure it to the wallet interior. Flip the pocket over and repeat on the interior edge so that the cards cannot force its way under that first strip of tape. Do not tape the sides just yet.









The same applies if you have made an ID-display pocket.

, This will allow you to see all your cards at the same time. Remember that each card flap is slightly shorter than the card it will hold, so be sure not to place your pockets so high that the cards jut out of the wallet.

, For a cleaner look, you may even want to place your pieces of tape so that they run from the interior crease outwards across the pockets, around the corners, over the front face of the wallet, and finally back around the pockets on the other side, leaving no visible breaks on the front of the wallet.








, Alternatively, give the wallet as a gift or sell it.

,


When you first use the wallet, you may notice it doesn't stay closed; flatten it beneath some books for a few hours to fix the problem.

Cover each piece of cardboard in duct tape.,
Assemble your purse.,
Make your strap.",How to Make a Duct Tape Purse1," It now comes in a variety of colors (and patterns!) as well as the standard gray.


Duct tape has so many uses it's now available just about anywhere. Walmart has a good selection and each roll runs at about $5.00 right now.
Feel free to choose as many colors or patterns as you desire. You could also place a different color on the inside.;
, The five pieces will be the bottom, large sides and small sides of your duct tape purse.


The size of the purse is entirely up to you; just make sure the sides match up and fit with the bottom.

, Cover it fully, making sure that it is all gray (or whichever color you've chosen) by the time you're done.


To cover a corner, run over it with duct tape and cut the tape so that you form a good, neat corner.

, Once you've covered all your pieces, put everything together by placing the pieces on the bottom of the purse and taping them on.

, To do this, take two pieces of tape and cut them to the length you want. Now place them together, leaving a little space.


This space, once folded over, will keep your strap from feeling sticky. Now just tape the strap to the bottom of the bag.

Tape the insides of your purse and along the top edge.,
Cover a pre-measured rope in duct tape.,
Place your grommets in the desired position.,
Insert the strap into the grommets and secure.",How to Make a Duct Tape Purse2," Remember, your purse will be half this size.


Avoid fabrics that are too thin or sheer. Your tape needs something to cling to and shouldn't let the duct tape show on the inside.

, This makes it secure when you're working with the tape.


Decide what kind of colors and patterns you want for your purse before you go any further. You are not limited to vertical or horizontal strips; make any pattern you want or cut up the tape into shapes.

, The tape should cover all of the fabric and leave none exposed.


Go past the fabric an inch (2.5 cm) or so. Taping to the table or floor should not be an issue (use a clean surface!).
Overlap the tape as uniformly as possible.

, Peel your piece off your surface and turn it over, fabric side up.


Turn over your purse. You should see a giant rectangle of duct tape.

, Don't tape up the top!


This serves as the seam and can be a completely different color or pattern of tape.
It's easier to lay the duct tape (the seam) sticky side up on the table and put the purse on top to meet it.
Trim the excess with scissors.

, This is the trickiest part.


Before you insert the seam into the bottom of the bag, fold it onto itself to make it un-sticky. Then insert it; it should be much easier to manipulate.
The seam should be tucked into the fabric, disappearing.

, This gives it structure.


Tape along the bottom one strip of duct tape. This gives it a base.
Tape one strip along each side. This gives it a sturdy left and right.
Tape along the top to remove any rough edges.

, This serves as your strap.


Make it a bit longer than you need; a bit will be used to be knotted or taped to the inside.

, There should be simple directions on the package.


If you don't have grommets, you can stick to a plain duct tape strap. Duct tape is very sturdy and won't budge; however, grommets give your purse a more professional look.

, Your duct tape purse is complete.

Use a ruler for an exact measurement.
Fold each strip in half lengthwise. Try to be diligent in folding; the opposite side of the duct tape is a different color and will be seen.
Repeat this 23 times. That's right, 23. Use a different color on occasion if you see fit.

Put weights on them (books, stacks of paper, boxes) to flatten them out.



, Measure out 25 inches (63.5 cm) of your main color.


Fold each strip in half, just like you did with the horizontal strips. Do this 12 times.
Cover all straps with weights for around an hour to flatten completely. They'll be easier to work with.

, Rip off a piece of duct tape from your main color that's about 14 inches (36 cm) long.


Fold it in half sticky side out and make a crease.
Line all 12 of the vertical strips along the crease. Get them up close and personal to each other.
Reverse the seam and fold along the crease, adhering the ends together.
Do this for both sides.

, Make sure each strip is snug in its place.


For weaving, go under, over, under, over for the first strip and then over, under, over under for the second. Repeat.
Throw in a different color here and there to mix it up.

, This should go on the back of your purse. It acts as a liner.


Be as straight as possible--the strips will create lines.
Don't skip this part; the liner makes your bag much sturdier.
Continue weaving and constructing the lining as you go until you meet the far seam.

, Leave half of the strip hanging, exposed.


Flip the entire piece over and fold the hanging edge over, taping it to the opposite side of the bag.
Repeat for both sides.

, These will serve as the sides. They should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 8 inches (20 cm) tall.


Fold your strip in half sticky side out. Lay on another strip sticky side up touching the upper, sticky edge of your first piece.
Unfold the bottom piece so that the two pieces are totally stuck together. Fold the top sticky part over the middle, so that there is only sticky on the bottom edge.
Flip it over and repeat.

If you're lost, we understand. Basically, halfway overlap the pieces of tape, flip it, halfway overlap them again and repeat until it is the size you want.


With the last one, fold it down so you have a sheet with no sticky band at the top or bottom.

, You want your sides to be a bit bigger at the bottom than at the top.


Like a triangle...but not quite. The two sides should come to a point if the piece were to go on.

, Count 8 strips in for centering.


This will not be centered; one side is supposed to be longer than the other.

, This will adhere the sides together.


Fold it in half sticky side out.
Connect the sides together. Repeat this three more times.

, This hides any pieces that wound up not completely straight.


One side should be longer than the other. It's a flap-top purse; the longer side serves as the cover.

Attach velcro to keep the purse from opening needlessly.



, Cut three strips a bit longer than half the length you want the strap to be.


Lay one down, sticky side up. Cover half of it with another strip, sticky side down. Fold one half over the other.
Flip the piece and cover the now-exposed sticky edge halfway with the third sticky piece.
Flip over again and fold the edge down so there are no exposed edges.
Tape the two pieces together and tape them to the inside of the bag.

",How to Make a Duct Tape Backpack," Lay it down on a table, sticky side up. Continue to cut multiple pieces of duct tape that are 15 inches long. Each time you cut a new piece, lay the non-sticky side onto the sticky side of the duct tape already on the table. Overlap the pieces about 1/2 inch. Do this until it is 11 inches wide.At the end of this step, you should have one large sheet of duct tape, all sticky side up. If the size is a little over 11 inches, you can cut the excess off later.;
, The direction in which the duct tape is facing should now be shifted. Cut more pieces of 15 inch long duct tape. Add them, sticky side to sticky side, onto the already made sheet. The pieces of duct tape should be placed perpendicular to the already existing sheet. Overlap each of these pieces by about 1/2 inch.Make sure all of the sticky sides from the previously made sheet are covered. If there are some sticky sides left around the sides, this is fine. You will trim them off later.

, Use a pair of scissors and cut off any excess amounts of tape. Try and keep the size, 15X11 inches, as best as you can. This project does take into account some discrepancies, so if your rectangle is a tad short, don't worry about it.If you want too, you can reinforce the edges of your rectangle with another layer of duct tape. After you get done cutting, simply take a piece of duct tape, and fold it around the edges and corners. This will keep your backpack from potentially fraying.

, Instead of one that is 15 inches long by 11 inches wide, you will want to make it 30 inches long by 11 inches wide. The first rectangle will represent the front of your backpack, while the second rectangle will be the back and the folding flap (that is why you need the extra length). Simply repeat the previous three steps, but this time replace the length from 15 to 30 inches., You are going to do exactly what you did in the first three steps. However, in this case, both the lengths and the widths will change. For the sides of your backpack, you will need TWO pieces that are each 11 inches long by 5 inches wide. For the bottom, you will need one piece that is 15 inches long by 5 inches wide., Lay the back piece (11X30) on a flat surface. Take one side piece(5X11), and lay it to the long side of the back piece. Take the other side piece, and do the same to the other side of the back piece. The long sides of the side pieces should lay against the long sides of the back piece.Slide both side pieces down, until their edges are parallel with the bottom of the back piece. This will leave room at the top for the flap in your backpack.
Tape each piece on using duct tape. Make sure to tape both sides. This will help reinforce and stabilize your backpack.

, Take the bottom piece (5X15) and place it at the bottom of the back piece. Make sure the long side of the bottom piece is against the short side of the back piece. Note: this should be done next to the side pieces, not on the flap side of the back piece.Tape the bottom piece to the back. Make sure that you get both sides.

, Take the front piece (11X15) and place it next to one of the side pieces. The long side of the front piece should rest next to the long side of the side piece you chose. Tape it on using duct tape. Make sure to get both the front and the back., Take the front piece in your hand and fold it over. As you are doing this, also fold up the side piece you will be joining it with. Hold them tightly together. Grab a piece of duct tape and place it on the outside of the conjoining edges. Do your best to also place of duct tape inside the conjoining edges, although this can be difficult., Press the sides inwards, while lifting the front piece up. Fold and bend the corners until the corners are resting at 90 degree, square angles. Pinch the edges with your hands to make nice creases, and hold the angles. This step is absolutely necessary in order to properly tape the bottom flap on.

, Lift it up and press it tightly against the other three edges. Take a piece of duct tape and run it along the long edge. Then take two shorter pieces and run them along the shorter edges. If you can, lift your backpack up, and place some extra pieces of duct tape on the inside of the conjoining edges.Crease the edges of the bottom flap, so that your backpack continues to hold the sharp 90 degree angles.

, Take a roll of duct tape, and place the loose end near the bottom of the backpack. Begin to wrap the duct tape around the back, sides, and edges. Shift over a little bit, each time you make another pass around. Once you get to the opening at the top, cut the duct tape off. This will give your backpack some extra stability, and protect your items from getting wet., You have two options here. You can square your flap, or let the flap remain as is. To square the flap, first take it down as far as you are comfortable with taking it. Do not take it all the way to the bottom. Hold the flap in this position, as you bend the flap, and make creases. These creases should bend nicely over the top edges of the backpack.


If you want to leave as is, simply bend the flap down, and use your hand to curve it slightly., Measure out one long piece of duct tape, about a yard long. Measure out a second one, a yard long as well. Stick the two pieces together, sticky side to sticky side. Cover the edges of the pieces with another layer of duct tape. Repeat this twice in order to make two straps.Tape each of these straps to the back part of the backpack (below the flap). You can move them side to side, up or down, depending on your own comfort level.
Reinforce the straps with multiple layers of duct tape. Since these straps will carry the brunt of the load, you will need to secure them with many layers of tape, crossed over one another.

, Cut two large pieces of duct tape, about a yard long each, and attach them together sticky end to sticky end. Place some duct tape on the edges to smooth out the strap, and to prevent it from sticking to your clothes. Finally, attach the strap to the back of your backpack, about two inches from the bottom of the flap, and 8 inches apart.You can adjust the measurements, depending on your size, and the comfort level.
Make sure to use lots of duct tape to secure the strap. The strap is what will be taking the brunt of the load.

, The most common way to secure a backpack is with a button. Punch two holes in the front of your backpack, about 3 inches from the bottom, in the center, 1/4 inch apart from one another. You can do this with a knife or a pair of scissors. Find a button that you like, and which goes with your backpack.


Lace a strand of string through the two holes in the backpack, and then lace them through the button. Finally secure the button with a knot. How to Sew a Button

Cut a slit, the diameter of your button into the flap. Do this cut about one inch from the end of the flap.

, First, you will need to buy magnets with removable adhesive strips. If you cannot find them, use super glue in order to secure the magnets. Simply put one magnet on the front of the backpack, about 3 inches from the bottom, in the center. Then attach another magnet on the inside edge of the flap.If you are using glue, give the glue a few minutes to dry before you test them out.
Make sure that you are using magnets which attract one another. You do not want to glue on two positive magnets, or two negative ones. Otherwise, they will repel one another.

, A more elegant way of securing your backpack is to lace a ribbon through, and finish it off with a beautiful bow. First, poke two holes in the front of the backpack, 3 inches from the bottom, in the middle, and an inch apart. Then cut two holes into the flap, about an inch from the end of the flap, and an inch apart.Find a nice ribbon and lace it through the front holes first. Then bring down the flap, and lace it through those holes as well.
Finally, tie a bow, or a knot, depending on your preference. How to Tie a Bow

",How to Make a Duct Tape Pencil Case2," You can make this design to size, if you know what size you'd like. Measure the longest pen.

, You can do this project in just one color, but if you have a second color, you can make a contrasting liner. We'll call the two colors the liner color (shown here in yellow) and the cover color (shown here in blue). If you want you can personalize it, try using different colors of tape, stickers, craft foam and pipe cleaners.

, Fold evenly!

, When working with duct tape, you can lift if for the first few days. After that, don't count on changing anything.

, Decide where you want the fold. You may want to leave a little extra length in case you ever get a pen or pencil that's a bit taller than the ones you have now.

, The easiest is to cut a straight line on a slight angle, but if you want to cut a bit of a curve, you can. In order for the sides of the curve to be equidistant, fold the top flap lengthwise in half and cut the curve through the edges while they are held together.

, If you curved the end of the top flap, you'll need to cut little slits in the duct tape on one side to receive it so it will stick flat. Here, there's another bit of tape to line the tab.

Find a small, lightweight object that is flat on one side.,
Find a magnet that fits your object.,
Consider cleaning the back of your object with rubbing alcohol.,
Place a swirl of glue on top of the magnet.,
Press the back of the object down into the glue.,
Let the glue dry before using your magnet.",How to Make Refrigerator Magnets1," You can turn almost anything you want into a magnet. Look for something that is between 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide/tall and not too heavy. Make sure that the bottom or back of the object is flat. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Legos
Small stones
Seashells and starfish
Large rhinestones
Small, plastic animals
Colorful buttonsBroochesScrapbooking embellishments (plastic flowers, cabochons, etc);
, You should not be able to see the magnet from behind your object. You can use a round button magnet. You can also cut a rectangle out of a thin, magnetic sheet. Keep in mind that the flat, sheet magnets tend to be weaker than the thicker, button magnets. It is best to save those weaker magnets for light objects.


If your object is large, consider gluing two small button magnets to the back: one at the top, and one at the bottom.

, If your object is very dirty, the glue may not stick to it. Simply soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, and wipe the back of the object with it.

, The entire top surface of the magnet should be coated with glue. You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue. Hot glue will be suitable for items made out of wood, foam, paper, and lightweight plastic. An industrial strength glue will be best for heavier objects, and anything made from plastic, metal, or glass.


Even if the magnet has a sticky back, it might be a good idea to use some glue. The adhesives on these types of magnets usually are not very strong or long-lasting.

, Press it down firmly enough so that the item sticks to the glue, but not so firmly that the glue gushes out all over the place.

, This can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to several hours. For example, hot glue will set within minutes, but an industrial strength glue may require up to a day in order to cure properly. If you are using an industrial strength glue, double-check the label to see how much time you need for it to dry and cure.

Gather your supplies.,
Find a clear, glass gem.,
Wipe the back of your glass gem clean with rubbing alcohol.,
Choose your backing.,
Use the gem to trace a circle onto your backing.,
Cut the backing out.,
Spread a thin layer of glossy Mod Podge on the back of the glass gem.,
Press the backing face down into the glue.,
Apply another coat of Mod Podge to the back of your gem.,
Allow the Mod Podge to dry completely.,
Glue a round magnet to the back of your gem.,
Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",How to Make Refrigerator Magnets2," These magnets are made of flat-backed glass marbles, like the type you might put in a vase. The magnets are small, but colorful. Here's a list of what you will need to make such a magnet:


Clear, glass gem/vase filler
Backing (photo, colored paper, fabric, etc)
Glossy Mod Podge
Paintbrush or foam brush
Round magnet
Hot glue or industrial strength glue

, They are usually flat on one side, and slightly domed on the other. You can find them in the vase filler or floral section of an arts and crafts store. Look for something that is at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter. This will allow you to see more of your design.


You might also see them labeled as vase fillers, cabochons, marbles, and glass stones.

, Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe the flat side of the gem. This will get rid of any dirt or oils that might prevent the glue from sticking.

, You can use almost anything you want as your backing, such as colored paper or a photo. You can even use nail polish. If you want to use a letter or an image, place your glass gem over it. You will be able to see how much of your letter or image will show through the gem. Here are some ideas of what you can use:


Photos
Pages from old books
Old maps
Scrapbook paper or wrapping paper
Newspaper or magazine pages
Patterned fabric
Nail polish

, You can use a large hole punch to cut out a perfect circle, if you can find one that is the same size as your gem. Most glass gems, however, won't be perfectly round, so it might be better to trace them.

, Most glass gems are beveled on the bottom, so you might want to cut just inside the line that you drew., Apply it using a paintbrush or a foam brush. Make sure that it is even, and that the entire back of the gem is covered. You can also use another clear-drying liquid glue.


If you are using nail polish, you don't need to apply any Mod Podge. Simply brush on a few coats of nail polish onto the back of your stone.

, Smooth it out using your fingers, starting from the center and working outward This will get rid of any air bubbles and wrinkles.

, Make sure that you go a little bit over the edges of your backing. This will seal it to your gem.If you used nail polish, consider brushing on a top coat onto the back to seal it.

, A good indicator is when it turns clear, but it is better to let it dry overnight. This will also allow the Mod Podge to cure and make it less tacky or sticky.

, You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue. Place a thin layer of glue onto the magnet, then press the magnet down into the back of the gem.

, Hot glue will set within a few seconds, but industrial strength glues will need a much longer drying and curing time. If you are using an industrial strength glue, refer to the label for a specific drying and curing time. Just because something looks and feels dry does not mean that it is fully cured and ready to be used.

Gather your supplies: Clothespins can make great magnets because you can use them to clip and hold things such as memos and recipes.,
Buy some wooden clothespins.,
Decorate your clothespin.,
Allow the clothespin to dry, if necessary.,
Cut your magnet down to fit your clothespin.,
Glue the magnet to the back of your clothespin.,
Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",How to Make Refrigerator Magnets3," Here's a list of what you will need to make one:


Wooden clothespins
Magnet (sheet is recommended)
Glue
Decorations, such as paint, washi tape, etc

, They must be the type that have a spring in them. The solid wood ones that don't open and close won't be suitable for this.

, This is where you can get really creative. However you decide to decorate it, make sure that you leave the back blank, or you won't be able to glue the magnet on. Also, make sure that you can still open and close the clothespin. Here are some decorating ideas:


Cover the top and sides of your clothespin with washi tape. Washi tape is a type of patterned scrapbooking tape. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.
Paint your clothespin using a small paintbrush and acrylic paint. You can paint it all one color, or many colors. Simple designs, such as stripes, will work best on the clothespin.
Glue a thin, flat wooden shape, such as a cat or dog, to the top of the clothespin. The wooden shape should be about the same length as the clothespin. You can find the wooden shapes in the wood section of an arts and crafts store.
Glue down some buttons down the center of your clothespin. Play around with different shapes, colors, and patterns, just make sure that the buttons are the same width as the clothespin.

, Depending on how you decorated it, this can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Some decorations, such as washi tape, don't require any drying time.

, Cut a strip of magnetic sheeting down to fit the back of your clothes pin. If you are using round, button magnets, plan on using two magnets per clothespin.

, You can use an industrial strength glue or hot glue. Draw a line of glue down the back of the clothespin and press the magnet down into the glue.


If you are using round button magnets, place a drop of glue on the top and bottom of the clothespin back. Press the round button magnets into the glue.

, Once the glue dries, you can use the clothespin to hold recipes and memos to the door of your fridge.

Consider jewelry that is large enough to transform into a magnet.,
Look for further damage to the jewelry.,
Make sure none of the broken jewelry is extremely valuable.,
Consider whether the jewelry needs professional cleaning before you create the magnet.,
Remove any hooks, pins or chains from the piece.",How to Turn Broken Jewelry Into Magnets1," Even though you may have a piece that is precious it may not be large enough to make a singular statement. You could group smaller pieces together to make one large magnet or use the smaller pieces for another project.;
, You want whole pieces that may have broken off a chain or hook but are still in good condition. Avoid using cracked or shattered pieces as they may be too delicate for everyday use.

, For example, you won’t want to turn a broken ruby ring into a magnet so be sure you separate the extremely valuable pieces from the rest.

, Especially if the jewelry sat in a jewelry box for some time, it may have tarnished or could use a good polishing. Determine if it's a job you can do on your own with simply jewelry cleaner or if a professional should attempt to clean it.

, You want the item to be a singular piece that makes a statement on its own. Use a pair of pliers or even scissors to remove any other hooks or pins before using.

Gather your materials.,
Wrap the screw with thin coated copper wire.,
Loop the ends of the wire.,
Attach the wire loops to your battery.,
Use your magnet to pick things up.,
Try a different type of nail or screw.You might find that different materials have different levels of magnetism.,
Use a larger screw or nail.A larger screw or nail may also have more magnetic power than a small one because you can coil more copper wire around it.,
Attach a larger battery.AA batteries work well for this experiment, but maybe a larger battery will make your electromagnet more powerful.,
Add a switch.By adding a knife switch, you can control the flow of power with the push of a button.",How to Create a Magnet With a Wire and a Nail," Making a mini-electromagnet is a fun, easy project. You can use it to learn more about how magnets work, or just as a way to pick up some paperclips that you spilled on your desk. To make a mini-electromagnet, you will need:nail or screw (at least three inches long and made from iron, zinc, or steel)some thin, coated copper wire
scissors
one AA battery
electrical tape
something to pick up, such as metal paperclips or tacks;
, Take your nail or screw and begin wrapping the copper wire around it, but make sure that you leave a tail of about three inches. You will need this to connect the wire to the battery.








Coil the wire tightly around the nail or screw until you reach the end. Then, leave another three-inch tail. Cut the wire about three inches past the end of the nail or screw.
When you are done, you should have two three-inch pieces of copper wire hanging off of the ends of your screw or nail.

, Take the wire pieces that are hanging off of the ends of your screw or nail. Then, curl up the ends of these pieces of wire a little bit, as if you are making a tiny loop on each end.








Looping the ends of the wire will help to create a better connection between the battery and the wire.

, Next, take the loops that you created and attach one loop to each pole of your battery. Attach one to the positive pole and the other to the negative pole.








Secure each of the wire loops to the opposite poles of your battery with a small piece of electrical tape.

, After you have attached the wires and secured them with tape, your mini-electromagnet is complete. Now you can use the wire-wrapped part of the nail or screw to pick up things like paperclips, tacks, nails, screws, and other small metal objects.








If your mini-electromagnet does not work, then check to ensure that the wires are making close contact with both ends of the battery. If they are loose or not connected, then the electromagnet will not work.
Detach the copper wires from the battery when you are done using the magnet. The magnet will become hot if the wires are connected for too long.

, Try swapping an iron nail for a steel one to see if this increases or decreases the amount of paperclips you can pick up.


Don’t forget to count the number of paperclips that your current design can lift before you make adjustments.

, Try upgrading your current screw or nail with a larger one to see if this makes the magnet more powerful.

, Try swapping your AA battery for a D battery to see if this results in a more powerful magnet.


Attach the wires to the D battery the same way that you would attach them to the AA battery.

, To add a knife switch, you will need two D batteries, more wire, and a knife switch, which you can find in most hobby stores.


Coil the wire around your nail or screw, then connect the wire from one end of the screw to your knife switch.
Then, connect the wire from the other end of the nail or screw to the negative pole of one of the D batteries.
Next, connect a piece of copper wire between the positive pole of your battery that is connected to the screw and the negative pole of the battery that is not yet connected to anything.
Finish the circuit by connecting a wire between the remaining positive pole and the knife switch.
Close the knife switch and you should be able to pick up some paperclips or tacks.

Gather your supplies.,
Roll out some air dry paper clay until it is about 5 mm thick.,
Use a rubber stamp to imprint some designs into the clay.,
Use a cookie cutter or a craft knife to cut shapes into your clay.,
Let the clay dry.,
Use a fine-grit sandpaper to buff away any ragged edges.,
Consider painting your piece.,
Seal the front and back of your clay piece.,
Glue a round magnet to the back of your clay piece.,
Allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.",How to Make Refrigerator Magnets4," You can make beautiful magnets out of clay and rubber stamps. Paper clay dries white, making it the perfect surface to paint on. It also dries lightweight, so it won't slide down the door of the fridge. Here's a list of what you will need: Air dry paper clay
Rolling pin
Cookie cutters or craft knife
Rubber stamps
Ink pad (optional)
Clear acrylic sealer
Round button magnet
Hot glue or industrial strength glue

, You don't want to make it too thin or too thick, or it may crack while it dries. Paper clay is great, because it dries very lightweight.

, You will be punching out shapes later. This is to give the shapes some texture and design. You can use ornate designs, such as damask and scrolls. You can also use pictures or symbols, such as a cat, dog, heart, or star.


If you want your design to be colored, then press your rubber stamp into a colored ink pad first. The color will transfer to the clay, along with your design.You can also use ornate buttons or brooches to stamp designs.

, You can make any shape you want, but simpler shapes (such as circles and squares) might show off your design better.

, Depending on how dry or humid it is, this can take several hours or overnight.

, If the cookie cutters didn't cut clean, you can smooth the edges down with some sandpaper.

, You can paint it using some watercolor paints or acrylic paints. Watercolor paints will give you a sheer finish, and acrylic paints will give you a more opaque finish. Allow the paint to dry before moving on.

, The clay will dry matte, but if you use a glossy sealer, you will get a glazed look. Seal the front first and let it dry before sealing the back. This will help your piece last longer. It will also prevent the magnet from peeling off.


You can spray it with a clear acrylic spray sealer. You can also apply some Mod Podge over it instead using a paintbrush or a foam brush.

, You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue.

, Hot glue sets quickly, but industrial strength glues require several hours to dry and cure. Refer to the label on your glue as each brand is a little different.

Gather supplies.,
Rub the magnet against the paperclip.,
Touch the paperclip against the smaller piece of metal.",How to Make a Magnet1," A simple temporary magnet can be made with a tiny piece of metal, such as a paperclip, and a refrigerator magnet. Gather these items as well as a smaller piece of metal, such as an earring back or a tiny nail, that you can use to test the magnetic properties of the magnetized paperclip.

Experiment with different paperclip sizes, and uncoated versus coated paperclips.
Gather smaller objects in a range of sizes and metals to see which ones will stick to the paperclips.;
, Move it in the same direction, rather than back and forth. Use the same quick motion you'd use to light a match. Continue rubbing the paperclip with the magnet 50 times as quickly as you can.
, Does the small piece of metal stick to the paperclip? If so, you've successfully magnetized it.

If the metal won't stick to the paperclip, rub it 50 more times and try again.
Try picking up other paper clips and larger objects to determine how strong the magnet is.
Consider recording the length of time the paper clip stays magnetized after a certain number of rubs. Experiment with different types of metal, like pins or nails, to see which one makes the strongest, longest-lasting magnet.

Find a bottle of clear school glue.,
Squeeze out some of the glue into a small jar.,
Open up a container of extra fine, scrapbooking glitter.,
Take the cap off the glue bottle and add about a tablespoon (15 grams) of glitter.,
Consider adding a few drops of food coloring to make your glitter glue more colorful when it dries.,
Close the bottle tightly, and shake it to mix the glue and glitter.,
Add more glitter if necessary.,
Use the glue to draw glittery designs and letters on your art projects.",How to Make Glitter Glue1," The glue bottle should have a pointed, nozzle tip. This will make it easier to squeeze the glue out and draw designs with. Try to get the clear type of school glue. White school glue dries matte, and the glitter won't sparkle as well.


Make this type of glue if you'd like to draw pictures, write letters, or outline something. If you are going to cover a large area, click here to learn how to make a glitter glue you can brush on.;
, You don't need to squeeze out a lot of glue. A spoonful or so will be enough. Close the jar tightly, and set it aside to use for other projects. You are pouring out some of the glue to make room for the glitter.#* If you want super sparkly glitter glue, take out more glue.

, Avoid the regular craft glitter. It is too chunky, and will be more likely to clog up the bottle.

, You can always add more glitter later, if it is not enough for you. Keep in mind that glitter glue is usually more sparkly once it dries.

, After regular glitter glue dries, only the glitter will show up. If this is not colorful enough for you, add a few drops of food coloring. This way, when the glue dries, you will see glitter and some color.


The more drops of food coloring you add, the darker the color will be.
If you are using white or iridescent glitter, you can use any color of food coloring. Lighter colors will work better than darker.
Try to match the food coloring to the glitter color. For example, if you are using blue glitter, use blue food coloring. The more food coloring you add, the darker your color will be.

, Make sure that the nozzle is screwed shut as well before you do this. If the glitter and glue are not mixing well enough, turn the bottle upside down first, and then shake it.

, Depending on how big the bottle of glue was to begin with, you may need to add more glitter to get the degree of sparkle you want.

, Try to stick with simple designs, such as spirals, snowflakes, spider webs, hearts, and starts. It is also great for outlining borders on handmade cards.


Draw some spider webs or snowflakes on a sheet of wax paper. Let the glue dry, then peel the design off. Hang it as a decoration, or use it as a window cling."

Gather supplies.,
Strip the ends of the wire.,
Wrap the nail.,
Connect the battery.,
Use the magnet.",How to Make a Magnet2," Electromagnets are created by running an electric current through a piece of metal to create a magnetic field. This can be done on a small scale using these supplies, which are available at hardware stores:

A large iron nail
3 feet of thin coated copper wire
A D-cell battery
Small magnetic objects, like paperclips or pins
Wire strippers
Masking tape

, Use the wire strippers to remove a few centimeters of insulation from either end of the copper wire. The uninsulated ends will be wrapped around the ends of the battery.
, starting about 8 inches from the end of the wire, wrap the nail tightly. Each wrap should be touching the last, but don't overlap them. Continue wrapping until the nail is covered from head to tip.

Make sure you wrap in the same direction down the nail. In order to create a magnetic field, the electricity must flow in the same direction.






, Wrap one end of the exposed wire around the positive side of the battery and the other end around the negative side of the battery. Use a small piece of masking tape to secure the wire in place on both sides.

Don't worry about which end of wire you attach to which end of the battery. The nail will become magnetized either way; the only difference is that its polarity will change. One side of the magnet is the north pole, and one side is the south pole. Reversing the wires will also reverse the poles.





Once the battery is attached, the wires will grow hot as electricity begins passing through them, so be careful not to burn yourself.

, Place the nail near a paperclip or another small piece of metal. Since the nail is magnetized, the metal will stick to the nail. Experiment with different sizes and weights to see how much strength your magnet has.

Gather supplies.,
Magnetize the needle.,
Stick the needle through the cork.,
Float the magnet.",How to Make a Magnet3," A compass works by indicating north with a magnetized needle that aligns with the earth's magnetic field. Any metal that can be magnetized can be turned into a compass. A sewing needle or straight pin is a good choice. In addition to a needle, gather these supplies to make your compass:

A magnetizer. Find a magnet, a nail, or even a piece of fur to magnetize the needle.





A cross section of cork. Slice a disc from an old wine cork to provide a base for the compass.





A bowl of water. Suspending the compass in water allows the magnetized needle to align with the earth's magnetic poles.






, Rub the needle using a magnet, a nail, or a piece of fur, which creates a small electric current. Rub the needle in the same direction at least 50 times to magnetize it.
, Slide it in horizontally, so that the needle pierces on side of the cork and comes out the other side. Keep pushing until the front and back of the needle protrude equally from the cork.

If the needle you're using is too big to push through the cork, you may simply rest it on top of the cork.





If you don't have a cork coin, use another lightweight object that floats, such as a leaf.






, Place the magnetized needle on the surface of the water in the bowl. Watch as it moves to align itself from north and south along the poles. If it doesn't move, remove the needle from the cork, rub it 75 times with the magnetizer, and try again.

Pour some glue into a small jar.,
Add some glitter.,
Stir until everything is evenly mixed.,
Add more glue or glitter until you get the sparkle you want.,
Use the glue.",How to Make Glitter Glue2," You can use clear or white school glue. You can also use a decoupage type of glue, such as Mod Podge. If you plan on using this glue to cover a pair of shoes, use decoupage or Mod Podge. It will also act as a sealer and give you a more durable finish.

, Use 1 part glitter for every 2 parts glue.The best type of glitter to use would be the extra fine glitter used in scrapbooking. It will give you the nicest finish.


Consider adding in some tiny sequins or metallic confetti for extra texture. Don't use the paper kind of confetti.

, You can use a popsicle stick, a fork, or a spoon to stir.

, For less sparkle, add more glue. For more sparkle, add more glitter. If you are going to glitter something, like a picture frame or a pair of shoes, remember that you can always paint on more layers for extra sparkle.

, Brush it onto your project using a paintbrush. Try to get a brush with stiffer bristles. Natural bristles, such as camel hair, won't hold up to the glitter very well. When you are done using the glue, wash the paintbrush and close the jar tightly.


If you want your project to be super sparkly, wait until the glue dries before adding a second layer. Keep adding layers (and letting them dry in between) until you get the sparkly you desire.If you are using very light glitter, such as pale pink or white, consider painting your project with acrylic paint first. Use the same color of paint as your glitter. Let the paint dry before you add the glitter glue.The glitter may shed, especially if you painted a large area. Wait until the glue dries, then brush on a thin layer of decoupage or Mod Podge. This will seal the glitter in and keep it from shedding."

Use basic craft glue for simple needs.,
Use Styrofoam glue.,
Use spray adhesive.,
Use low temperature hot glue guns.,
Don't use a material-specific glue.,
Don't use a glue containing a plastic solvent.,
Clean and prepare your surfaces.,
Apply the glue.,
Attach the Styrofoam.,
Allow time to dry.,
Be wary of Styrofoam's relatively low strength.",How to Glue Styrofoam," For simple, casual arts and crafts projects, the easiest way to glue Styrofoam is usually to use an ordinary white glue. This basic glue works reasonably well for a wide variety of uses, especially for gluing Styrofoam to construction paper, cardboard, and wood. It's also usually the cheapest and most accessible option, making it a great choice for simple projects.









White school glue, such as Elmer's, is safe, non-toxic, and kid-friendly. It tends to be more runny and messy, however.
White tacky glue, such as Eileen's, tends to be thicker and less messy.
Note that while school glue is cheap and versatile, it may not be as strong or long-lasting as more expensive specialty glues, so you may not want to use it for projects where your Styrofoam will be put under stress (like Styrofoam glider planes, etc.).
Because of its liquid form, white glue is best for attaching large blocks of Styrofoam together.

, Believe it or not, certain glues are actually developed specifically to be used with Styrofoam. This glue, sometimes marketed as ""Styroglue"", is usually fairly affordable, but can also be more difficult to find than ordinary school glue. Typically, Styrofoam glue can be purchased at many home improvement or arts and crafts stores.









If you're thinking of buying Styrofoam glue, check the label before making your purchase. Some Styrofoam glues may be formulated for use only on Styrofoam, while others may be suitable for gluing Styrofoam to other surfaces.

, Most aerosol adhesives (which are often available at hardware stores for $10 or less per can) offer a quick, convenient way to glue Styrofoam. Additionally, because these sprays are usually intended for multipurpose home usage, they generally work on a variety of surfaces. For instance, one low-price multipurpose adhesive is billed as being able to bind foam materials to metal, plastic, paper, cardboard, and wood.








Consider testing the glue on an inconspicuous area first. If the glue does not say whether or not it is safe to use on Styrofoam, you might want to test it first. Some aerosol-based products, such as spray paint, can actually melt or dissolve Styrofoam.
Because spray adhesives tend to be low-tack, it is best to use them when attaching large blocks of Styrofoam together. They are not a good idea for attaching two Stryofoam balls together, for example.

, Ordinary hot glue guns can also work well to bind Styrofoam to many different craft surfaces, like paper, cardboard, wood, and so on. However, when using a hot glue gun with Styrofoam, the cooler, the better. Extra-hot glue can burn or melt Styrofoam, which can release harmful fumes.









Because of their precision, hot glue guns are great for attaching small Styrofoam objects together. They are also great for Styrofoam balls.
Though the fumes that result from burning Styrofoam aren't likely to immediately hurt you, they're not something to treat lightly, as they can contain a variety of toxic chemicals. These include styrene and benzene, suspected carcinogens (cancer-causing agents)., When it comes to gluing Styrofoam, you'll generally want to stay away from glues that are specifically designed to work on certain materials other than Styrofoam (e.g., wood glue, fabric glue, glues and epoxies used for construction projects, etc.). While some of these glues may work fine with Styrofoam, many may not work significantly better than cheap, basic craft glues, making this an inefficient use of your money. In addition, some select specialty glues can even dissolve Styrofoam and other plastics (see below).








, Because it's fairly light and weak, it's easy to forget that Styrofoam is a plastic product. Styrofoam is essentially ""foamed"" plastic—that is, it's plastic that's been mixed with air, resulting in its light weight. Because Styrofoam is plastic-based, you'll want to avoid using any glues that contain a solvent that can dissolve plastic. Using one of these may erode your Styrofoam, creating a liquid mess and ruining your project.









For instance, rubber cement, a fairly strong, flexible adhesive, often contains both alcohol and acetone. Acetone, the active ingredient in nail polish remover, can dissolve many types of plastics, making it a poor choice for Styrofoam. However, some non-acetone rubber cements may be suitable for Styrofoam use.

, Once you have the right glue, Styrofoam itself is fairly easy to work with—all you'll usually need to do is apply the glue to the Styrofoam, stick it to the other surface, and wait for it to dry. However, before gluing, it's always a good idea to clear each surface of dirt and debris by wiping with a clean, dry rag. Gluing over a dirty or dusty surface can interfere with the bonding action of the glue, resulting in a weaker hold.









If you're gluing to an especially ""gappy"" surface (like a rough piece of wood with lots of surface imperfections), the effective hold of your glue may be reduced.In this case, you may want to try sanding to make the surface smoother and more regular—try using 200 grit or higher sandpaper.

, When you're ready to start, apply your glue to the Styrofoam surface. For the strongest hold, use a thin, even layer that covers the entire surface. If you're not looking for a very strong hold, it's also OK to use beads or lines of glue.









If you are working with a very large piece of Styrofoam, consider pouring the glue into a tray, and applying the glue with a paintbrush. This will ensure that the glue goes on quickly and evenly, which prevents any sections of glue from drying while others are still being applied.
If you are working with small pieces, consider using white tacky glue or a hot glue gun.
If you are using a hot glue gun, plan to work quickly. The glue will set and harden within minutes.
Consider reinforcing Styrofoam balls with toothpicks. If you are going to glue two Stryofoam balls together, you might want to stick a toothpick into one of them. This will help ""hold"" the two balls together. Round objects have far less surface area than flat objects, after all.

, When you're ready, press your piece of Styrofoam into the other surface. Press down gently to ensure that all of the glue comes in contact with the other surface. Depending on the type of glue and the amount you used, you'll usually have at least a minute or so during which you can easily slide your Styrofoam around, so use this time to make any minor adjustments that you need to.









For extra hold, you may want to apply a little extra glue around the edges of your Styrofoam where it meets your other surface. Don't use any more than necessary to make a thin line or seam—this will prolong the drying process.

, Next, all you need to do is wait! Depending on the size of your project, the type of glue you used, and the amount of glue you used, your drying time may vary from just a few minutes to many hours. Don't disturb your project while it dries or you may need to re-apply glue and start the drying process over. If necessary, use sturdy objects (like books, boxes, etc.) to prop your project in the proper position while it dries.









Hot glue will set up faster when it is colder.
Some glues will need more time to set, especially if it is very cold or humid.

, Most of the gluing methods described in this article for gluing Styrofoam are at least somewhat strong and shouldn't fail under normal conditions once the glue has dried. The same can't be said of Styrofoam itself, which is an exceptionally weak, fragile building material. Remember to handle styrofoam with care even after drying is complete—it's not hard to accidentally chip or break Styrofoam projects on walls, door frames, or other obstructions, glue or no.

, The rectangle needs to be about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) tall and 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide. Sketch the rectangle out using a ruler and permanent marker first, then cut it using a pair of scissors., Hold the rectangle horizontally. Roll the bottom left corner towards the top right corner to form a cone. Make sure that the cone has a small opening at the tip.If you can't get a small opening at the tip, slice the tip off with a craft blade, then use a pen or pencil to shape the opening into a round hole.

, When you look at the cone, there will be a flap of metal on the side that ends in a point. Use a pair of scissors to trim the corner down so that it is a straight edge instead.This will make it easier to tape down.

, Wrap a piece of electrical tape around the middle and bottom of the cone. Start wrapping around where you cut the flap, and finish at the bottom. Don't wrap too close to the tip, or the tape will burn when you go to heat up the glue gun., You can find these alongside the candles in most stores. They look like regular lighters, but with a trigger and a stick at the end. Try to get the kind with a firm stick, and not the flexible kind.


If you absolutely can't find a stick lighter, you can use a regular one. It will be more awkward to hold and use, however.

, Set the lighter down so that it is parallel, with the trigger pointing down. Position the cone alongside the stick, so that it is on top. The tip should be extending just past the tip of the stick.This way, when you ignite the lighter, the flame will heat up the glue and cause it to melt.


Do not place the cone over the tip of the stick, like a hat.
If you are using a regular lighter, place it on the side edge—the same side that the flame comes out of., Place a piece of tape halfway inside the cone. Press the other end of the tape onto the stick itself. If you need to, wrap another piece of tape around the bottom of the cone and the stick., Keep pushing it until the glue stick is as deep as it can go. Hold it steady, if you need to. Try to glue the thinner kind of hot glue stick rather than the thicker kind.

, Make sure that the top/length side of the cone is facing upwards, towards the ceiling., Hold the trigger for a few moments until glue starts to come out of the nozzle., Once you see glue coming out of the tip, release the trigger and extinguish the flame. Your hot glue gun is now ready to use.

, Working quickly, make a line of hot glue wherever you need the glue to go. Gently push the glue stick into the nozzle to help force the glue out. At some point, you may need to heat the glue up again by igniting the lighter.

It may also take off some of the glue, especially small pieces of glue. Keep rubbing until the gun is clean. You may need to change out your paper towel and reapply the acetone from time to time., If you think your glue gun has come in contact with germs, you can wipe down the outside with a disinfectant. Don't use one that's flammable. Also, make sure your gun is unplugged and cool before applying the disinfectant. For instance, you can wipe it down with a solution of half vinegar, half water or a gentle commercial disinfectant.

","How to Make Your Own ""Put Toilet Seat Down"" Sticker"," Toilets need to be cleaned every day and the constant liquid will likely impact the durability of the sticker, depending on where it is placed. For stickers placed directly under the seat (showing only when the seat is in the upright position), you'll need to use something that can cope with constant cleaning. A sticker placed on the cistern, wall or somewhere else above the bowl might fare better and not need washing as often. Placement is important for noticing though, so don't shift the sticker where it fails to catch the eye––be prepared to do what will have the most impact! Here are several possible ways for making stickers:


Homemade sticker hack: Make the sticker out of paper, then cover it with clear tape to adhere it to the seat. This won't last long but is very easily updated and replaced as needed.
Old fashioned paper and tape: While this may not be truly deemed a sticker, you could use this method of signage around the toilet area. However, as it is clearly not waterproof, don’t place this type of sticker sign near the toilet bowl or faucets. This temporary method can be easily revised and removed whenever you desire.
Laminate the sticker: Either use a laminating machine or you can encase your homemade sticker between two sheets of contact paper. This can be another easily updated approach with temporary sticking power.
Make an actual sticker, one that either clings or adheres long term: Printer programs and forms exist to enable you to make your own stickers. Or, you could have the sticker printed at a commercial printers after you've done all the design work. Just check that the adhesive can be easily removed once the message has worked its magic––most sticker adhesives can be removed using goo-removing solutions or something like eucalyptus oil but you'll need to be sure the toilet seat surface can handle such solutions.;
, The design does need to be attention-grabbing. Eye-catching color is essential, so stick to bright colors, especially red, a color that tends to alert people to pay attention. Whether you use hand drawing, printed text or clipart is up to you, depending on what you're most comfortable with, just as long as the end result is visually attractive. Some design style ideas include:


A visual-only sticker: Draw or use clip art to show the image of a person using the toilet, then putting down the seat, in the style of the airline safety sheets. Or, use the common symbol for a forbidden action, by showing the toilet seat upright inside a red circle with a slash through it. Visual stickers can be helpful for households with young children but since visual depictions attract our attention immediately, they're effective for alerting all householders and guests.






Write a simple message: A simple message stuck on the underside of the upright seat can be very effective when in bold colors.






Direct the message to an actual culprit: Pinpointing the person who always leaves the seat up might work if he or she has a good sense of humor but do be careful with those who might be insulted by this direct approach. So, if you know exactly who keeps leaving the seat up, write, “Colin, put the toilet seat down!” as your message. How can poor Colin resist if the sticker is screaming out his name every time he uses the toilet?






A mixture of text and images: Depending on how creative you are, you might be able to combine both images and text to get across a suitable message. For example, a stop sign image design with a message inserted in the middle can be a very effective sticker. Or, you could use a toilet shape, a little boy peeing (cliched and kitsch but cute), an animal shape, etc. and insert text inside the largest part of the image.







, The message can be simple, humorous, visual or written. It all depends on how you think the household members will respond best, whether it be cute, a little crude or simply polite and sweet. Brainstorm some ideas for what you think will have the best impact for the householders you live with. And decide whether it's just the seat you want shut, or the whole seat and lid arrangement––it's just as easy to do both. In case you're stuck for what to write on your sticker, here are some ideas poached from various places:


Put me down!
Put the seat down!
Adjust the seat before take-off.
A closed lid repels flies.
This toilet only gets cleaned when the seat's left down.
The cat drinks from here when the lid's left up.
Toilet germs flush into the air and contaminate your toothbrush. Put down the toilet lid!

, The size will be shaped by where you plan on placing it as much as its design elements. Take exact measurements of the intended location and follow these measurements when creating the design. In terms of placement, things to consider include the washability of the sticker (as explained above), the likelihood of the sticker being seen and the effect on your bathroom décor. Under the seat in the part that sits topmost when the seat is lifted is probably the best location, as it shows when the seat is in the upright position. Under the lid in the middle of the seat hole is another eye-catching location. However, the cistern, wall or a nearby spot might work as well.


It might be overkill but a trail of sticker reminders in your bathroom might work in seriously annoying cases. Think toilet seat, flush button zone, washing hands area and light switch!
Think about the reactions of guests and other household members. It might be considered annoying, immature or pushy to see these stickers everywhere.

, Depending on the approach you've chosen to creating the sticker, once you've got design, message and size sorted out, proceed with making it. It's a fairly easy process but here are some hints for each type:


Homemade sticker hack: Write or print the message on paper in the required size. Add an image if using. Print (if relevant) and cut to size. Hold in place on the toilet seat and use strips of tape slightly longer than the paper to completely cover the paper lengthways.
Old fashioned paper and tape: Draw the design and add text as chosen onto paper. Adhere to the wall or other surface using tape, poster tack or similar.
Laminated sticker: Create the sticker on a piece of paper, cut it out and place it on top of one piece of contact paper. Use a glue stick to cover the bottom sheet completely and then gently place the next sheet on top. Smooth to remove any wrinkles. Cut the sticker out and use double sided tape to affix to the toilet, walls, etc. For attaching to the toilet seat, tape is probably the best option. Again, with repeated cleaning this will wear and probably need replacing––make a few at the same time and store the replacements in an easily accessed place.
An actual sticker: Follow the instructions of either a computer program for making stickers or ask for the instructions of a commercial establishment printing the stickers for you and follow those. If you're printing a sticker, be absolutely sure that your printer can handle any special materials you might be using.

, Clean all surfaces first to ensure the best adhesion. Ensure that the surface is dry before attaching the sticker. Don't draw attention to the sticker after placing it. The message needs to be a wake-up call, a complete surprise that registers in the mind of the culprits. And, of course, after sticking your sticker down, leave the seat down in the desired position before leaving.

Apply your stickers.",How to Make Outdoor Stickers," It is important to use materials that will ensure that your sticker can survive the outdoor environment. Acrylic varnish as a base, followed by a gloss varnish to cover the acrylic varnish is ideal. Look for acrylic varnish with UV protection. The gloss varnish forms a rubbery coating that stops the rain from causing the color to run. Workable fixative can be used as substitute for the acrylic varnish. These varnishes will not hurt the adhesive on the other side of the paper either.;
, Acrylic inks come in a wide array of colors and metallic inks too. You just need brushes but the inks will go a long way. You can also get away with being less precise as they will not typically cover the black outline you laid down.

, There are a lot of markers out there but many of them will not stand the test of time. A good marker has to be oil-based marker, meaning don't use a Sharpie. A few companies that make good markers are:


Marvy Uchida Deco color. These are the best for fills and and outlines because they can cover almost anything but be wary of the fumes. These will last outside without being treated for a while.
Sharpie oil paint. This is good for fills and outlines and has less odor than Deco. These will last outside without being treated for a while.
Sharpie poster paint. These are good for outlines and sometimes for fills. These will not last outside without being treated for a while.
Elmers paint markers. These are better for outlines, especially the black. These will last outside without being treated for a while.
Sakura. The metallic inks are the best. The color inks last when treated.

, Use a pencil to draw out the initial design. By using a pencil first, you can correct or redraw what you do not like. You can order the paper from many sources online; cheap matte finish paper is ideal as it will be getting treated anyway. Do not use an ink jet because the ink will not survive the weather. Only laser printers and copy machines will produce a black that lasts because the ink is melted on to the paper.

,, There are two possible ways - print out a design using a laser printer or just draw it out. When a lot of black is involved, it's easier to use the laser printer ink from the computer. You could also draw it out and take it to the copy shop to make copies on sheets of sticker paper as well.

, Touch up lines after you have finished coloring it.

, It is best to use the inks for this because they end up being cheaper than the markers when covering larger areas. They also lack the fumes of the markers, so are more pleasant to work with. When treated properly, the colors will last for quite a long time outside.

, After painting in the design, add any decoration with paint markers. You can also do this step after spraying with workable fixative if you want to add a layer of color.

, Although this step is not completely essential, it does ensure that the inks won't bleed when the gloss varnish is applied. Use either acrylic varnish or workable fixative. Work on this outside because of the fumes. It is recommended to do this direct onto an old board or a piece of cardboard so that the spray does not end up everywhere.

, Once you have applied the gloss varnish, the inks will be sealed in and weather-protected. This step is vital to outdoor endurance. There are not fumes with gloss varnish, so this step can be done indoors.

, If you don't do this, your brush will turn hard and become unusable. Artist's pink soap is good to use but any type of soap will work.

, Use an Exacto knife to cut out the design. It is up to you whether or not you leave a border of white space or not. Scissors could be used in place of the knife.

, They are now ready to stick outdoors. Make sure that the surface on which you apply your sticker is very clean and smooth. You might need to wipe it with paper towels etc. Latex based spray adhesive (e.g., 3M Photo Adhesive (Orange Label)) is a good choice for affixing your stickers. It is inexpensive, widely available, relatively easy to remove and will not damage most non-porous surfaces.

Cut a hole in the bottom of 36 (or 2/3) of your bottles.,
Fill 18 (or 1/3) of the bottles halfway with dirt (if there are a lot of stones or rocks in the dirt, filling the bottle ¼ of the way is fine).,

The idea is that the top of another bottle will snap right in and not fall out, so be careful that it is not too big or too small. It is easiest done with a very sharp knife, or by heating a knife in a candle for a few seconds then cutting the hole. (If you are doing this in a school it is good to bring a sample and show the kids the size of the hole. Ask them to have their parents/teacher help them cut holes before you come to construct the garbage can. This is the most time consuming part of the project and it’s much easier if they do the holes at home).;
, Variation: fill 18 bottles with trash. The idea is to fill the bottom bottles to give the garbage can some weight so it doesn’t blow away.

, Use a candle to heat a piece of wire and poke two holes through each bottle at the 10 centimeter (3.9 in) mark.

, The bottle with dirt is on the bottom, an empty bottle is snapped on top of that one and another empty one snapped on top of that.

, Start with the bottom row of bottles and begin inserting the wire. Repeat for the middle row of bottles, and do the top row last. Keep the bottles in a line as you put the wire through. It's easier to form it into a garbage can when the wire is in.

, Fix the bottles so that they are standing as straight up as possible. Put in your bag (or reusable fertilizer or chicken feed coastal) and start throwing away your trash.

Once the pieces are fully sanded you can start painting it.,
Carefully cut out the stands from the bottom of the bottle.,
Take one of the middle pieces.,
With the second middle piece, cut it into two halves.,
Take the smaller of the pieces you cut in step 7 and cut a small slip off from it, leaving the larger one just enough to be able to cover the bottom of arm piece.

, Try an All Purpose Acrylic: Morning Silver paint.  If you apply it in horizontal strokes, it gives a more scarred metallic look as if it's been through battles.

, You'll need a total 14 for each gauntlet if you make it like Mordred's. If you don't want spikes on the gauntlet, only cut out 5 for the hand.


Be aware that the plastic at the bottom is much thicker and harder to cut, then it is anywhere else on the bottle.
Once cut out, you can put this to the side.

, Cut it vertically before carefully wrapping the plastic lose around your arm with enough space to take it off. Seal the two parts together by taping them with a few strips of duck tape

, Make one larger then the other. With the large piece, follow the same steps you did in step 6, using the arm piece from 6  as a base for it.


Leave a small gap in between as shown in the second picture. This is for the spikes and to give more stability to the plastic. Using a hot glue gun, glue the strips together along with any flaps that aren't secure.

,, Bend 9 of them in two places at the bottom to make a place for the to be glued later. The other 5 need to be cut into shape for the hand. the second image is a zoomed up of that.


Note that the finger joints need 3 pieces, while the thumb need 2, the bottom is longer then the rest.

Also note the joints are folded in the second picture to show what the pattern looks like.



, Then, carefully cut two small holes in both sides of the plastic  at the top, and then again on the bottom of the arm piece. Attach the pieces together by use of the 2 twist ties. this allows to bottom guard to move slightly when you move you hand.

,, If you don't do this, you can easily burn yourself as the hot glue burns at a temperature of 170 °C (338 °F) { 338 Fahrenheit.} This step is a bit dangerous so you must be very careful.

Use the center ""tube"" of the bottle to cut the rings from.,

Start at one end of the center tube.,

Join the red tape circle at the tube's join line.,

Take the next color (in this example, blue) and proceed to stick it around the tube as before but don't tape it down completely.,

Repeat using the next 4 colors, placed equally along the tube.,

Carefully cut out each colored ring.,

Repeat until all 5 colored rings have been cut into individual rings, as well as the red equator ring.,
Create the ""South Pole"" or Antarctic design.,

Weave in the equator circle (the red piece).,
Make the North Pole or Arctic pentagon.,





Tape the ends together as shown, then glue into place to strengthen and maintain the desired shape.,

Use the ornament decoratively.",How to Make a 'Sepak Takraw Ball' Ornament from a Plastic Bottle," This will help with the method for creating it. There is one piece that serves as the ""equator"" (in this article, it is the red piece), and the remaining pieces can be viewed as the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions, depending on the manner in which they are added.
,, Note where the join of the tube meets; this join line will form your reference point for sticking down the tape from start to finish., Carefully stick the red tape around the tube close to one end, to form a complete circle. This red circle will form the ""equator"" of the polyhedral ornament., Make a fine cut from the edge of the tube along the join line, just to the edge of the red tape circle.,







Instead of taping this circle down, use tape-mount (disposable tape) to insert under the colored tape. Instead of adhering the end of this circle to the plastic tube, it will stick to the tape-mount, moving freely.

, There should be a total of 5 colored rings, plus the red equator ring.







In each case, adhere to the tape-mount and not to the plastic tube. Thus, apart from the red ""equator"" ring, all the other tape rings should be attached to the tube all the way except for the last part, which will sit on the tape-mount.

, Gently pierce the tube with a pair of scissors and cut around each ring, leaving an even amount of plastic tube on each side of each colored ring.,







This should be the end result of your efforts so far.

, This will be held in place by tacking with tape; use tape that is easy to remove. With each ring, interweave the pieces alternately (under, over, under, over, etc.).







Hold the blue and green rings vertically together, crossed over. Slide the silver ring horizontally around both rings. Weave the silver ring under the green ring and over the blue ring.






Tack in place.






Add the gold ring. Weave in and out so that is is positioned to form another part of the overall circular shape. Tack in place.






Weave the last circle in and out. Tack in place.

, Weave so that it intersects alternately with the rest of the rings.







The finished ball. If you are happy with this shape, glue the tacked ends into place. Or, proceed to the next steps.

, This pentagon is located inside the ornament.







Refer to the image here when placing the rings. Weave around the respective circles and adjust to create the necessary gaps to create the pentagon.

, (Note that the reference to ""bottle"" in the image refers to the ""rings"".), You can use the Sepak Takraw decoration for such decorative projects as celebratory ornaments, a display object, or as shown here, it can add artistic flair to an ordinary vase:

Optional: Cut the straw. Straighten the straw. Observe that it's divided into two sections by the ""bendy"" part. One section is longer than the other. Cut the longer section halfway between the end and the bend. This is for if you want to make a puppet from just one straw, because you can use the shorter section to make wings later.










Press the straw down on either side of the bend to make it flat. (Do not make the bend itself flat.)





Cut next to the folded edge as shown in the picture. Cut until you get to the bend.










Divide the other piece and cut along the fold, splitting the piece in half, lengthwise. Stop cutting at the bend.

The short end will be the tail, while the two long, thin pieces will be the stand (stick in the diagram) and the backbone. You'll fold the long, wide pieces to make the body of the orca. It might help you to print this off to follow. Additionally, you might want to use a straw with colored lines running down the side for your first try.

, For now, keep the bend in the closed position.







Flatten the straw. Press down on each side of the bend to flatten the straw, running your fingers over the bend a few times. Do not flatten the bend itself.

, Pinch the straw flat between your thumb and forefinger with one hand. With the other hand, use scissors to cut out your first piece. With the straw flat, cut a thin strip off one side, making sure you cut both layers of the straw. (If you're using a lined straw, it might be useful to flatten the straw such that the thin backbone and stand pieces contain the lines.)







Stop cutting when you reach the straw bend.






Cut out another thin strip on the other side of the flattened straw.






Again, don't cut along the edge itself but right next to it. You should be cutting two layers of straw, not one.






There will be four ""sticks"" once you're done with cutting – two thin sticks and two wide sticks.

, First, take one of the thin sticks and bend it so that it's at a 90-degree angle to the straw. This stick will be the stand. The other thin stick will be the backbone.







Grab one of the wide sticks and pull it under the backbone, then up and back down through the loop created.






Pull the knot created by the wide stick all the way up to the bend in the straw. Tug gently on the bottom of the wide stick to tighten.

, As with the first wide stick, pull it under the backbone, then up and back down through the loop created.







Move the knot up to the bend in the straw, layering on top of the first knot created with the other wide stick. Tug gently on the bottom of the wide stick to tighten the knot. Both wide sticks and the stand should be pointing in the same direction.






Gently fold the wide sticks upward on their respective sides. This will position them away from the stand slightly, so that you can keep tying the body of the orca.






Begin tying again. Grab the first wide stick you tied. Pull it under the backbone, then pull up and draw back down through the loop created.






Tug gently on the wide strip to tighten the knot once it's at the bend in the straw.

, Grab the second wide strip. Pull it under the backbone, then upward and back down through the loop created.







Tug gently on the wide strip to tighten the knot once it's at the bend in the straw.






Again, both wide strips and the stand should be facing the same direction.

, Fold the two wide strips upward and away from the stand again.







Fold the first wide stick, then the other, in the same motion - looping under the backbone, then up and pulling down through the loop.

, The fins on each side of the orca are called pectoral fins, or pec fins, and they're used for steering.





 Back view






Position the orca standing on the two wide sticks left from folding and tying in the previous steps. You might have to bend the sticks a bit to get them into the right position.

Then, fold the wing piece in half, as shown.

, Make sure to keep the wings connected at the middle., It is helpful to enlarge this picture to see the extent of the feathering required., In this part, you will be shaping the tail and the backbone. Refer back to the diagram in step 1 for the correct cutting points.

Press down on the straw on either side of the concertina part of the straw. Don't flatten the concertina part itself, however.






Leaving a little even space on each side of the folded line, start cutting down the backbone piece of the straw following alongside the folded edge, as shown.






Continue cutting this piece until you reach the concertina portion of the straw.

, This will divide the remaining piece exactly in half.







As before, continue cutting down the folded line until you reach the concertina part of the straw.

, The piece that is still folded is the backbone and tail. See the image, the fatter piece is still folded and is the piece that was cut alongside the folded line, not on it., Take the concertina part of the straw and bend it into what looks like a bird's neck shape.

Try to approximate how it appears here.

, Turn the straw around to the shorter end above the concertina part. Return to the figure set out in step 1 and follow the exact cutting points outlined there.







Pull the cut piece away to reveal the beak shape.

, Take each of the wide pieces and bend them, then wrap them around the backbone piece, as shown. You're about to create a knot at this point. Refer back to previous steps to help you keep track of each piece.,







Pull into shape to create a neat and symmetrical knot. Don't make it too tight as you'll need to loosen it shortly for adding the wings.






The two fat pieces (the legs that will slide into the cage piece) should be facing forward when you are finished, in front of the neck and below the beak.

, Slide the wings through this space and ensure that they're sitting evenly. Retighten the knot., Cut off the long piece so that a short tail remains, as shown by the image.







Feather the tail. As with the wings, make small evenly spaced slits to create a feathered tail look. You can stop here if you want just a bird, or you can proceed to making a cage for it as well, as outlined in Part 2.

,, Following the image provided in step 1 of Part 2, cut the straw into eight equal parts, lengthwise. The cuts should only come as far as the valley fold line indicated on the figure., Following the figure, you will need to make both mountain and valley folds, as outlined on the figure.

Valley folds: Pull each of the eight pieces out from the straw (toward you if you're rotating the straw) and bend into position. The valley fold extends from the point where you ended cutting the eight pieces.

Mountain folds: Looking at the diagram in Step 1, Part 2, fold each of the eight pieces that have been folded outward up toward you so that stick up like a mountain.

, You are going to be using this piece as a ring to thread over the other part of the straw.







The resulting ring seen apart from the rest of the straw.

, Make sure each piece is included; this may take some steady handwork.







Thread it to about three quarters of the way down the cut straw pieces, as shown here.

, The curls are designed to prevent the ring piece from slipping off the cage when you push it back up toward the top. Take the ends of each cut piece of straw and roll it over firmly to create a curl shape.







Repeat for each piece until all are curled.

,







Pull out the valley/mountain folds evenly to form the sides of the cage. Adjust until the entire structure sits together properly and looks like a cage.

Plan out the materials you’ll need.,
Start layering the sand.,
Add in objects as you please.,
If there is a cork or top, seal it with a hot glue gun.",How to Make Sand Art1," Do you want to make a vase? A terrarium? How many colors of sand do you want to use? Generally speaking, most pieces look best if they have a specific color palette that’s kept to. You can find colored sand at most craft supply stores. You’ll also need:


Glass bottles
Objects like plants, if desired
A funnel
A device for moving sand, like a paintbrush or spoon;
, This is easiest to do if you use a funnel – you can either use an actual funnel or a piece of paper (where you can control the size of the tip). Move the funnel around to aim where you want the sand to lie – uneven layers look best (and are easiest, anyway).


The funnel is the simplest device to create interesting looking layers and to make a pattern. And the beauty of sand art is that if you mess up, you can just start back over.
If it doesn’t look how you imagined it to look, use a tool like a paintbrush to adjust the sand into the appropriate position.

, If you’re going for a terrarium look, you may wish to add objects like rocks, plants, or twigs to your bottle. Some people like to put rocks in the bottom so if the bottle is to be lifted up, you can see the “roots.”


You can add a smaller vase or bottle inside your bottle and put sand around it. Then you can easily put something inside the smaller vase – and it'll look like it's buried in the sand.

, Once the bottle is full and you're happy with your creation, line the top or cork with a small line of hot glue (you don't want it spreading) and apply gently to the base.


This isn't necessary, but it does keep sand from going everywhere should it knocked over or fall from a ledge.







"

Gather your materials.,
Put the sugar into bowls.,
Put a few drops of food coloring in the sugar and mix it with a spoon.,
When all of the food coloring is soaked in the sugar, start kneading it with your hands.,
Start filling the glass bottles.,
Use hot glue to seal the cork.",How to Make Sand Art2," The amount you need of everything will be determined by how many pieces you plan on making. Here's what you'll need:


Sugar
Food coloring
Glass bottles with corks
Bowls
Spoons
A hot glue gun

, Separate the sugar into one bowl for every color. Make a little bit more than you think you need. You can always use the colored sugar for cookies or other desserts later.

, Start with just a few drops and see what the color looks like; then add more if you need it. Just a drop or two will make it significantly darker. Mix it well to disperse it evenly.


Do the same for all the separate colors. You’ll need separate bowls of sugar for each color.
Combine red and yellow to make orange, blue and yellow to make green, and red and blue to make purple.
Consider combining two colors of sand for a two-toned look as well.

, This mixes up the color better and evens out the texture. It’s okay if it’s clumpy; that’s normal.

, Depending on the size and shape of your bottle, you’ll need different materials to create layers. You could just spoon the sand in – but to be more precise you’ll need a funnel.


Put a piece of paper into a cone shape and use it to funnel in the sand. Alternatively, you could use a straw or other similar device. If the sand doesn’t lay perfectly, you can adjust it with the end of a spoon or a toothpick.
Try to create a pattern; using a funnel will be the easiest way to do this. Try tilting the bottle or vase and building on the sides, too.

, When the bottle is full, put hot glue on the bottom of the cork and the rim of the bottle. Stick the cork in the bottle and let it dry for 5 minutes.


The glue will be really hot! Be very careful not to touch it. Once it's sealed, the art is ready for display.

Get everything you need together.,
Dissolve the food coloring in hot water.,
Separate your sand into bowls, and pour the water over each one.,
Dry the sand.,
Design your sand art.",How to Make Sand Art3," Though sugar and food coloring is easiest, you may find that you get brighter, more vibrant colors with sand and gel color. Play sand (darker sand is better for darker colors) is available at home improvement stores or pet stores for just a few dollars. Apart from those two things, you’ll also need:


Bowls of hot water
Glass containers or vases
Flowers (optional)

, Each color will need its own bowl of hot water. Not boiling, but hot – microwave it for about a minute and it should be enough. You’ll need about 1-3 spoonfuls of gel color for each bowl (depending on how vibrant you want it).If gel coloring isn’t accessible, you can use powdered tempera paint. Liquid tempera paint works, too, you just have to remove the water and work very, very slowly when you add it to the sand., You’ll likely want 1 part water to 3 parts sand. Any more and the sand may not absorb the liquid.


Stir until the color is fully and evenly immersed throughout the sand – you may find that using a whisk is best. It should be clumpy and not too liquid-y.

, This can be done one of two ways:


Drain out the excess liquid. Then spread it on a baking sheet to dry overnight.
Alternatively, pop it into the oven at 200 degrees C (350 F) on a baking sheet for 10-15 minutes or until dry.

, With dry sand, you’re ready to go. Get out a glass bottle or vase and arrange your colored sand into accessible bowls. Here’s a few tips:


Use a piece of paper or straw to act as a funnel. This will keep where you sand goes precise and even. Make layers, tilting the vase as necessary to create interesting designs.
Use the handle of a spoon, paintbrush or other small, thin device to move sand that doesn’t land where you want it.
If you’d like, put a small vase inside a larger vase. Then put the sand around it, and flowers inside the smaller vase. This gives the illusion the flowers lodged in the sand when they’re really in a vase full of water.

, Lay some newspaper down, get on an old shirt, and paint those pine cones!

, Once the pine cones are dry, find a decorative bowl, place the pine cones inside, put the bowl somewhere to your liking, and enjoy!

, If you want, glue sequins or rhinestones on the pine cones.


You can use some tweezers or some tool to glue the sequins or rhinestones easily.

",How to Make Moss Terrariums," You can also buy terrariums in pet stores. Amazon.com or eBay are good sources as well, if you are willing to pay for potential shipping costs and wait for the container to arrive. Choose a store within your price range.;
, You can select a glass or plastic jar, vase, decorative container, or box. The size depends on your preference.


If you would like to house animals in your terrarium, choose one that is appropriately sized for the species and quantity. The smaller the terrarium, the easier it is to control humidity and keep it clean. Larger containers can hold more moss and make great center pieces for tables and desks.
If you plan on keeping animals in your terrarium, choose a glass one. Plastic is less expensive but overheats easily and can leach chemicals into water sources or even melt if left in direct sunlight. Glass is much easier to clean, but breaks easily. Any terrarium should have a secure top, whether made of glass, plastic, or even cork. If is houses animals, it should have a lid with some sort of ventilation.

, The taller and narrower the container, the less moss you will be able to fit inside.


Animals should only be kept in terrariums the right length, width, and volume for their species. If you choose a tall aquarium, remember that it will be more difficult to clean and decorate.

, Spanish moss, or other hanging moss species can be used, but usually terrestrial moss is does much better. Do not use any plants that are illegal or restricted in your area. Most recommend using at least three or four species of moss in your terrarium, but it is up to you. Green, blue, fuchsia, and even blue moss can be found online or in nurseries. Dyed moss is not typically used, but can be added if desired.

, Amazon.com carries moss plugs in different varieties, and alternate online resources carry interesting colors and varieties. Do not collect moss from the wild unless you are completely sure that it is legal and not-restricted. Check your local laws and ordinances to confirm. Moss should be fresh and wet. Dry or dead moss should not be used in terrariums.

, You can buy shells, sand, soil, rocks, pebbles, marbles, plastic figurines, and other small items to fill your terrarium. Some even make small scenes with figurines inside their containers, but this is not recommended if animals will be kept as well.


Colorful ribbon, rope, or twine can be wrapped around terrariums, or tied into bows on top.
Colored sand or rocks are fun to layer in the bottom of your container, and make interesting patterns. Quartz or natural rocks are nice touches to moss displays.

, You can choose tiny plants from your yard or a nursery to plant in your terrarium along with the moss. Only use a few live plants to keep your terrarium moss-oriented.


Newly sprouted oak tree saplings, ferns, and colorful weed-like sprouts are fun and easy to grow. Oak saplings should be clipped every few months so that they fit inside their container.
Grass is not recommended, as it becomes invasive in a very moist, humid environment.

, Buy sand, rocks, or loose soil for the bottom of your terrarium. This will help drain extra water and can be styled to fit your container's look and size. Layer different colors of sand for a fun, swirling choice of substrate which drains easily and can be removed from the terrarium if necessary.


Dirt can become compacted and too moist and doesn't drain well, so it should be avoided.

, Small hanging ornaments or pieces of streamer can be caught in the lid of your terrarium so that they hang around its edges, but go easy on very heavy decoration. The main idea of your terrarium is to maintain a small moss garden and mini ecosystem. Water feeds the moss, moss releases oxygen for any animals inside your terrarium, and the animals use the moss as shelter or substrate for burrowing.

, Layer your substrate in the bottom of your container. If sand or rock granules are not available, loose potting soil or even wood chips can be used. If you choose colored sand, layer lights against darks for nice contrast, and establish some sort of pattern for even spacing. Using your substrate, fill at least half of your container, more if desired. If there is not enough substrate, your terrarium will look incomplete and un-filled.

, You can cover the entire top of your substrate with moss, or spread it around and fill in gaps with smaller pieces, more substrate, or decorations (see next step). Moss should not be layered, or mold can grow due to the lack of drainage. Different colored mosses make beautiful patterns, but different types of moss really pull your terrarium together. Some moss grows in flower or star-shapes. Other types grow like grass or are tightly clustered. If you have Spanish moss or a similar hanging species, you can tape it to the sides, trap it in the lid of the terrarium so it hangs down, or scatter it.


One of the best methods is to add a stick or large rock in the middle of your terrarium, then hang the moss on it so it drapes into the container's floor. Moss should barely press up against the side of the terrarium, don't pack it too tightly!

, Any extra decorations can be placed inside the terrarium to fill gaps and make it look nicer. Natural-looking rocks make great accents to green or brown moss, while quartz or amethyst enhances bright colored moss, including blue, fuchsia, or purple. Sticks and tree branches can be added, as can small sources of water to keep humidity up, such as a bowl or cap-full of water.


Plastic decor is not recommended, as it melts in sun and does not look natural near real moss and plants.

, Keeping a small animal in a terrarium sounds fun and easy, but there can be adverse side affects.

, Non-aquatic salamanders and very small toads are recommended, but frogs and even insects can be added to enhance a moss terrarium's ecosystem.


All amphibians will need a small source of water, bigger if they rely on, it like frogs do.
Insects will usually do well with a cap-full of water or light, frequent misting. Good insect species include roly-polies (pill bugs), safe millipedes, harmless beetles, and snails/slugs.
For toads and frogs, most species will eventually have to be moved to a more permanent home, as with some species of salamander, though most can live their lives in a terrarium with no problem. Make sure you have the means to provide care, food, and a stable, safe environment for any animal you decide on.

, Pet stores, or online sources often sell any animal or insect you would like to add to your container. Do not collect wild animals! Never keep any illegal or restricted animal. Most online stores will require a shipping/handling price, so always keep this in mind while comparing prices.


Oftentimes, shipping prices are much more expensive then the animal you are buying, so it is imperative to choose a good site with low prices.

, Make sure to keep their water full and feed them whenever necessary. Follow care instructions for your specific animals and always wash your hands after handling them or touching their environment. Keep your terrarium moist and the right humidity for your pets.

, Mist your container once or twice daily with a spray bottle, using chlorine-free water. You can also add a small jar cap or cup buried nearly to its top in the substrate. Fill it with warm, de-chlorinated water and keep it at least half full.


Alternately, you can pour in a cup of water every other day, sprinkling it around any moss and plants, as well as frequent misting with your spray bottle. You can fill a plastic cup with water and half bury it in the sand to maintain a good humidity, but animals can drown in them, so only use this method if your terrarium is pet-free.

, Animals should always be fed a species-specific diet, and plants can be given small amounts of fertilizer, loose potting soil, or liquid plant feed mixes. Moss will not need anything but water and indirect sunlight.

, Choose a room that keeps a stable temperature of 68-85 degrees F. Keep the container somewhere that gets indirect sunlight in the late afternoon and morning.


Your terrarium should remain far from where children or pets can gain access to it, a high table, counter, or shelf works well. Do not keep your terrarium in a cold environment, the moss will die.

, Once a year, all substrate can be replaced and the container cleaned, but this is not necessary. The container's top should be left off for three-four hours once a week to allow the moss to air. In this time, all animals should be removed until the terrarium is lidded.

Seal the ladybug with 2 to 3 coats of a clear, outdoor sealer.,
Let the ladybug dry completely.",How to Make Ladybug Rocks," The rocks need to be smooth, flat, and roughly oval-shaped. You can find great rocks at the beach or by the river. You can also buy bags of them at a garden-supply shop or an arts and crafts store. They can be any size you want.;
, Even if you plucked the rock right out of the water, it may still be coated with grime that might prevent the paint from sticking. Wash the rock using cool water and a scrubbing brush. Pat it dry with a towel or set it out in the sun to dry., You don't have to do this, but it will help the colors show up brighter. This is highly recommended if your rock is dark-colored, or if you plan on painting it a light color, such as yellow. Simply paint the entire rock white, then let it dry.You can use the spray-on or brush-on kind of paint for this.

, You can apply the paint using a paintbrush or a foam brush. Start by painting the top and sides of the rock. Let it dry, then paint the bottom. This way, you won't get as messy, and you won't get fingerprints on your ladybug.


You can also use spray paint inside, but painting it on with a brush is a lot more fun!

, If you skipped the white base coat, take a look at your rock again. Is the paint showing up the way you want it to? If it's look a little too dark, add another coat or two of paint. Be sure to let each layer dry completely before adding the next one., Find one of the narrower ends of your rock. Paint a straight or curved line across it using black paint, then fill it in with more black paint.You may need another coat of black paint if it is now showing up very well.

, You don't have to do this if you don't want to, but it will make your lady bug look more realistic. You can paint the line using a very thin brush, or you can draw it on using a black, permanent marker., There are lots of ways to do this. You can paint them on using the end of a brush handle or a pencil eraser.You can even use your fingertip to make extra-large spots!Plan on doing at least 7 spots. For a more realistic touch, do 1 in the center, and 3 to each side., Dip a large paintbrush handle into some white paint, then use it to make two white dots in the middle of your ladybug's head.If your rock is very large, you might want to paint the dots on directly instead.

, If you have a large rock with large eyes, you might have enough space to make more detailed eyes. Paint two blue dots in the bottom of each eye using a thin brush. They should be just a little smaller than the whites themselves.Let the irises dry before moving on.


You can give your ladybug a different eye color instead if you prefer.

, Depending on how big your rock is, you may be able to use a small paintbrush handle. Otherwise, snip the tip off of a toothpick, and use that to make two, small black dots for the pupils., You can paint them on using a thin brush, or you can make a dotted line using a toothpick or brush handle. White paint will show up the best. Avoid using black paint, as it will blend in too much with the spots. Once you finish painting the antenna, let them dry.


Most ladybugs have curved or curly antenna, but you can make them straight if you prefer.
Use metallic or glittery paint for the antenna to make it really stand out., At this point, your ladybug is essentially done. There are a few things you could do to take it to the next level, however. Here are some more ideas to get you started:


Give your ladybug a smile using white or red paint.Give you ladybug some lashes if it's a girl, or eyebrows if it's a boy.If you added irises and large pupils, use a toothpick and white paint to add a highlight to the upper corner of each pupil., Let each coat dry first before applying the next one. You can use either the spray-on kind or the brush-on kind. If you plan on keeping your lady bug out in the garden, it must be waterproof. You can use either a matte or glossy finish.Paint the top of the ladybug first, let it dry, then paint the bottom. This ensures that both sides are protected.

, Check the label on your bottle of clear acrylic sealer for specific drying times. Just because something feels dry to the touch doesn't necessarily mean that it is fully dried and cured; some types of sealers need a full 24 to 48 hours to dry. Once the ladybug has dried completely, you can set it out in your garden. If the lady bug is small, you can place it into a flowerpot instead!

Clean the shells.,
Prepare the cuttlefish bone.,
Prepare the vanilla pod.,
Put the scented cuttlefish, bruised vanilla pod and shells into the airtight container.,
Remove the shells for display.,
Refresh the display shells regularly.",How to Make Scented Shells," Make a washing mixture from soapy water with a dash of bleach added to it. Use this mixture to clean the sand, grit and any marks off the shells.
, This will serve as the medium for releasing the scent into the shells. Ensure that it is clean by wiping it over with a dry paper towel. Add the essential oils directly to the surface of the cuttlefish in the following proportions:

25 drops of lemon essential oil
15 drops of bay essential oil
5 drops of rosemary essential oil

, Gently bruise the vanilla pod to enable it to release its aroma. Bend the pod in several places and gently wiggle about to release the aroma. Once you can smell the aroma rising from the pod, it is ready for use., Be careful not to drop the shells as you store them. Seal the lid tightly. Leave the shells to absorb the scents for one month (four weeks). At the end of the month, check to see if the scent is strong enough., Take out half of the shells and place them into the display bowl or container. Put them into the bathroom, toilet or other small room in the house., The shells will gradually lose the scent over several weeks. Rotate the display shells with the shells still stored in the airtight container."

Collect walnuts that are black, old, and wrinkled.,
Place about a dozen walnuts in a boiling pot; this depends upon how much ink you want and how thick you want it to be.

,
Put some water in the pot along with the walnuts.

,
Simmer all the ingredients well (about 8 hours), and soak for another 16.,
Scrape the husks from the shells until you have a mixture with a soil-like texture.

,
Add more water and simmer until the mixture is a rich brown color, and is nice and thick like ink.

,
Once you have the color you like, strain out all the thick or large chunks of the shells.

,
The ink should be a golden brown.,
Ink is ready to use.

",How to Make Ink from Walnut  Shells," If you can't find old walnuts, then put young ones in a pot outside (with a lid) for a couple months, or until they start to age.;

Collect flowers.,
Set up the paper you're going to print on.,
Paint the underside of the flower with paint.,
Gently place the leaf onto the paper, paint-side facing down.,
Move a paint roller over the top of the flower.,
Lift the roller up quickly and carefully.,
Repeat.,
Allow the print to dry before using or hanging.",How to Make Flower Prints," The best flowers are those that keep their shape after picking and have a lot of definition to their petals. This project is best done with strong flowers as the act of pressing for printing can destroy more delicate petals. Pick several flowers, as it's likely you'll want to see which ones give the best prints, and you will possibly make a few prints that don't work so well.


Some good flowers for flower prints include: Daisies, chrysanthemums, zinnia, strong roses, etc.
Artificial flowers can be used if they have adequate detail and you don't mind getting paint all over them. Wash and dry them after use, so that they can be reused.;
, First up, lay down a cover sheet to protect the work surface. Then add the paper you want the print to go on; this could be done in a number of ways, such as:


Roll out a length of brown or butcher's paper along a long table. Seat children at either side for a fun printing session.
Use single sheets of quality craft or art paper to reproduce quality prints.
Use a canvas if you're going to create a scene or picture using the prints.
Use fabric. You don't have to just use paper. If you're using fabric paint, fabric can be great for making craft projects that need flower prints.

, This is the side that you want to make the print from.

, Cover the flower with a sheet of brown paper or newspaper.

, Do this as gently and lightly as you can, to preserve the flower design. Alternatively, simply press down with your hand rather than rolling over the flower; this will be a better option where you're concerned that the paint might spread too far and lose the delicate petal design.

, Peel back the paper, then carefully lift up the flower. Hopefully the printed flower design is to your liking.

, Make as many as you need or simply keep going until you get a print you like. Some flowers will be strong enough for reuse, other flowers will need to be discarded and a new flower used.

, Once you've got your flower prints, either frame the end result or go ahead and use it in your art or craft project.

For the bottom hanging cord, thread decorations in place to dangle.,
Hang the fruit bauble.",How to Make Fruit Baubles," Suitable fruit includes apples, pears, oranges, mandarins, lemons, etc. Choose good quality specimens, as these will be on display.


Seasonal fruit is good, as it's affordable and likely to be in the best condition. It also helps to celebrate the season.;
, You could use cord, raffia, thin ribbon, string, etc. The method for wrapping is as follows:


Wind the cord around the fruit in the same manner as for tying string around a parcel.
Tie a strong knot to secure in place at the top. Leave plenty of cord intact for hanging the fruit from at the top and for adding decoration at the bottom.

, This is what the fruit bauble will hang from.

, Beads, dried citrus slices, herbs, etc., can be threaded on. Tie a firm knot to keep the decorative pieces in place. Trim off excess and neaten.


If using raffia, fray the end after cutting for the dangling base piece. This adds a nice touch.
If using ribbon, cut the end piece in a V shape, or diagonally, to prevent further fraying.

, It's heavier than your standard bauble, so use either a sturdy branch, curtain rod, thick dowel, or other such strong item for hanging from.

Wipe away any residue using the dry side of the cotton swab or a clean, dry rag.
This process removes any debris that could interfere with the effectiveness of the glue you'll be using later on.
If the staves do not have specific inlay holes, you should still clean the general areas you plan to place the stones.
Note that rhinestone decorations are only optional. Skip this section if you choose not to use them.;
, Use a toothpick to apply a dab of glue to the back of one rhinestone gem.


You may need to hold the stone with tweezers as you apply the glue to prevent the adhesive from sticking to your skin.
Five-minute epoxy is a good choice, but any super glue should work.

, Place the stone, glue-side down, on one of the cleaned inlays. Gently press down on the stone so that the adhesive sticks securely to the stave.


Wait until the glue dries before continuing.
If the staves you use do not have specific inlay holes, you will need to determine where to place each gemstone before applying it. The stone should be able to stick to any position on the stave, though.

, Apply glue to the back of each rhinestone gem, then place each gem on a separate inlay hole along the stave.


Typically, each stave has six gemstone inlays.

, Repeat the process for each stave until all 12 staves are decorated with rhinestones.


Let everything dry before continuing.
If the staves do not have separate rhinestone inlays, you will need to measure out the space in between each stone on your first stave and repeat these precise measurements on each stave that follows.

, Each feather must be equal in length to each stave, and the feathers must be equal in length to one another.


Use a yardstick to measure the staves and feathers. Make sure that the quill portion of each feather can extend all the way down the bottom set of double holes on the stave.
If the quill is too long, trim it with heavy scissors until it reaches an appropriate length.
Note that the feathers should be at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) long., Hold one stave together with one feather. The quill of the feather should be positioned on the back (undecorated) side of the stave.


The feather should curl downward when held with the stave on top.
Make sure that the feather plume hangs down over the squared end of the stave. The stave end marked by a single hole should fall below the quill of the feather and in the opposite direction of the feather plume.

, Locate the lowest set of double holes in the stave. Insert a small cable tie through one of these holes from the back, then loop it all the way around both the stave and the feather.Ideally, the color of the cable tie should match the color of the stave.
Some staves have more than two sets of double holes. If the quill of the feather does not extend down to the lowest set of double holes, you can thread the cable tie through a higher set. Make sure that you can use at least two separate sets of double holes per feather and stave, however.
Close the cable tie over the feather side. Make sure that you have closed it as tightly as possible so that the feather does not slip out.
Thin wire or v-shaped wires can be used instead of cable ties, if desired. Use pliers to twist the wires closed at the feather side of the stave.

, Loop a second cable tie around the feather and stave inside the top set of double holes.


As before, you should close the cable tie as tightly as possible over the feather side of the stave.

, Line up one feather with each stave and secure the two together with two cable ties.


When finished, you should have 12 identical feathered staves.
Use heavy scissors or side cutters to trim the end of each cable tie.

, Slide one washer onto a long bolt, slipping it all the way down to the head of the bolt.


The exact size necessary will vary depending on the thickness of each fan stave, but generally, a 3-inch (7.6-cm) bolt will work well.

, Locate the single hole at the base of the stave. Insert the bolt through this hole so that the decorated rhinestone side of the stave faces the head of the bolt.


The feathered side of the stave should face up and away from the bolt head.

, Place the remaining staves on the bolt, sliding two washers in between each pair of staves. Make sure that there is at least one washer at the end of the bolt following the twelfth and final stave.All staves should face the same direction on the bolt.
If there is a considerable amount of excess space at the end of the bolt, you can add more than one washer to the end following the final stave.

For the sake of consistency, you may wish to add a few extra in between the bolt head and the first stave, too. Doing so will require you to remove all of the washers and staves on the bolt and redoing the construction from scratch.



, Using your fingers, screw a hexagonal locking nut onto the end of the bolt, following the final stave and final washer.This locking nut will hold the construction together.


You may need to use a pair of pliers to hold the nut while using a screwdriver to tighten the bolt into it.
A tight fit will allow the fan to stay open more securely, but a loose fit will make it easier to open and close your fan. You may need to experiment a bit with the tightness of the locking nut until the staves reach the level of tension you desire.

, Lay the fan down on your working surface and spread the staves out equally.


Continue spreading out the fan until the staves form a semicircle with a rotation in between 90 and 180 degrees.
Make sure that the staves are all positioned at an even distance apart from one another.

, Locate lowest pair of double holes in your first stave. Insert a long piece of nylon fishing line through the right hole of this set and securely knot it in place.


Cotton twine and embroidery floss will also work. The string should either be transparent or should match the color of the staves.

, Weave the nylon line through the matching hole of each stave, knotting it around the side of each hole before continuing to the next one.


Continue until all 12 staves are strung together.
This nylon line will hold the ""open"" position of the fan, preventing it from opening any further than this.

, Consider placing a small bead of super glue on the first and final knots in your nylon line to help keep the knots secure.


Keep the glue on the nylon line itself. If you get glue on the stave, it could create an unappealing mark or smear.
Let the glue dry before continuing.

, Open and close the fan a few times. If it works properly, the project is complete.


If the fan does not close completely, you may need to undo the nylon line and try tying it on again, leaving more space in between each separate stave this time.

If just a slight sharpening is required jump to stage 3.;
,
Set up on a table with plenty of light and prop your sword up on the wood.Using even, measured strokes at about a 30 degree angle, start to shape the edge with your file, counting strokes one at a time down your, blade one way, then turning it over and doing the same thing on the other side.,
Get your whetstone and apply a thin layer of oil to it.,
Complete the sword sharpening process by blending your newly sharpened blade with the rest of your sword, get some 400 grit and tear off a postage stamp sized piece.",How to Sharpen a Sword1,",


Make sure not to take too much off of one side, just keep filing and turning the blade over until an edge shows. The edge will be very rough at this point but it will become refined in the next steps.

, This is more polishing rather than grinding. Pass the blade over the stone as if slicing pieces off of the stone, but not so much that it bites into it. Do this at a 30 degree angle, using a slow and flat stroke; you want to making sure you pass over the stone at the same angle every time. Use a good light source to find the parts you've missed or even use a marker and draw on the edge, then sharpen until all the marker is worn off.

, Wet with a little water, and carefully run the paper along one side of the edge of the blade with your finger at a 30 degree angle the.


This is a dangerous step. You may cut yourself so turn off the TV or radio and focus (it can actually be quite relaxing). If you want a higher polish then get finer and finer grit paper, I generally take it to 1000 grit. Eventually using a cotton rag and buffing compound if you want mirror finish.

Get a knife sharpener.",How to Sharpen a Sword2," It's the easiest, fastest and most reliable. Some say it's cheating but really it's just that it's not traditional so older blacksmiths frown upon it.


It will not create as fine of an edge as filing BUT it will ensure you do not mess up on what may be a 500-1000 dollar blade. Accusharp is the most commonly used sharpener for swords being that not all sharpeners fit a sword. It's also relatively cheap.
Try polishing the edge with sandpaper after you're done for that extra gleam.

Ensure the size is less than maximum size on your printer feed.

, Take the flashing outside and lay the printing surface face up.

, You want to abrade the coating on the outside of the flashing. Use a medium to fine sandpaper and cover every inch with your sanding pad.

, The waterproof surface should now be removed, so that ink can be applied.

, Apply a large piece of double-sided tape and tape it to a waterproof work surface.

, You will need an even layer on the top of your flashing before printing.

, It should be pooled above it so that you can coat it evenly with a coating bar.

, It can be wood or plastic, but it is similar to a screen-printing technique.

, If it doesn’t coat your metal and the surface is flat, you haven’t used enough pre-coat.

, Pick it up from the sides until the tape comes loose.

, Make sure to size it ahead of time and test it. Place your feeder tray bars in the right position for even printing.

, Press the flashing down onto it, with the printing side up.

, Press print. If your printer will not print on metal, you will need to opt for the next part, which is using an inkjet transfer.

, Let it sit for a few moments. Then, remove it by the sides and let it sit and dry completely.

, The ink is secure, but not very durable at this point.

, Purchase some inkjet transfer sheets that will work on metal. Sheets like Lazertran say they will print onto any material., Print them according to the instructions.

,, It may take some assistance or practice to apply it flush with the edges.

Sew the two pieces together, leaving an opening at the top, and slide the hanger inside. Stuff the inside of the material with loose cotton or pieces of foam, and sew the opening shut.

, Use wire clippers to cut the bottom part of the hanger in half. Bend the two bottom halves of wire down to narrow the shape (approximately 3-4 inches, or 7-10 cm, apart). Twist each wire end upwards to meet the bottom of the hanger hook, and twist the ends into a circular shape to cover the sharp points.Place shoes, toe-side up, over each circular part of the hanger to hang them easily in your closet.

, Start with a finished piece of wood and attach 3 to 6 screws to the board, depending on its size and your preferences, halfway in and evenly spaced. Cut the same number of wire hooks from old coat hangers using wire cutters. Using pliers, twist the end of each hook around a screw until it is firmly attached.If you wish to paint or decorate the coat rack, do so before attaching the hooks to make things easier.
Be sure to attach the coat rack firmly to the wall before hanging anything on it.

, You can reuse wire hangers without making any modifications to them by rethinking their purpose. By hanging a hanger off a bathroom door cabinet, for instance, you can make a simple magazine or newspaper holder. You can also hang up hangers on the wall to hold a collection of eyeglasses, scarves, ties, bras, or other accessories."

Mold the molten silver.",How to Melt Silver Coins," It should be more than large enough to hold the coins you want to clean. Keep in mind you’ll also need to pour water into this container so choose your container appropriately., Unroll a sheet of aluminum just large enough to cover the bottom of your container and cut to size. Don’t worry if you have to fold up the corners of the foil for it to fit in your container., Pour water into a saucepan and bring it to a boil on a stovetop. Pour it into your non metallic container until it’s a few inches from the top. You may want to wear gloves or oven mitts in case the water splashes., Measure half a cup (170g) of baking soda and one tablespoon (14g) of salt. Add them both to the water. Use a stirring stick to help the two substances dissolve in the water., Be careful not to drop the coins too quickly, as this could cause the water to splash and burn you. Make sure the coins are placed on the foil in a single layer. If necessary, you can use a toothpick or a knife to nudge them so they don’t stack.


You’ll see the baking soda start to react with the aluminum foil, stripping any tarnish the coins may have accumulated., It’s best to use tongs to remove the coins as they may be quite warm. Place them on a soft cloth and allow them to cool.

, If the coins are still dirty after their dip in hot water, you may need to give them a good scrub. Run the tap, keeping the water warm but not too hot. Take a pinch of baking soda, rubbing it onto the coin under the tap. The baking soda will mix with the water, creating a paste that makes for an efficient, non-abrasive cleaner.


You can use an old toothbrush to help scrub the grime from the coin., Make sure the coins are rinsed thoroughly, clean of any grime or baking soda. Turn off the tap and use a dry cloth to scrub the coins dry., At the very least, you should wear safety goggles to prevent heat or debris from harming your eyes. Consider wearing an apron and gloves to protect yourself as well.

, Crucibles are typically made of fire clay, and can withstand temperatures that would melt metal. Try to lay the coins down in a single layer. It will take more time for heat to travel to coins laying at the bottom of a pile. Make sure you use tongs to hold the crucible, don’t try to hold it with your hands.


If you don’t have access to a crucible, you can place the coins on a brick. Be aware that because it’s a flat surface, the melted silver won’t be as easy to pour if you need to do so., Some blowtorches have a self-starting system with a trigger; for these, simply press the trigger to light the torch. Just make sure you’ve turned the knob to give the torch some gas.


Other torches are manual and need a striker to start. For these torches, turn the knob to let the gas flow, then place the striker near the mouth of the torch. Squeeze the striker to create a spark. If the torch doesn’t light, squeeze the striker until it does., Make sure to pass the flame over the coins evenly. Keep in mind it will take several minutes of heating for the coins to start melting. You’ll notice any inscriptions or markings on the coin will melt first. Then, the coins will start glowing bright red before finally melting., Whether you’re molding it into a specific shape or a bar, make sure to keep your mold close by. Pour quickly so the silver doesn’t have a chance to solidify. Pour evenly to prevent the silver from splashing.


Alternatively, you let the silver cool in your crucible or on your brick. It will solidify into a nugget that you can keep, store and melt down later. Try to avoid touching or prodding the silver until it’s completely cooled."

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the fork that will be the centerpiece.,
Drill holes in each remaining piece of silverware so that they can be hung.,
Make decorative changes to the remaining pieces of silverware if desired.,
Hang the lower pieces of silverware from the central fork.,
Hang the entire set of wind chimes from your desired location.",How to Make Wind Chimes From Old Silverware," For this project, you will need 6 pieces of silverware, at least 1 of which must be a fork. Forks and spoons are preferable to knives, as the thick handles of knives make them difficult to drill a hole through for hanging. You will also need a pair of pliers, a pair of needle-nose pliers, a drill and a set of drill bits, and some fishing line or thin ribbon.;
, All of the remaining pieces of silverware will hang from this central fork. To prepare it, you will need to drill 2 holes in it and bend its prongs to allow for hanging the other pieces.


Begin by drilling the hole for hanging the entire wind chime. This hole should be placed in the handle of the fork, very close to the end. Select a very small drill bit for this job - preferably 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) or smaller. All-purpose drill bits will generally be able to handle drilling through metal if they are high-quality. You may want to secure the fork to a work surface using a C-clamp while you drill.






Next, drill a hole in the central fork for hanging a piece of silverware directly below it. This hole should be drilled in the center of the broad part of the fork, just above the tines.






Now you'll need to bend each of the fork's tines in a different direction to make room for the other pieces hanging below. Use your pliers to bend each tine until they are at a 90 degree angle to the fork's handle. Make the bend right where the tine meets the broad part of the fork, and spread the tines out until they are each at right angles to their adjacent tines.






Finally, curl the end of each tine so that the fishing line can be looped through it. Use your needle-nose pliers to grab the end of each tine and wrap it back on itself until it forms a small loop.







, Only 1 hole needs to be drilled in each of the 5 additional pieces of silverware. Position the hole very near the end of the handle of each piece. Again, you may want to secure the silverware with a C-clamp when drilling.

, The 5 remaining pieces of silverware can be hung as-is, or they can be altered in shape.


For example, you can use your needle-nose pliers to curl the tines of forks tightly back onto themselves. You could also curl the blade of a knife or the basin of a spoon in the same way.
Another option is hammering each piece of silverware flat. This would best be accomplished by laying the silverware on a hard work surface and striking them with a sledgehammer.

, To begin assembling the wind chimes, cut 5 pieces of fishing line to the length that you want the lower pieces of silverware to hang.


Carefully tie the end of each piece of fishing line to the hole in each lower piece of silverware. Cut off any excess length after securing the knot.






Loop the other end of the fishing line through 1 of the curled tines of the centerpiece fork. Tie a knot to secure it in place. The fifth piece of silverware should be tied to the hole you drilled in the broad part of the central fork.







, Now, the 5 lower pieces of silverware should be hanging from the centerpiece fork above. The only remaining step is to tie a piece of fishing line through the hole in the handle of the central fork. This fishing line can then be tied to a hook in your ceiling, covered porch, or another location.

Purchase a vinyl record vacuum cleaner.",How to Protect Vinyl Records," The inner sleeve is the only storage item that should regularly come into contact with the record. The best sleeves are composed of either a plastic liner within a paper inner, or as a round-bottomed plastic-only sleeve. Storing your record in one of these sleeves is essential to protect it from scratches and debris. These can be purchased both online and in local music stores.Most records come with paper sleeves.Avoid using these because as you slide your records in and out over time, the paper acts as fine grain piece of sandpaper that will add scratches to your vinyl.;
, The outer sleeve covers the vinyl’s card sleeve, and it also prevents dust from gathering on the vinyl itself. Opt for the softer, roomier sleeves to avoid peeling off the record’s artwork. These can be purchased both online and in local music stores.Avoid the heavy gauge plastic sleeves. Over time, these can compress and stick to the record sleeve. When removed, they may damage the artwork.
You can also use a vinyl bag that fits like a normal sleeve but has a large flap and adhesive strip on the outside to fully enclose the record.

, Avoid carelessly dropping a record into its jacket or sleeve. This can not only split the cover but it can also cause damage to your record including scratches and abrasions. Gently put away your records by slowly sliding the vinyl into the jacket or sleeve., Once your records are properly encased, you’ll need a shelving system that is sturdy enough to hold your records in an organized manner. Opt for a shelving system that has built-in square shelves or inserts that will hold baskets or boxes. You can purchase inexpensive shelving systems from local furniture stores.Be sure to strengthen the system by adding L-shaped metal brackets to avoid having your shelving system lean to one side.
Use dividers to help catalog your records for easier access. You can find record dividers online which allow you to write in categories, genres, or the alphabet.
Never lay your records flat as this will cause them to warp. Store them vertically instead., Opt for stronger materials that will support the weight of lots of records and avoid cardboard which can weaken over time. Avoid containers that won't retain a static charge (wood over metal#, and loosely stack your records in an upright position.Try a heavy-duty, top down, plastic container with handles for easy transport., Vinyl records should always be stored in a dry, cool environment. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight, as the light and heat can fade the jacket artwork and warp the record. Never store records in extreme temperature or humidity. This can cause warping of the record. In addition, avoid storing in areas where the record will be exposed to a lot of dust or airborne particles.Avoid areas like basements that tend to have leaks and environmental extremes.Proper storage temperature is between 46-50 degrees° F, with 30-40% relative humidity.

, Avoid touching any part of the record that contains stored information such as the grooves of the album. Instead, handle carefully by touching only the edges and the inner label. Dirt and prints can affect the sound quality and playback of your record. If you happen to come in contact with the record, use a fibre brush to remove surface dust and clean prints., Limit the amount of time records are in contact with the air to avoid accumulation of dirt and debris. When albums are not in use, they should immediately be stored in sleeves. If your turntable has a lid, be sure to close the lid during playback to limit contact with airborne dirt., If you have a manual turntable, you will have to manually lift the arm and place the needle on the record for playback. If you don’t have a steady hand, you can easily scratch the record. Avoid shaking hands and also use the cueing lever on your turntable to raise and lower the needle. Additionally, you can purchase a turntable with an automatic system., When a record has played to completion, wait for the platter to stop spinning before removing the needle. This helps to avoid scratches on your record. If you are trying to skip to another song, it is not necessary to stop the turntable. However, it is important to avoid applying downward pressure to the arm. After picking up the arm, lower it to the dead space before the song.The dead space is visually distinctive from the parts of the record which contain music. You can also use the track list as a guide to avoid scratching information on the record.

, A fiber brush is useful because it can easily enter the grooves of the record to remove dirt. Additionally, the type of fiber easily drains static electricity which is responsible for attracting dust. To use, spin the record slowly while holding the brush over the vinyl. Special brushes can be purchased at your local music store or online.Use the brush to clean your records both before and after each record use.
Don’t forget to clean the dust off of the brush between uses too.
Avoid using a T-Shirt or towel as this can damage the surface of your vinyl., There are pre-formulated cleaning products available both online and at local music stores, but you can also make a safe and affordable cleaner at home. Combine distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, and a couple drops of laundry detergent #without fragrance or dyes#, spray onto the vinyl, and use a microfiber cloth to wipe in a circular motion until the vinyl is dry.Combine 12 oz distilled water, 2 oz alcohol, 2 drops free and clear laundry detergent, into a spray bottle.
It’s important to use distilled water because it doesn’t have any minerals that could be harmful to the record.

, Vinyl record vacuums provide a deeper clean than brushing and cleaning products alone. The vacuum sucks the debris out of the grooves with as little friction as possible. In addition, vacuums are able to apply a thin layer of cleaning fluid which dissolves oils and further protects the record.Each record vacuum is different so consult included with the device to learn to operate the device correctly.
As an added bonus, the vacuum also helps to dry the record in an even fashion.

Gain access to and learn the proper safe use of a metal lathe in proper running order and good condition.,
Familiarize yourself with the parts of the lathe and common terminology.,
Select a piece of aluminum stock that has about a quarter inch of extra metal on either side when sized up to your finger.

,
Insert the piece of stock into the chuck.,
After chucking up and testing for wobble, select a tool bit for parting.,
Once locked and ready activate the lathe, running at a relatively slow speed, slowly feed the cutting bit into the stock and proceed slowly with the parting operation.,
Prepare for truing.,
If your lathe has an automated feed mechanism, set the tool bit to travel down the stock at a set, smooth speed.,
After surfacing the metal, make designs in the metal by manipulating the tool bit on the metal creating grooves, rough spots, or knurling (this requires a specialized tool bit that creates the diamond pattern seen on many tool handles to improve grip and feel).,
Find a drill bit that has a shank that is approximately the size of the desired finger.,
Move the tool-holding assembly away from the end of the workpiece, but don't run it into the chuck.,
Run the bit slowly inward until the desired depth is reached; it should be enough for at least two rings of the size that you want.,
Loosen the tailstock and slide it to the end of the rail or remove it to get it out of the way.

,
Get the bit you used to perform the initial parting operation and position the bit on center line of the workpiece.,
Once the ring(s) is cooled, use sandpaper or emery cloth to remove any burrs or to smooth the inside of the ring.",How to Make Your Own Aluminum Rings," Bad equipment can cause serious injury.;
, A good resource for such information is Wikipedia.

,, The metal can be turned on only one point, but only if the piece short enough to not wobble. Typically, about seven inches is long enough to make several rings, and to allow for some error in work.

, This is necessary for a flat end surface to work with. Center the cutting point of the tool to just barely below center of the workpiece, and lock into the tool rest. Activate the lathe so that it is turning the metal counterclockwise when looking at it from the right of the stock. This will feed the metal in the correct direction as to cut it.

, Once completed, run the bit directly back out, paying close attention not to make the bit traverse laterally toward the metal by turning the incorrect operation knob. If you like, you can move the bit away from the stock first, then back it out.

, This refers to making the piece spin truly round on the axis. This is achieved with a tool bit that has been ground to the correct shape for performing the operation on aluminum, you can obtain this information in a metal-working book, or some stores may sell pre-ground bits; when in doubt, contact a professional or a person with experience.

, If not, or if you prefer, simply feed it slowly by hand, as evenly as possible. Set the tool bit at centerline of the stock, and move it to a position a few inches before the end of the stock. Then you can activate the lathe to turn in the same manner as before. Don't start the lathe with the tool touching it; feed the bit into the metal just a few thousandths of an inch. There should be little markings on knob that indicate thousandths of an inch. Engage the automatic feed or begin feeding it by hand; if the feed is too fast, the surface will look rough after cutting, so slow the feed by shutting down the lathe and adjusting the feed transmission. Or, just turn the knob slower if you're doing it by hand. Continue this operation until the desired size is achieved; this can take a while if you want it really smooth. Once finished, disengage the feed mechanism from the transmission via the switch on the tool-holding assembly.

, Or, if you like the flat finish, you can proceed to the next step.

, If it does not have a Morse taper on the back, (a locking taper), you will need a keyed chuck attachment to insert into the tailstock. Once you have the bit, insert it into the tapered tube in the tailstock if it has a Morse taper, or insert the bit into the chuck and put the chuck in the tailstock.

,


Slide the tailstock into position, with the bit fully drawn back, close to the end of the stock.
Lock the tailstock in place.
Activate the lathe in the same manner as before and slowly feed the bit into the stock, the turning of the workpiece replaces the turning of the drill bit.

,


Back the bit out and shut down after the bit is clear from the workpiece.

,, Position it for where you want the ring to end. Follow the parting operation; odds are, once you break through the ring, it will drop into the pile of aluminum leftovers from all the cutting. Just leave it there for a bit until it cools. Shut down the lathe or repeat the parting operation on another ring that is bored if you prepared enough metal for another ring.

, It might be sort of rough; always check for sharp edges and sand them off. Now that your ring is complete, wear it around and show it off to your friends; make more with different textures, finishes and designs.

Add a key ring to any wire. Push it to the center so that you can use it as a key chain.







, Place it between the next two strands.


, Then place the last one in the loop of the first strand. At this stage, you have made a starting square stitch. Now continue doing this until the project is approximately 6 centimetres in length.
, Then take the first wire and place it in between the center part by passing it through the previous wire (as shown in the picture). Pull tight. After that, cut the remaining wires, leaving approximately 1 cm of length in place. At this stage, you have made one side of the letter. Now make the same piece for the opposite side.

Before starting the opposite side, take the keyring with which the previous side was made and place the keyring in the middle of the new side's one strand. Then follow the same steps as for the previous side.

, First create a starting stitch, then place it below a strand (as shown in the picture). Then take the strands up and make a tight knot before continuing with the stitching.,, Cut off the excess wires. It is now completed and you can add the A to a zipper pull, key chain, lanyard, etc."

Cut several loops of bracelet-size memory wire.,
Use a pair of round nose pliers to fold the end of the memory wire into a loop.Pinch the end of your memory wire with the tips of your round nose pliers.,
Slip a faceted bead onto a headpin.You can use the standard teardrop shape, or something more interesting, such as a ball, heart, or star.,
Trim the headpin down to ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters), then use a pair of round nose pliers to twist the tip into a loop.,
Slip the headpin onto the memory wire, then close the memory wire's loop all the way.,
Slip beads onto the memory wire.You can use all one type of bead, or experiment with different shapes, sizes, and colors.,
Twist the other end of your memory wire into a loop.Use the same technique as before: pinch the end of the memory wire with your round nose pliers, then roll it into a loop.

,
Slip some string through the loop.Tie the ends of the string to form a loop, then hang it from a hook.

",How to Make Suncatchers1," Use a pair of heavy duty wire cutters to do this. Memory wire is very hard, and it can ruin a pair of more delicate jewelry-making wire cutters.;
, Twist the pliers away from yourself to form, but don't close the loop all the way.

, For best results, use a crystal or glass bead; it will catch and reflect the light much better than a plastic one.


This only works for beads that have a hole going straight up and down through them, and not for the pendant-style beads.

, Cut the head pin with a pair of wire cutters (you can use jewelry making wire cutters here).Next, grip the tip of the headpin with your pliers, and roll it towards the bead to form a loop.If the loop is off-centered or crooked, use a pair of needle nose pliers to fix it., Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open the loop on the memory wire, if needed. Slip the headpin onto the memory wire's loop, then use your needle nose pliers to close it again.

, For example, you could use seed beads, small faceted beads, and large faceted beads.

Find a plastic lid.,
Spread a thick layer of clear school glue over the bottom of the lid.,
Arrange glass, flat-backed gems in the lid.,
Fill the lid the rest of the way with clear school glue.,
Wait 2 to 4 days for the glue to dry.Do not disturb the suncatcher during this time.,
Carefully peel the lid off of the suncatcher.,
Thread some clear through through a thick part of your suncatcher with a needle.,
Hang the suncatcher indoors in front of a window.",How to Make Suncatchers2," The best type of lid to work with is the kind that comes from a yogurt, butter, or margarine container. Make sure that the lid is clean and dry.

, Turn the lid over so that the inside is facing you. Fill the bottom with a thick layer of clear school glue.Make sure that there aren't any gaps or holes in the glue, or your suncatcher will fall apart.It may seem as though you are using more glue than necessary, but clear glue tends to shrink a lot as it dries.Do not use a clear, industrial-strength glue for this; you want to be able to remove the suncatcher from the lid when you are done.
White school glue may also be used, but your finished suncatcher may look cloudy and not sparkle as much., You can arrange them randomly or in a pattern, but make sure that you fill the entire bottom of the lid in an even layer. To make a more interesting looking suncatcher, experiment with different sizes and colors.Make sure that the flat size of the gems is facing down.

, Do not skimp on the glue during this step; this is what will hold your suncatcher together. Make sure that you fill all of the cracks between the gems, and don't worry if the glue covers the gems; the glue will dry clear., If it tends to get very dusty where you live, consider placing a cardboard box over the lid to keep the glue clean and dust-free.

, Turn the suncatcher over, so that the back is facing you, and let it finish drying., Find an area near the edge of the suncatcher where the glue is thick. Thread some clear string through a needle, then push the needle through the glue.Tie the ends of the string into a loop.

, You can hang the suncatcher from a suction cup that has a hook on it, or you can hang it from the window latch.Do not let this suncatcher get wet. The glue will dissolve.

Figure out what kind of tape you're removing.,
Wet the surface gently.,
Use a spoon or other scraping device.,
Remove the remaining adhesive.",How to Remove Tape1," Different types of tape will be able to be peeled off quickly and easily without much extra effort, while more sticky or hefty types of tape will be more difficult to remove. Figuring out what you're working with will help you to plan the removal job properly:


If you're removing Scotch tape, you should be able to remove the tape quickly without leaving much residue that will need to be removed. Use your fingernail or a knife to remove the tape, then wipe the surface down with a clean cloth.
If you're removing masking tape, it's likely that some sticky residue will be left over on the glass, though the tape itself should be fairly easy to remove. It's likely that you'll need a small amount of acetone or commercial Goo Gone to get the glass cleaned up.
If you're removing duct tape, it's likely that you'll need to spend some time scraping the tape off vigorously, using a putty knife, scraper, or some other kind of knife. You'll also need to spend some time with isopropyl alcohol, paint thinner, or some other kind of cleaner.;
, Before removing the tape, it can help to soften the tape, as long as the surface will not be damaged by the water. Soak the surface by wetting a sponge or towel with warm water and pressing it on top of the surface. Wait for a minute or so before starting to pick at the tape. If it doesn't come off, wet the sponge or towel once more and wait for another minute before trying again.









If the surface is not easily damaged, rip the piece of tape off to save time and clean up the residue afterward. However, this is not recommended for wooden or painted surfaces for the paint could come off.

, After softening the tape with warm water, you can start scraping the tape off. Depending on the surface you're trying to remove the tape from, you might use something gentle, like the edge of a spoon, or something more serious like a putty knife.









Start at the corner, working the scraper gently under the edge and pulling the tape back at the same time with your other hand. Continue working it under until the tape comes off completely.

, After you've removed the tape, get to work cleaning up the surface. Depending on the surface and the tape, there are lots of household cleaners, some more aggressive than others, that you can use to wet the residue and try to scrape, or wipe it off.In ascending order of strength, here's a list of cleaners that some people have had success with:


Warm soapy water
Baby oil, vegetable oil, or Crisco
Mineral oil
Vinegar
Acetone fingernail polish remover
Denatured alcohol
WD-40
Lighter fluid
Lacquer thinner
Paint thinner
Turpentine
Goo Gone

Heat the tape with a hair dryer.,
Use a knife or other scraping device.,
Remove the remaining adhesive.",How to Remove Tape2," Wetting tape on paper won't work, because you'll soften the paper far more than you'll soften the tape. Removing the tape without doing anything, on the other hand, will likely tear up the paper and mess it up. If you're trying to remove the tape clean, it'll be difficult, so it's important to try to soften the tape in other ways.









To start with, try using a heating gun close above the tape, moving it back and forth over the tape to help loosen it. At the very least, this can help to curl the edges of Scotch tape and get it up slightly easier.

, Try to use a sharp knife to scrape underneath the tape slowly, very carefully pulling the tape off as you work. It's much better to use some kind of scraping device with paper to try to separate the paper very carefully and keep it from tearing.








, It is possible to use a very small amount of alcohol, which will evaporate very quickly without damaging the paper. Use a Q-Tip or cotton swap to wipe a very small amount of tape just at the corners.








"
"
Wet the edges of medical tape.,
Remove the tape quickly.,
If it's especially painful, use a small amount of Vaseline.,
Clean up the remaining residue.",How to Remove Tape3," If you're using medical tape to keep gauze or other protective wrapping on your body, it helps to gently wet the edges of the tape to make it easier to remove. The water will help dampen the tape and make it easier for it to come off. Then, slowly pick at the tape while it's in the water until it eventually peels off.









Don't soak a serious wound in water to help get the tape off. It's usually important to keep wounds as dry as possible as you're trying to heal them, making it important that you only use a small amount of water to help ease off medical tape.

, Gradual pulling makes it a lot more painful. Instead, dab it gently with water and pull it off as quickly as possible. One second of quick pain is better than ten seconds of wincing and whimpering while you carefully rip it. Plus, the soapy water should help to soften it and remove it much more quickly.








, Carefully lift up a small piece of the tape, dabbing a cotton ball in a little Vaseline, then wiping a little under the lifted piece of tape to help soften the adhesive. Slowly lift up more of the tape using the cotton bud and more vaseline. Continue doing until all the tape is removed.








, Medical tape will often leave some gunk stuck to your skin and your hairs, and the best way to remove it is by rubbing it vigorously with warm soapy water. Stay clear of the wound, if there is one, or leave the wound covered while you clean up the area affected by the tape.

For example, the website Duck Tape features many duct tape crafts, or Ductilities, you can make. You can start by reading on and making a beach bag or wallet. The steps for making those duct tape crafts are described below, in methods three and four. These crafts are ""easy"" level crafts to make.
If you are searching online, there are many classic duct tape crafts to choose from, including: flowers, bow tie, wallet, magnetic clutch, wire picture frame, and beach bag. Start with an easy craft. If you are searching online websites for crafts, on most of the websites, it will tell you how easy or difficult it is to make the craft.
Click on a project you might like to make. Check the approximate crafting time it takes as well as the supplies and tools required for the craft. Browse through the crafts, until you find the craft you want to make.;
, For most crafts, you do not need more than one roll of duct tape. You may, however, need two different colors, or you may need a color and a print. There is a wide variety of duct tape colors, prints, and even scents, for you to choose from.


For most crafts, you can choose the print(s) and/or color(s) that suit your taste. For example, if you are making duct tape flowers, you could choose a classic pink solid and floral print or you could do something a little different and pick a geometric print, to along with a green solid.
You will be able to find the best selection of duct tapes online. You can shop online at Staples, Amazon, or Consumer Brands, to find a great selection of duct tapes: colors, prints, fabrics, and sheets. Generally, printed duct tape from the retailer cost about five dollars, plus shipping, for a ten-yard roll. You can also find duct tape at craft stores, like Michael's and Joann’s. If they are out of stock, ask an employee where there is a store nearby that sells craft duct tape. Often, it is easiest to talk to someone who is knowledgeable about where to buy craft supplies.

, Both will work, but many craft enthusiasts prefer a razor blade to scissors, which the tape often sticks to. No matter which utensil you choose, make sure you are comfortable handling it.

, For example, the beach bag requires a cord for the strap. Read through all of the steps of your craft. As you read, make a list of things to buy.


In some crafts, not all of the materials are listed in the materials section at the top, so be careful.
You may need to buy duct tape sheets to make your craft. Sheets, unlike the fabric, have a sticky side. You use sheets to make shapes that you stick onto your finished product.
You may also want to buy pre-made duct tape fabrics. Purchasing fabrics can cut down on your crafting time, because you will no longer have to make your own duct tape fabric. Duct tape fabrics can come in both in rolls and sheets. Almost all crafts require you to make duct tape fabric. If you do not know what duct tape fabric is, read this method to find out how to make duct tape fabric.
To buy the less common materials required for your craft, you may want to go to a website like etsy.com. For example, to buy the stencil to make the anchor shape for your beach bag, you can find a variety of anchors, ranging from five to ten dollars, on Etsy.
Go to Michael's or Joann’s to buy any other materials you may need. For example, for the beach bag, you can easily find a cord for the strap, at a craft store.

, A crafting board is a mat used for craft making. You can get away with not using a board, but they are useful to have because they have measurements on them. You can buy a crafting board online at Amazon, for less than ten dollars. You can also buy a crafting board from any crafts store, like Michael's or Joann’s.


A self-healing crafting board is a more durable version of the crafting board. It has a malleable surface that will withstand cuts. However, these boards are more expensive.

, Clear off a table or a counter space to make your craft. Before you get started, make sure you have at least three feet by two feet clear for your materials and cutting mat.


You can use the floor to craft, but make sure all small children and animals are out of the way.
Cut on a flat, firm surface. Not only does a flat surface ensure that your designs are cut with more precision, but it is much safer than cutting on a surface that is likely to bend. If you are serious about duct tape projects, it might be a good idea to invest in a self-healing mat.

, If this is your first craft and the project approximated time is twenty-five minutes, give yourself forty-five minutes, to do your craft.


If you do not have dexterity in your fingers from making other crafts, it will probably take a duct tape craft or two before your fingers are used to manipulating duct tape. Be patient.
Don’t worry, after you have made a few crafts, you will be able to make duct tape crafts much more quickly.

, Most crafts require that you make duct tape fabric for your craft. Making the duct tape fabric takes approximately five to ten minutes, depending on how much fabric you need to make. To make the fabric you must:









Find the measurements of the duct tape fabric you need to make. Map out, on your craft board, the dimensions, the length and height of your fabric.
Measure out your duct tape, lengthwise (the longer side), using the measurements on the cutting mat, and cut. Lay down the strip, sticky side up, on your cutting mat. Cut another strip the same length, and lay it next to the first strip, so that it slightly overlaps the other. Do this until you have the correct width for your fabric you are making. When it is the correct length and width, turn it sideways so the strips are going left to right in columns.
Cut more pieces of tape, lengthwise (the long side again), and lay them sticky side down, going up and down, to cover the tape that is sticky side up. Repeat the process until all of the sticky side is covered, and cut off any excess.

, If you used scissors for your project, wipe any adhesive off of the blade, surface, hands, by using rubbing alcohol and a paper towel to scrub it off. 








When storing your duct tape, fold the end so that it is easier to start the roll next time you use it.Clean the area that you worked at. Throw away any extra scraps, and put your craft materials away in an assigned location, so you do not lose any of your materials.

"
"
Fold a piece of tape in half the long way and wrap it around your head, cutting it off with an inch and a half overlap.,
Tape it at the spot where it fits snugly (put this at the back of the visor so you can re-size it later).








,
Make a piece of duct tape fabric that is 5 X 5-7 inches, and cut a curve, so that it looks like a dome with a flat bottom.








,
Tape each corner of the brim at the bottom edge of the band, but tape the center of it at the top edge, giving you a curve.








,
Tape it the rest of the way.








,
Optional: Tape designs onto the brim for extra standing out.

However, the quality of these videos can be hit and miss, so make sure to check out the whole video, before you prepare to make the craft.
These websites often give helpful tips for making your craft. For example, in the instructions for how to make duct tape bangles, at craftsunleashed.com, it suggests ways to fold your duct tape to make sure you are completely covering the sticky parts. This is especially important for this craft because arm hairs can get stuck in the bangles, if the duct tape is not very carefully folded.

, Comments are typically below the craft instructions. Find out what the people who actually made the craft have to say about it. You may want to use their suggestions, to learn how to improve your duct tape craft.


For example, for the beach bag craft, one commenter suggested that you add a clasp to the bag, so that it will close.
In order to figure out how add a feature like the clasp, you can look at related crafts, for example, a duct tape clutch purse, with a magnet, that closed.

, Read the directions for a craft with the feature you want to add. For example, the magnet clutch purse directions explained how to tape magnets to a purse so that it will close. Now you can make your beach bag close.

, For example, you can make the anchor with an Etsy stencil and a red sheet of duct tape, if you are making the beach bag craft. However, make sure to cut shapes carefully. Cut shapes by:









Laying a strip, or sheet, of tape flat, on the cutting surface
Placing a stencil, if needed, on the strip of tape
Tracing the shape on the sheet with a pen or marker
Placing the blade of the razor firmly onto the tape and cutting out the shape
Lifting the edge of the tape with the edge of the blade and peeling the shape away from the cutting surface.

Give yourself approximately thirty minutes.,
Get out your duct tape.,
Get out your additional supplies.,
Cut the edges off of the trash bag, then cut the seam at the bottom of the bag.,
Tape the bag to the surface you are working at.,
Draw a rectangle on the plastic with a permanent marker.,
Cover the surface of your rectangle with tape, sticky side down.,
Cut out the fabric from the plastic, with scissors.,
Cut the cord or ribbon to a desired length.,
Make the encasement for the cord.,
Seal the sides of your bag.,
Tie the two cords that lie on top of each other.",How to Make Duct Tape Crafts3," Because we are making an easier version of duct tape fabric, thirty minutes, or less, is how long this project should take.

, Choose two different colors of duct tape, to create a striped look for your bag; or you can choose a single print, like the anchor print, to make your bag. Reference method one, above, for instructions on the best way to purchase duct tape. Consider choosing one darker color and one lighter color for contrast.
If you want to add a shape onto the bag, buy tape to make the shape. For example, if you want to make the anchor stencil, buy red or white duct tape and use the steps in method two add the shape to your finished product. , In addition to the standard materials detailed in method one, sharp scissors and cutting mat, for this craft you will need a:


13 gallon, white trash bag
Yard stick or measuring tape
Permanent marker
Long ribbon or cord to make the strap of your bag

, This sheet of plastic will be one side of your the duct tape fabric.









If need be, you can use a black trash bag if you do not have a white trash bag. The black doesn’t match the beach bag look as well, but it will still work in a pinch. The white trash bag is also preferable because you can mark the outline with a sharpie that is more visible.

, This will keep it from moving when you are working with the duct tape. Reference method one to learn about how to prepare your surface for crafting.









Tape each of the four sides of your bag to your cleared off surface.

, Using your yardstick or measuring tape, draw a rectangle twenty eight inches by twelve inches.








, Start with your first color of duct tape, and cut a piece, twenty eight inches long, and lay it, left to right, on the top of the long side of the plastic.









Lay the next strip of tape down (your other color, if you are making stripes), slightly overlapping the first piece of tape. Don’t worry about the tape being the perfect length, you will cut off the excess later.
Repeat the process until the rectangle is covered.

, Use the marker outline to help guide you, and remove the excess duct tape and plastic. Throw away the excess you remove.








, Make sure not to cut the cord too short. Two and a half feet for each cord should be sufficient.


The cords in this bag will work like drawstrings that tie at the two ends of the bag. You will pull up on the tied off cords from both sides of the bag and it will tighten the opening of the bag.

, Place the fabric on table with the plastic side facing up. Position the cord along the edge of the short side of your fabric. Fold a couple of inches of fabric over the cord. Cut a long piece of tape and tape down the fold, pressing to smooth the tape down. Cut off any excess.









Now the cord is encased in the bag. When the bag is made, if you pull the cord, the bag will bunch tighter.
Repeat this process with the opposite, also short, side of the fabric. Once both cords are encased, fold your bag in half, so that the cords meet at the top of the bag.

, Cut a long piece of tape, and make sure it matches the color on the bag. Place the half of the tape, vertically, down one side of the bag, and then fold the other half of the tape onto the other side of the bag, and seal the bag shut. Trim off the excess tape.








, On each side of the bag your cords lie on top of each other. Tie them in a double knot. Trim off the excess cord. Pull up on the ties, and your new beach bag is ready to go!

, Get out your duct tape and a ruler. Reference method one to read about your options for purchasing duct tape.

, Make sure you have a cleared off desk or the equivalent to do make your craft. Reference method one to read more about what to do to prepare your space.








, Materials include: scissors, board, and a roll of the tape of your choice. Once again, method one will help you give you more specifics on the materials, if need more information.

, Cut off four, seven inch strips of duct tape. Lay down your first strip, sticky side up. Cut off another piece of duct tape, and lay it, also sticky side up, next to the first piece, so that it slightly overlaps. Repeat until you have all four in a row. Take four more, seven inch strips of duct tape, and lay them, sticky side down, on top of the duct tape sticky duct tape, to make your fabric.









Trim off excess, fold your fabric in half, hotdog style, so the long sides are touching at the top. Trim off the excess duct tape on each side, so you have straight sides.

, Cut off a ten inch strip of duct tape, and cut or rip the strip in half. Take one piece, place half of it along the top of one of the sides, and fold it over. Cut off the edges. Repeat the process with the other side.









Sealing the top and bottom will give the wallet a cleaner look.

, Put two on each side of the wallet. To do this:









Cut three, fourteen inch strips of duct tape.
Take two of the fourteen inch strips and stick them together, sticky sides touching, to make a long strip of duct tape fabric.
Seal each of the long edges of fabric with tape. Lengthwise, rip the third piece of tape down the middle. Take one of the two pieces, lay it on one long side of the fabric, so that it halfway covers the fabric. Fold the tape down and smooth it, to make the edge. Repeat on the other side.

, Fold your original fabric in half, hotdog style, or so the long sides touch. Then, fold the fabric again in half, hamburger style, so the short ends touch, to see where the credit cards pockets will go.








, Get a credit card and your wallet, folded hot dog or lengthwise. Lay the card on the inside of the wallet and measure a piece pocket fabric big enough to hold cards. Make a mark on the fabric and cut it to size. Use that same measurement for the three other pockets.









Measure the fabric so that it is slightly longer than the size of the credit card, so they will fit.
Make sure the pieces of fabric you cut for your credit cards are not so long that they stick out of the sides of the wallet. Also see to it that you can tape the pocket in the middle, as well.

, Lay the pieces of fabric in place where you want the credit cards, on the inside of your wallet.









Cut twelve strips of tape, a few inches long, to secure the pockets. Tape the bottom and two sides of the four credit card holders.

, First, fold the wallet in half, again, lengthwise (hotdog style). Make sure that the pockets are faced out. Take two strips of tape, a little longer than the short side of your wallet, and seal the short edges that are touching, on both sides of your wallet. Trim off the excess tape.








, You have your completed wallet!

You may buy your duct tape at a hardware store or find a greater variety of colors and patterns at an arts and crafts store. You may also find unique designs online.;
, Create fabric out of duct tape by cutting 16 strips of duct tape that measure 32 inches (81.3 cm) long and 2 inches wide. This will create 2 sheets of fabric, one for each panel of your tie as conventional ties are commonly constructed using two panels., Place the strips on a flat surface with the sticky side up. Lay one horizontally and the next one beside it but overlap the edge slightly. Continue to do this until you have four strips wide., Place strips of duct tape over the four adjoining strips so that the sticky portions face one another. Measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together. Once you have 8 strips, 4 on each side, you finished a single panel of fabric., A traditional tie is composed of 2 panels that make up the top of the tie and the neck portion. Create a second panel of fabric for the second part of the tie by, again, overlapping 4 strips of duct tape and closing the panel with another 4 strips., Choose a tie that is a size you’re looking for, don’t choose a thick tie if you want a thin tie. Smooth the fabric so that it lays flat onto one of the panels., Use a pencil or sharpie to trace the tie but be careful not to stain your cloth tie. Make sure that you press hard enough to see the outline but not hard enough to puncture the duct tape. Felt works well but may easily be smudged if not careful., Each panel should be use for a different part of you old tie. Use the second panel for the neck portion of your tie. Again, spread the fabric out flat onto the second duct tape panel., Using a pencil or marker, trace the skinny portion of your tie onto the second panel of duct tape fabric. If your tie is skinny the entire length, the neck portion is the part of your tie that will be closest to your chest and most likely covered by the other portion of fabric., Use scissors to cut out both pieces of your tie from the duct tape fabric. Cut carefully as you do not want to damage the main pieces. If you used a marker, you can choose to include the outline to give a bold silhouette., Tape the ends of the tie that will be closest to your face. Depending on the design you have chosen, the end of your tie may be angled. In this case, the points of your tie should be away from your face, pointed toward your feet and not be taped together.It is common to use the same color duct tape to tape the 2 portions of your tie together; but, you may want a contrast and use a different colored tape., Use markers to let your creativity shine. Whether you create stripes, patterns, logos, or words, markers are a quick way to add flair. You may also add stripes by using a few strips of different colored duct tape. Cut them at the angle and size suitable for your tie.Use a sharp utility knife to create complex patterns or intricate designs.Be sure to only decorate a third of the way up so that the decorations doesn’t get obstructed by your collar or peeled off., Measure your duct tape and your neck before cutting. In case you’re trying to make an comically large or small bow tie, adjust the measurements once you’ve perfected the technique. , The ends should slightly overlap as they come together at the center and the duct tape should now measure about 4 inches (10 cm) in length. Measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together., Create an accordion as you fold the piece 3 times. You should now be able to see your bow tie come together. Cut a small strip of duct tape to create the center of your bow tie. Leave enough length to fold over the center of the accordion while leaving enough space for the neck piece.Create a small a small loop. This will both secure your bowtie in place and complete the traditional bow tie design as the accordion sides flare out.

, Use measuring tape to make sure you create a neckpiece that is both snug and comfortable. Cut a strip of duct tape to your neck measurement and fold it into quarters so that there is no sticky side remaining. Put the neck piece through the bow and maneuver your bowtie into place.

, Pick up sticky velcro from your local arts supply store and attach it to either end of your neck piece. Do not tie your neck piece as it may ruin the material and overall look. Sticky velcro is easy to apply and adjust. Use a mirror and stick the ends together to complete your look. "

Tie a double knot with both ends of the ribbon.",How to Make a Necklace out of Duct Tape Flowers," You will need about six or seven because you will be making a long necklace. Use this ratio to make the necklace: one flower to every 5 inches (12.7 cm). If the flower comes out as a decimal, just round down.;
, Thread a thirty-five inch ribbon that matches the flowers through a longer embroidery needle. Such needles are usually long and sturdy, so they are ideal for this craft.


If you want an even fancier necklace, you can use a patterned tape and pick a ribbon that compliments one of the main colors.
You can go for what is called the ""hover"" style, which is where you use about three or four flowers and a black or nylon thread.

;
, You want a ring, not a finger trap. If you want an even smaller ring, cut off 2/3 of the duct tape.








, This gives it a zig-zag feel; if you'd like something else, feel free to cut out any design of your choosing. Zig-zag is easy as it doesn't to be perfectly symmetrical to look good.








, Cut one on the right and one on the left. When wrapped around your finger, these notches will keep the ring in its shape.

Seal the band together with a small piece of tape.,
Fold the extra in half.,
Seal the fold.,
Form your petals.,
Continue applying petals and adjusting.",How to Make a Duct Tape Ring2," It should be longer than what would make a tight fit; the extra will be used for the base of the flower. Also: It's much easier to trim it down than to add more.









When you have the right length, cut off 1/3 of the width. It'll be far too wide if you don't. Fold this piece in half. Wrap it around your finger -- if you have about 3/4"" (1.9 cm) extra, you're golden.

, Place it on the edge of the tape, wrap it around your finger, and fold it over the other edge of the tape. Cinch it up so that the ring doesn't cut off your circulate but won't fall off, either.








, You know that 3/4"" you had that was just sealed? That's going to be your stem. If you fold in it half, you'll see it start to resemble just that.









When you fold it, you might notice that it intrudes into the diameter of the ring. Place your finger back in the ring and make sure there's still enough space for it to be worn.

, Using the 1/3 of the width of the duct tape you cut off originally, wrap the fold up, around and around, sealing the fold into a tube (stem-like) shape.








, Cut pieces (25-30) of duct tape that are 2"" (5 cm) long. With standard issue duct tape, this should be a square. For the best look, use pieces of varying colors or patterns.









Take your square and, wrong side facing toward you, fold up the bottom right hand corner so the sticky side forms a capital ""L."" In other words, fold the corner almost to the other corner, but not quite.
Take the top left corner and fold it over, so you have a triangle of color and below it a stripe of stickiness.
Wrap it around your stem. If the stripe of stickiness is too wide, cut off a bit now. That's your first petal!

, As you add petal after petal, be sure the tips of each petal don't match up -- the points should be on all sides of the flower. It needs to grow uniformly.









Put it on your finger from time to time; you'll need to check that the band is still big enough (the petals may detract from the original size of the band). Fluff out the petals a bit by squeezing them lightly.

Cut a new circle.,
Peel the back off the circle.,
Cut a second length.,
Make the last circle.,
Add the final ruffle layer.,
Create the centerpiece.,
Use as required.",How to Make a Duct Tape Rosette," This will form the base of the rosette. Use either a compass or a circular object to trace a perfect circle. Trace the circle onto the duct tape, then cut out the circle, leaving the duct tape backing firmly in place for now.


The size of the circle is entirely up to the final size of rosette you want but a fairly typical size would be about 3"" (7.5cm) in diameter.
You'll need to use sheet duct tape for this project, as it is wide enough and gives you the opportunity to make plenty more circles for more rosettes. This can be purchased from craft stores.;
, Assuming you're making a rosette based on 3"" (7.5cm), cut a length of duct tape measuring approximately 12 inches (30cm).

, However, leave a small edge of the sticky part exposed at one edge, which will be used to adhere the pleat in the following step.

, This method will be used for each subsequent layer of rosette ruffles, so simply repeat the step each time:


Begin by attaching a sticky edge of one end of the length to the circle, color side facing up. Pleat by bending the strip at regular intervals, working in a curve around the edge of the circle. The sticky edge left above should be pressed down and attached to the circle each time.
Continue bending and attaching all the way around the circle.
Finish pleating. Cut off any loose edge. Should you find you've run out of enough to finish a total circle with the pleating, this can be quickly remedied by patching another length to the first one and cutting off any excess when completed.

, Follow the step above for making another circle. This circle should be smaller, just sticking over the edge of the ruffle you've just pleated in place. Use the compass to measure accurately.

, Attach it to the ruffle, being careful to overlap the edge of the ruffle circle evenly all the way around.

, As above, cut a new length for the second ruffle, using the same dimensions and method. Pleat onto the second circle, using the method described above for pleating.


Finish by tucking the last pleat under the edge of the first pleat.

, Again, this should just overlap the second ruffle, so use your compass to make this smallest circle accurately. Cut and attach as above.

, Use the pleating method described above to attach the final layer to the rosette, using the same measurement as before.

, This can be a costume gem, a button, an artificial flower or another piece of circular duct tape. The choice is up to you.


Use a hot glue gun to attach a non-self-adhering centerpiece

, The duct tape rosette is now ready to use in crafts, on gifts, as a beauty accessory or for any other use you can think of. You can attach double-sided tape at the back, a brooch pin, Velcro tabs or similar items to adhere the back of the rosette to something else.

, Mark where the buttons (and power switch) will be.








, You can also use scissors, but it will be much more complicated. Remember that the holes can be bigger than the buttons (and probably should be).








,, Both sides should be sticky. You can make a skinny one by taking one strip of duct tape, cutting it in half, and folding the edges so the tips have non-sticky parts on them.








,, For the skinny strips, place them on the sides that have the button holes. Pull the wings tight and stick them onto the PSP.

, Decide which colors you’d like to use for your dress. Buy enough rolls to produce the dress you want. It will vary depending on the pattern and your own dress size.


Start with 3-6 rolls of tape and be ready to head out and buy more if you need to.
The amount of tape will also vary depending on whether you use a single layer of tape on a piece of fabric for your “fabric,” or if you are making the dress solely out of duct tape.

, Non-stick scissors are ideal for working with duct tape because the scissor blades are coated with a non-stick material. These are available at fabric stores.

, Depending on how you plan to assemble your duct tape “fabric,” you might find it preferable to use fabric or an old dress to help you along.


Using cotton fabric on the inside of your dress will also make the dress more comfortable to wear.

, You’ll need a good-sized work surface for constructing your creation. This should be cleaned of any dirt or dust that could get stuck to the tape. A table is good; the floor will work too if you don’t have other available space.

, A stapler might be useful for securing the panels of duct tape fabric together. It is also useful for installing a zipper in your duct tape dress.

, As you start to make your dress, you may benefit from someone else helping fit you for your dress. She might also like to make her own dress and you can help each other.

, Place each strip of tape on your work surface, sticky side up. Overlap them by about ¼ or ½ inch so that each strip sticks to the strip above it., Rotate this section of strips so that they are oriented vertically. This will help reinforce your fabric and make it stronger when you attach additional strips of tape.

, Using strips of tape that are long enough to cover the vertical strips. Overlap these strips, sticky side down, to completely cover the bottom strips.


Alternately, you can cover these strips with a piece of fabric cut to fit. This makes a softer inside that will be more comfortable when you wear the dress.

, Make these strips into fabric panels by trimming away sticky edges. They will be easier to work with if they don’t stick to each other until you’re ready for it.

, If you are using a pattern, the pattern will give you estimates of how much fabric you will need.


A yard of fabric is 36 inches by 36 inches. If you make two 18-inch panels of fabric, then you can tape those together to make a yard of fabric.

, Unfold the papers that come with a dress pattern and cut out the pattern pieces., Follow the instructions on the pattern for whether your duct tape fabric should be face up or face down. Trace the pattern pieces on your fabric or pin them to the fabric.

, Use your non-stick scissors to cut out the pattern pieces. Keep them with the pattern pieces so that you know which fabric piece is which.

, Assemble the pieces of the pattern according to the instructions. You can either use tape to “stitch” the pieces together, or you can staple them together.If you staple your pieces together, cover the staples with tape so that they will not poke you or catch on anything.

, Use a dress that is a little big for you. It can be any color and it doesn’t matter if there are stains. You’ll be covering up the entire dress with duct tape anyway., If you’d like the basic dress form to be your size and shape, then you’ll need a friend to help you wrap tape around your body.

, The first application of tape will be around the ribs. Don’t worry if your fabric folds or wrinkles a little bit. It will be covered with tape.

, Take a strip of tape and place one end on your left shoulder. Cross it down in front of your chest and attach it on the tape around your ribs. Place another strip of tape crossing your chest from your right shoulder to the tape around the ribs.

, Place a strip of tape from your left shoulder, across your back, and attach it to the tape around your ribs. Do the same starting with your right shoulder.

, Continue to cover the upper back of the dress with tape.


Fold the edges of tape over the neckline of the dress so that the tape is wrapped into the inside of the dress.

, Stick strips of tape all around the ribcage and under the armpits to continue making the bodice of the dress form.

, If your dress has sleeves, cover them with tape. You will likely want to only short or cap sleeves, not longer, as they might be difficult to get off your arms.

, Carefully form the bust of the dress form so that the dress will fit you well and won’t slide off too easily when you’re wearing it.

, Once the top is done, you can move on to the waist area. Start wrapping tape around the waist and hips. Don’t pull too tight. Allow the tape to follow the curves of the body. If you need to, cut the tape and start with a new strip to position it correctly.


Place as much tape as you’d like to make the preferred length.

, Ask your friend to cut you out of the dress by cutting straight down the back center of the dress form.You will then be able to create a fastener to ensure that the dress stays on when you’re wearing it by stapling in a zipper or creating tape strips that hook from one side of the back to the other.

, Once you have the correct form size, you’ll be able to use it as the base for a unique design that you tailor to your own style.

, Your dress form will likely have sleeves and a neckline that conforms to the shape of the original dress used underneath the duct tape. You can cut these sleeves and neckline to shape them as you prefer.


Add more tape along the neckline and sleeves to finish off the edges.

, Once you have the basic form for your dress, you can start to design the color scheme that will be displayed. Try a complementary color of duct tape along the neckline and hemline.

, Make a more elaborate dress design by cutting your tape into different shapes, such as butterflies, flowers or flames, and sticking them to your dress., Add additional flair to your dress by creating rosettes or bows made of duct tape in complementary colors and attaching them to your dress with tape or staples."

Pick a pen.,
Get your duct tape and other supplies.,
Cut pieces of duct tape for the petals.,
Fold the petals.,
Trim the petals.,
Create a “stem” with the pen.,
Make the center of the flower.,
Attach the petals to the flower.,
Add the leaves under the flower, also known as the sepals.,
Accessorize your flower pen.",How to Make a Duct Tape Flower Pen," This pen is going to act as your stem, so look for a pen that doesn't have a clicker on the top or on the side. You want the stem to be smooth and clean., Think about what color you'd like your flower to be when selecting the duct tape. Red, white, and pink are good colors, especially if you want the flower to look like a rose. You will also need a pair of scissors, or a small cutting knife, and a cutting board or a surface where you can cut the duct tape. Have one to two rolls of duct tape in different colors if you’d like to make a multicolored tape flower pen. Get a small roll of green duct tape for the “stem” and the “leaves” of the flower pen.

, If you're making larger flowers, cut 23 squares of two to three inch pieces of the duct tape you're making petals out of. If you are making smaller flowers, cut 11 squares of two to three inch pieces of the duct tape.Lay out the pieces of duct tape, sticky side up, on a clean, flat surface.








, With the sticky side up, fold one of the corners of a piece of tape down half way across the square of tape, making that corner into a triangle. Keep a half inch of the sticky side uncovered at the bottom of the tape.








Then, take the other corner and fold it over to meet the first fold in the middle of the tape square, making the top of the tape into a triangle. The tape should now look like a wide triangle, with a stripe of the sticky side at the bottom.
Repeat these steps for the rest of the pieces of tape. You should have a collection of triangles with a stripe of the sticky side at the bottom. These are your petals.

, Use the scissors or the cutting knife to trim the top of the triangles so that they are rounded, instead of pointed. The pieces of tape should look like round petals. Your rose petals are now ready to be attached to the stem.







, Roll the pen lengthwise across a long piece of green tape, with the sticky side up. Do this until the pen is covered in several, even layers of green tape. Cut off any extra bit of tape so that the tape doesn't extend past the length of the pen.







, Tightly roll the triangle piece around the top of pen, with the rounded side of the petal facing the top of the pen. Use the sticky side on the triangle piece to secure it to the pen. This will be the center of the flower and you will build the petals around it.







, To do this, you will continue to attach the pieces with the sticky part on the pen and tightly roll the pieces around the pen. Keep the rounded side of the petals facing the top of the pen as you attach and roll them.









Slightly overlap the petals as you attach them and keep the tips of your petals even. Don’t roll the pieces all in one straight line. Instead, position the triangle pieces under each other, overlapping slightly, so they unfold like the petals of a flower.As you roll the triangle pieces onto the stem, crinkle them at the bottom with your fingers. Do this by using your thumb to push the bottoms of the petals to mush them so they are crinkled, once they are attached to the pen., Make two sepals, following the same steps you completed for the petals.








Cut two two to three inch squares of green duct tape.
As you did with the petals, fold over two of the corners of the pieces to make two triangles, with a strip of white sticky tape showing at the bottom.
Wrap the two pieces around the stem at the base of the flower, one of each side of the flower.

, Now that you have created a beautiful flower pen, make it more realistic by spraying floral perfume on the petals, or use your fingers to crinkle the petals slightly.









You can also make a bouquet of duct tape flower pens. Create more flower pens by following the same steps.

Cut four 12 inch (30.48 centimeters) pieces of duct tape and place them on a cutting mat.,
Stick two strips together, so that you have a set of 12 inch (30.48 centimeter) pieces of tape with no sticky sides showing.,
Take one strip and cut it in half to make the tails.,
Fold both strips in half lengthwise, so you end up with a bundle of two 1 by 6 inch (2.54 by 15.24 centimeters) strips.,
Cut a notch into one of the narrow ends of your bundle.,
Fold the un-cut, narrow end of each tail, accordion style.,
Tape the folds together.,
Fold the other strip into a ring, and secure it with a piece of tape.,
Fold the center of the ring accordion style.,
Secure the folds with a ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) piece of duct tape.,
Flip the bow over.,
Attach the tails.,
Fold the sticky ends of the center piece down to hold the bow together.,
Secure the center of the bow with two 1 by 3 inch (2.54 by 7.62 centimeters) pieces of tape.,
Slide a bobby pin into the back of the bow.,
Wear your bow.",How to Make a Duct Tape Hair Bow1," Try getting a cutting mat with a grid and ruler printed on it; you can these as a guideline. Keep the tape sticky-side-down on the cutting mat.








Use an craft knife with a sharp blade and a steel ruler to make straight cuts.
Cut four ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) pieces of duct tape. You will use these later.
Cut two 1 by 3 inch (2.54 by 7.62 centimeters) pieces of duct tape. You will use these later.;
, Take a strip and grip it tightly by both ends. Align the long, bottom edge with the long, bottom edge of another strip. Press the top strip down firmly onto the bottom strip.









One strip will make the bow loops. The other one will make the tails.

, Fold the strip in half, widthwise first, then cut along the fold with a pair of scissors. You should end up with two 2 by 6 inch (5.08 by 15.24 centimeters) pieces of duct tape.








, Line the strips up together, with the folded edges on the same side. You will be cutting both at the same time in the next step.








, Turn the bundle so the open edges are facing you, and the folded edges are face away from your. Cut a half-triangle shaped notch towards the fold. This way, when you open the strips, you'll have a triangle-shaped notch at the bottom of each one.








, Take a tail, and fold it in half, lengthwise. Bring the long sides down towards the fold and pinch them at the top; make sure that you are pinching the flat, un-cut end. It is okay if the rest of the tail is flat and not folded.









One side of the tail will have a single folded edge. The other side of the tail will have two folded edges. Pay attention to this.

, Flip tail over, so you have the single fold facing you, and the two double folds on the bottom. Cut a ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) piece of duct tape, and fold it over the top part of the tail. This will hold your folds together.









Repeat this step and the previous one for the other tail.
Consider using clothespins or paperclips to hold the accordion folds together while you work on the other steps.

, Take the other strip and fold it in half to create a crease. Do not cut it. Instead, unfold it, and bring each narrow end towards the crease. Take a ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) piece of duct tape, and tape the two narrow ends together so that you end up with a 2 by 6 inch (5.08 by 15.24 centimeters) duct tape ring.









This will create the loops of your bow.

, With the ring still flattened into a 2 by 6 inch (5.08 by 15.24 centimeters) rectangle, pinch it by the middle, so that it sort of looks like a bowtie. Fold the two top edges down towards the back/center fold. You will still have a bowtie shape, but the center will be folded accordion style.








, You may have noticed that your bowtie has two folds and a groove on one side, and one fold and two grooves on the other. Flip the bowtie over so that the side with the two folds and one groove is facing you. Fold the small, ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) piece of tape over the two folded bits in the center. Do not press the sticky ends of the small piece of tape down just yet.








, You will now have a bowtie shape, with a single fold in the center, flanked by two cut edges. You should also have the sticky ends of the little tape facing you.

, Take one of the tails by the accordion folded/taped part, with the single fold/taped part facing you. Slip the tail into the bottom of the bowtie, keeping it to one side of the sticky tape center. Secure the tail to the bowtie by taping it to the center fold of the bowtie with a small piece of tape.









Repeat this step with the other tail.
If you used clothespins or paperclips to hold the accordion folds together, make sure to take them off before taping the tails to the bowtie.

, Start with the bottom piece, closest to the tails. Once you have that side folded down, press down the top piece.








, Cut two 1 by 3 inch (2.54 by 7.62 centimeters) pieces of duct tape. Wrap one of the pieces around the center of the bow. When you are done, wrap the second piece around the center of the bow. Make sure that the seams are in the back of the bow.








, Pry open a bobby pin, and slide one of the prongs under the central piece of tape.







, The bobby pin may not be strong enough to hold a ponytail together, so you will need to secure your hair with a hair tie first. Once you have the style you want, slip the bobby pin into your hair, just above the hair tie.


Try putting your hair into a half-up, half-down ponytail first, then attach the hair bow.
Put your hair up into a high ponytail. Once it is secure, attach the hair bow.

, Flip over one of the pieces of tape, and press it down onto the other piece. Make sure that all edges are aligned. You should end up with a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) long piece of duct tape that is smooth on both sides.








, Bring the two long edges together, and press the piece of tape flat. If you want, you can run your fingernail down the fold to make a sharper crease.








, Take the two long edges, and bring them back down towards the center fold.









Use a clothespin or paperclip to help the accordion hold its shape while you do the next step.

, You will be using it to wrap around the center of your bow.

, If you placed a clothespin or paperclip around your accordion, take it off before wrapping the tape around the center.








, You may have noticed that your bow has two folds and a groove on one side, and one fold and two grooves on the other. Flip the bow over that that the side with the two folds and one groove is facing you. Pry open a bobby pin and slide the prong under the central piece of tape. The groove will help conceal the bobby pin.

Cut eight strips of foot-long tape.,
Fold each piece in half lengthwise.,
Place one strip of tape across another perpendicularly and staple them together.,
Make three of the ""plus signs"" overlap to form an asterisk.,
Fold the ends of the strips toward each other.,
Create a smaller flower with the remaining ""plus sign."",
Create the center of the bow.",How to Make a Duct Tape Flower," One foot is a good place to start -- the longer the tape, the bigger your flower will be. This length will create a flower that you can comfortably pin on your dress or bag. Each strip of tape should be the same length. Use a ruler to mark the place where you should cut along each strip of tape.;
, Fold each piece so that the sticky sides stick to each other. You'll have created eight pieces of tape that are half as wide but twice as thick.

, Make sure that you're really laying them across each other at their centers. Repeat this process four times. You should have created four ""plus sign"" shapes.


Set aside one of these ""plus signs"" for later -- in the meantime, work with the other three ""plus signs.""

, Just line them up so that their centers match up while the sides fan out at different angles. They should be evenly spaced apart. If you have a strong stapler, try stapling all of them together at their centers.

, Take the two ends of each strip and fold them toward each other until their edges touch. Then, staple this place to hold them together.

, To do this, just take the last ""plus sign"" shape and cut each of the four sides into thinner strips by cutting down the lengths of each side until the center, where they are connected. Then, do what you did to create the flowery effect with the other ""plus signs"". Just fold the ends of the thinner strip towards each other and staple them together where they meet. This will create a unique-looking shape that will add some variety to the original flower.


Staple this smaller flower to the center of the other flower.

, To make the bow stick together, you'll need to fold a strip of duct-tape into a square shape and cover the center of the bow with it. You can keep the extra square in shape by duct-taping it down, gluing it with craft glue or a hot glue gun, or even placing a colored tac in the center of the flower for additional reinforcement.


Once you've finished the flower, you can use a hot-glue gun to glue a pin with a flat surface onto the back so you can pin it to your dress, purse, or other accessories.

Enjoy your pouch!",How to Make a Duct Tape Pencil Pouch," You can make your pencil pouch whatever size you’d like, but using these instructions, your pouch will end up measuring 8”x5”.In order to make a Duct Tape pencil pouch, you will need the following things:


A cutting-board
One patterned roll of duct tape (duct tape comes in different colors and some with pattern designs)
One orange roll of duct tape
One green roll of duct tape
A pack of gallon-sized Ziploc bags
A ruler
A pair of scissors
An Xacto knife;
, You can do this by using your scissors to cut along the bottom and top of the zipper on your bag, so only the zipper remains. Make sure to do this slowly and carefully, so as not to cut into the zipper itself.









If you mess up, grab another bag and start again.
Leave 1” of baggie space on either side of your zipper. You will use this space to attach your zipper to your pouch.

, Spread out your patterned duct tape so you can measure it. Cut a piece of duct tape that is 9” long. Do this five more times so you have six strips of patterned duct tape, each measuring 9"".







, Using your scissors, trim the edges off your zipper on either side so you can pull your zipper apart. Place one half of the zipper face up on a solid surface, like a table. Lay one of your strips of patterned tape across the top of your zipper so they attach. Flip your tape and zipper over. Fold the extra tape over the zipper, like a hot dog bun.








When attaching your tape to your zipper, try to do so in a straight line.
Make sure when you’re attaching the zipper that you’re attaching the tape to the extra baggie and not the zipper itself. If you tape the actual zipper, the pouch will not be able to zip.

, Take your taped zipper. Flip it so the zipper side is face down. Lay another piece of patterned duct tape on top of the zipper tape, overlapping by 1”. Add your last piece of patterned tape below the first piece of tape, also overlapping by 1”.









Try to line up your pattern as much as possible, otherwise your pouch will look off.Repeat these steps. You still have another half of zipper left, so repeat the last two steps exactly the same to attach your zipper to your remaining three patterned tape strips. When you’ve finished, you should have two completed duct tape sheets, each attached to a zipper.

, Use them to line the back of one of your duct tape sheets. This will reinforce your pouch and make it stronger and sturdier. Lay your tape as close to the zipper as you can, without actually covering the zipper.If you cover the zipper, the pencil pouch will be unable to close.
If you have extra tape hanging off the bottom of your sheet, you can trim it off using your Xacto knife. Make sure to be incredibly careful while using this tool, as it is very sharp.Don’t trim too much, though. Your Duct Tape sheet should have a small amount of sticky tape at the bottom of the sheet. Make sure to leave this there, otherwise you will not be able to attach your sheets together.

, Use them to line the back of your other Duct Tape sheet. You should now have two Duct Tape sheets attached to zippers, lined by strips of solid Duct Tape.

, Set your Duct Tape sheet so the green lining faces up. Take your orange lined sheet, with the orange lining facing up and use the sticky bottom to connect it to the green sheet. Fold the pouch in half, making sure that the zipper lines up and can close.







, Unzip your pouch. Place the pouch lining side face up on a table. Using your ruler and Xacto knife, trim off the uneven edges. Repeat this on the other side of the pouch. When you finish, your pouch should measure 8” long.


Cut one 8” strip of patterned tape. Tape this strip to the bottom of your pouch, making sure to line up the pattern. Fold the tape over, like a hotdog bun. By doing this, you are reinforcing the bottom of your pouch and making it stronger.
Trim off any extra tape on either side.
Measure two 5” strips of patterned tape. Tape the strips on both sides of the pouch, laid vertically. Fold both pieces of tape like a hotdog over the edges of your pouch to reinforce the sides of your pouch., Your pouch is now complete. Fill it with pencils, pens and markers or use it as a makeup bag. However you choose to play with and enjoy your pouch, it should last for a long time and serve you well.


If you used non-patterned Duct Tape, decorate your pouch with stickers for a little added pizzazz. Or try adding a chunky button. Be creative and have fun with it!"

Gather your things, which are listed below.,
Stick one end of your duct tape to a chair, pull it out to your other chair and stick it there leaving about three to four inches hanging free so you'll be able to stick it to the dowel/stick.

,
Repeat step 2 with a second and third strip of duct tape spacing the strips of tape about 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart.

,
Take your first strip of duct tape and fold in half, sticky sides together (Hot Dog Style), matching the sides so they don't overlap.,

",How to Make a Duct Tape Bullwhip," You'll need to have two chairs (or something to string your tape between) spaced about ten feet apart. You can buy duct tape in many different colors. Basic gray is the cheapest, but you can get whatever you want.;
,,, This can be difficult and or very easy depending upon how nice you want it to look. If you want it to look nice, or are using dark colors, you should take it slow and make sure not to overlap. If you're using basic gray or white, it won't matter a whole lot as far as looks if you overlap, but it may be slightly sticky to the touch!

,,, Don't make them real loose (doesn't work as well), but don't make them real tight either (won't move as smoothly).

, Once you get towards the end of your rope, cut off about four to six inches of duct tape and wrap it around the end. Cut off any extra rope.

, Secure the handle by wrapping any color duct tape around the handle starting a couple inches off the handle and on the rope. Wind your way up the handle and back down if wanted.

,


To do this cut approximately eight inches of twine or whatever you chose to use.
Fold it in half and lay it on a flat surface.
Take the end of your bullwhip and lay it on the middle of it.
Bring the folded end up and feed your two ends through it (refer to picture).
Tighten it real tight so it won't fall off. You should tie it a couple times to just to make sure. The popper is very interesting because when you whip it and it ""pops"", it is moving beyond the speed of sound and creating a vacuum in space.

, You're done, so go outside wearing your protection (Below in Warnings) and practice. Wet the popper down before you use it as it makes it ""pop"" better. One method is to bring it forward and up and snap it back down. When you come back down you're using more wrist than arm.

, Seriously, this can be fun but like with everything, there are limitations.

",How to Make a Duct Tape Bow1," Duct tape is available in all sorts of colors and patterns, so choose some pretty, brightly colored ones to make your bow with. A good idea is to pick one color for the main part of your bow and another, contrasting color for the centerpiece.;
, Use a pair of sharp scissors to do this. The six inch pieces will make a pretty large bow, so if you'd prefer a smaller one, cut out two 3 inch (7.6 cm) pieces instead.

, Do this slowly and carefully to make sure the two pieces are exactly aligned. However, if you make a mistake, you can use your scissors to trim any extra bits off the edges. Try to make sure that there aren't any wrinkles and the bow will look better at the end!


At this point, you can feel free to decorate your strip of duct tape with any additional details, using markers or glitter pens.

, Fold the strip of duct tape three ways, going in opposite directions each time, as if you were making a fan.

, Pinch the middle of the folded duct tape between your fingers and wrap a thin strip (about 0.25 inches in width) of the other colored duct tape around the center, to secure. Make sure to keep your fingers out of the way or making a duct tape bow could turn into a sticky situation!

, Once you have made the bow, you can stick it to whatever you like. One easy idea is to stick a bobby pin through the back of the wrapped piece of tape. Now you have a beautiful, customized bow to wear whenever you want! Alternatively, you could try attaching the bow to a headband or pinning it to a schoolbag or handbag.

, Before you make the bow itself, it is a good idea to cut out a small strip of duct tape (about 0.25 inches, or about 0.64 centimeters, in width) for the centerpiece. This will make it easier to secure the bow later. Stick the strip of duct tape to the edge of a table where you can easily grab it.

, Taking the second roll of duct tape, cut out a piece 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length. Fold it neatly in half (lengthwise), sticky sides together, leaving just a small strip of adhesive exposed at the end.

, Take both ends of the strip of duct tape and curl them upwards, to form a circle. Stick the ends together, using the small strip of adhesive that you left exposed earlier. The duct tape should now form a circular shape, like a cuff.

, Flatten the circle of duct tape and pinch the edges together, in the center, to form a bow shape.

, Take the small strip of duct tape you cut out earlier and wrap it tightly around the center of the bow to secure.

The thickness will vary depending on the amount of pieces you use. Eight pieces will make a bulkier bracelet, while four pieces will give you a thinner look.If you're unsure this size will fit, wrap another piece of 8 inch duct tape around your wrist with the adhesive side facing out. Decide if you want to increase or decrease this size.;
, Put the 4 duct tape pieces on top of each other, with the sticky part facing upward. You are creating the thick bulk of the bracelet., Fold over one side of the duct tape lengthwise so that the sticky part folds into sticky part. Do this to create a skinnier bracelet, but if you prefer a wider bracelet, don’t create this fold.Cut out a strip of duct tape the same length as the bracelet, if you want to keep the bracelet wide. Apply the adhesive side of this strip to the other adhesive side of the bracelet.

, This will turn the duct tape pieces into the bracelet's shape. Use a piece of duct tape about 2 inches (around 5.1 centimeters) long attached over the opening to hold the ends together.

This could create an unique bracelet to include such items as letters to spell a name or word, tiny images, buttons, lace pieces, flat costume gems, or glitter., Measure one piece of duct tape long enough to fit your wrist. An easy way to measure is to wrap the non-sticky side around your wrist, leaving around an inch of space (2.5cm).

, Make sure you cut the length with a little overlap in case it’s too small. The length should be adequate to allow you to slip the bracelet on and off., Fold the length of the duct tape in half so the adhesive side sticks together.

, Using the same length as the first piece, cut off another strip of duct tape. Fold it lengthwise as you did in the previous step.

, Use double sided tape or a glue to stick the tape together. Use up any extra length at the end to ensure a perfect fit. Trim any edges.

Hoses;
, Don’t throw away a plastic item just because the plastic has cracked. As long as you don’t care about appearances, get some more life out of it by mending the split with duct tape. For a stronger patch job, apply one long strip along the split itself, and then cross that with shorter strips. This can help you get more use out of things like:Cans, bins, and other containers
Household tools like rakes and dustpans

, Replacing the siding to your house isn’t something you can always do immediately after it has been dinged, scratched, or punctured, so utilize duct tape as a temporary fix. Protect your home from insects and water damage. Cover the damaged area with duct tape until you can make a more lasting repair., Like vinyl siding, you may not be able to repair broken shingles or replace missing ones right away, but you also don’t want to leave your roof exposed in the meantime.

Simply tear off a strip and start folding it up until it equals the size and thickness of the remaining pads so that your furniture remains level. Trim off any excess if needed and use that to secure your new pad to the bottom of the leg, or tear off a new piece and do the same., For each pane of glass, cut off two strips that are long enough to reach from one corner to its opposite. Stick them directly to the glass, forming an X. Reduce the risk of injury due to glass shattering during storms, tornadoes, or other weather events with high winds.This won’t prevent your windows from breaking. However, it will reduce the chance of the glass shattering into lots of small pieces. This minimizes the number of shards you have to watch out for in case your windows blow in.

, If you have electrical or extension cords crossing your floor, deck, or patio (or anything similar that people could easily trip over), pull your tape’s loose end out, center it over the cord, and secure the tape to the floor on either side of the cord.

Repeat as needed until all the offending particles are removed. For large areas, speed things up by grabbing an empty paint roller and wrapping your tape around the actual roller with the sticky side facing out., Use a strip of duct tape to cover the leftover bits of price stickers and other adhesives left behind when you tried to tear them off new purchases or other items.

If you need to point someone in the direction you’ve gone, rip off one long strip and two shorts to form arrows. In either case, make sure you stick to tape to sturdy objects, like a tree trunk, rather than a leaf that might get torn off., Need to leave a note where someone’s sure to see it? Don’t waste materials by using both tape and paper. Use a marker to jot down your note directly onto the duct tape’s non-sticky side. Then simply affix it wherever it will stand out., Need to leave a message but don’t have a marker? Don’t worry! Just tear off lengths of duct tape and use each one as a line in a letter. For example, for the letter A, tear off two long strips for the diagonal lines and a short one for the horizontal line. Then stick them wherever someone will see it.This is particularly helpful if you need to spell out huge letters to be seen from a distance, like ""HELP!""

Done.",How to Make a Chevron Duct Tape Bracelet," If you want to alternate colors, choose two colors of duct tape that match nicely. Beginners may wish to work with just one color to start with, to gain confidence in the process.


One interesting look could be to mix one plain color duct tape with one patterned duct tape, in a matching or complementary color.;
, It's up to you how tightly or loosely you'd like to have the bracelet sit. Record the measurement and use it later to determine the length of the bracelet.


Do not make it so tight that you cannot slip it on and off; equally, not so loose that it slips off of its own accord.

, This part is time-consuming but once you get a ""process line"" going, it'll speed up as your skill improves.

, Cut the template out.

, For a decent-length bracelet, you'll need about 30 pieces.


If using two colors, make 15 squares in one color and 15 squares in the other color.
Work over a cutting mat, to protect the surface you're working on. A cutting mat is essential if you're using an X-Acto or craft knife to cut the squares with.

, Fold the piece into a ""house"" shape, turning down the two top corners to meet in the center on the sticky side. This leaves half of the square unfolded and still sticky, and the other half folded into two triangles, non-sticky.

, Align these in neat rows separate from one another, to avoid accidentally sticking them together. Once they're all created, you're ready to form the bracelet.

, This will prevent the tape from sticking on the work surface.


Wax paper will also work if you don't have a silicone sheet.

, Have the sticky side facing down on the silicone sheet.

, Line up the sides of the pieces so that they fit together exactly but leave a 1/4"" gap so that the second piece sits lower down than the first piece. This forms a staggered overlap that will open out when the bracelet is worn.


If alternating colors or designs, be sure to keep this pattern in place as you go.

, Once all of the pieces have been added, double check that it's the length you measured originally. If not, adjust as needed (adding or removing pieces).

, This will bring the sticky side to face upward. You will probably need to neaten the chain a little, as some pieces will move during turning over.

, Then fold the other side in to meet it. This will mostly cover the sticky side and holds the bracelet together.

, Cut a narrow strip of colored duct tape, about 1/4"" in width, the same length as the finished bracelet, plus a little extra. Remove the backing and carefully stick this down the center join you've just made on the flat side of the bracelet. Leave the additional overlap of this length untouched, sticking out at one end. Smooth down the tape. This will now cover the join area and helps to strengthen the bracelet for wearing.

, Cut it diagonally to be pointed in just the same way as the other pointy end.

, Insert the newly cut pointed end into the opening at the other end of the bracelet. Smooth down the remaining piece of inner duct tape length that covers the join.


If you are concerned that the join for the circle may not be strong enough, reinforce it with a small piece of tape wrapped around it. Use the same color as the chevron piece you're wrapping the duct tape around, and keep the wrap underneath the chevron, making it as neat as possible.

, You should now have a pretty chevron duct tape bracelet that opens out a little like scales when worn.


The bracelet slips on and off.

Wrap the petal around the straw or craft stick.,
Continue to lay the petals over each other.,
Rip off enough duct tape to cover the rest of the craft stick.",How to Make a Duct Tape Rose1," You’ll need duct tape and a ruler to make the petals of the rose. You’ll also need a craft stick or a straw, whichever you prefer, to make the stem. Using a craft stick will create a sturdier stem, but choose the items you have on hand. You’ll also need some scissors if you prefer to cut your tape instead of rip it.;
, It doesn't have to be exact, but it should be approximately the size mentioned. However, if you want all of your petals to be the same size, feel free to use a ruler to measure 2 inches (5 cm) of width and height. Then, rip or cut off the piece.

, But, do not extend it all the way to the opposite corner. Leave about a quarter of an inch of the sticky underside showing so that the border is framing each side. Again, it doesn’t have to be an exact measurement. An approximation is fine.</ref>www.thriftyfun.com/Making-a-Duct-Tape-Rose.html</ref>

, Match up the top left corner with the right corner so that they are flush with each other. None of the sticky underside should be showing. As with before, approximations are fine, and it is okay if the corners are not lined up perfectly.


This piece is the basis for the petal. Make 7 more petals to make a simple small rose. Make about 14 more if you want a bigger rose.

, Turn the petal so that the pointy end of the petal sticks up when it is wrapped around the stick. If need be, turn it on an angle to orient it like at an angle. If you continue in this fashion, it creates the appearance of a rose opening.

, Repeat steps 1-4 by wrapping the petals around the stick in the same direction as before. After wrapping all of the petals, you will see that they have formed into a rose. Bend the petals to make them fluff out as much as you want.

, Seven to 8 inches (17.78 cm - 20.32 cm) should be plenty. Then, place the top left corner of the tape on the bottom of the rose and start to wrap it diagonally around the craft stick. Wrap it all the way down the stem until the rest of the straw or craft stick is covered in duct tape.


To sturdy the rose, rip off a one inch (2.54 cm) section of duct tape, and wrap it vertically around the bottom of the rose and the top of the stick.

"
"
Gather your materials.,
Cut a piece of duct tape long enough to cover the stick, straw or pen.,
Tear a 2 inch (5.08 cm) piece of tape.,
Fold the left corner down so that it touches the midpoint of the square.,
Wrap the petal around the stem in a tight coil.,
Add a second row of a few more petals.,
Make a leaf in the stem color.",How to Make a Duct Tape Rose2," You will need duct tape in any color you want. Choose two colors of duct tape -- one for the rose and one for the stem -- if you wish. You’ll also need some wire or a drinking straw for the stem. But if you want the stem to be sturdier than a straw-based stem would be, opt for the wire. If you don’t have either item, use a pen for the stem instead. , Ten inches (25.4 cm) is a good size. Roll the tape lengthwise sticky-side up around the wire, straw or pen. If you are using a pen, just tape around the outside until everything except for the tip of the pen is completely covered.

, Again, it doesn’t need to be exact. Fold the top right corner down so that the point touches the midpoint of the square. Leave the sticky side of adhesive showing on the side and bottom. Then repeat with the other corner.

, (These are the classic first two steps in making a paper airplane.) The two folded down corners should look like a triangle, and below it there should be about 1/2 an inch (2.54 cm) of the adhesive side showing on the bottom.Make about 79 petals to make a really full rose.

, Place the first petal about 1/4 inch lower on the stem. The center should be lower on the stem than all the rest of the petals to create a look of realism. You’ll need about 4 or 5 petals to form the base of the rose.Wrap the first 4 to 5 petals around the base of the stem tightly to form the center of the rose. Make sure to keep them relatively close to the first petal. To achieve this, roll the first few petals around the stem to form a bud. Use the 1/2 and inch of adhesive on the bottom of the petal to secure it to the stem., But, this time spread the petals out more by not wrapping them as tightly. Continue to wrap the petals around the stem to form each layer of petals. Stop when you have reached your desired fullness.

, You’re going to make a leaf to hide the seam between the rose and the stem. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with duct tape the same color as the stem to make the leaf. Then, stick it under the rose to cover the place where the rose and stem meet. Make two leaves.!

"
"
Select the material that best suits your rose.,
Cut a long piece of wire to about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 cm).,
Tear off a piece of duct tape long enough to cover the stem.,
Cut a strip of duct tape about four inches (10.16 cm) long.,
Pinch the base of the leaf.,
Attach the leaves to the stem.,
Attach your rose petals to the stem in the methods mentioned in the earlier sections.,
Secure the rose on the stem with a small piece of tape under the stem.",How to Make a Duct Tape Rose3," Craft sticks are sturdier, but wires allow more flexibility in the stem and the leaves. If you are creating a heavier rose, such as in method two, you might want to opt for the craft stick. But if your rose is smaller with fewer petals, such as the “simple rose,” then the wire will do just fine.

, If you are using a craft stick, use the longest craft stick you can find. Or, tape two together. Put two sticks next to each other with about 2 cm (0.787 inches) overlapping. Then, put a small piece of duct tape less than two inches (5.08 cm) over it to secure it. You can cover the seam later.


To make it look more natural, cut one of the craft sticks to about 2 inches. Then, overlap them and tape them together in the method previously mentioned.

, So, if your wire is 10 inches, rip off at least that much. Placing the upper left corner of the tape at a diagonal wrap the duct tape around the wire.The seams should be diagonal as you wrap them around the stem.Use the same method for the craft stick. Rip off enough duct tape to cover your stem and wrap it.

, Fold it over on itself. Then, cut a leaf shape. The shape should be an oval shape with a point at the top and the bottom, which is a typical leaf form. If you need assistance, use a template online.

, When you do this, the sides of the leaf should curl and the point should fold over on itself. With a small piece of tape about an inch (2.54 cm) long and a centimeter (0.393 cm) wide, wrap tape vertically around the base of the leaf so that it remains curved like when you pinched it. This effect makes the leaf look more real.


Cut four more leaf shapes and fasten their bottoms with thin strips of duct tape as previously mentioned.

, Place a leaf with the folded part facing the stem of the rose against the wrapped wire or stick. Then wrap a skinny piece of tape about an inch (2.54 cm) long and a centimeter (0.393 cm) wide along the stem to secure it.


If you have used two craft sticks taped together, place a leaf over the seam where the two sticks overlap and secure it with a small piece of tape as previously mentioned.
If the sticks meet at the end of the stick, designate that end as the top of the rose stem near the flower.
Attach all the other leaves in a similar fashion.

, In other words, make your long stem first, then roll your first layer of petals on the stem. Allow the other layers to flare out slightly. Keep adding petals until you have reached your desired fullness.

, Using thin strips of duct tape approximately about an inch (2.54 cm) long and a centimeter (0.393 cm), attach the rose bud to the duct tape-covered stem. Make sure the strips are of the same color as the sepal -- the bottom part of the bud.

Line the inside of the bag with duct tape.,
Create the bag handle.,
Cut out the bag handle.,
Add lining to the top edges of your bag.,
Put your bag together.,
Seal the inside edges using duct tape.,
Close the bottom corners by stapling the bottom edges together ½” (1.3cm) from the edge.,
Turn the bag inside out so that the desired fabric is facing outward.,
Now you can use your bag!

",How to Make a “No Sew” Bag Using Duct Tape," Choose fabric that is fashionable and durable (steer clear of flimsier materials like silk). Purchase a few yards/1–2 meters (3.3–6.6 ft) or so of fabric.


Purchase a strong pair of sewing scissors. Because you will be cutting fabric with these scissors you will need a pair that will easily cut through the fabric you chose.





;
, The duct tape will serve as your “needle and thread”, plus it will act as the bag's liner. As such, while the typical industrial grey duct tape will suffice, consider purchasing a complementary color or design.

, Draw up a simple tote pattern, making it large enough for your needs. The simplest design is a large rectangle.


To check that the size is adequate for your needs, fold the fabric evenly in half. This will create the bottom and sides of your bag and you'll be able to assess that the fabric size is sufficient. Cut the rectangle shape out when you're satisfied.







, Make each square approximately 1” (2.5cm) high and 1.5” (3.8cm) wide. For a larger bag, increase the measurements. These will be folded over for a neat base finish later on.

, Turn the fabric over (if it has two sides) and then line the entire inner side of the piece of fabric with duct tape.


Start at the top of the fabric. Cut strips of duct tape that will be placed along the top. Be sure to overlap each strip of tape for full coverage.






Continue this process until the entire inside portion of the bag is covered with duct tape. Trim away any excess tape.







, Measure and design the handle to be placed at each end of the bag while it lies on a flat surface. You can use the design shown here, or vary it as desired. Draw the cutting pattern on each side of the bag.

Begin the bag handle approximately 1.5” (3.8cm) from the end. Mark the center of the tape on each end so you have an evenly distributed handle (and one that will match up once the bag has been created).






Draw a 2” (5cm) line on each side of the 1.5” (3.8cm) mark and 1” (2.5cm) down each side. You should essentially be drawing a box shape. Do this on each end of the duct tape bag.






Draw a horizontal line running across the middle of the box but don’t touch each end. Instead, create a triangle shape at the end of each side––inside the box you will see a long line through the middle with a triangle shape at each end. Do this for each bag handle (on each side of the duct tape fabric).







, You will be cutting along the line and triangle marking you made inside each box for the handle. You may need to start your cuts using a small knife or box cutter in the event you have trouble getting your scissors through the fabric.


Once these portions have been cut on each end, fold back the flaps you’ve created and secure with a piece of duct tape.







, This step isn’t completely necessary but provides a more finished look to your tote.

Turn the bag over so that the finished side (not the duct tape side) is facing up.






Lay a piece of duct tape over the top 1/2” (1.3cm) edge of the bag, fold over and tape down inside the bag.






Trim away any excess tape for a finished look.







, This is where you could sew it, but a sturdy stapler will do the trick instead.

Fold bag in half, duct tape side facing outward. This way, the staples will be hidden if you staple it from the inside.






Staple the sides of the bag, about ½” (1.3cm) away from the edges. Clip the corners on the top and continue on the other side.







, You will still have those ½” inch (1.3cm) pieces sticking out, so a more professional finish will be to tape down those edges.

Get a better angle on taping down the edges by slipping a large block, book or item inside bag.






Measure the edges and then pull the same amount of duct tape from your roll.






Lay the duct tape down on top of the edges, beginning on one end and smoothing down as you move down the side of the bag.







,


Fold the seam along the bottom of the bag and seal with duct tape. Trim and fold edges. Repeat on the other side.







, You can also get an idea of any additional trimming or duct tape sealants that might finish the look.

The constant rubbing and wiping you do to clean them can eventually cause scratching and warped grooves, which can even make a vinyl unplayable.  The best way to tell if your vinyl should be cleaned is by taking one finger and swiping it gently around the record one time. If you see any dust or debris on your finger tip then that means you probably have to clean it.;
, You will need glass cleaner, a couple microfiber rags, wood glue, and, of course, a dirty vinyl. One important thing to make note of when buying wood glue is to find a bottle with a good pouring tip and that it is free of urea-formaldehyde. This type of glue works best because it dries faster at room temperature than other types of glue, and it is much easier to remove.

, One or two sprays should be enough, putting too much on can flood the grooves on the record will cause it to dry much slower.

, Be sure to only go in one direction when wiping; it while cover the whole surface of the record, front and back.

, Do this on each side for about fifteen seconds. Then let the record sit on a soft surface to dry completely for ten minutes before the next step of the cleaning process.

,, Use a spoon or popsicle stick and mix the glue vigorously for about two minutes; this will help thin it out before applying it. However, if it still feels too thick you can apply a tablespoon of water and mix it to thin it out a little more. Once it has the viscosity of honey, it should be perfect to start using.

, Take the record and place it on a sheet of wax paper; this will prevent scratching during cleaning. Take your bottle of wood glue and shake it before finally squeezing it out. Then put the tip of the bottle and place it on the outermost groove of the vinyl. Slowly squeeze the bottle to apply a consistent stream of glue as you go along the groove from the outside all the way to the very middle.

, Let the record sit for four hours to ensure that the glue has dried completely.

, Test to see if it completely dry by tapping on it with a couple fingers. If it feels soft at all it is best to let it sit for at least another hour.


 Attempting to remove it before it dries can permanently damage the record. When it is finally dry you can move on to the final part of the cleaning process.

, Then go around over and over, carefully lifting the dry glue from the vinyl.  You want to make sure that you remove it all in one piece, if  you see it ripping just  slow down and be more careful. Once you have completely removed the glue, wipe it down one more time and repeat the last two steps on the other side of the vinyl.

Hammer in your first letter or shape.",How to Make Stamped Metal Jewelry1," Stamping letters and shapes into metal blanks for necklaces, earrings, and bracelets is the mainstay of making stamped metal jewelry. Although you will need to invest in some special items to get started, you will be able to use these items over and over again. Before you begin, you will need:Metal blanks in the material of your choice. Try starting out with aluminum, since it is cheaper than silver and copper.
A set of stamps. Opt for a set of lower case stamps in a font that you like.
A hammer. A hammer with flat edge and a ball peen on the other side is ideal for texturing metal. However, a plain household hammer will work just fine if you are just getting started.
A stamping surface. You can purchase a metal stamp pad at craft stores.
Masking tape.
Permanent markers or acrylic paint in the colors of your choice.
Rubbing alcohol.
Paper towels.;
, Decide which blank you want to use to create your design. Metal blanks come in lots of different sizes, shapes, and metal types. You can create basic circular tags or holiday themed shapes, like a snowman or Santa Claus.To help you decide, consider what you want to stamp onto the blank and what type of jewelry you will be using the blank to create.


For example, if you are planning to stamp a phrase onto the blank, then a larger blank will work best. If you are planning on stamping just a shape or initials onto a blank, then you can use a smaller size.

, Next, pull out the stamps that you will need to create your design and line them up in the order that you will need them. This can help to prevent typos and make it easier for you to complete the project quickly.If you are planning on stamping a phrase on the metal blank, then just pull the letter stamps for one word at a time.
Holding the stamps up against your blank may help you to decide which ones will work and which ones will not. Try positioning your stamps on the blanks to get an idea of how well they will fit and how you might arrange them

, Before you start hammering, it is a good idea to use masking tape to define the area where you want your stamps to go. Place your blank onto your metal surface and then apply a strip of masking tape going horizontally across the center. You can use this like the lines on a piece of paper as you stamp the metal.Some people also like to use a ruler and pencil to draw notches on the masking tape. This can help you to be even more precise when you are stamping the metal.
If you want your letters or symbols to appear in multiple lines, then start with the first line and then remove the tape after you have imprinted those letters/symbols. Then, apply tape for the second line and imprint the letters and/or symbols for that row.
You can also use the tape to secure the metal blank into place on your stamping surface. This will help to prevent it from slipping around as you hammer in the stamps.

, To imprint the metal with the stamps you have selected, you will need to place them onto your metal blank and hit the top of the stamp with the hammer three times. Make sure that your stamp is facing the right direction and properly aligned before you begin.


Hold the base of the stamp right up against the ridge of the tape with one hand and hit the top of the stamp with the hammer in your other hand.Give the stamp two or three good whacks with the hammer and no more. If you imprint the stamp too much, then it could warp or otherwise damage the metal blank. You may want to experiment with your first tag to see how the imprint looks depending on how many times you hit it. You may find that hitting it once is enough for some types of metal.
After you hammer in your first letter or shape, repeat the hammering process with the rest of the shapes.

"
"
Choose your permanent marker or acrylic paint colors.,
Color in the indented areas.,
Wipe away excess color with rubbing alcohol.",How to Make Stamped Metal Jewelry2," Adding color to the letters and shapes that you imprint in the metal will help them to stand out more. To add color to your letters and symbols, you will need to use a permanent marker, such as a sharpie, or acrylic paints.Choose the colors that you want to use before you begin.


Black works well for most designs, but you could also use red to emphasize a heart shape that you have imprinted, or go for red and green if you have created a Christmas design.
If you are using acrylic paint, then you will need a fine tipped brush as well.

, When you are ready to add color to the letters and symbols you have imprinted into the metal, trace the marker or paint brush along the indented parts of the metal. However, do not worry if you go outside of the lines.Make sure that the color is dark and that there are no unfilled spots.
Try not to use too much paint if you are using acrylic paint to fill in the indents. This may result in clumps of paint in the grooves of the metal, which may look sloppy. Start with a small amount of paint on the brush and add more as needed.

, After you finish coloring in the indented areas, apply some rubbing alcohol to a clean paper towel. Use just enough to make the paper towel damp. It should not be dripping. Then, wipe over the areas you just covered. This will remove the marker from the areas that are above the indentations.You may need to wipe the metal two or three times to get all of the excess permanent marker off. When you are done, the only place that marker should appear is in the indented areas of your metal tag.

Tape down your piece.,
Hammer it flat.,
Use a texturizing hammer.,
Complete your piece.",How to Make Stamped Metal Jewelry3," After you have added letters and symbols to your metal piece, you may decide to flatten out the shape a bit more or you may want to texturize it using a special hammer. Before you do either of these things, tape your metal piece to your stamping pad.


Use a couple of strips of masking tape to hold the metal in place.
If you need to see the edges of your piece, then you can also tape down just one edge, or you can use an object like a clothespin or pencil (eraser end) to hold the piece while you hammer it with your other hand., To flatten out a piece after you have finished adding letters and shapes, secure the piece in place and then hit the piece with the flat edge of a hammer. Start on one side and work around the piece until the shape looks how you want it to look.


Flattening a piece after it has been warped may test your patience, but try not to rush if you get frustrated or you may damage the metal.

, If you want to add texture to a metal tag after you have added letters and/or symbols, then you can use a special texturizing hammer to do this. If you have a ball peen hammer, then try using the ball peen to create a bumpy texture. A riveting hammer can also create some interesting texture.Even if you do not have a special hammer, you can use letter stamps to create texture in your metal. Try using X’s and O’s to texturize your piece, or experiment with other letters and shapes for texture.
Hit the metal with your hammer in different places and with different levels of force. Do this all over the metal to create a textured look.

, After you have finished designing your metal piece, you can add a necklace or bracelet chain, or attach it to an earring base to make it wearable. Use pliers and a jump ring or two to attach your piece to a chain or earring base.


If you blanks are not pre-punched, then you will need a metal punching tool to punch holes in them. You can find these in craft stores.Your piece is ready to wear, or to give someone as a unique gift.

Make sure that you are happy with the size of the bowl. The record bowl will end up roughly the same size.

, Make sure that the record is centered and that the label is facing upward. If your record has a label on each side, make sure that the side you like the best is facing up.If the record is dirty, clean it first.

, Again, make sure that the can is centered. The can will weigh the record down as it heats up, and help it conform to the shape of the bowl.If you don't have a can, fill a cloth bag with dried beans or rice, and use that instead.

, Place the baking sheet into the oven and let it bake. After about 3 to 5 minutes, the vinyl will start to soften and warp. Do not bake it longer than 10 minutes.Adjust the shape while the record is in the oven.

Slit severe wrinkles to redistribute the vinyl.,
Prioritize small pieces of vinyl for easier installation.,
Heat vinyl to loosen its glue and reposition it when necessary.,
Wash items with vinyl by hand.",How to Apply Vinyl to Curved Surfaces," Severely or irregularly curved surfaces will require greater care while applying the vinyl. Surfaces that are dirty may negatively impact the vinyl’s adhesive. Visualize the placement of your vinyl so you have a clear idea where it will go., If the surface is dirty, clean it with a suitable cleaning agent. For most surfaces, soap and warm water or an ammonia based cleaner, like most window cleaners, work well. Wipe the surface completely dry after cleaning, then mark the placement of your design with painter’s tape.You can substitute another weak adhesive tape, like masking tape, for painter’s tape. Weak adhesive tape will be easier to remove later and isn’t likely to leave behind an adhesive film.For a more precise outline, use a grease pencil to draw the placement of your design on the surface. Some surfaces may react negatively to grease pencils. Test pencils on an out of sight area first., In some cases, you may need to use a utility knife to cut the vinyl so only the design remains on the adhesive backing. Then cut excess vinyl backing from the design with scissors. Leave a small border of adhesive backing around the design.


If you’re applying vinyl lettering to an item, don’t forget to cut out the empty spaces, like the middle parts of the letters A and O.
It may be difficult to remove small pieces of vinyl from designs. In these situations, try to lift unneeded pieces of vinyl from their backing with the edge or tip of your utility knife., Cut a strip of transfer tape or contact paper so it is the same size as the vinyl backing. Peel the adhesive backing from the tape or paper. Starting from one side of the design, use your fingers to apply the tape or paper to the vinyl and its backing a little bit at a time.


Your tape or paper doesn’t have to be attached to the vinyl and its backing perfectly. Wrinkles and bubbles in the tape or paper shouldn’t transfer to the vinyl design.
To ensure the tape or paper is firmly attached to the vinyl, press the paper to the vinyl design with your nail using moderate force. You can similarly use a rigid edge to do this, like a credit card., Position your design in place on the surface. When it is in place, use a piece of painter’s tape to attach the vinyl to the surface from top to bottom across its middle. The edges of your design will likely stick out from the curved surface to the left and right of the tape.This step is not absolutely necessary, but the tape will hold the vinyl in place while you apply it, preventing it from being attached unevenly or on an angle.

, Remove the vinyl backing from one side of the design until you reach the tape. Cut away the unattached backing. Press the vinyl design into place on the surface. Remove the tape and repeat the process on the opposite side.When pressing your vinyl into place, do so a little bit at a time. Start from the edge closest to the tape and work your way to the outside of the design. This will prevent bubbling and wrinkles.
It may help to hold the vinyl lightly taut as you press it onto the surface. This can stretch the vinyl so it better covers severe curves in the surface., Even careful applications of vinyl sometimes have wrinkles or air bubbles. Use your nail or a rigid edged tool, like a credit card, to push wrinkles and bubbles out of the edges of the design.Some bubbles may resist your efforts at removal. In these situations, you may have to remove and reapply the vinyl, or you could pop the bubble with a pin and try to smooth it.

, Severe wrinkles won’t likely be affected by the nail/credit card technique. To correct this problem, make a small slit in the wrinkled vinyl. Pull the vinyl to remove the wrinkle and reattach it so the excess material overlaps the surrounding vinyl.


While overlapping vinyl may be obvious when closely inspected, it’ll likely be less obvious than the severe wrinkling., Generally, smaller designs attach most easily to surfaces. In some cases, you may be able to cut up larger designs into smaller pieces. These pieces can then be attached on the surface one at a time to complete the larger design., This technique is especially useful for stubborn wrinkling or bubbling around the edges of your design. Lightly heat the vinyl with a hairdryer or heat gun. Peel up the vinyl and pull it lightly to remove wrinkles, then press it back into place.


Some vinyl may be difficult to peel away even when heated. Use the tip or edge of your utility knife to carefully lift the design if necessary. Be careful not to damage the surface the vinyl is attached to., The heat and water pressure of dishwashers may harm vinyl designs and cause them to peel. Prevent this from happening by washing all items with vinyl with mild soap and warm water. Hand dry items with a dishtowel to prevent streaking before putting them away."

, The color is best matched to the table setting theme, such as oranges and reds for Thanksgiving or greens and blues for a woodland setting.

, This will help to make the walnut appear ""dipped"" into a color, while leaving the lovely natural walnut color and texture on top.


Paint half of the walnut, finishing at at an angle, to help make it look ""dipped"" into the color. Imperfection is part of its charm.

, Repeat for as many place card holders as you need for the event.

, There should be enough room for writing on the person's name and some extra space for the flag-tip end.

, At one end of the paper piece, cut a small V into the rectangle. This will make the place card appear flagged.

,, Avoid painting on the text; just paint near it, then stop.


This paint can match the color that the walnut has been painted, or it can be a contrasting color. Keep the colors within the theme of the table setting or party.

, Set the place cards aside to dry before attaching them to the color dipped walnut place holders.

,  Attach the place card to the walnut, using a dob of glue. Press firmly until you're sure it has stuck on without any risk of the card sliding down. Repeat for each place card being made.

, To make the flag portion of the card curved, run your fingers along the edges. This step is optional; it is only if you should want a ""waving flag"" appearance to the place card.

These washes contain body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in one mix. Pour 1 cup (0.24 L) of 3-in-1 body wash into a large plastic bowl.The more body wash you use, the more slime you will make.;
, Shaving cream will help to give the slime a good texture. You want to use a 1:1 ratio of shaving cream to body wash. So, for 1 cup (0.24 L) of 3-in-1 body wash, add 1 cup (0.24 L) of shaving cream to the bowl.If you choose to use more or less body wash, use the more or less shaving cream to keep the 1:1 ratio for consistent texture.

, Use a spoon or whisk to blend the ingredients together. Continue mixing until there is a smooth, consistent texture throughout the whole mixture. Once the ingredients are evenly mixed, you can finish making the slime., Add a tablespoon of salt to the mixture. The salt will help give the mixture a slimy consistency. You can change the consistency by adding more or less salt as needed., Use your spoon or whisk to stir in the salt. As you stir, you can add more salt if desired. Stir the mixture for 20-30 seconds or until it is evenly mixed., Place the slime in your freezer for 15 minutes. This thickens your slime. When you remove the slime from the freezer, it is ready to play with!"

Obtain or make silly putty.,
Buy iron oxide.,
Stretch out the putty.,
Put a face mask on and gloves on.,
Measure out some iron oxide shavings.,
Add the measured out iron oxide to the putty.,
Work the iron oxide into the putty.,
Test the magnetic nature of the putty.",How to Make Magnetic Putty," If you decide to buy putty instead of making your own, buy name brand Silly Putty or its off-brand equivalent. Silly Putty can be found at craft stores. Instructions for making silly putty are as follows:To make silly putty, you'll need Elmer's Glue-All Multipurpose Glue, Sta-Flo concentrated liquid starch, a measuring cup, a spoon, and a mixing bowl.
Pour the glue into a mixing bowl. The more glue, the more silly putty. Keep track of how much you put in. For example, if you've got a 4 ounce bottle of glue, maybe you'll want to put in half, giving you 2 ounces of glue in the bowl.
Use your measuring cup to measure out as much liquid starch as the amount of glue you used. Then pour that liquid starch into the bowl with the glue.
Use a spoon to mix and stir together the starch and glue in the bowl. Let it sit for 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes, take the putty out of the bowl. Knead the putty with your hands for 5 to 10 minutes to make sure there are no inconsistencies in the mix.;
, You can find iron oxide shavings at an art supply store., Use your hands to knead the putty until it's a little softer. Stretch it into a flat shape. You can also use a rolling pin to make it stretch further.Do this on a disposable surface, like newspaper or a paper plate.

, You don't want to be breathing any of the iron oxide. Also, pop on some rubber or latex gloves to save your hands from getting dirty from handling the iron oxide., Silly Putty often comes in 0.8 ounce containers. For this much putty, a tablespoon of iron oxide should do. More iron oxide will make it more magnetic, but too much will be hard to work into the putty. You can always add more later if you desire.As a rule of thumb, for every ounce of silly putty, a tablespoon of iron oxide should be used. So if you made your own silly putty and used 2 ounces of glue and 2 ounces of starch, you have 4 ounces of putty, so 4 tablespoons of iron oxide should be use.

, Pour a tablespoon of iron oxide shavings across the stretched out putty. The iron oxide should go onto the center of the putty., Fold the putty up and then flatten it out again. Keep kneading until it is black all throughout.Just keep squishing together the putty with the iron oxide in it. As you do, the iron oxide will become evenly spread throughout the putty. After the putty loses all its color due to the iron oxide, keep massaging and squishing the putty for 3-4 minutes.

, Be aware that normal magnets aren't likely to be strong enough. You might want to use rare earth magnets like neodymium to work with this putty.You can always add more iron oxide if the magnetic putty isn't reacting enough with magnets. Just sprinkle more iron oxide shavings into the putty and knead and squish it again.
The stronger the magnet, the better it will react with the magnetic putty, and the more iron oxide you put in the putty, the better it will react with magnets.

You can use any brand or fragrance that you prefer. Pour 1 cup (0.24 L) of body wash into a large bowl.You can color the slime by adding food coloring to the body wash., Cornstarch will help your slime to achieve a thick, viscous state. Start by adding cornstarch in a 1:1 ratio. You can add more if needed., The best way to mix the ingredients is to knead them with your hands. If you do not want to get your hands dirty, you can use a spoon to mix them. Mix until the slime has a steady consistency throughout., If your slime is too thick, you can use water to thin it. If you accidentally make the slime too thin, adding more cornstarch will thicken it. You can experiment with different ratios of cornstarch to water for different kinds of slime."

Use your hands to mix the ingredients until you achieve the consistency of honey. Using different amounts of water will change the consistency as needed.If you want to color the oobleck, add food coloring to the water before mixing it with the cornstarch.

, Once you have a good consistency, pour the oobleck from the bowl onto a flat surface. Observe how the oobleck behaves compared to other liquids. As you pour, it becomes a slimy and sticks to itself., Oobleck slime changes depending on the forces present. Try picking up the slime and hitting it. You’ll notice that applying force to the slime makes it harden."

Frame, but don’t cover.",How to Sugar Paint Snowflakes," To make paint with the fewest ingredients possible, simply use a 2 to 1 ratio of powdered sugar to water. Before mixing, boil the water so the sugar dissolves more easily. Then combine 2 parts sugar to 1 part hot water in a mixing bowl. Stir them together until they combine into a thick, grainy mix.The mixture should be on the thicker side so it doesn’t run. However, feel free to add either more sugar or water as desired to make the paint as thick or thin as you’d like it.;
, For a paint with a milkier complexion, start by combining 3 cups (360 g) of powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons of light corn syrup in a mixing bowl. Once combined, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk, plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and stir until the paint is evenly mixed.Again, the paint’s consistency is up to you. For a thicker consistency, use less milk and vanilla extract. For a thinner consistency, add more.

, If you’re content with all of your snowflakes being the same shade of white, go with it. To add more variety, however, consider spooning in some glitter to make your snowflakes sparkle. Also, think about creating a couple different batches of paint and adding drops of a different food coloring to each one.For instance, for a holiday-themed picture, you could use red, green, and white glitter and/or food coloring for Christmas, or blue and white for Hannukah.
For a more wintry picture, you could use white, silver, blue, and purple glitter and/or food coloring.

, Avoid thinner paper, since the paint might bleed through it before it dries. Depending on how thick your paint and snowflakes are, thin paper might also bend under the weight of it once hung up. To avoid this, paint your card on cardstock or thicker material like cardboard or foam board.Unless you used food coloring to create a very dark paint, choose black or similarly dark cardstock for contrast to make your white snowflakes pop out.

, Regardless of which recipe you used, all the ingredients are edible. So feel free to forego brushes and just finger-paint!The one exception would be if you included glitter in your paint and very young kids are joining in the project, but if everyone’s old enough to be trusted not to lick their fingers, then go for it!, Remember: no two snowflakes are alike. Make each of yours stand out from the rest by using variously sized fine brushes. Create individual snowflakes of different thicknesses. Then, to be even more ornate, use your thinnest brushes to create more delicate branches to each thicker snowflake., Instead of using brushes, fill a piping bag with your paint. Create your snowflakes by squeezing the paint out of the bag through an icing nozzle. Decorate your cardstock just as you would ice a cupcake or other pastry., Create a temporary snowflake by applying strips of painter’s tape directly to the cardstock, or use poster putty to stick paper cutouts of snowflakes to it instead. Then paint all of the exposed cardstock with a wide brush. Once you’re done, remove the tape or cutout before the paint dries them to the cardstock.Paper cutouts will need fine brushes to paint the cardstock through their lacy pattern.
Painter’s tape can be applied in whole strips or trimmed down into finer shapes.

, This may take a couple days. Find a suitable level surface to lay the cardstock where it won’t get in your way. Remember: the paint is made of sugar, which attracts pests, so cover your painting if possible.Placing it in a sealable plastic container will help keep the bugs out.

, Sugar paint is only temporary. Expect it to start cracking and flaking off after a couple weeks if left as is. To make them last longer, apply a layer of Mod Podge or similar product over the paint once it dries.This will also make it less appealing to pests.

, If you’re inclined to, frame your artwork with a picture mat. However, don’t use frames with glass or plastic covers. Sugar paint allows you to create snowflakes with depth, so your paint will be raised from the cardstock. Avoid squishing or cracking it with transparent material."

, Get all of the crumbs and other food particles out of the bag. Leaving them in will cause bumps and irregularities in the bag after it shrinks. Dry the bag with a paper towel to help remove leftover particles., Lay the chip bag between two sheets of parchment paper. If you want your chip bag to have a flatter, smoother look, place the second baking tray on top of the parchment paper, sandwiching the bag between the trays. For a wrinkled look, leave off the second tray., Place the tray in the preheated oven and allow to bake for 10 minutes. Check the bag every 2 minutes to gauge its progress and make sure the bag is not being damaged. After the ten minutes are complete, remove the tray and peel the parchment paper apart to reveal your tiny chip bag.


Take care when removing the tray and handling the bag. Both will be hot after their baking period.
The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape. The bags become easier to bend if they aren't fully shrunk.
A bag will shrink down to approximately 25% percent of its original size depending on whether you cook it for the fully suggested time, or a lower time.

Note that the aluminum lining the inside of most chip bags will cause sparks in the microwave. If you choose to use the microwave to shrink the bag, watch the bag very carefully., Set the microwave setting to “high” and allow the bag to cook for no more than 5 seconds. Keep your eyes on the bag at all times. The bag will likely spark, but should not ignite provided it does not ""cook"" for more than a few seconds. If the bag ignites into flames, turn off the microwave!, The chip bags will be very hot to the touch. Leave them in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes before handling them. You may also use oven gloves or tongs to remove the bag if you wish to cool them elsewhere.


Don't try shrinking multiple bags at a time in the microwave. This will increase the amount of time required to shrink each bag, which can lead to a greater risk of the bags igniting into flame.The bags will be small and hard, and generally difficult to shape.

, When you are done rolling the petals, many of them will probably be vertical; they should be horizontal. To make them look more rose-like, turn each disk/petal so that it is horizontal. Some disks/petals will need to be on top of each other.


There should be fewer petals towards the center, and more towards the outside.
The petals will also be closer together towards the center than the outside.

, You can give it to someone you care about, or stick it into a pretty vase.

Put on a puppet show.",How to Make a Puppet with an Empty Bottle and a Broom Stick," When choosing a puppet handle, consider how long you want it to be. If you want your puppet to be the same height as you, use the broom stick. If you’d like a short puppet, look for a stick outside or a ruler.;
, If you’ve picked a broom to be your puppet handle, you’ll need to remove the broom head. This can be done by simply twisting off the sweeping part of the broom.If you’re having trouble, ask an adult for help.


Remember, when you remove the broom head, twist left. If you can’t remember which direction to twist, simply think “righty tighty lefty loosey”., You’ll need to use a plastic bottle for the body of your puppet. Generally, a larger bottle is ideal. A bottle with a smaller opening will move around less on the handle. Some examples of good bottle choices for the puppet are soda bottles, shampoo bottles, or a milk carton.


Once you’ve chosen your bottle, make sure it will fit onto the broom by quickly inserting the handle into the bottle opening.

, When decorating, you want to start with a clean bottle. To clean the bottle, twist off the lid completely. Add a few drops of soap into the bottle and fill it half way with warm water. Recap the lid. Now shake that bottle until the soap is foamy and white.Once you’re satisfied with your shaking job, remove the lid and rinse the bottle until all the soap is out.


Before decorating, make sure the bottle is completely dried. This will help any decorations properly stick.

, To heat up the glue gun, first insert a stick of glue into the back. Sticks of glue and hot glue guns are inexpensive and are available at the dollar store. Wait until the glue is dripping hot before using., Put a face on your puppet to give it a lifelike look. Simply glue on googly or button eyes.If you want to add a nose or mouth, consider using sequins, stickers, or a row of buttons.

, If you want your puppet to have limbs, it can be done easily. Cut some string or yarn the length you want the arms or legs to be. Cut out a hand, foot, paw or fin in craft foam. Attach the string to the bottle using hot glue and allow it to dry. Now glue the arm onto the other end of the string., Want to give your puppet a funky hairdo? Lay a strip of paper down. The longer you want the hair to be, the wider your strip should be. Taking scissors, cut approximately ¾ of the way deep into the paper. Continue to cut small strips all the way down the length of the paper. Now, taking the uncut end of the paper, glue it onto the bottle.


Once your hair is cut, you can glue it two ways. Either glue the solid strip with the “hair” facing upwards and crazy, or glue the strip with the “hair” facing down, over the puppets eyes.Hair can also be made by gluing several strands of yarn or string to the head of the puppet.

, Using felt or craft foam, cut out a dress, shorts, a sweater, or any article of clothing. Mix and match by using felt for one article of clothing and foam for another. After you’ve cut the clothes out, you can add sequins or mini-buttons to help add to your puppet. Once ready, simply glue your clothing onto the bottom using the hot glue gun.


When using a glue gun, hold the nose against the bottle and gently squeeze the trigger. The nose is where the glue comes out. Wipe the nose of the glue gun onto the bottle and pull away.Now stick on your clothing.

, If you don’t want a human puppet, you can easily turn your puppet into an animal. Using foam, cut out a cat tail and ears, a lion’s mane, or an elephant trunk.Once you’ve decided, glue your animal accessories onto your puppet.

, Using a hot glue gun can be frustrating if done incorrectly. Once you glue a piece, do not glue another unless you are sure you can do it without moving the puppet. Trying to move a puppet with liquid glue will leave a big, ruined mess.Never touch hot glue. Don’t test to see if the glue is dry by touching it. Simply let it sit for approximately 30 minutes., Before you put your handle into the puppet, you want it to be completely dried. Otherwise, you could end up with decorations on the floor. Test your puppet by gently touching the decorations. If they don’t fall off, you’re likely okay to insert the handle.

, Start with your bottle’s opening facing down towards your feet. This will likely mean your puppet is upside down.

, Once your puppet is flipped upside down, simply insert your handle into the bottle’s opening. Be gentle, to avoid any decorations from falling off.

, Your puppet is now put together! Whether you've created a show or just want to let your puppet roam free, enjoy playing with it. Try giving it a fun voice and catchy name.


Make sure to play gently. Your puppet will easily fall off if turned upside down or if flung around forcefully.

Mix soap and water.,
Enhance your bubble solution.",How to Make Soap Bubbles for Your Children1," Bubbles can be made using any type of liquid soap you have around the house. Some soaps make bubbles that last longer than others, so experiment with different types until you find one you like. Simply mix one part liquid soap and 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl. Try these different types of soaps:


Liquid dish soap. This makes a great bubble base, and it's something you probably already have on hand.
Body wash or shampoo. These may not be quite as sudsy as liquid dish soap, but they should still work fine for making bubbles.
All natural laundry detergent. Stay away from commercially-produced detergent, which may not be safe for kids to use. Chemical-free laundry detergent can be found at health food stores.;
, There are a few tricks you can use to make your bubbles stronger and more interesting than typical bubbles. Experiment with these ingredients until you've created a solution your kids will love:


Add a little sugar, corn syrup, or starch to the mixture. This causes the bubbles to be a little thicker, which results in longer-lasting bubbles.
Add some food coloring. You can separate the solution into a few different containers and make different colored bubbles.
Add some fun decorative ingredients. Have your kids find out whether you can make bubbles with glitter, small flower petals, and other tiny ingredients. Which ones make the bubbles pop?

"
"
Assemble ingredients: soap, bowl, water, spoon, sugar and optional thickening ingredients.,
Pour dish washing liquid or baby shampoo into a bowl or cup and add water.,
Add a thickener such as glycerin, sugar, or corn syrup.,
Stir the solution ingredients gently and completely.

,
Take your bubble mix outside and blow as many bubbles as you'd like.",How to Make Bubble Solution1,";
, The necessary ratio will vary depending on your choice of soap and type of water you use. Use trial and error to see which formulation works best for you. Some sample formulations are listed below.

, Be careful though, as adding too much will make the suds too heavy for bubble formation.

,, Alternatively, be aware that storing the solution for one day can actually lead to better bubbles.

Make a little bubble wand.,
Make a giant bubble wand.",How to Make Soap Bubbles for Your Children2," The wands that you can purchase in the store are usually made from plastic, but any material with a hole in it can be used to blow bubbles. Look around the house for materials you can bend or shape into a bubble wand.


Bend the top section of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand.
If you have old egg-dying supplies lying around, you can use the circular egg dipper as a wand.
Bend a straw into a wand shape, and fasten the circular part with a piece of tape.

, Blowing lots of little bubbles is fun, but you can also make a large wand to blow giant bubbles. You'll need a large wand shape with a piece of mesh or screen to cover it; this helps stabilize the solution so the bubble can form without popping.


Straighten out a wire coat hanger. You may need a pair of pliers to untwist the top of the wire.
Bend one end of the wire into a large circle shape, then fasten the tip of the circle to the straight part of the wire by bending it with pliers.
Wrap mesh or wire netting, like chicken wire, around the circle. Use the pliers to bend it in place.

"
"
Blow little bubbles.,
Make giant bubbles.",How to Make Soap Bubbles for Your Children3," First go outside, since bubbles look most beautiful when the sun shines through their iridescent swirls. Dip the small bubble wand you made into the bubble solution. Hold the circular part of the wand close to your lips and gently blow. Watch as bubbles stream from the wand and float away, then burst.


If you're using bubbles with food coloring, be sure not to blow them inside, since they may stain furniture and carpets.
To make lots of tiny bubbles, get a good amount of solution on the wand and blow with extra force.

, Pour the bubble solution into a shallow tray. Lay the large bubble wand in the solution so that the netting is completely covered. Slowly lift the wand from the solution and check to make sure a membrane of swirling bubble solution is stretched across the blower. Gently wave the bubble maker through the air; a large bubble will form and separate from the wire.


Try running with the giant bubble blower to make a larger bubble.
Stand in a high spot, like at the top of your porch steps, and make a big bubble that floats gently to the ground. It will last longer this way.

If you don't have a ready-made ""bubble wand"", you can make a loop out of thin wire or pipe cleaner.,
Use a wire coat hanger to make make a very large bubble wand.",How to Make Bubble Solution3," Just twist a round end on your wire to blow the bubbles through. You can even make it heart-shaped, square or use other shapes if you're clever enough to bend it well.

, To make a bubble wand, just round the triangular loop out into a circle (not really necessary, but it looks better).


Shape the hook of the hanger into a handle.
Wrap with tape if desired.
Use pipe cleaners to help maintain the bubble film in the loop. Wrap the pipe cleaners around the wire loop. You'll want roughly one wrap of pipe cleaner per inch (2.5 cm) of loop wire. At the end of the pipe cleaner, fold about a quarter of an inch (6 mm) of the cleaner sharply into a hook using needle-nose pliers. Do the same to the next pipe cleaner, hook the hooks together and crimp with the pliers. Keep wrapping until the entire loop with a helix of pipe cleaners. Secure all ends by crimping together as before. The pipe cleaners form a reservoir which supplies plenty of bubble juice to the growing bubble. With a little practice, big, quivery, impressive, ten-inch-or-so (25 cm) bubbles will form.

Buy a package of water balloons.,
Fill your balloons with enough water to make small spheres.,
Tie the balloons.,
Leave the balloons in the fridge.,
Pop and peel off the balloon before using each ball.",How to Make Ice Balls1," This method is cheap, quick, and easy — perfect if you don't want to spend money on specialty molds for making ice balls. All you'll need is a few round water balloons (and, of course, water and a freezer.)


Remember that, if you're using your ice balls to cool your drinks, they'll need to be able to fit inside your glasses. Thus, when it comes to water balloons, generally, the smaller, the better.
;
, If you want color ice balls add two drops of food coloring when you do this. Grab a balloon, open the neck, and slide it over your faucet. Turn the water on at a low level so that it gradually fills the balloon. You want enough water so that you have a small globe that you can easily handle with one hand — this is probably a lot less than you'd use if you were going to have a water balloon fight.


Once again, you'll want to make sure that your ice balls are small enough to fit in whichever glass you plan to use. A good way to check this is to put your glass around the balloon as it fills. Keep in mind that water expands when it freezes, so you want to leave a little extra room on each side., When each balloon is full enough, remove it from the faucet and tie it off. Use tight knots — having a leaky balloon in your freezer can lead to an icy mess.

, Now comes the easy part — waiting. Simply leave your water balloons in the fridge until they are frozen all the way through. For the most round shapes, don't pack the balloons into a container — they will push against each other and create oblong-shaped pieces of ice. Instead, give each balloon its own space on a plastic tray or baking sheet so that none are touching.


Note that, even with this precaution, ice balls made using this method won't be perfectly round. Instead, they'll have one side that's a little flattened (the side of the balloon that it was resting on.)

, Once your ice balls are completely frozen, they're ready to use. Simply use a knife or a pair of scissors to cut the balloon off each one and drop the (mostly) spherical pieces of ice into your drink. Voila!

"
"
Buy bubble solution.,
Make basic bubble solution.,
Enhance your bubble solution.",How to Make Bubbles1," Toy stores, drug stores, and dollar stores carry bubble solution that usually comes in small plastic bottles with plastic bubble wands. Buying a ready-made kit is probably the quickest, easiest way to go from bored to bubble-blowing, and when you're finished you can screw the cap back on and put it aside until you want to blow bubbles again.






;
, If you have liquid soap and water, you can make bubble solution. Just mix up 1 part soap to 4 parts water in a jar, cup or bowl in preparation for bubble-blowing. There are a few things to keep in mind when you mix up a homemade solution:









Different soaps result in different types of bubbles. Experiment with dish soap, body soap, baby soap, and other soapy liquid washes.
If you dilute the soap too much with water, the bubbles will be thin, and may break almost as soon as you blow them.

, Once you have a basic bubble solution mixed up, you make it unique by adding ingredients that change the texture and color.









Adding a little sugar, corn syrup, corn starch, or glycerin can thicken the solution and result in stronger bubbles. Experiment with different amounts of sugar or starch to make bubbles that last a long time before they pop.
Add a bit of food coloring. Bubbles naturally take on a beautiful iridescent rainbow hue, but you can also customize them and make them your favorite color. Simply add a couple of drops of food coloring to the mix.
Experiment with other ingredients. Ever wondered if you could blow a bubble with something inside it? Try adding tiny flower petals, glitter, or other small materials to the mix to see what results you end up with.

"
"
Buy a set of molds.,
Fill the molds.,
Freeze the molds.",How to Make Ice Balls2," If you'd like perfectly-round ice balls or you simply don't want to deal with the hassle of filling and popping water balloons, investing in a good ice ball mold is your best bet. These are available in specialty stores and online for typically about $8-$20.Several types of molds are available, including:


Silicone molds: Made from flexible silicone material, which makes it easy to ""pop"" the frozen balls into drinks.
Screw-together molds: Made from hard plastic, but screw construction eliminates much of the danger of spillage.
Novelty molds: Usually designed to make the ice take the shape of a specific spherical object, like a baseball, the Death Star, etc.

, Regardless of the type of mold you're using, most work in the same way. Secure the top half of the mold to the bottom half, then position the small hole in the top half of the mold underneath a running faucet. Fill until the mold is full, then remove the mold from the water.


Some molds may come with caps for the filling hole — if this is so, secure the cap before freezing.

, Next, simply place your mold in the freezer and wait until the balls freeze all the way through. Depending on the size of the balls in your mold, this can take anywhere from one hour to six or so. When the balls are frozen, remove from the freezer, take the mold apart, and serve.


Be wary if you are using a silicone mold — some models may not be sturdy enough to retain their shape unless you put them on a flat surface.

"
"
Use insulated mugs to get clear ice balls.,
Add color.,
Freeze ingredients inside the ice balls.,
Make ice balls from liquids other than water.",How to Make Ice Balls3," Once you've frozen a few ice balls, you've probably noticed that the centers of these balls tend to be white and cloudy. However, it's possible to get crystal-clear ice balls if you have individual ball molds (not ""tray-style"" molds) and a freezer-proof cup or mug that's big enough for the ball mold to fit snugly in the rim. Use the following steps:


Fill the cup or mug to the brim. Set aside.
Fill your mold.
Keep a finger over the mold's fill hole. Turn the mold so that the hole points down and your finger is blocking the flow of water.
Put the cup in the sink (or somewhere else where you don't mind spilling water.) Slide the mold into the cup hole-down (keep your finger over the hole as long as possible as you slide it into the cup.) The extra water should flow over the sides of the cup. The hole in the mold should point down at an angle — not straight down.
Put the cup and mold into the freezer. If you have trouble removing the mold when the ice is frozen, run warm water over the outside of the cup where it meets the mold.

, Ice balls don't have to be white or clear. If you'd like to add a little color to your ice balls, consider putting a drop or two of food coloring in each ball and gently shaking the mold or balloon before putting it in the fridge. This won't effect the taste of the ice, but it can be great in terms of giving cocktails and other drinks eye-catching presentation.


If you're throwing a party, try putting out a serving bowl full of ice balls of many different colors. This way, guests can add whatever color they want to their drinks!

, To add flavor to your ice balls (and make a great conversation piece), try freezing different ingredients in each ice ball. As each ball melts (which, compared to ordinary ice cubes, will typically take some time), the flavor of the ingredient will leech into the drink. Here are just a few ideas to get you started:


Lime slices
Lemon slices
Mint leaves
Basil
Berries
Candy
For these ingredients, you'll want to make smaller ice balls than you normally would — ideally, just bigger than whatever you put in them. If you make full-sized ice balls, your fillings will sink to the bottom or float on the top, concentrating them all in one part of the ball.

, Giving your drinks an unexpected burst of flavor is as easy as simply making your ice balls something other than ice balls! Substituting fruit juices, soft drinks, and so on for water can allow you to make some interesting flavor combinations — just make sure that whatever you use compliments the taste of the actual drink.


If you're using flavored liqueurs, note that alcohol has a lower freezing point than water and a colder the temperature will be needed to freeze it. Hard liquor is very difficult to freeze with anything but a commercial freezer.

Buy a bubble wand.,
Make a small bubble wand.,
Make a giant bubble wand.",How to Make Bubbles2," If you buy bubble solution from the store, it's likely to come with a small plastic wand. Bubble wands are usually a few inches in length, with a handle on one side and a plastic circle with a hole on the other. The circle is dipped into bubble solution, and you blow through the hole to make bubbles.









You can also buy a giant bubble-blowing kit. These come with a big wand with a net that is capable of making very large bubbles.
You may also be able to find wands of different shapes and sizes, and other decorative wands, in toy stores and dollar stores.

, Bubble wands don't have to be made out of plastic. Most any material with a hole in it can be used to blow bubbles. Try using the following materials to make a wand:









Bend the top of a pipe cleaner into a circle shape, then bend the tip of the circle around the shaft of the pipe cleaner to create a wand shape. Experiment with different shapes for the blower part - make a heart, star, or square instead of a circle.
Use a wire dipper used for dying eggs.

Bend a straw to make a hole, then use tape to keep the hole in place.
Use the holes in a slotted spoon or other kitchen utensil.
For the sake of experimentation, try using an onion ring or a thick slice of an apple that has been cored.

, If you want to blow huge bubbles, your wand needs netting over the hole to stabilize the bubbles as they are created. Take the following steps to make your own big bubble wand:









Unbend a coat hanger to make it into one straight wire.
Bend one end of the wire into a circle shape.
Fasten the tip of the circle to the straight part of the wire with some pliers.
Wrap wire netting (chicken wire, for example) around the circle and use the pliers to secure it in place.

"
Find the right setting.,
Blow tiny bubbles.,
Make giant bubbles.,
Play bubble games.",How to Make Bubbles3," Bubbles look beautiful when the sun highlights their rainbow colors, so it's best to blow them outdoors. Blowing bubbles inside the house is usually not a good idea, since bursting bubbles make a mess that's difficult to clean, especially if they're made with sugar or food coloring. Plan to blow your bubbles in an open space, like your backyard or in a park.








, Whether you're using a store-bought bubble kit or you made your own solution and blower, the technique for blowing small bubbles is the same:









Dip the part of the wand containing a hole, whether it's a circle or another shape, in the bubble solution. You'll see a thin membrane of solution stretched over the hole.
Hold it up to your mouth and gently blow.
The membrane will form a bubble and detach from your wand to float away in the breeze. Blow faster to make lots of tiny bubbles. Blow slower to make bigger bubbles!

, Pour a few inches of bubble solution into a shallow tray. Lay your giant bubble wand in the solution, then gently lift it up. You should see a thin membrane of swirling bubble solution stretched across the wand. Gently wave the wand through the air so that the solution membrane begins to stretch out behind the wand. Eventually the membrane will form a giant, undulating bubble.









Try walking quickly or running with the wand to make an even bigger bubble.
Hold the wand high above your head so the bubble has more time to float around before it hits the ground and bursts.

, Invent some fun and imaginative games to play with your bubbles. Have a contest for who can blow the most bubbles, whose bubble is the biggest, who can pop the most bubbles, and whose bubbles last the longest."

Make your own unclogging mixture out of household supplies.,
Purchase liquid cleaners to unclog your pipes.,
Use a powder solution to clean your waste pipes.,
Be careful when using chemical substances.",How to Clear a Clogged Waste Pipe1," Using vinegar, baking soda, and water is an effective, eco-friendly method of unclogging your pipes. The baking soda and hot water will loosen up any build-up that’s clogging your waste pipe, and the chemical reaction from the vinegar will cause the sludge to move on down the drain.


Start by pouring a pot of boiling water down your drain.
After you do this, pour 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain and let it sit for 5 minutes.
Follow this with a solution of 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup very hot water. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
Pour one more pot of boiling water down the drain to flush away the scum that has been loosened up by the baking soda and vinegar.;
, One of the most common ways to clean out your waste pipes is to purchase liquid drain cleaner at your local convenience store. These chemical solutions are often very effective, but can sometimes cause damage to pipes if they are old or worn down.


Popular liquid drain cleaners include Drano, Liquid Plumr, and Rid-X.
The instructions for these products will be included on the bottle, but you will typically use an entire bottle to unclog stopped up pipes. The chemical solution will need to sit in place for awhile, but be sure to rinse it out with hot water before taking a bath or shower.

, Some people prefer to use powder based cleaners as opposed to liquid ones, as they are less corrosive on the pipes. Most of these powders contain the chemical Sodium Hydroxide, which works quickly to unclog drains. Because it works quickly, the product doesn't need to sit in the clogged drain for long periods of time to be effective.


Popular powder cleaners are Thrift and Drain Care.
When using these products, let hot water run through the pipes for 1-2 minutes before pouring the powder down the drain. Use roughly 2 cups of powder (more or less depending on the size of the drain), and let the powder sit for 2 minutes before rinsing with hot water., Chemical substances work by dissolving the scum, hair, and dirt that tends to clog drains and waste pipes. Because of this, these chemical products are usually extremely corrosive and may be harmful on older pipes. Take extreme caution when handling these products, as they can sometimes cause injury to your skin.


To be extra cautious, only handle these products while wearing rubber gloves.

Use a plunger.,
Use a drain snake.,
Make your own drain snake out of a wire hanger.",How to Clear a Clogged Waste Pipe2," Using a plunger is a great way to clear clogged waste pipes – from your bathtub, to your toilet, to your sink. Plungers have existed for ages, and many homes have a standard plunger hidden away in the bathroom or closet. They consist of a long, straight handle with a flexible rubber cup type mechanism attached at the bottom. The rubber section acts as a suction cup to dislodge any blockages and force air and water to flow through the pipes.If standing water isn't already present in your tub / sink, add 2 to 3 inches of water. As you use your plunger, the water will help force whatever is obstructing the pipe out of the way.
If there is a drain catcher or stopper, remove it.
Place the plunger cup over the drain hole, and work the plunger's handle up and down repeatedly. After 15 to 30 seconds, you should see the water beginning to drain. Repeat this process a few times if your pipes are still draining slowly. After you clear the clog, run water to wash away remains of the obstruction., If your plunger does not clear the blockage, try using a drain snake. A drain snake is a long, flexible piece of steel attached to a handle that is used to dislodge the buildup that clogs pipes. A piece called an auger is at the front end of a drain snake, this piece is usually shaped like a spiral. They can be purchased at most hardware shops.


Feed the snake down the drain, auger end first. As you insert the drain snake, twirl it around so that it can easily make it's way through the pipe. Once you've inserted the drain snake, slowly begin to pull it back it out. This technique should be able to break-up the debris that is causing the clogging. You may have to repeat this a couple of times to guarantee that your pipes are free of obstructions., This is a great method to use if you don't have a plumber or drain snake lying around at home. Almost everyone can find a wire hanger somewhere in their closet, and that's all you'll need to make your very own drain snake.


Disassemble a wire coat hanger by unwinding the looped end of the wire from around the hook part of the hanger. If the wire is extremely stiff, use pliers instead of your hands to unwind the wire. Straighten the hanger as much as possible, using the pliers if you need assistance.
Fold 1/4 inch of one end of your hanger onto itself to create a small hook. Use your pliers to fold and squeeze the hook into place.
Slowly push the hook end of the homemade snake into the pipe,twirling the snake as it travels downward. Once you've inserted it all the way, slowly pull out the snake. Repeat this until the clog has been removed.
Run hot water to rinse out remnants from the clog."
"
Locate the obstruction.,
Disconnect the P-trap of your pipe.,
Keep your waste pipes clear.",How to Clear a Clogged Waste Pipe3," Is it inside the waste pipe outlet from the bathtub, the toilet, or perhaps in the kitchen sink? Obstructed waste pipes are likely to be the result of build-up of soap scum, hair, oil, or kitchen waste. The P-trap (sometimes called the U-bend trap) is the part of the pipe that needs to be disconnected and cleaned.

, P-traps (U-bend traps) are found beneath the plug hole of sinks and baths, and are found in the tank of toilets. This waste tube traps debris, prevents deep clogs from forming in your plumbing system, and to stops foul smelling gases and odors from passing into your home.Place a bucket or large bowl under your P-trap to catch the excess water when you unscrew the pipe.
To remove a P-trap, use a wrench to unscrew the pipe’s retaining caps. Release the waste tube and pour out the water and debris. Then, flush out the P-trap with warm water to remove the remaining debris.
You can then use a wire or drain snake to push out any debris obstructing the actual pipe.
Replace the pipe and screw the caps back in place., Prevention is preferable to cure, so take care of your pipes to prevent them from clogging. If you make an effort to clean your drains every 1-2 weeks, they'll be less likely to form clogs.


Place strainers in all of your drains. These will stop debris (like hair, food, etc.) from entering your waste pipes.
Run a drain cleaner through your pipes every few weeks to prevent sludge from building up.
Run hot water through your garbage disposal after use to wash away excess debris.

Use a batch unit ionizer.,
Test the pH level of your drinking water using pH strips.,
Don’t expect great health benefits.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Ionize Water," The most common way for people to ionize water at home, is by using a water ionizing machine. These machines are attached to your main source of water, such as your kitchen tap. Depending on the model you have, you will be able to set the specific pH levels that you want the water to be.Electric water ionizers utilize small voltages of electricity to change the electrical charge of the water molecules.
Water ionizers tend to be expensive. They may cost between $1000 and $6000.If you have an ionizer that you attach to the tap, you will not need a plumber to install it.
Alternatively, if you have an ionizer that must be attached to the water mains, you may need a plumber if you don't have basic plumbing skills.;
, Bio-ceramic filters are made out of select materials--clay, stone, and others--in order to create a magnetic charge within the water. The manufacturers of these filters claim that they work to effectively alter the water’s electrical charge, and the water gains its magnetic charge from particles of magnetite and cobalt within the clay.


Some advocates for these filters claim they can have significant health benefits.There is, however, little scientific evidence to support claims that drinking alkaline water can have significant health benefits.If you use this method, be sure to check the pH of the water before you drink it.
Most filters come as inserts in jugs or other containers that you pour water into and then wait while it passes through the filter.

, One easy way to make a small amount of alkaline water, is just to add some pH drops to your water. There are a number of different brands available, but they are all marketed as ways to increase the pH level of water. This option is great if you only need a small amount of alkaline water to drink, but not for any other use (e.g., taking a shower).


Be careful with this method, and be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging carefully.
Depending on which brand you use, you may need to add 5 drops per litre of water, or ten drops per litre.
Do not exceed the recommend amount, and if you are on any medication speak to your doctor first., Magnetic devices have long been used to “soften” water as it travels through pipes, and potentially reduce the scaling effect of hard water. Although such devices have been in use for many decades, there is still considerable doubt about their efficacy.Some people now claim that such magnetic devices can be used to ionize water and increase its alkalinity.The argument is that by attaching magnetic ionizer devices to your water pipes, your water will have its charge restored as it passes through the pipe.
There is, however, a distinct lack of published evidence to support the idea that magnetic fields can bring about the ionization of water.You can attach easily attach the magnets to a pipe, often without any tools., Typical batch unit ionizers will ionize 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water at a time. You may choose to use a batch ionizer if you don't need to ionize all the water in your house, but want to ionize a larger amount than one glass at a time.With a batch unit ionizer, you will need to fill it with water from the tap, plug it in and turn it on.
Follow the instructions on your model, and wait while the water is ionized., Dip the pH strip into the water but do not swirl it around or stir the water. After about 5 seconds, remove the strip from the water and wait another 5 to 10 seconds. When the pH strip changes colour, compare it to the pH spectrum to determine the pH level of your water.


Generally tap water has a pH level of around 7. Anything below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline.Those who advocate the health benefits of alkaline water recommend a pH level of around 8.5 - 9.5., If you are hoping to improve your health and wellbeing by ionizing your water, it’s important that you spent some time scrutinizing the health claims. This is especially important if you are thinking of buying an expensive ionizing machine. Advocates of ionized water say the alkaline helps balance the acidity in other food and drink we consume, and claim that it can have marked impact on your focus and energy.


These are difficult things to quantify, however, and scientists say there is little evidence for the claims.
Your body has mechanisms to keep your pH level within a narrow range on its own.
Whatever pH level food or drink was at when it entered your body, it is 6.8 when it leaves.There has been scientific studies done in Korea and Japan that argue that alkaline water helps treat and prevent diseases., Some scientists have expressed concern about the lack of clinical evidence to support the claims about ionized water.If you are interested in ionizing water, talk to your doctor for some more advice. If you are on any medication, or you are pregnant, you should always talk to your doctor first."

Dawn and Joy brands work best, but feel free to experiment with other detergents.You can buy glycerin at craft stores or from a pharmacy.You can use light corn syrup instead of glycerin. ;
, Mix 2/3 cup dish soap, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, and 2-3 tablespoons of glycerin for a basic bubble solution. Stir the ingredients together gently, taking care not to create too much foam.It is best to keep your solution in a clean jar with a lid.If you are replacing the glycerin with corn syrup, you will need to adjust your ratios. Use 1/4 cup of light corn syrup for each tablespoon of glycerin.For best results, let the solution sit overnight., There are several different recipes for making bubble soap. The ratio of the ingredients will determine the strength of your bubbles.Soap helps the water to form a bubble by stabilizing the water molecules. Increasing the amount of soap in your solution may yield a stronger bubble. However, too much soap could cause the bubbles to collapse. Glycerin and corn syrup help create a ""skin"" for the bubbles, helping them last longer., Pinch the middle of the pipe cleaner and start bending one end of it into a circle. Wrap the end of the bent part of the pipe cleaner around the straight part to secure the circle.You can also bend your pipe cleaners into various shapes. While your bubbles will always turn into a sphere, the shapes are a good way to personalize your wand.You can use the same method to make a wand from a plastic coated wire hanger. You may have to use wire cutters to cut the hanger to a manageable size., You can make a bubble wand from anything with enough space in it to hold your bubble solution. Try reusing old containers for various sized bubbles.Use the empty rings from a 6-pack of soda to make six bubbles at once. Just dip the rings in your bubble container and pull them through the air.Look for old containers with plastic lids. Cut the centers out of the lids and tack them onto a handle for a makeshift wand.Cookie cutters can also double as bubble wands., You can make bubble wands in the shape of cubes, pyramids, or whatever 3D shape you can imagine. Use clay and toothpicks to make your shapes.Use toothpicks to form the straight edges of your shape, and clay to form the angles. Dip your 3D shape into the bubble solution and pull it through the air to see some interesting bubble shapes., For larger bubbles you will need a different formula and a few other ingredients. Large bubble solutions generally call for corn starch and baking powder in addition to the soap and water.Some solutions call for personal lubricants, such as KY Jelly, to give the bubbles more elasticity. You can use glycerin in place of the lubricant, but your bubbles may not be as large., Mix together 12 cups of water, 1 cup of liquid dish soap, such as Joy or Dawn, 1 cup of cornstarch, and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of baking powder. Stir the mixture gently. Don't shake it, as this will cause foaming and ruin the mix.Let the mixture sit for one hour, uncovered. You may need to stir it every now and then to make sure the cornstarch is completely dissolved.Mix 2.5 to 3 oz of personal lubricant in 1 cup of warm water. Dissolve the lubricant completely and add it to your bubble mix.You may find a layer of cornstarch at the bottom of your mixture, even after you have made some bubbles. This settling is natural, and shouldn't affect your bubbles., You can make your own wand for creating large bubbles, or you can use a hula hoop. To make your own, get two drinking straws, and about 3 feet of yarn.Thread the yarn through both drinking straws and tie the two ends together. Pull the straws apart until you have a ""hoop"" with the straws acting as handles.You can also use a wire hanger to make a giant bubble wand. Simply unfold the wire hanger and bend it into a loop., Pour your bubble solution into a container that is easy to reach into, such as a small bucket or plastic bin. Dip your wand into the bubble solution and hold it there for a few seconds. Lift the wand out and start walking backwards slowly to make large bubbles.Keep your arms high, and make sure you can see a film of bubble solution in your wand. Let the air move through your wand to create the bubbles."

Mix some solution.,
Find a wand.,
Dip the wand into the bubbles solution.,
Lift the wand to your lips and gently blow into the circle of the wand.",How to Blow Bubbles1," If you've already bought a bottle of bubbles solution, you're ready to start. If you don't have any on hand, it is easily make your own using a few household supplies. First, use any kind of liquid soap as your base. Add cornstarch to make the bubbles strong. Mix the following ingredients in a bottle:


1/4 cup dish soap
1 cup water
1 teaspoon cornstarch;
, Store-bought solution comes with a wand, but if you make your own bubbles solution you will need to make a wand. Here's a chance to get creative. A wand can be fashioned from any item that has a hole to blow through. Look for one of the following items you can easily make into a wand:


A wire dipper for dying eggs. These come in egg dying kits used during Easter. This little wire contraption has a hole and a handle, making it the perfect wand for blowing bubbles.
A pipe cleaner. Just bend one tip of the pipe cleaner into a circle shape and wrap it around the stem of the pipe cleaner.
A plastic straw. Bend the end of the straw into a circle and tape it to the stem of the straw.
A slotted spoon. You can dip the spoon in the bubbles solution and blow a lot of tiny bubbles at once.
Any other item that can be bent into a circular shape. If it has a hole, you can blow a bubble through it!

, The solution should stretch over the hole to form a thin film. If you look closely you'll be able to see swirls of colorful soap in the film. The film should be thick enough to stay in place without breaking while you hold the wand steady for several seconds.


If the bubbles solution breaks as soon as you lift the wand from the bottle, add a little more cornstarch to make it thicker. Or you could try adding an egg white.

, A soft, gentle stream of breath will cause the soap film to bend outward until it forms a bubble. You've just created a bubble! Experiment with different ways of blowing to see how the force of your breath affects the creation of bubbles.


If you continue blowing past the first bubble, you might find that there's enough solution left on the wand to create a stream of bubbles.. Keep blowing until bubbles stop flowing through the wand.
Try making a bigger bubble. Very slowly, blow a steady stream of air through the wand.

"
Make an extra strong solution.,
Make a giant bubble wand.,
Pour the solution into a shallow pan.,
Dip the wand and trail it through the air.",How to Blow Bubbles2," Gigantic bubbles have to be strong so that they don't pop. The bubbles solution needs a little extra cornstarch or additional egg white. Mix a large batch of bubbles solution with the following ingredients:


1 cup liquid soap
4 cups water
1/2 cup cornstarch

, In order to create giant bubbles, you'll need a big wand with netting over the opening. This lets the bubble grow large without popping. You can find giant bubble wands in a store, or you can make your own, by following these steps:


Bend a wire coat hanger to form a large circle.






Cover the hole with wire netting, like chicken wire. Using a pair of pliers, bend the netting into place.






You can also use mesh fabric or a piece of netting. Make sure the ends are securely fastened to the wire hole.







, The big wand won't fit into a bottle, so pour the solution into a large, shallow pan. You can use a cookie sheet with high sides or any other shallow dish.

, Lay the wand into the solution so that the hole and netting get completely submerged. Lift the wand slowly and let it trail through the air. You should see a giant, undulating bubble emerge from the wand. Help it separate by continuing to move the wand until the bubble pulls away.


Blowing giant bubbles may take practice. Large bubbles tend to pop more readily than smaller bubbles. Don't give up!
Experiment with putting small objects in the bubbles. Try putting litter, tiny flower petals or another light, small object in the solution and see if you can make it float inside the bubble.

Grab some gum.,
Start chewing.,
Flatten the gum against the top of your mouth.,
Lower the flattened gum to the front of your mouth.,
Push into the gum with your tongue.,
Blow!,
Use baby oil or peanut butter for clean-up.",How to Blow a Bubble With Gum1," You can use almost any kind of chewing gum or bubble gum to blow bubbles with as long as you have enough of it! Pick a flavor that you like, and if the pieces seem especially small (like for many ""tooth-healthy"" brands of gum like Trident), take an extra piece or two so you have enough to work with.


Though almost any gum will work, if you're going for the best bubbles, stiff, chewy, low-sugar gums (like Bazooka) work best.;
, It can be pretty tough to blow bubbles with ""fresh"" gum that you've just started chewing, so be patient. Chew the gum for long enough so that it becomes soft, moist, and very stretchy. There should be just a little flavor left at this point.









For many types of gum, you won't want to chew for too long, or the gum can get hard and won't stretch as well. This time varies from gum to gum, so be willing to experiment to find the perfect chewing time for you.

, Use your tongue to move the ball of chewed-up gum to the center of your mouth. Next, make it flat between the top of your mouth and your tongue. Your goal is to make a small, flat ""disc"" — this will be what you blow into to make your bubble!

, Move the gum to the space just behind your front teeth — where the tip of your tongue would normally sit. Pull in your jaw to hold the flat gum in place. If you need to, press gently into the back of the gum with your tongue to support it.

, Next, you need to make a small ""pocket"" in the gum to blow into. With the disc of flattened gum at the front of your mouth, open your mouth very slightly and stick your tongue about half an inch into the gum. Your goal is to make a slight indentation in the gum. However, you want there to be enough gum remaining in the disc that it won't stretch and pop when you start blowing. The ""pocket"" can need a little adjusting, so feel free to try a couple of times until you find a good position.









For best results, keep your lips together when you open your mouth slightly. This prevents you from accidentally pushing the gum out of your mouth when you're getting the hang of this motion the first couple of times.

, You're all ready to make bubbles! Open your lips and use slow, steady air to blow into the pocket you've made in the gum. Don't go too slow or too fast — if you blow too slowly, the bubble can collapse, but if you blow too quickly, it can pop! Keep your eyes on the bubble as you blow it. The thinner and more transparent it looks, the closer it is to popping. To bring the gum back into your mouth, open your lips wide and use your tongue to pull the gum in.









This can take some time to learn, so be ready to practice! If you can't get it at first, try again and again! Before long, you should be blowing good-sized bubbles consistently.

, Blowing bubbles can be great fun, but getting thick, sticky bubble gum out of your hair or off of your skin can be a huge pain. Sooner or later, almost everyone who blows bubble gets some gum stuck on their face or hair. To get it out, try soaking a cotton swab in baby oil and wiping it on the affected spot. The oil should undo the stickiness of the gum, making it much easier to peel off.Another good trick that works extra-well for gum in your hair is to work peanut butter into the gum, then shampoo it out. This usually removes the majority of the gum, though you may need to repeat several times to get all of it.

"
"
Use the right gum.,
Use slow, even blowing.,
Use your hands to support huge bubbles.,
Practice!",How to Blow a Bubble With Gum2," If you're going for the biggest bubbles, the gum you start with matters. You'll definitely want to use ""stiffer"", less sugary gum than you might normally chew. Bazooka gum is great for this — it's a little harder at first than the average bubble gum, but its rubbery texture makes for great bubbles. Sweeter, softer brands of gum contain lots of sugar and additives, which may taste great, but make for a softer, more fragile bubble.


You also may want to use more gum than normal. Try chewing two or even three pieces at once to make sure you have plenty of material handy for you bubble.

, Start by chewing your gum and flattening against the top of your mouth as you normally would. When you start blowing, it's extra-important to keep a slow, even pace. The bigger your bubble gets, the more fragile it will get, so you'll need to hit that ""sweet spot"" between too fast and too slow to keep it inflated.









If you're really serious about blowing bubbles, you might want to learn a technique used by musicians of wind instruments called circular breathing. With this technique, you blow until you're almost of air, use your last bit of air to fill your cheeks, then push the air out with your cheeks as you breathe in through your nose.When done correctly, this allows you to blow more or less without ever stopping to inhale.

, As you get better and better at blowing large bubbles, you'll eventually get to the point where the bubble starts to touch your chest. Because bubble gum can be especially hard to get out of clothing, you'll want to avoid this, so use the tips of your fingers to ever-so-carefully keep the growing bubble away from your body. Be gentle! The bubble will probably be quite fragile at this point, so a delicate touch is needed.


If you do get gum on your clothing, don't worry! You can get gum off of clothing by freezing it or rubbing it with a bag of ice cubes until it hardens, then scraping it off with a knife or your fingernails. Alternatively, you can try applying white vinegar directly to the gum to soften it up. This works well when the gum has already been worked into the fibers of the clothing., Huge bubbles aren't the sort of thing you'll be able to get overnight. The world's biggest bubble-blowers take years to get their skills to the point where they're recognized for their talent. The best way to get good at blowing huge bubbles is to try to do it, so go buy yourself a pack of gum today!









Don't give up! With lots of practice, you can become a champion bubble gum blower. The current Guinness World Record for the largest bubble gum bubble ever blown (without using hands) currently stands at 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) in diameter."

Make a loud ""gunshot"" pop.,
Blow two bubbles side-by-side.,
Make a bubble around a small object.,
Make a bubble within a bubble.",How to Blow a Bubble With Gum3," This trick is great if you're trying to scare your friends or just be a nuisance in general! To make a loud pop, start by blowing a bubble as you normally would. Don't inflate it until it pops — this won't make a very loud noise and can leave you with sticky gum all over your face. Instead, pull the bubble into your mouth, raise your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and use a sharp motion to bring your tongue downward (similar to how you'd use your tongue to make a ""tsk, tsk"" noise). The bubble should pop with a loud ""crack"", getting you plenty of attention from the people around you.








, When you master one bubble, try two! Chew two pieces of gum, keeping them separate from each other in your mouth. Use one piece of gum to blow a bubble as you normally would, then use your lips to ""close"" the end of the bubble. Carefully use your lips to move this bubble to the side of your mouth, then move the other piece of chewed gum to the front of your mouth and blow a bubble with this piece. With luck, when you're done, you should have two separate bubbles next to each other.


For an extra trick, try joining the bottoms of the bubbles together in your mouth and carefully pulling the joined bubbles out. They should look something like a heart — perfect for Valentine's day, as long as your S.O. is open-minded!

, Put a small, light object in your mouth (like a piece of hard candy, for instance) and keep it separate from the gum as you chew it. As you start to blow your bubble, use your tongue to maneuver the object through the hole in your lips and into the bubble. Close the bubble by bringing your lips together and use your hands to remove it from your mouth. Present your gift to a friend or spectator and watch their reaction!

, This is the hardest trick of all, but, when pulled off correctly, it's absolutely amazing. Chew two pieces of gum in your mouth, keeping them separate. Begin to blow a bubble with one of the pieces. Get the bubble fairly big — the more space you have to work with, the better. Next, maneuver the second piece of gum in your mouth in front of the hole in your lips and start to to blow. This is very tricky, but if you pull it off correctly, you should see a second bubble growing inside the first one!


If, after plenty of practice, you become an expert bubble-blower, try challenging yourself by blowing a third bubble inside the second one. It's very tricky, but possible!

Draw the shape of the wing.,
Cut the wings out.,
Build the wings.",How to Make Paper Fairy Wings1," Using any kind of paper, draw the shape of your wings. Use two pieces of paper with each wing on a different sheet. Make sure each wing is exactly the same shape and size.


If you want double layered wings, draw the same wing shape out twice, but with one bigger than the other.
For 3D wings, cut multiple layers of wings is descending sizes.
You can also make the wings out of cardboard for sturdier wings.;
, Use a pair of scissors to cut the wings out. Try to cut the edges as smooth as possible. Follow the lines so your wings stay the same size and shape.


If you drew on white paper, color the wings. You can color them before or after you cut them out. Cutting them after you color may make it easier since you can color over the lines and then cut off the excess.
Be creative with the way you draw or decorate them. Draw veins along the wings, glue flowers, or tape sequins to them.
Try covering the paper with glitter, gold or silver paint, or gold trim.If you drew them on cardboard, try painting the cardboard. Just make sure to let the paint dry before building the wings.

, Tape the wings together in the center. On the back of each wing, place straws. The straw acts as the support for your paper wings so they keep their shape and don't tear. Try to have at least 3 straws on each wing. There should be one at the top, one at the bottom, and one at the bottom. Use bendy straws so that you can shape them to your wing.


If your wings have points, each straw should run from the center of the wings towards the points. If your wings are rounded, place straws on the top, bottom, and middle.
If you want 3D wings, tape the layers of wings together. You can leave just the wingtips untaped, or more of the wing to give it a fluttering look. Place the straws on the back of the bottom wing.

Gather the materials you will need.,
Combine the glitter and powder in a bowl.,
Put the fairy dust into a small bottle or container.,
Give the fairy dust to your child.",How to Make Fairy Dust1," Making fairy dust to sprinkle outside simply requires glitter, in any colors you like, and a non-toxic powder.The powder you use can vary. You can use talcum powder, sidewalk chalk, which you will need to grind into a powder, or salt.You may also want to get a fun container, such as a small decorative bottle, to hold the fairy dust. Whatever you use to hold the fairy dust, it's a good idea to use something with a sturdy lid.
The amounts of glitter and powder you will need varies depending on how much fairy dust you want to make but the ratio of glitter of talcum powder should be 2 to 1.
Any glitter will work for this method but buying super fine glitter will make the best fairy dust.;
, Mix the two together until they are completely combined.

, Be sure to close the container securely, so that the fairy dust doesn't get accidentally spilled in your house.


You may need to use a funnel to get the fairy dust into a container, depending on how small the opening is. If you don't have one, simply roll up a small piece of paper into a funnel shape and use a piece of tape to keep it in that shape. Cut the bottom of the funnel shape with a pair of scissors, making sure that the bottom of the funnel will fit into the container you want to put the fairy dust in.

, Make sure that they play with it outside, as throwing this fairy dust inside will make a horrible mess. Most kids will enjoy simply throwing small handfuls into the air and watching the sparkles fly through the air!


Do not let your child eat this fairy dust. It is not edible and could cause problems they ingest it.

Cut out the wings.,
Place the wire on the wing.,
Connect the wires to the paper.,
Finish the wings.",How to Make Paper Fairy Wings2," Draw the shape of your wings on colored paper, tissue paper, or white paper. Each wing should be on a different sheet of paper. Make sure to use a sheet of paper that will be large enough for the wing size you want. Use scissors to cut out the paper.


Use any wing shape you desire. You can have rounded tips or pointed tips. They can be large like angel wings or narrow like dragonfly wings. This is up to your imagination.

, Using gauge wire (or any kind of other thin wire), outline the wings. Place wire along the top of the wing, the bottom of the wing, and along any veins you want in the wings.


The wire should extend beyond the edge of the wings. Tape the wire down to hold it in place.
Bend the wire so that it follows the contours of the wings.

, There are a couple of ways you can connect the wires to the paper. Cover the wires with tape to keep them in place. An alternate way to adhere the wires is to use Fimo gel.


Fimo gel is a craft adhesive. Squirt it onto the wings so it seeps beneath the wire, or use a sponge brush to dab under it. Just don't lift the wires. Try to get the Fimo gel under the wires. Start with the outer wires and set that. Then, spread it over all of the wing.
Use an embossing gun to set the gel. Fimo gel has to use heat to harden. Usually, Fimo gel is put into the oven, like when it's used with polymer clay. Since you can't put paper in the oven, use an embossing gun instead., After the wings cool, take needle nose pliers and twist any separated wires together near the base. Use wire cutters to cut the end of the wires that extend beyond the paper.


Add any embellishment to the wings. You can use glitter, paint, flowers, beads, or anything else to decorate the wings.

Bend the hangers into wings.,
Connect the wings together.,
Cover with paper.,
Decorate the wings.,
Make a harness.",How to Make Paper Fairy Wings3," Take two wire hangers and undo them. Straighten the hanger into a straight line. Then, bend the hangers into the shape of your wings.Make sure to leave enough wire at the base of the hangers so you can connect them.


Use pliers to straighten the kinks in the hanger, especially where the hanger was wrapped around the neck to keep it together. You can also use the pliers to help you bend the hanger into the proper shape.
For easy wing shapes for the hanger, try making long, narrow wings like dragonflies. You can also use 4 hangers and make four balloon-shaped circles. Attach two of them together, one on top and another on bottom, so that they look like butterfly wings.
You can also draw the shape of the wing first, and then lay the hanger on top of the paper and bend it so it matches the outline of the wing.An alternative to undoing the hanger is to bend the wide part of the hanger into a wing shape, leaving the hooks in tact., Take the ends of the hangers and twist them together to connect the wings together. Use the pliers to bend the wire so you can secure them.


If you left the hanger in tact, twist the hooks together to connect the wings.
Cover the twist with a piece of fabric or felt so it doesn't poke you in the back.

, Take a piece of paper and spread it over the edges of the hanger. Fold the paper over the edges and secure to the back with tape.


If you are going to use this paper as the base, make sure you have colored it before attaching it to the hanger. If you try to color it while on the hanger, you could tear the paper.
An alternate to regular paper is to use contact paper. Cut contact paper so that it fits the hanger. Make sure there is enough to bend over the edge to secure it. Decorate the sticky side of the contact paper with flower petals, leaves, glitter, fabric, or anything else. Place another piece of contact paper over the decorations, sticky side down. Smooth it down to seal the wings. Cut around the wire hangers and fold the ends over the edges., After you have placed the paper on the wings, decorate them how you desire. Paint them, add glitter, attach flowers, or embellish with ribbon.


To make rows of feathers, cut smaller pieces of paper into half-ovals. You can make a lot of smaller individual ovals, or you can create a long piece of paper with one flat edge and one edge of half-ovals.These ovals should stack on top of each other so that your wings look like they have rows of feathers. You can cut them out of different colored paper, or color and decorate them after you cut them. When you have the feathers ready, tape or glue them to the paper wings.If you want to make paper wings that look like angel wings, try using paper fringe for feathers. Take tissue paper and cut into half. Then, fold those in half and staple along the folded crease. Cut along the paper, about 1 inch apart. You can cut it closer or further apart depending on your preference. You just want it to look like fringe. When you're done, separate the fringed edges and fluff.Use a hot glue gun to glue the fringe to the paper wings., To make a harness so you can place it on your back, connect ribbon or thin strips of material to the wings. You can connect them with either tape or staples directly onto the paper. You can also tie ribbon or strips of paper directly to the hangers.


Before securing the straps, adjust them so they are short enough that the wings will not fall off.

Gather the materials you will need.,
Mix the sugar and food coloring in a bowl.,
Pour the colored sugar onto a pan and put it into an oven preheated to 350 degrees.,
Pull the sugar out of the oven and let cool to room temperature.,
Put the sugar in a container, such as a sugar or salt shaker.,
Shake the ""fairy dust"" onto your kids favorite food.",How to Make Fairy Dust2," Edible fairy dust is simply made with sugar and food coloring.Figure out how much fairy dust you want to make, this will determine how much sugar to use. Perhaps you can try this method for the first time with one cup of sugar.


You will also need a bowl to mix the fairy dust in, a pan to cook it in, and a container to store it in.
Some people like to put edible fairy dust in a sugar or salt shaker, so that it can be used to dust the fairy dust on food. A shaker like this should be available in most kitchen supply stores.

, The ratio of sugar to food coloring will vary, depending on how much fairy dust you are making. Start by adding just a few drops of food coloring to the sugar and mix until the color is spread evenly throughout the sugar.


If the color is to your liking simply stop adding food color at this point. If you would like a stronger color, add a few more drops and mix again. You can keep adding color gradually until the color of the sugar is bright enough.

, Cook the sugar for approximately 10 minutes.


The sugar is cooked so that the color becomes fixed into the sugar. In essence, the heat of the oven will dry out the food coloring, making it less messy and permanently colored.

, Once cooled, break the sugar apart if it has melted together at all.


You can break the sugar apart by putting it in a strong plastic bag and then hitting the bag with a meat tenderizer or some other heavy kitchen tool, such as a rolling pin.

, The sugar ""fairy dust"" should keep indefinitely, as it is simply sugar covered in food coloring. You can store it in your kitchen cabinet at room temperature.

, The fairy dust will make any meal more colorful and magical.


This ""fairy dust"" is great dusted onto a wide variety of foods. It can be added to buttered toast, ice cream, or cereal, anything that will be made more delicious with the addition of a little color and a little sweetness.

Measure out your liquids.,
Add your ingredients in the right order.,
Stir your ingredients very slowly.,
Prepare your pipette.,
Dip the wand into the mixture.,
Blow your bubbles.,
Enjoy your bubbles.,
Distill your water.,
Experiment with different types of dish soap.,
Set the solution aside for stronger bubbles.,
Make bubbles on warmer days.",How to Make Unpoppable Bubbles," Get a measuring cup and measure out the corn syrup, water, and dish soap. Measure out these liquids, pour them in small bowls, and set them aside.


You can use distilled water or tap water from your sink.
If you don't have dish soap, it can be purchased at the grocery store. Corn syrup can be purchased here as well or you can buy it online.;
, The order you add your ingredients to a mixing bowl matters in this project. Add the water first. Then, add the dish soap. Add the corn syrup last.







, You do not want any bubbles to form while you're mixing your ingredients. If you stir too fast, bubbles will begin to form prematurely. Stir your ingredients slowly until you have an even mixture. This means everything should be one solid color and texture.








Use a spoon to stir your ingredients.

, Take one plastic pipette. You can buy these objects at a local craft store or department store. Use a pair of scissors to cut off the tip of the wider end of the pipette. This is the end that is not already opened.








Make sure to only trim the tip of the wide end. You do not want to cut off the entire wider part, as you'll be dipping this into your mixture. Once you're done, your pipette is now a bubble wand.
If you don't have a pipette, you can use a straw.

, Dip the tip of the wider end of the wand into the mixture. You only need to make one, quick dabbing motion to get the bubble mixture to spread on the pipette.








You should have a layer of the bubble mixture covering the end of the wand, like the glass pane of a window. Dip the wand into the mixture again if you did not get the end fully covered.

, Place your lips on the opposite end of the wand. Blow gently into the wand. A bubble should form and eventually break off.








Make sure to blow into the wand slowly. Blowing too fast could cause your bubble to break before it forms.

, Once you've blown as many bubbles as you want, you can play with them. You can bounce these bubbles up and down in your hands or throw them back and forth across the room. These bubbles should not rupture or pop as fast as regular bubbles.








Remember, no bubbles are completely unpoppable. The bubbles will rupture with time, but they should last much longer than normal bubbles.

, Some people find the minerals from tap water can affect the quality of bubbles. You may want to purchase distilled water for the project. If you can't find distilled water at the store, you can distill water yourself at home.Pour your water into a large pot with a glass lid. Do not fill the pot more than a third of the way full.








Place a small glass bowl in the center of the pot. Then, put the pot's lid on upside down. This means the handle should be in the water.
Have an adult bring the water to a boil and, once it's boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer. Cover the lid with ice cubes. This will cause water to form on the lid and drip into your bowl.
Watch the pot, adding more ice cubes as they melt. Once the bowl is full, you can remove the bowl. Use the water in the bowl in your project.

, Not all dish soaps will create the same effect. While making your unpoppable bubbles, be open to experimenting with a variety of brands of dish soap. If your bubbles did not turn out the way you wanted, try using a different dish soap., You can set aside your solution for up to two days and still use it. In general, the longer you set your solution aside, the longer it will last. If you were unhappy with how long your bubbles lasted, try making the solution again and letting it sit for awhile before blowing bubbles., In general, warm and humid days will produce the best bubbles. While the solution will work in any weather, your bubbles should last longer during warmer months.You may want to play with your bubble solution inside on windy days. Wind can pop your bubbles.

These cross bars strengthen the door and ensure that it stays held together.,, You can use any color or a combination of colors. You could even paint a rainbow of colors. Allow to dry completely., You could add a small bell too, for tinkling instead of knocking.

Dollhouse miniature knockers can be purchased for adding to the door.

, As preferred, use stickers, pens, flowers, glitter, etc., to make the door appear pretty and inviting."

Cut the bottom off each bottle.,
Create a circle on the washcloth or fabric.,
Cover the bottom of the bottle with the fabric.",How to Make a Bubble Snake Maker1," Use scissors to cut across the base of each bottle being turned into a bubble snake maker. Only remove the bottom quarter portion of the bottle so your child will have enough room inside the bottle to blow into the washrag or fabric.;
, Cut a large circle that can be placed at the bottom of the bottle and held snugly with the rubber band. The fabric or rag will need to overlap the bottle enough for the band to hold it in place, so cut with plenty of edge left.


If you don’t want to cut into your washrag, just make sure it fits comfortably (flat and not bulky) on the bottom of the bottle and is easily held in place by the rubber band.

, Secure it with the rubber band. Consider double tying the rubber band to ensure a snug fit; however, avoid crushing the bottle.

Allow the paint to dry.",How to Make Fairy Doors2," It should be the height and width of the door that you would like., Do this on paper first, to be sure that you've got the right shape, then transfer the design onto wood, using pencil.

The door can be as small or as large as you want it to be. It can be miniature for a fairy's house or much bigger and wider for the base of a tree trunk.
Round designs will be hardest to cut. Be sure that you or your helper can cut round shapes with wood first.

, This can be done with a fine saw, a jigsaw or some other cutting device suitable to wood. As already stated, if you cannot do this yourself, have someone else do it, following your pattern markings., You might have a window, a door knocker, some door hinges and decorative elements such as plants, butterflies, ladybugs, etc. You could also include a sign., For a fancier look, you could glue on embellishments such as felt shapes, buttons, sequins or the like. A little glitter can help to prettify everything too, When it's dry, the fairy door is ready for use. It can be glued to a miniature house, leaned against something, propped up with pebbles at the base or tied around the base of a tree.

If tying, such as at the base of a tree trunk, drill two little holes each side of the door for inserting string or yarn through and knotting in place once the string is looped around the tree or other object.

Create your own bubble blowing mixture in a small bowl.",How to Make a Bubble Snake Maker2," Consider using small individual plastic bowls for each child (this lessens any chance of fighting to get to the bubble bowl). Homemade bubble mix is made as follows:


Combine two parts regular dishwashing liquid (not the type used for automatic dishwashers though) to one part water. The water used can be warm or cold.
Gently mix the liquids together without creating froth or bubbles.

Cut out the shape.,
Glue the shape to a short dowel and let it dry.,
Decorate the shape.,
Tie a bow on the stick using sheer ribbon.,
Wait for the glue to dry before you play with your wand.",How to Make a Fairy Wand1," You can also use colored card stock, a thin craft foam sheet, or even felt. Use a stencil or cookie cutter to trace the shape. Your shape can be anything: a heart, star, circle, moon, and so forth.;
, Try to cut just inside the lines you drew, so that you don't see the lines on the finished piece. If you want, you can cut another, identical shape out to glue onto the back of your wand.

, You can also use a long lollipop stick. Try to find something that is around 12 to 18 inches long. Cover the bottom ½ to 1 inch of the shape with tacky glue, and press the dowel down onto it.


You can also use hot glue. It will set a lot faster.
Consider gluing an identical shape to the back of your first shape, sandwiching the dowel in between. This will hide the glue and dowel.

, Even if you used some colored paper to make your shape, you may want to decorate it to make it even more special. Here are some decorating ideas:


Cover the shape with a thin layer of glue and sprinkle glitter over it.
Outline your shape using glitter glue or puff paint.
Draw designs inside your shape using glitter glue or puff paint.
Glue rhinestones, sequins, or beads over your shape.

, Leave long tails trailing from the bow. If you want, you can wrap some ribbon around the stick to make it more colorful.

, Depending on how much glue you used, this can take anywhere between a few hours to a whole day.

Add final touches with glitter glue and rhinestones.,
Let the wand dry before playing with it.",How to Make a Fairy Wand2," You want the dowel to be between 12 and 18 inches long.

, You can use acrylic paint or spray paint. It might be a good idea to stick the end of the dowel into a lump of clay and paint the top half first. Once the paint dries, flip the dowel over, and paint the bottom half.


You can use any color you want, but great fairy colors include: silver, gold, pearly white, and pastel colors.

, Place a drop of hot glue onto the top of the dowel. Press the end of your ribbon into the glue. Wrap the ribbon around the dowel. Leave spaces between the ribbon so that you can see the painted dowel underneath. It should look like a candy cane. Secure the other end of the ribbon to the bottom of the dowel with more hot glue.

, Place a drop of hot glue onto the bottom of the dowel. Press a small rhinestone or bead into the glue. The rhinestone or bead should not be wider than the base of the dowel.

, You can use anything you want as a topper for your wand, just make sure that it is not too large and not too heavy. You also don't want to use anything made from glass, just in case you drop it.


Find a flat, wooden shape, such as a star.
Find a small, round Christmas ornament and pull the metal cap off. The dowel needs to fit into the neck of the ornament.
Make a topper out of air-dry clay. Be sure to poke a hole into the bottom of it using your dowel.
For a creepy fairy, use a giant fake spider.
For a snow fairy, use a snowflake ornament.

, You can paint the topper or draw designs on it using glitter glue. You can also glue rhinestones onto it.

, This can make it even more twirly. You can use regular satin ribbon or curling ribbon (like the type you'd use on a balloon). Cut five to seven pieces of ribbon that are a little bit shorter than your dowel and glue them to the top of your dowel.

, 3-D items, such as figurines and ornaments, will be able to sit right on the tip. Flat items may have to be glued to the side of your dowel.

, You can glue some rhinestones along the sides of the dowel. You can also draw a thin ring of glitter glue around the bottom and top of your dowel to hide any seams and glue.

, Hot glue dries quickly, but glitter glue takes a lot longer to dry. Wait a few hours to a whole day.

Make a simple wand out of several pipe cleaners.,
Make a wand using a glowstick instead of a dowel.",How to Make a Fairy Wand3," Find a stick that is between 12 and 18 inches long, and about as thick as your finger. Use sandpaper to smooth away any rough spots, especially on the top and bottom of the stick. Decorate your stick with silk flowers, fake leaves, glitter, and ribbon. You can add a large fake flower or butterfly to the top of your wand.

, Find a wooden dowel that is between 12 and 18 inches long. Draw squiggles and vines over the dowel using hot glue. You can also glue on some beads or jewels onto the dowel as well. Wait for the glue to set, then paint the entire wand a solid color using acrylic paint. The glue will give the wand an embossed look.


To create shadows, take a slightly darker color than the one your used for your wand, and apply it to the nooks and crannies of the designs. You can use a small paintbrush or even a Q-tip.
To create highlights, dip a folded paper towel into a slightly lighter color than the one you used for your wand, and gently rub it over your designs. You can also use silver or gold for this technique as well.

, Take two differently colored pipe cleaners and twist them together to make a striped stick. Bend another pipe cleaner into a fun shape, such as a star or heart, and twist it to your pipe cleaner stick using one of the loose ends. Tie a few long pieces of ribbon around the top of your wand, just under the fun shape.

, You can use anything you want for the topper, but don't decorate the glowstick itself. When you are ready to play with your wand, snap the glowstick and shake it to activate it.

Select the space for the fairy garden village.,
Design the fairy garden village.,
Make fairy dwellings and village items.,
Purchase items.,
Assemble the fairy garden village.,
If using ceramic or other outdoor-suitable miniature fairies, arrange them in the village after it has been built.,
Stand back and admire the crafting of your fairy garden village.",How to Make a Fairy Garden Village," While it could be anywhere in your garden, there are some key considerations:

Which part of the garden is free for adding bits and pieces to? Avoid using the fertile veggie patch for the fairy garden village.
Choose a spot that is easy to see. If you'd like family, friends and visitors to see the village, it shouldn't be hard to see or hidden away.
Consider your own comfort. Is the spot easy to access, are you okay to bend down to put things into it or would it be easier at a higher level so that you can work on it while sitting or standing?
Is it something you want viewable at nighttime? If so, lighting will be an additional factor to consider.
Does the village need to be kept out of the rain or can all the elements land upon it? This will definitely impact the location, for if you need to keep it sheltered, you'll have to put some sort of cover in place, or use existing cover. It is far easier to make an all-weather fairy garden village.;
, Start by sketching out your ideas for the village on paper first. This doesn't have to be exact, in fact the more flexible, the better. You never know what new addition you may wish to make to the fairy village over time. Things that you might wish to have in your design include:

What sorts of dwellings do you want for the fairies? Are you going to make them or purchase them? Are you happy for an eclectic mixture of dwellings or do you want this to look fairly uniform? It will be easier to make an eclectic village, especially if you're obtaining the items from all sorts of sources but if you prefer a neater looking one, you might consider purchasing a village set or making the houses all in the same way.
Will the village have other things than just dwellings? For example, you could add shops, a wishing well, a place of worship, a play area, a veggie patch just for the fairies, a dancing area, a magic mushroom circle, and so forth.
Consider having pathways. These can be easily made from pebbles or gravel and add a special extra touch to the village layout.
Little fences can be made using tiny sticks and string strung between the sticks.
Water bodies can be included––the easiest way is to use very small bowls and fill these with real water.
Will the fairies need lights? Little solar lights might make a fun addition to light up their world by night.
What sorts of fairies will you have in the village? Small ceramic fairies can be found in many dollar stores or charity shops, or you can make your own. Another alternative is making this for the invisible fairies, and making believe that the fairies visit when you're not about.

, If you're making the items rather than buying them all, it's useful to have an idea about how you'll do this. The best approach is to be very creative and to innovate as you go. The more you experiment with items you have from nature and your craft supplies, the more fun you'll have and the more unique the end result will be. Some suggestions to help you experiment include:

Borrow a book or two on making miniature houses, especially ones with a focus on using items from nature. This will give you a lot of inspiration for using different sorts of materials. Modify as much as you like––there is no need to follow the instructions exactly.
Use natural materials such as twigs, branches, rocks, pebbles, leaves, seed pods, nuts, straw, seeds, wood, etc. to make the dwellings, pathways and other features. The more natural the village looks, the more realistic it will be.

, If you don't mind mixing things up, the fairy garden village can benefit from having a mixture of purchased and handmade items. Or, simply stick to the purchased items if preferred. Things you can purchase include miniature fairy houses, ceramic fairies, ceramic pieces such as a well, a swing or a tower and doll house items of all sorts. The main thing is to only use items that can withstand being outdoors and getting weathered. Some suggestions for locating items include:

Visit charity, thrift and used goods stores. Many miniature items can be found in such places for a bargain price, and you can have lots of fun rummaging about for the best pieces.
Check out hobby or toy stores, including ones online. Look for fairy designed items and for doll house things.
See what crafters have to offer on sites such as Etsy, eBay and their own personal online stores. You might find some lovely items for sale that are just perfect for your fairy garden village.

, Follow your design ideas and begin putting the dwellings, other buildings, feature items and pathways in place. If what you planned on paper doesn't look as good when placed in the garden, continue to make adjustments until you're happy. Often the way that plants are growing, the level of the soil or the limitations of the site chosen will form part of how you assemble the items as a whole, so go with the flow and add things in the way that looks best.

This step is a great time to include your children in adding the items to the garden. In this case, just let them make the choices about where the little items will go––remember that their view of the world is much lower and more intimate than yours and they'll find this a very special and fun activity to do.

, It will be easier to see where they fit in best once the buildings, pathways and other features are already in their places., Take a photo and post it online for others to see. Then let the fairies get on with their business. If you're really lucky, you might spot one moving from the corner of your eye..."

Choose a headband in the color you'd like to show through. If this isn't possible, select ribbon in that color and wrap it around the headband.;
, Do you want artificial flowers or real flowers? Artificial flowers are easier to add––they only require gluing. Fresh flowers will take a bit more work with wire, etc. This method focuses on the artificial variety.


Sourcing the flowers: Craft stores, remove from hair clips, thrift store finds, etc. You could even make your own.

, There is no hard and fast rule about how a fairy might like flowers to be arranged; that's up to you to be creative about! But some ideas that you might like to consider include:


A row of the same flower in the same color across the entire headband. For example, a row of sweet small pink satin roses.
A few large flowers placed in one spot of the headband, with the rest of the headband left free of embellishment (the method images here show such a result).
A mixture of flowers of differing sizes.
Flowers entwined with leaves, stems and artificial gems.
Any other ideas you have for fairy-like floral arrangements.

, Use glue suitable for attaching fabric to the headband material.


As you're gluing, wipe off any congealed glue to ensure that it doesn't create unsightly blobs when dried.

, Read the instructions on the glue package for details on drying times.

, Make any adjustments as needed.

, It's time to add the fairy costume and head off to the party!

Add a ribbon to the wand stick.",How to Make a Star Wand1," The paper needs to be strong enough to withstand decorating and sitting atop the wand. Construction paper, cereal box card or thin card are the best types of paper.;
, The star should be a substantial size; a good ratio is to make a star the size of a child's hand for a child's wand and a star the size of an adult's hand for an adult's wand.

, Place it over the paper you're making the star from. Cut out two stars from the paper.

, For a stick, use something long and slim, such as a straw, a bamboo skewer, a specially cut piece of balsa wood, a thin dowel piece or even a garden twig (make sure it is clean).


Use glue, tape or staples to attach the star.

, This will cover the top of the wand stick and gives the star added strength.


You might even consider stuffing the two stars. To do this, crumple up paper (newspaper, scrap paper) or cotton wool. Staple or glue almost of the way around the two stars to seal the edges. Leave a small gap. Stuff the star, then join up the last opening. The star is now three dimensional and puffy.

, There are lots of things you can do:


Paint or color the star with markers
Glue on sequins, buttons, artificial jewels, etc.
Sprinkle with glitter (either use glitter glue or use a glue stick and then shake on the glitter)
Glue on candies for a candy fan
Cover the star in foil. It can be left like this or glitter/flashy artificial gems can be added.

, Tie it into a neat bow or wind it around the wand stick and glue or tape in place.


You can also tie a strand of ribbons from the point at which the star base ends on the wand stick. Have the various ribbons cascade down to the base of the wand stick.

Done.",How to Make a Fairy Headband2," Check the comfort of the fit on the wearer before proceeding.

, For this project, you'll need grosgrain, sheer and tulle ribbon. Select in either the same color, varying shades of the same hue or matching colors.

, Use the grosgrain ribbon to cover the whole headband. You can either wrap it around or carefully glue a straight piece across the top and a straight piece underneath (the latter method is more fiddly).


Glue the ends in place to prevent unraveling if wrapping around.

, Glue this along the length of the headband in a sort of wave-like way, with the dips glued on and the rises sticking above the headband.

Measure your child's or your own head for the diameter.,
Lay the band out.,
Prepare the foil.,
Fold each foil strip into halves, lengthwise.,
Start creating the tiara.,
Decorate the front side of the tiara.,
Wear the tiara.",How to Make a Fairy Tiara1," Cut a narrow band of the cardboard to this measurement.;
, Cut two small slits a little way in from each end of the band. These slits should not cut all the way, just long enough to allow you to slide the two ends of the tiara together and hold in place on the head.

, Cut six strips of foil. The length of the foil should be twice the width of the band you've already cut.

, Then roll each folded strip into a long, thin sausage shape. Cut each sausage-shaped foil stick in half.

, At this stage, you can form the foil sticks into different shapes to create the tiara's designs. Once formed, the foil pieces are to be attached to the cardboard band created earlier. Here are some ideas:


Bend each foil stick in half and slightly shape to form an arch. Tape the ends onto the backside of the tiara band in a row until the area that ends around the ears.
Curl each foil stick. Tape each curl along the tiara in a row.
Shape each stick into a heart shape. Tape each heart along the tiara, to form a row.
Do a combination of curls, hearts and arches, or rounded designs. Vary the sizes to make the tiara look more interesting. Or, make one center design into a feature piece in a larger size and make the other foil stick shapes smaller, to sit alongside the centerpiece.

, How you decorate the tiara is up to you but here are some ideas to help:


Use small paper cut-outs or paper punches in the shapes of stars, hearts, circles, etc. and glue on in a pretty pattern.
Make flowers using paper petals and a sequin stuck in the middle. Or, use artificial flowers and glue in place.
Use rhinestones or other craft gems. Simply glue in place where they'd look prettiest.
You could also affix some decorations onto the top of the foil shapes for an extra rich look. Or, hang a decoration down from the center foil shape for a special ""jewel"" look.

, To wear, slot the ends of the cardboard band together. Once the circlet is formed, the tiara is ready for wearing. Tiaras do not sit around the head, but on top of it; therefore, you may need to adjust the tiara a little and perhaps hold it in place with hair clips or bobby pins.

Gather your materials.,
Position the towel.,
Secure the towel.,
Create the tail.",How to Make an Easy Mermaid Tail2," This technique is great for mermaid parties and easy to make. All you need is beach towels, ribbons, and rubber bands.


Thicker rubber bands will work better for this design.
The ribbon needs to be long enough to fit around your future mermaid’s waist., Place the towel, preferably a beach towel, around the mermaid’s waist. The towel should droop down like a long dress. , Tie a ribbon around the mermaid’s waist. Use the same knot you’d use to tie a shoe. You don’t want to suffocate the mermaid, but make sure it doesn’t slip off., Wrap a rubber band around the last foot of the towel. Leave the rubber band in the center of the towel on your last wrap around. This will produce fins out of the last foot of the towel."
"
Gather your supplies.,
Prepare the tights or leggings.,
Attach the fins.",How to Make an Easy Mermaid Tail3," Get some tights or leggings that are bigger than your size. Make sure the legs are longer than yours. You’ll also need swimming fins/monofins, scissors, and duct tape.


Use brightly colored leggings, that are slightly thick so you can't see your legs., Put both of your legs through one of the leg holes. This may be hard if you use tights. Make sure your waist fits into the leg hole. This will be your tail. Make sure some of the fabric covers your feet.Tuck the extra leg hole into your tail by wrapping it around your waist to make it look fashionable. Then simply tuck it into the back or side of the tail.

, Put on swimming fins or monofins that fit your size onto your feet. These will be your mermaid fins.


If you are using leggings, cover the connection between the tail and the fins."

Done.",How to Make a Fairy Tiara2," If it has peaks, so much the better and it should be a wide style of lace. If you don't have any lace at home, the craft store will have plenty of choices.

, This is needed to starch the lace and cause it to stand up on its own.


Mis 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat gradually over low heat, to dissolve the sugar.
Stir often. The sugar must only dissolve, not change color. If it changes color, you'll need to start over. Do not boil the mixture.
Remove from the heat source and allow to cool.

, Ensure that it is completely wet, then place on a clean towel and dab. The lace should be damp, not sopping wet.

, Ensure that all of the lace has been coated in the sugar starch solution.

, Remove the lace and lay out flat on a sheet of wax paper.

, Be generous––excess glitter can be retrieved from the wax paper later.

, Hold in place with a rubber band or food package clips. Leave to almost dry.

, It should still have a little give in it, allowing you to glue the ends together in a circlet formation, making use of the overlap to ensure it attaches strongly. Set it down on wax paper to dry completely.

, Once the tiara is completely dried, it is ready for use. It can be sealed with Mod Podge or similar craft sealant if wished, for durability, but this isn't essential.

Fill your broken pot with soil.,
Nest a large potsherd in the soil.,
Add more soil to the pot.,
Build a staircase with smaller potsherds.,
Decorate the pot with suitable plants.",How to Make a Fairy Garden from Broken Pots1," Your pot should have a somewhat large gap in it from the broken section of the pot. However, the base of the pot should be intact. Fill the pot a quarter of the way with soil, with the soil sloping upwards away from the broken section of the pot.Depending on the size of your pot and its broken section, you may need to use more or less soil.
The goal at this point is to put enough soil in your pot so that you can nest your large potsherd in it.
A general potting soil, which is sometimes called potting or container mix, should work well for the plants in your fairy garden.;
, If both the upper corners of your large potsherd are still attached, put on safety glasses and use a hammer to break off a corner. If you've broken the right corner, nest the large potsherd in the soil inside the pot so its left side touches the left side of the pot, or vice versa.The gap in the corner will allow a space for you to use smaller potsherds, stacked on sloping soil, to create a potsherd stairway.

, With your hands or a hand spade, add more soil to your pot. Fill it about ¾ of the way full, and arrange the dirt so it holds the large potsherd in place. Your dirt should slope upwards away from the broken segment of the pot, with the greater portion of the soil in the main part of the pot, behind the large potsherd.The shape of your large potsherd or the size of your pot might require you to adjust the amount of dirt you add at this point in the project.

, If you don't have small potsherds, take your hammer and break the corner you removed from your large potsherd into pieces. If you already have small pieces of potsherd:Layer the small pieces of potsherd on the sloping dirt in an ascending fashion. These should spiral up the sloping dirt to the gap in one of the corners of the large potsherd.
Press the potsherds into the soil or add a little soil to firmly fix the smaller potsherds in place.

, Now that your potsherds are in place, you can add plants. Choose those that look like normal, everyday plants (like trees, shrubs, and so on), but miniature. This will give your garden the atmosphere that it was cultivated by little fairies.


Succulents, bonsai plants, and moss are well suited for creating this kind of atmosphere, but feel free to experiment.Tiny flowering plants will make your fairy garden appear to be a miniature flower garden tended by little fairies. Try plants like Baby's Breath, Alsike Clover (Trifolium hybridum), Black Swallow Wort (Cynanchum nigrum), Blue Curls (Trichostema dichotomum), and more."

Fill your pot with soil and potsherds.,
Position your buildings.,
Add other decorations.",How to Make a Fairy Garden from Broken Pots2," Fill your broken pot with soil that slopes upwards and away from the broken section of the pot. Arrange your potsherds in the soil to create terraces or to section off the inside of your pot in interesting ways.


When arranging your potsherds, you may want to first add a small amount of soil to the pot, then insert the potsherds, then add more soil to hold potsherds in place.
Small potsherds can be pushed into the sides of sloping soil to form stairways in your broken pot fairy village. You might also use small pieces of wood to simulate the same effect., You can find miniature buildings, decorations, and so on at craft stores, hobby shops, or even at stores that sell aquarium decorations. Nest these in the soil according to your preference. Once you have your buildings places, you can add other features and greenery for your fairy garden.Don't be afraid to add models and decorations you've made yourself. These can make your fairy village look even more authentic. For example, you could add a popsicle model house, a model castle, or even a fairy house.

, The more details you add, the more it will seem like your fairy village is actually occupied by these tiny, mystical creatures. Think about adding features a fairy might use, were it living in your village. Some examples include:


A miniature bus stop for fairies.
Tiny mail boxes outside of fairy houses and buildings.
Benches where fairies can sit.
Small birdhouses."

Fill a bucket or container with water.,
Drill guide holes in the outline of your break.,
Break the pot with your hammer.",How to Make a Fairy Garden from Broken Pots3," You'll need this container to be large enough so that when it is filled with water your terra cotta pot will be completely submerged. Soaking the pot in water will make it less brittle, and allow you to shape the breaks in it with greater precision.


Depending on your pot, your soak time will vary. Thicker pots may need to be soaked for a few hours. Thinner pots will likely only need a 30 minutes to an hour soak., Remove your pot from the water filled container. Much like perforated paper is easier to tear cleanly, you'll be drilling holes to guide where your pot will break. Use your craft or power drill and a drill bit to drill holes ½-inch apart along your planned break-line.You may want to use a piece of chalk to outline where you plan on breaking your pot. This way, you can follow the outline when drilling.
For terra cotta that's especially thick or sturdy, you may want to drill your holes with only ¼-inch separating each hole.
You can create breaks in your terra cotta pot in any shape you desire. For example, you might make a V-shaped break from the mouth of your pot down to the bottom, or you might try to make a diamond shape.

, Before breaking your pot, put on safety glasses to protect your eyes. Hit your terra cotta pot to the inside of your break-line with your hammer. Use firm, medium force strikes. Your pot should break along the break-line. Try to break your pot so that you have at least one large potsherd.Try to create few smaller pieces of potsherd along with the large one. Smaller pieces, stacked ascending on sloping soil, will give the appearance of tiny stairways, with each small potsherd forming a single step.
If your pot broke so that there is only one big piece, take your drill and drill holes to create a break-line to remove the upper left or right corner from your largest potsherd. Hit the potsherd with your hammer so that it breaks the corner piece off.
It is not necessary to remove a corner piece from your largest potsherd. However, doing so will allow you to stack small potsherds on soil sloping up to the corner gap. This will create a ""stairway"" up through the gap that leads to the central, unbroken part of the pot.

When you're done, give the face time to dry.,
Hold up a mirror to show your customer the result.",How to Face Paint," Having the right face paint should be your first consideration. Keeping an eye on safety, variety, and quality will help you paint the face of your dreams.


Put safety first. Use face paint that is cosmetic grade and contains only FDA compliant materials so it does not cause damage to the person whose face you are painting. Make sure the paint is cosmetic grade and contains a list of ingredients. Improper face paint can cause rashes, allergic reactions, or may even do permanent damage in extreme cases. If unsure of allergens and your client, have the client or parent read the ingredient listing. Avoid the following items:

Watercolor pencils, markers, or pens. They may be ""washable"" on fabric, but that does not mean they are OK for skin.
Acrylic craft paints. They may be labeled ""non-toxic"" but that does not make them skin safe, or ""to be used as a cosmetic"".


Avoid oil-based paints. They are difficult to remove and easily smear.
Gather a variety of colors.

At the very least, you'll need black, white, red, blue, and yellow paint. You can mix these colors to create every color in the spectrum.
If you don't have the time to mix colors, choose a color palette with at least 8-14 colors.

;
, Without the right brushes, the hard work you've put into choosing the perfect colors won't pay off. The right brush can go a long way in helping you paint a face with as much detail and precision as possible.


Variety is key. At least three types of brushes are crucial for a balanced look:

A #2 round brush should be used for fine details.
A #4 round brush is necessary for larger details.
A 1-inch flat brush can help you pick up multiple colors.
As you expand your repertoire, brushes of different thickness can help fine-tune your design.



, Makeup sponges are useful for quickly applying paint to a large area, or for adding a base color.


Start with at least three sponges. You can cut them in half to make six.
Having different sponges for different colors can help you avoid having to wash the sponge during a painting session. The same is true for brushes.

, Gel glitters are recommended for their ease of use and controlled application. However, keep in mind that glitter can get a bit messy and may get on your paints or parts of the face you did not intend to paint with glitter.


Remember safety. Your glitter should be FDA-approved as well. The only safe glitters for face painting are made of polyester and are round cut. Never use craft glitters as they can be made of metal and can scratch sensitive skin and eyes.

, Having these extra tools can add some pizzazz to your finished product.


Stencils are perfect if you're not confident about your painting skills, or if you're simply short on time. Some classic stencils include hearts, flowers, and moons. Make sure to have different sizes of stencils to accommodate different faces.
Face stamps can be filled in by using glitter and face paint and can be a great addition to a painted face.
Temporary tattoos can be used even more quickly than stencils. However, some people's skin doesn't react well to them, and they can take longer to remove.

, Sometimes the perfect look requires texture or something face paint alone cannot provide.


To create bumpy noses, soak a bit of cotton wool in the paint, place it on the face, and cover it with a tissue before you paint over it.
For warts, simply cover wheat or puffed rice with a bit of paint.
For an extra-ghostly effect, apply a light coat of flour to your subject's face after you're done painting.

, It's important to have the right furniture to store your paints and to make you and your subject comfortable.


Have a flat surface, such as a table or desk, for your painting materials.
Also, have two chairs, one for the face painter, and one for the person being painted, so you are both comfortable during the process.

, It's just as important to be ready to clean up a mess at it is to have the proper materials for painting faces.


To prevent your subject from getting splashed with excess paint or water, you can use a plastic trash bag with a holes cut in it to act for protection. Simply cut the bag at the end of the process to avoid ruining your work.
Have trash bags and towels to clean up as you paint.
Have washcloths and makeup remover for your customers.
Have access to a sink or water so you can wash your hands in between customers to prevent the spread of disease.
Have soapy water or disinfectant to clean your brushes and sponges.

, Your subject would like to see what your masterpiece looks like--a mirror is crucial not only for showing off your finished work, but also for helping your subject see your progress along the way.

, It's crucial to get a sense of what your customer wants before you begin. Clear communication about his or her needs is key for the success of your work.

Have a board that shows what you can offer. This can help people make a decision and will save time as well as show off your skills.
If you're working with children, you should be ready to provide the child with ideas in case he or she is indecisive.
If you're working with a big group, you should make sure that the person who is next in line also knows what he or she wants to avoid delays.

, Once your subject makes a decision, it's important to have an idea of what the finalized face will look like.


If you plan on using any glitter, special effects, or tattoos, make a note of this, so you don't end up adding them too late in the process.
Think fast. Kids are impatient and may change their minds if you take too long.

, Be sure to clean the skin of any existing makeup or product.

/images/thumb/2/21/Face-Paint-Step-12-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Face-Paint-Step-12-Version-6.jpg









Never paint someone with open cuts or sores on their face because this can cause them harm and may spread infection to your other customers. Opt to paint their arm instead.
Tie hair back and secure flyaway that might interfere with application.
Watch out for long earrings or any other jewelry that may interfere with your process.
Have your subject practice sitting still as you clean his or her face. If it's a child, putting a hand on the back of his or head can be helpful.

This will make it easier for you to add darker colors as you move forward, and to avoid having to start over.

, You should apply a solid base of color before you move into the finer details of the face.

Use a sponge to cover a face in a certain color before you begin the details.
Thick brushes work for large swathes of color.
Thin brushes work best for fine details.

, Don't forget to add these special effects early on so you can paint over them.

, Having patience will keep you from blending or smudging the paint you have worked so hard to apply.


Let the first color dry before you apply a second. If you don't wait, then the two colors may mix together and you will have to begin again.
Fill in the colors slowly after you wait, making sure not to mix them, so you avoid smudging.
Instead of one thick coat of color, apply several thin coats of color to avoid cracking.

, If you planned to use glitter or stamps, make sure you've worked them into your painting plan.

Glitter can be mixed with paint and applied any time.
If you're using stamps or tattoos, make sure to leave room on the face for them.

, All the time you've spent on creating the perfect look will be ruined if you don't give it enough time to settle.


Instruct the person you’ve painted not touch their face for about 5 minutes to allow it dry
Alternatively, use a hand held fan to dry the paint more quickly.

, He or she will be impressed by your efforts and will be ready to show off his or her new look.


Take a photo of your subject to show future customers.
Have your subject show off his look for your customers, or potential customers. This will help you gain credibility as a face painter, whether you're trying to make a living or just looking for more potential subjects for the fun of it.

In a bowl, combine cornstarch, lotion, and water.,
If desired, add more of either ingredient to change the base texture.,
Scoop the base mixture into a small container.,
Add the food coloring.,
Make more base and repeat.",How to Make Your Own Face Paint1," Face paints are made out of two parts: the base and the color. First, we'll make a neutral base that we can add any color that we wish to. Stir until smooth.


Note that, in the UK, cornstarch is typically called ""cornflour"" — the ingredients are identical.
Ideally, you'll want to use a white lotion so that it won't affect the color of the face paint. If you don't have lotion, you can get away with using any mild skin cream, like cold cream, shea butter, and so on.;
, The recipe above should work well on its own in most cases. However, if you don't like your results, you can add more cornstarch to make the mixture thicker and more lotion or water to make it thinner — it's up to you!

One cheap and creative way to store face paint is to use an egg carton. Put a little base in each compartment individually, leaving them about halfway full to prevent spillage when you mix in the colors.
Another good choice for this is to use leftover baby food containers — they're usually just the right size to hold face paint.

, Put a few drops of your preferred food coloring in your neutral base. Stir thoroughly to combine until the color is smooth and even. You may need to add a little more food coloring than you first think is necessary — keep in mind that this paint will be spread fairly thin when it is worn.

Mix the shortening, Vaseline, and food coloring.,
Gradually add the cornstarch and flour.,
Store as above.",How to Make Your Own Face Paint2," Compared to the recipe above, this face paint is much thicker. This means that if we wait until the end to add the color, it can be difficult to distribute it throughout the paint. Instead, this time, we'll add it first with the ""wet"" ingredients. Mix to combine until the mixture has a smooth, consistent color.

After mixing your shortening and your powdered ingredients, the texture should be chunky or even chalky. This is good — like a clown's greasepaint, this recipe should be solid enough to handle.
Note that the recipe calls for a teaspoon of flour — not a tablespoon

, When this recipe is done, you can handle and store it exactly as you would with the liquid face paint above. Once again, egg cartons and baby food containers work well for keeping each color separate from the others.


Apply the finished face paint with an old makeup applicator, a Q-tip, or a light, clean sponge.

Prepare the person.,
Begin with the cat ears on the forehead area.,
Design the nose.,
Paint on the whiskers.,
Paint the lips.",How to Face Paint a Cat1," Have the person whose face you’re painting sit down on a comfortable chair, stool or, other seat. The seat should be at a height that you can reach with ease. If the person has long hair, put it back in a ponytail to make sure that the hair stays out of their face., These are fairly standard. Draw two triangles on the forehead with the chosen color. Draw a smaller pink triangle inside to represent the inner ear area. Color in the inner ear triangle with the face paint, making it completely pink (or pinkish).









The color and shape may change slightly depending on the type of cat you’re painting.

, The nose is usually a simple black shape that covers the tip of the nose and the nostrils. There are, however, several options for the nose. Two of the options are: 








Option one: Draw an upside down triangle on the tip of the nose. Even up the sides after drawing it, then paint it in completely. It is usually black or pink, but the color can vary, depending on which face paints you have.
Option two: Paint around the nostrils. Paint the chosen color for the nose just above the nostrils, continuing to paint the chosen color up the bridge of the nose. Add some black just above the nostrils. Finish by drawing a straight line from the nose base that extends down to the lip.
You could also try a combination of both of these suggested options.

, Whiskers are easy to do, since they mostly consist of straight lines. For a small child's face, three whiskers on each cheek are sufficient. A larger face might be able to handle five. There is no need to do any more than five, or it may start to look overdone.








Draw three to five lines across both cheeks, from the nose towards the sides of the face. Flick them on without pressing too hard, for a more flowing look.
Add dots in front of the whiskers, nose end. These represent the growing ends of the whiskers typically seen on a cat.

, Choose any color that matches the color you have already applied. Apply it on the lips in the manner of lip gloss. Black and red are common choices. Ask the person if they are okay with having face paint on their lips before applying it.








You can outline the lips instead of fully coloring in the lips.

Obtain four to eight wire coat hangers.,

Repeat Steps 3 and 4 with the lower wings.,
Connect the four wings at the center.,
Stretch and tie the leg of a stocking over each wing.,
Cut two long pieces of a wide ribbon.,
Tie each ribbon around the center of the wings.,
Decorate the wings if desired.",How to Make Fairy Wings1," You can obtain them for free from your local dry cleaners, as they often recycle the hangers or even try to throw them away. Wire hangers with a clear, flexible coating are easier on the fingers when you bend them.


To create four separate wings, you will need a minimum of four separate wire hangers. However, if you plan to make very rounded, hoop-like wings, it may be necessary to double up on the wire to keep your shapes sturdy; you will later be placing stockings over the wire structures, which may squeeze them into a more flattened form than you’d like.
Alternatively, you can also buy thick wire. 16-gauge wire is the highest you should go; 12-gauge or lower will give you a stronger form to work with.;
, Straighten the hooks, unwrap the twisted spiral tops, stretch the wires into straight pieces, and flatten out kinks with pliers.

, Use one wire for an elongated shape or two for a rounded one. Bend the wire into the desired shape and twist the ends together when you’re done, leaving some excess sticking out so that you can attach this to the other wings later. For inspiration, look at photos or illustrations of butterfly wings. You can also make dragonfly wings by just shaping them into long ovals.

, Simply bend the wire into shape using the first wing as a guide. When you’re done, twist the ends together as before.


If you only want to use one piece of wire for each wing, you can make both wings at the same time; if using two for each wing, however, do them separately, as bending four wires at once won’t be easy.

, The lower wings should be smaller than the upper wings, which may mean that you need to shorten these wires.

, First, place the wires that jut out at the end of each wing so that they overlap the wires of the surrounding wings; you may need to do some additional bending to make this work. Then, secure the various wires together either by wrapping and tying them very firmly with string or by duct-taping them.


Don’t worry too much about how your central wire hub ends up looking, as you will cover it later.

, The stockings fabric will form the wing material, so choose a color/pattern that achieves the look you’re going for (though you can also decorate the fabric later if desired). Simply feed a wing into the stocking, stretch it to the center, cut it to the necessary length, grab the open end on either side, and tie it over the center of the wire. Repeat with the other three wings.


Note that stretching a stocking over the wing form may distend the shape; simply pull the wire back into the original shape after you’ve tied the stocking off. (The tighter you pull the stocking, the more the wire wing shape will flatten.)

, Since these will be used to tie the wings on, make sure they not only match the stockings, but are also long enough to tie around the torso (i.e. around each shoulder, in an X over the chest, etc. depending on the desired look).

, Be sure to orient the knots inward (i.e. toward the spine) so that the wings will tie on easily.

, For example, you can spray paint the edges, paint designs on the centers, paint the front and back sides differently, paint the top and bottom wings differently, or any combination thereof. You can also apply glue with a paintbrush and sprinkle glitter over the paint for a shimmery look.


If you’d prefer angel wings, add feathers. This can be done by attaching store-bought feathers to the wings with a strong glue; simply place a dab of glue where you’d like a feather, then stick the tip of the feather through the glue and into the stocking for a tight hold. Start from the bottom so that the next row of feathers will cover the quills of the row beneath it. Place longer feathers on the bottom and shorter feathers on the top of the most realistic effect. Note that you will have to feather both sides of each wing to make them look complete.

Apply bronzer.,
Use brown eye shadow and eyeliner for the spots.,
Use eyeliner for the whiskers.,
Do a cat eye.,
Paint on a black nose.,
Use black lipstick.",How to Face Paint a Cat2," Use a golden brown bronzer for the base of the leopard face. You can also choose to use a light brown paint if you do not want to use makeup. Apply the color to your cheeks, chin, forehead, and the bridge of your nose. Don’t apply the bronzer to the center of your forehead, your eyes, and the area where the whiskers should be. For these areas, you will want to use a light foundation or white paint. Blend in the makeup, but don’t blend the colors together. Do not blend the areas together.








You are using these colors to achieve the leopard’s base coloring.

, Use a brush and brown eyeliner to set the base for the spots. Again, you can also choose to use light brown paint. Take the brush and make small, rounded streaks. They should look like natural leopard spots, rather than perfect circles. Make these streaks all around your face, except for the area where the whisker will go. Next, outline and lightly fill in those streaks with black eyeliner. 








Don’t fill the face with the “spots.” Make sure there is space in between them.
Make some of the spots smaller than others for variety.

, Use the eyeliner to create the look of whiskers. For this look, you won’t draw straight lines. Instead, make small points below your nose and above your mouth, spreading out towards your cheeks. You can also use the eyeliner to make small points on your chin and in a line below your eyes. 







, Use black eyeliner and dark eye shadow to create a cat eye look. First, go over the eyeliner with a dark brown eyeliner. Cover the lids and slightly extend the eye shadow outside of the lids to create a point that will line up with the eye liner. Next, use a black eyeliner to create a classic cat eye . You can use liquid, gel, or a basic pencil eyeliner. Draw a line just above the eyelash line and extend it to a point that ends a few centimeters outside of your eyelids. 








The upper lid and area below the eyes should remain white.
You may choose to opt out of the eyeliner if this look is being done on a small child.

, Use the black eyeliner to make the tip of your nose a nostrils black. Start with the bridge of the nose. Draw a line with the eyeliner. Gradually fill in the rest of the nose and nostrils until it is black. Then, draw a line from the bottom of the nose to the center of top of the center of the lips.








You can also go slightly outside of and below the nose to create a larger “leopard nose.”

, You can also use black eyeliner or paint, but black lipstick is best for the lips. First, outline the lips in black. Then, fill in the rest of the lips. You can go over the lips with a gloss or keep them matte.

Use white paint for the center of the face.,
Apply brown paint or bronzer to the rest of the face.,
Paint on a light pink nose.,
Make frown lines with brown paint.",How to Face Paint a Cat3," Begin with white paint or white, creamy eye shadow. You will use this to create the white streak down Grumpy Cat’s face and around his eyes. Start in the center of the forehead. Paint a streak that is about an inch wide down your face until you reach the bridge of your nose. From there, it should get wider. The white paint should cover your nose, inner cheeks, jaw, and lips.








You can use a white lipstick for your lips instead of paint.

, Cover the rest of the face with a light brown paint or golden brown bronzer. Make sure it doesn’t run into or blend with the white paint. Since Grumpy Cat’s eyes are darker than the rest of the face, you can use a darker color or apply the paint or bronzer heavier around your eyes.







, You can use light pink paint or lip liner. It’s okay if you have covered your nose in white paint. The light pink paint or lip liner will cover the white paint. Cover the tip of the nose and nostrils with the paint. Bring the paint just below the nose to create a point, similar to a cat’s nose. You can mix the paint with a light brown at the point for a more realistic look.







, To emphasize the grumpiness, you can use light brown paint or eyeliner to draw on frown lines. Frown and follow the natural lines of your face. The lines shouldn’t be too thick or plentiful. Make sure to keep an unhappy look on your face so people will know what famous cat you’re trying to look like.

Iron the cellophane.,
Trim the excess.,
Make a back attachment.,
Wear your wings!",How to Make Fairy Wings2," Look through nature books or images on the internet to find a basic black-and-white outline for a butterfly or dragonfly's wing. You will need the basic shape as well as the ""cells"" (or smaller shapes inside the wing) to create a strong frame for your wings. Print this design out onto one or multiple sheets of paper (depending on size).


You will probably want to do two wings individually, as this will be much easier to manage than a single, unified set.

, Get a thick paper (or several layers of thick paper glue together) and place your printed wing on top and facing up. Firmly trace the outside of the lines with a pen so that you end up embossing the cardstock below.


This cardstock can be whatever color you want but black is recommended for realism and so that the wings will be easier to see.

, Cut out the design using an exacto knife or similarly strong cutting utensil. Be careful to get the lines as clean and even as you can, since the frame will be very visible.

, Use spray glue on both sides of the frame (with scrap or newspaper underneath), being careful not to get it stuck on anything. Take the glue-covered frame and place it on a sheet of cellophane.


Make sure to use cellophane and not shrink wrap.
Colored cellophane has color only on one side. You will want to glue that side so that it is facing or touching the frame. Test to know which side is which by using rubbing alcohol on a scrap or corner. If the color rubs away, this is the side that should be glued to the frame.
If you want to use glitter or paint or anything like that, do it after you have glued down the frame to this first layer.

, Place the second layer on the other side of the frame from the first. This will enclose the frame and any glitter or other additives you have placed in the cells.


Add more glue to the frame if you have not done the previous steps fast enough and the second layer will not adhere.

, Put your iron on the lowest setting and go over each side a few times. You do not want to over-iron or have your iron too hot, as this will make your wings look bad and melted.

, When everything is glued and ironed, trim the excess cellophane from around the edges of the wing.

, Take a wire coat hanger and open it up into a single line of wire. Create a loop with ears or Ichthys (Jesus fish) shape. The ""ears"" should be bent at the correct angle for your wings. Attach the wings to the ears.

, You can cut a hole in your costume or clothing and fit the wire loop through the hole. Bind the wire loop to the chest with an ACE bandage and you're good to go!

Draft an outline on your face.,
Fill in the outlines with white paint.,
Use black paint to define the eyebrows.,
Outline the smile and mouth.,
Rouge the cheeks, lips and nose.,
Correct any smudges.Check out your clown face in the mirror.",How to Face Paint a Clown1," The classic, auguste-style clown is they type you see at circuses. Auguste clowns have exaggerated makeup and are clumsy and bumbling, using on physical comedy to get audiences to laugh. To create an auguste look, map out the following plan to exaggerate your eyes, mouth and nose by using a black grease pencil to create outlines on your face.


Draw domes over your eyes. Start about half an inch from the outside corner of one eye, draw a dome whose peak ends somewhere between your eyebrow and your hairline, and end the dome at the inner corner of the same eye. Make a dome of the same size around the other eye.
Draw an exaggerated smile on your lower face. Start under your nose, and draw a line that curves up past your nostril and just under the apple of your cheek. Swoop the line down to create a big loop at your chin, then bring it up past your mouth, under the apple of the other cheek, and end just under your nose. The shape should resemble a big, exaggerated, open-mouthed smile.;
, Spread a layer of white base makeup inside the eye and smile outlines using a makeup sponge. The makeup should fully obscure your eyebrows. Evenly distribute the makeup inside the penciled outlines so that those areas seem to pop.


If you want a less traditional look, you can use a color other than white to fill in the outlines. Go for yellow or a light pastel color to make your features stand out.
Using black, purple, blue, or another dark-colored paint to fill in the outlines can also have a dramatic effect. If you choose this route, you'll want to invert the rest of the color scheme, too, to create a balance overall look and make sure each component is visible.
Consider setting your base makeup. This is done with theatrical face powder and a powder puff; the powder holds the makeup in place all day long. Use powder that matches the paint you are setting.

Pour approximately 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz) of theatrical face powder on to the powder puff. Rub both sides of the powder puff together until it appears that the face powder has disappeared within the powder puff.
Pat the powder puff on your face until the entire area covered with base makeup has been in contact with the powder puff.



, Dip an application brush in black face paint. Run the brush from the bottom of the dome at the outer edge of your eye, up to the forehead, and back to the inner corner of your eye. Make the line as thin or as thick as you want. Repeat on the other side to define the other eyebrow.


Some Auguste clowns make a vertical black line running from just above the upper eyelid, down the middle of the eyelid, and ending about half an inch below the eye, at the bottom of the dome.
If you filled in the eye area with a dark paint color, instead of using white, use white or another bright color to define the eyebrows.

, Dip the applicator brush in black paint again, and this time use it to trace around the exaggerated smile shape you created. Make a thick line all the way around the shape. Try to make it symmetrical so that it looks the same on both sides.

, Use a clean makeup sponge to dab red paint lightly on the apples of your cheeks, above the black outline you made. Dab more red paint on the tip of your nose. When it dries, add a second layer so that it really stands out. Lastly, use red paint or lipstick to make your lips red as cherries.


Some clowns use black paint on their lips instead of red.
If you'd like, you can wear a red rubber or foam nose, but painting it red is perfectly acceptable.

, If you see spots that look smudged or uneven, use a sponge and a little water to wipe away the paint in that area. Dab the area dry with a towel, then reapply the makeup.

Choose a character.,
Make your face into a canvas.,
Create exaggerated features.,
Set your makeup each time you add a color.,
Smooth or fill in any inconsistencies.",How to Face Paint a Clown2," Character clowns are simply clowns that look like exaggerated versions of people, stereotypes, or emotions. For example, the classic ""sad clown"" look is a type of character clown. You could also be a perplexed clown, an angry clown, a doctor clown, or a sexy clown - you get the picture.

, Spread a thin layer of white base makeup on your face. Use the makeup sponge to evenly distribute the white base makeup to all areas of your face, covering your eyebrows as well. Most clowns will stop the application of the base makeup at their hairline, slightly below the jaw line and right in front of the earlobes.


Even out inconsistencies in the base makeup. Take a closer look at your base makeup and retouch any areas that have more or less makeup on them by patting them with the makeup sponge.
Remember to set your base makeup using theatrical face powder and a powder puff.

, Based on the character you have chosen to become, apply different colors of makeup and makeup designs to areas of your face you want to highlight.


If you're going to be a sad clown, choose a color to outline a frown around your mouth and down to your chin. Sad clowns often have black paint on the bottom half of their face, around the mouth, to indicate that they are unshaven.
If you want to be a perplexed clown, draw a thick, cocked eyebrow on your forehead, and a regular eyebrow on the other side.
To be a sexy clown, draw exaggerated black eyelashes above and blow your eyes, and use red to make large, luscious lips.

, Patting the powder puff on each different colored area will ensure the colors won't run together.

, Double check your clown makeup to make sure the lines are sharp and the colors aren't bleeding into the surrounding makeup.

Paint your face white.,
Outline your eyes with black.,
Paint small features in black.,
Make your lips red.",How to Face Paint a Clown3," Pierrot clowns are sophisticated, quiet, and tend to be dressed elegantly, with features that are understated instead of exaggerated. They look like ghosts. Their makeup usually involves a full face of white paint with delicate colors. The first step is to paint your entire face white, from the top of your forehead to below your chin, and from earlobe to earlobe. Be sure your eyebrows are covered. Set the paint using powder and a puff.

, Make your eyes look hollowed by rimming them with black paint. Line the top and bottom of your eyes and paint your eyelids black. Use mascara to cover your eyelashes in black, too.

, Dip your applicator brush in black paint and make a pair of small, downward-sweeping eyebrows about an inch above your real eyebrows. The eyebrows should give you the appearance of being sad and serious. You can use the black paint to create other small features, like a black teardrop flowing from one or both eyes. Some people simply draw a black dot on both cheeks.

, Use lipstick or red paint to make a small, rose-colored mouth, about half the length of your real lips. You can also lightly rouge your cheeks or make a defined red dot on each one.

Plan to make the project in the evening.,
Find a suitable jar for the fairies.,
Purchase some glow sticks.,
Activate the glow stick.,
Hold the glow stick over the jar and cut one of the ends off.,
Pour the contents into the jar.,
Sprinkle in some glitter.,
Consider adding some filler.,
Close the jar tightly and shake it.,
Decorate the jar.,
Take the jar into a dark room.",How to Make Fairies in a Jar1," This project will require glow sticks. Unfortunately, glow sticks only glow for a certain amount of time, so it would be best to do this project in the evening when it is already dark. This way, you will not be wasting any of your glow sticks' ""glow"" time.;
, You can use any size jar you want, but keep in mind that the smaller the jar is, the more glow you will get. A larger jar will have a less intense glow, and may require more glow sticks. You can also use a bulb-shaped glass bottle with a cork stopper.


Consider using a tinted mason jar. You can also tint the jar yourself by mixing a glossy decoupage glue with a few drops of food coloring, and then painting the jar with it.

, Any sort of glow stick will work, but the 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks will have better results than the bracelets or necklaces, which do not glow for very long. The size of your jar will determine how many glow sticks you will need to buy. The larger the jar is, the more glow sticks you will need.


You will need two to three glow sticks, depending on the size of the jar. For example, a 16-ounce (473.18 milliliters) jar will need two to three 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) glow sticks.Consider purchasing a long-lasting glow stick. Most glow sticks only shine for only shine for 2 to 3 hours, while others will shine for 4 to 6 hours. Some glow sticks, however, will shine for up to 12 hours. The package will tell you how many hours the glow stick will shine for. The longer the glow stick shines, the longer you will be able to enjoy your fairy jar.
Consider purchasing multiple colors of glow sticks. Most glow sticks come in basic colors, such as: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white. You can create new and exciting colors by combining existing ones. For example, if you mix blue and green together, you will get teal.

, Hold the glow stick with two hands, and bend it in half until you hear a ""snap."" This will shatter the glass tube inside the glow stick and release the chemicals that cause it to glow.








, You can use a craft knife or a pair of scissors. Glow sticks are non-toxic, but the chemicals can burn and irritate your skin. Protect yourself by wearing some rubber gloves for this step.


Adult supervision is required for this step.
Consider placing a small, tightly-woven strainer over the mouth of the jar. The strainer will catch any bits of glass that might fall out of the glow stick. Do not use this strainer for cooking or baking after this project.

, Turn the glow stick upside down and pour the liquid into the jar. You may have to shake the tube a little bit to get all of the liquid out.









If there are any large pieces of glass inside the jar, you can scoop them out using a plastic fork or spoon. Discard the fork or spoon after using it; do not use it again for eating.

, You can use any type of glitter you want, but iridescent glitter will give you the best results because it will allow the glow to shine through. How much glitter you use will depend on the size of your jar as well a your preferences. For example, for an extra glittery 16-ounce jar (473.18 milliliters), you will need ¼ cup (32 grams) of super-fine glitter.









Consider using shaped pieces of glitter, such as flowers, hearts, and stars.Consider mixing super-fine glitter and chunky crafting glitter in different colors for an interesting effect., The glow stick fluid will cause the glitter to stick to the sides of the jar, but you can make the glitter appear as though it is suspended inside the jar by adding filler, such white tulle or organza.You can also use clear, iridescent cellophane. Simply cut a piece of your chosen filler, and scrunch it inside the jar. You want it to be big enough so that fits loosely into the jar, but not so big that it completely stuffs the jar.

, Be sure the glow stick material and glitter coats the inside walls of the jar.








, You can make your jar extra special by painting the lid or even covering it with some glitter or pretty fabric. Read the section in this article on decorating your jar for more ideas.

, The glow stick fluid will shine during daylight, but it will be even brighter and more effective in a dark room.

Purchase some battery-operated LED string lights.,
Find a suitable jar for the fairies.,
Attach the battery pack to the inside of the lid.,
Tuck the lights inside the jar.,
Consider adding some filler.,
Turn the lights on and place the lid on the jar.,
Decorate the jar.,
Enjoy the jar in a dark room.",How to Make Fairies in a Jar2," The best lights for this project are the miniature LED string lights with a small battery pack. They are often used to decorate miniature villages and houses. You can also use ordinary-sized LED string lights, but make sure that they are battery operated and that the wire is not too long. Look for something with a silver or white-colored cable. You are using LED lights because they do not produce as much heat as regular lights.


If you are planning on filling your jar with moss, then consider getting some lights with a green cable instead.

, You can use any sort of jar you want, but make sure that the battery pack to your lights can fit inside the mouth of the jar.


Consider using a tinted jar. You can also make your own tinted jar by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue and painting the jar with it.
For a softer effect, paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue. This will soften the glow of the jar, so that you will see the lights, but not the wire.

, Tape your battery pack to the bottom of the jar lid. The battery pack will go inside the jar, and won't be visible once you finish decorating it. Make sure that you can still reach the switch. You could try taping the battery pack, so it will be easier to take the pack out and change/charge the batteries.


If the battery pack does not fit inside the jar or the lid, purchase a canning mason jar with a two-part lid. Get rid of the flat disk portion of the lid and keep the ring. Tape the battery pack to the top of the lid, and cover it with a piece of fabric. You will wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the fabric after you put the lid on the jar to secure the fabric. The string of lights will go through the hole in the lid and into the jar., Spread them out so that they fill the entire jar.

, By adding some filler, such as white tulle, organza, or clear, iridescent cellophane, you can diffuse the light and make it appear softer. The filler will also help conceal the wires. Simply cut a piece of filler that is slightly larger than your jar and tuck it inside. You want the filler to be large enough so that it can be scrunched up loosely in the jar, but not so large that you have to stuff it in tightly.


You can also use some moss instead of tulle, organza, or cellophane. This will create a more forest-y effect.

, Flick the switch on the battery pack into the ""on"" position and place the lid on top of the jar. Screw the lid on tightly.

, You may still see a bit of the battery pack. You can conceal it by wrapping a ribbon around the neck of the jar and tying it in a bow. For more decorating ideas, refer to the section in this article on decorating your fairy jar.

, The lights will still be visible during daylight, but they will be even brighter and more effective in a completely dark room (especially if you made the jar look frosted).

Choose a clear jar.,
Clean your jar.,
Purchase some glow-in-the-dark paint.,
Select your painting tools.,
Prepare your paint.,
Make little dots inside the jar.,
Let the paint dry before putting the lid back on.,
Activate the paint.,
Consider decorating the jar.,
Use the jar.",How to Make Fairies in a Jar3," You can use any size jar, but make sure that the mouth is wide enough for you to be able to stick a paint brush into. You can use a glass jar or a plastic jar. A lid is not needed for this project. Whatever jar you decide to use, make sure that it is clear, as you will be painting the inside of it.

, Wipe the inside and outside of your jar with some rubbing alcohol. Any oil or residue left on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking to it.

, You can use fabric paint or acrylic paint, but make sure that the label says ""glow-in-the-dark."" Unlike glow sticks, glow-in-the-dark paint can be reactivated once the glow fades. This means that you can use this jar again and again just by leaving it in the sunlight so that it can ""recharge.""

, You will be making little dots and speckles inside the jar with the paint. You can use a thin paintbrush to do this, or a long wooden skewer. You can even use different sized brushes and wooden skewers to create different sized dots for a more interesting effect.

, Shake the bottle of paint to mix up the glow particles inside.Pour out about a teaspoon of paint onto a dish. Acrylic paint and fabric paint dry quickly, so you do not want to pour out too much paint at once, or it will dry before you finish using it. You can always pour more paint onto your dish if you run out.

, Dip your paintbrush or skewer into the paint and start making little dots and speckles inside the jar. If you are using multiple colors, work with one color at a time.

, This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, but refer to the instructions on the paint bottle for more specific drying times. Consider drying your jar in the sun or under a bright light; this will allow the paint to ""charge.""

, Leave your jar in a brightly-lit room or in some sunlight for 10 to 15 minutes.

, You can paint the lid a different color, or over it with glitter or fabric. You can even place some filler, such as tulle, organza, or clear, iridescent cellophane inside the jar, For more decorating ideas, refer to the section on decorating your fairy jar.

, Once the paint has been activated, take your jar into a dark room. The paint will glow and look like little fairies. When the glow starts to fade, simply leave the jar in some like for a few minutes before taking it back into the room.

Add a filler.,
Add a fairy inside the jar.,
Paint the lid.,
Add glitter to the lid.,
Cover the lid with some fabric.,
Embellish the lid.,
Tie a ribbon around the neck of the jar.,
Use a colored jar.,
Add fairy-shaped silhouettes.",How to Make Fairies in a Jar4," Adding items, such as tulle, organza, cellophane, stuffing, or even moss can help diffuse the light and make the jar look more magical. When choosing tulle or organza, go for a very soft, pale color, or white. When choosing cellophane, go for something iridescent, as it will reflect the light better. You can also use teddy bear stuffing and pieces of moss instead.

, Purchase a small fairy figurine, and glue her to the inside of the jar lid using hot glue or super glue. Screw the lid back onto the jar, and turn the jar upside down. The lid will now be the bottom of the jar, making it a sort of snow globe.


Consider gluing gown bits of moss, stones, and tiny flowers to the lid around the fairy. This will hide the bottom of the lid, and give the fairy a pretty home to live in.
If you cannot find a fairy figurine, you can make your own by purchasing a person-shaped figurine, and gluing craft butterfly wings to the back.

, You can make your fairy jar more colorful by painting the lid. Lightly buff the lid with fine-grit sandpaper, and wipe it clean with a damp cloth to get rid of any dust. Paint the lid with some acrylic paint using a paintbrush or a foam brush. You can also use spray paint instead.


If you are using spray paint, shake the can for a few moments until you can hear it rattle. Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface and apply the paint in a light, even layer. Wait until the paint dries before applying a second layer. Make sure to spray paint in a well-ventilated area to avoid any light-headedness.

, For a more sparkly lid, brush on a layer of glue onto the top of the lid. Don't paint the sides with glue just yet. Pour some glitter onto the lid. Gently lift the lid off your work surface and tap the glitter off. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry before applying glue and glitter to the sides.


Consider working over a sheet of paper. When you are done, fold the paper in half, and use it to funnel the excess glitter back into its container.
Consider sealing the glitter so that it doesn't shed. Wait for the glue and glitter to dry, then apply a thin, even coat of clear, glossy spray paint. Wait for the coat to dry completely before applying a second one.

, Place the lid on top of some pretty fabric. Trace a circle around the lid—make the circle about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) larger than the lid. Cut the circle out of the fabric and screw the lid onto the jar. Place the fabric circle on top of the lid and push the edges down around the sides of the lid. Wrap a piece of ribbon or twine around the neck of the jar, holding the fabric in place. Tie the ribbon or twine into a pretty bow.

, Take a few colorful gemstones or rhinestones, and glue them onto the lid using hot glue or tacky glue. You can also glue beads, buttons, pretty rocks, or even a figurine to the top of the jar.

, You can also decorate the ribbon by gluing a flower or rhinestone in the middle of the bow.

, Tinted mason jars come in different colors, including blue, green, and purple. They can help lend a more unique look to your fairy jar. If you cannot find a tinted mason jar, you can make your own by mixing a few drops of food coloring with a glossy decoupage glue. Paint the outside of the jar with the mixture using a paintbrush or a foam brush.


You can also paint the jar with a matte decoupage glue or matte spray-on sealer. This will give the glass a frosted look, and will work best with the battery-operated string lights.

, You can print out silhouettes of fairies and cut them out using a craft knife. Tape or glue the fairies to the outside of the jar.

Stick googly eyes on the head.,
Fold two black pipe cleaners in half.,
Glue the head to the front of the sheep.,
Thread the pipe cleaner front legs through the pom pom.,
Press the second pipe cleaner through the back of the pom pom.,
Adjust the pipe cleaners to allow the sheep to stand.",How to Make Pom Pom Sheep," To make the pom pom for the sheep, you’ll need a cardboard rectangle to wrap your yarn around. For a large sheep, cut a piece that’s 3-inches by 5-inches (8-cm by 13-cm). For small sheep, cut a piece that’s 3-inches by 2-inches (8-cm by 5-cm).








You can adjust the size of the cardboard to customize the size of sheep if you prefer.
After you cut the cardboard, it’s a good idea to wrap it in packing tape. That will allow the yarn to slide off it more easily when you’re finished making the pom pom.;
, For the pom pom, you need fluffy white, cream, brown, or black yarn. Instead of cutting the yarn to a certain length, remove an end from the ball or skein and begin wrapping it around the cardboard widthwise. For a large sheep, wrap the yarn around the cardboard 120 times. For a small sheep, wrap the yarn around the cardboard 75 to 80 times.








Use one hand to hold the end of the yarn in place as you wrap it side by side in a single layer on the cardboard. Once you’ve covered the cardboard, start creating a second layer over the first. Continue working until you’ve wrapped the yarn around the suggested number of times.
While white, cream, brown, or black yarn offers the most realistic sheep look, you can substitute your favorite color yarn, such as pink or blue.

, When you’ve completely wrapped the cardboard with the yarn, use your fingers to bend the cardboard slightly widthwise to contract it. That makes it easier to carefully slide the yarn from the card.








Be gentle as you pull the yarn from the cardboard and make sure to hold it together so it stays together.

, Once you’ve freed the yarn from the cardboard, use a piece of twine to secure the bundle in the middle. Tie the yarn as tightly as you can to ensure that it stays together.








If you don’t have twine, you can substitute a piece of yarn. However, twine is stronger than yarn so it usually does a better job of holding the pom pom together.

, When the yarn is securely tied with the twine, use a pair of scissors to cut the loops. This will create the pom pom shape for your sheep.








After you cut the loops, you may need to trim some pieces to get the look that you want for your sheep.

, To make the sheep’s face, you’ll need a piece of black craft foam. Use a pencil or pen to draw the shape of the sheep’s head, complete with ears, on the foam as a guide. Next, carefully cut the head out with a pair of scissors.








If you’re not comfortable drawing the sheep’s head freehand, you can find templates online at various craft websites, such as Dad Can Do .
The proper size for sheep’s head will depend on how large your pom pom is. It should fit on one end of the pom pom.
If you used dark yarn for the pom pom, use white craft foam for the head.
You can use a craft knife to cut out the head if you prefer.

, Once you’ve cut out the sheep’s head, select two googly eyes that will fit on it side by side. Apply your favorite type of craft glue to the back of the eyes, and press them onto the foam head.








You can find googly eyes in a variety of sizes at the craft store.
Make sure to let the glue dry for at least 5 minutes, so you can be sure the eyes won’t fall off when you begin to assemble the sheep.

, For the sheep’s legs, you’ll need two black pipe cleaners that are approximately 4- to 5-inches (10- to 13-cm) long. Bend the pipe cleaner in half to create a “V” shape., Add a dab of glue to the back of the sheep’s head that you’ve made. Carefully press it onto your pom pom, and hold it for 30 to 60 seconds to ensure that it is secure.








You can use any type of glue to secure that works on fabric to secure the head to the pom pom. However, you may have an easier time if you use a hot glue gun.

, Take one of the bent black pipe cleaners and push it through the pom pom on one side near the front. Make sure that the pipe cleaner is threaded through the yarn pom pom so it is secure.








Some thread may come loose when you thread the pipe cleaner through. You can trim any errant strands.

, After you’ve secured the pipe cleaner for the front legs, push the second one through the pom pom near the back. Pull it through to the other side to create the second set of legs.








Take care with your placement of the second pipe cleaner. You want to ensure that it’s far enough back from the first to provide proper balance for the sheep to stand.

, Once both pipe cleaners are threaded through the pom pom, bend the four ends to create feet that help the sheep stand. You may need to adjust the length of the pipe cleaners on each side to ensure that the sheep is balanced properly."

Sew or glue the medium pom-pom to the large pom-pom.,
Cut the small pom-pom in half and glue each half to a side of the head.,
Cut out paws and/or a tail.,
If you want, use glue dots to attach googly eyes to the head.,
That's it!

",How to Make Pom‐Pom Mice,"


If you sew it (this option works best), push the threaded needle through the center of the medium pom-pom, and through the center of the large pom-pom. Then repeat it in reverse.
To keep the mouse from falling apart, tie the to leftover ends of the thread together tightly.
If you glue it (this is quicker and easier) you will need to wait for the glue to dry completely before continuing.;
,


The head is the medium pom-pom, which has been sewn/glued to the body, the largest pom-pom.
Cutting the pom-pom can be difficult, so be patient.
Try to cut through the middle of the pom-pom, or it will fall apart.
When you glue on the ears, make sure they are straight or facing the way you want them to.
Wait until the glue is completely dry before moving on to the next step.
Do not use glue dots for this part! The ears only stick if liquid glue is used.

, Use a glue dot or liquid glue to stick them on.


The tail length is best between the length of the mouse, or double that length.
Glue dots are greatly preferred over liquid glue, as they do not require drying time.
Paws should be small. You can use small balls of pipe cleaner, little hands made from pipe cleaner (these look best but are extremely hard to make) or even no paws at all!
Make sure that you glue the paws on first; that will help decide where the tail would look best.
If your mouse will have a bendy, twisty, or curly tail, do that before gluing.

,


This step is not necessary, and some people find that the mice look cuter without eyes.
If you do use eyes, make sure they are on the head and in the right place.

Gather your materials.,
Create your butterfly shapes from the soda cans.,
Thread the butterflies onto the fishing line.,
Finish each individual wind chime.,
Tie the wind chimes to the embroidery hoop.",How to Make Butterfly Wind Chimes," These butterfly wind chimes will be made from recycled soda cans. To make them, you will need 3 or 4 empty soda cans, some fishing line, a sewing needle, some metal washers in various sizes, scissors, a wooden embroidery hoop, a single-hole punch, and a butterfly punch. A butterfly punch is a tool for punching out the shape of a butterfly into a piece of flat material; these can be purchased at fabric and craft stores.;
, The butterflies themselves will be made from the recycled soda cans. The number you'll want to make will vary depending on the size and design of your wind chimes. The design in this guide will make use of 12 butterflies.


Begin by preparing the cans for the butterfly punch. Using scissors, cut the top and bottom of each can away. Next, make a straight cut along the height of the can so that the aluminum can lay flat in a rectangular shape.
You may want to clean up the jagged edges of the rectangle by trimming them again with your scissors. It also helps to wipe the aluminum down with a damp rag so that any remaining soda residue is removed.
Use the butterfly punch to punch out your butterfly shapes from the sheet of aluminum. Punch out twice as many shapes as the number of butterflies you need. So, if you want 12 butterflies in your finished design, make 24 punches with the butterfly punch.

, Two butterflies will be suspended from each of 6 lengths of fishing line - one at the end, and one near the middle.


Begin by punching a hole in the middle of each butterfly shape using the single-hole punch. Then, lay each butterfly piece on top of another, so that the soda can pattern is facing out on both sides.
Thread the fishing line onto your sewing needle, and run the line through the hole in both of the butterfly pieces. Loop the fishing line back around the butterfly and knot it to secure the butterfly to the line. You can trim the excess fishing line with scissors.

, Each length of fishing line will be finished when it is knotted to 2 butterflies and 2 of the metal washers. You can choose the overall length of the fishing line and the spacing between its elements based on your own taste.


After tying one end of the fishing line to a butterfly, loop the other end through one of the metal washers. Knot the washer onto the line about 2 inches (5 cm) above the butterfly.
Continue by knotting the next butterfly 2 inches (5 cm) above the washer. Finally, knot the final washer above the second butterfly. The fishing line should now be knotted through a butterfly, a washer, a butterfly, and another washer in that order. Place the fishing line aside and repeat the process until all 6 are finished.
After the butterflies are knotted to the fishing line, you can give them a more voluminous appearance by bending their wings outward a little.

, The embroidery hoop will be the piece from which the chimes hang. Tie each free end of the fishing lines to 6 equally spaced points on the hoop. You can vary the overall length that each line hangs if desired. Once the fishing lines are secured, the wind chimes are ready for hanging. The hoop can be suspended using the fishing line or another type of string.

Put the finished bags somewhere safe during the party, such as on a table or on the floor but out of the way.",How to Make Dinosaur Goody Bags," Roughly get a number of how many bags you need. Choose plain bags if you are happy to decorate them yourself, or buy ones with dinosaur designs printed on them if you aren't keen on making the bag. You can usually buy party goody bags from your local party supplies store, department stores that stock party items, quality paper/stationery stores and online sellers.

Always have more bags than guests, in case of additional guests, errors or the like.

,, You can make them in any of the following ways:

Stamped dinosaur goody bags
Attaching dinosaur images
Hand drawn dinosaur goody bag
Cardboard cut-out dinosaur goody bag.


Each of these types is explained in the following steps.

, Use your own dinosaur stamps or purchase some. These stamps can be found in the dollar store, through retailers who sell stamping equipment (hobby, craft and toy stores) and from online sellers.

Decide on the design. Either stamp the dinosaurs onto the goody bag randomly, or design a pattern on a piece of plain paper first and use that as a guide.
Stamp the dinosaurs in place. It's easier to do this as a production line if there are lots to do––set the goody bags out in a row and work your way down the row methodically.
Write, print or stick on the words ""Dino Goody Bag"" if wished.

, Find suitable pictures of dinosaurs in magazines, old books, online pictures printed off or stickers.

Decide on the design. Either glue or stick the dinosaurs onto the goody bag randomly, or design a pattern on a piece of plain paper first and use that as a guide.
Glue or stick the dinosaur images or stickers in place. It's easier to do this as a production line if there are lots to do––set the goody bags out in a row and work your way down the row methodically.
Write, print or stick on the words ""Dino Goody Bag"" if wished.

, This is best done by young children, allowing them the freedom to draw any dinosaurs they like. Don't make this too involved, especially not if there are lots of goody bags to make, as it can be time consuming and the bags are never kept for long anyway.

Set out the goody bags. Give your child plenty of coloring tools (markers, pencil, paint).
Ask your child to draw at least one dinosaur on each bag. They're allowed to add a tree or more than one dinosaur if they like but not too much, as they need to finish all of the bags needed.

, Draw or find an image of a dinosaur that is the size of the goody bag. It can be slightly bigger if wished, as having some of the image hang over the top or sides of the bag is fine. Make a template of this design for tracing around. Another alternative is to purchase or make a stencil.

Transfer the image to thin cardboard by tracing around the template (or stencil). Use any colors you like, perhaps match the cardboard to a party color theme if relevant.
Make as many as you have goody bags.
Cut the dinosaur images out. Be as neat as possible.
Glue the image onto the front of each goody bag. Do not allow any of the image to go under the base of the bag but sticking out of the sides and top is fine. The base needs to be able to stand up properly.
Allow to dry. Done. The cut-outs can be written on, such as a child's name, if wished.

, Head on down to the dollar store or other cheap toy or party supplies store to find some dinosaur related goodies. Here are some ideas for fillers:

Toy dinosaurs
Dinosaur stickers or temporary tattoos
Dinosaur candies
Dinosaur play sets
Dinosaur coloring books
Dinosaur mini games
Dinosaur poster or postcards
Dinosaur wallets or purses, and so forth.

, Consider tying a helium-filled balloon on the handles to keep the bag tied together. All the better if you can find a dinosaur-designed balloon., When the kids are leaving, hand out the goody bags as they go."

Punch a hole through the snake if you want to hang it.",How to Make a Paper Snake1," This is a simple snake that you can make out of a paper plate. It lays flat on your table, but springs up into a long snake when you hang it! Here's a list of what you will need:


Paper plate
Acrylic or tempera paint
Paintbrushes, spongers, etc
Pencil or pen
Scissors
Crayons, markers, or googly eyes
Red paper or ribbon
White school glue or tacky glue
String, thumbtack, hole punch (optional)
Rhinestones, glitter, etc (optional);
, Be sure not to go too far into the middle or else it may not be big enough.


If you don't have a paper plate, use a small plate to trace a circle onto a large sheet of paper. Cut the circle out using a pair of scissors, and use that circle instead.

, You can paint the snake however you want. You can use a paintbrush, a sponge, or even your fingers. Snakes come in many different colors and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Paint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry. Next, dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel. Then, dab the sponge all over the plate. If you want to add another color, wait for the first one to dry. This will give you a scale-like effect.Wrap a sheet of bubble wrap (bubble-side-out) around a rolling pin and secure it with tape. Pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across. Next, roll the pin across the plate. You will get a scale effect.You can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake's belly. Most snakes have a plain, light colored belly. Do this once the top of the snake dries., Make the spiral about half an inch thick. It doesn't have to be perfect, but try to make it even all the way around. The center of the spiral will be the snake's head, so make it rounded.


You are drawing the spiral on the back so that you won't see it on the top.

, Start front the outside of the spiral, and work your way in. Try to do this right on the line, because you don't want the line to show on the finished product.

, At this point, you can paint on some extra designs to make your snake even more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Paint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake.
Paint Xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern.
Glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue.Try not to add too many, or your snake will be too heavy.
Make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue. Then, shake some glitter onto the glue. Tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry.

, You can draw the eyes on using a marker or crayons. You can also paint the eyes on. If you have googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue.


Remember, the head is the rounded part in the middle of the spiral.

, Cut a thin 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08) long rectangle out of red paper. You can also use a piece of thin, red ribbon. Cut a V shape into one end of the rectangle. This will be the snake's forked tongue. Lift the head up and glue the tongue under it.

, You can punch the hole at the end of the tail, right between the eyes, or even in the tongue. Thread a piece of string through the hole and tie it in a knot. Use the other end of the string to hang the snake from a door knob, a stick, or even a thumbtack in the wall.

Red paper
Scissors
Glue stick, tape, or stapler
White school glue or tacky glue
Markers, crayons, or googly eyes

, You will need at least three pieces. You can use all one color to make a solid-colored snake. You can also use different colors if you want a striped snake.

, You will need at least 16 strips. The more you make, the longer your snake will be.Consider stacking the paper and cutting several sheets at the same time. This will make the cutting part faster., Pick up a strip of paper and bring the two ends together. Overlap them by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Use a glue stick to hold them together. You can also use tape or a stapler instead.


Do not use white school glue or tacky glue. It does not dry fast enough. Your snake will fall apart before the glue dries.
If you are using a stapler, ask an adult to help you.

, You can make your snake just one color, or you can make it many colors. You can give your snake a pattern, or make the colors random.

, Cut a skinny rectangle from red paper and cut a V shape into one end to make the fork. Fold the flat side over by about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to make a tab. Glue the tab to one of the end rings.

Make the head from fuzzy balls.,
Glue the head piece on about an inch (2.5cm) from the top of the body piece.,
Finished.",How to Make a Fuzzy Ball Pipe Cleaner Butterfly," Lay down two full length fuzzy wires side by side, both in the same color. Twist the two fuzzy wires together from one end. Leave about one inch (2.5cm) at the top for the antenna (untwisted).;
, This will form the antenna. The body piece is now ready for adding the wings to.

, Use one fuzzy wire for the first wing. Here you might wish to change to a different color from the body piece. Shape the fuzzy wire into a half circle shape. Attach it to the body piece by winding the ends around the body piece. Attach about one inch (2.5cm) from the top of the body piece and the other end in the middle of the body piece. This forms the top of the first wing.


To attach, wind the ends around firmly about twice or three times. Use as little wire as possible for winding on, to allow most of the wire to serve as the wing.

, Wrap just underneath each of the attachment areas of the already added wing, using another piece of fuzzy wire in the same color. After adding this, you should have two top wing pieces firmly in place. When done, the whole piece should look like an oval.

, Take another piece of fuzzy wire, either in the same color as the top wings or in a different but matching color. Make a half circle. This time, tie one end in the middle and the other end to near the base of the body piece.

, Attach just under the attachment parts for the first bottom wing. When done, the whole thing should look like a figure eight.

,, Glue two balls together. Ideally, these would be in the same color, to give a uniform impression of the head shape.

, Or, add it just under the antenna. Add googly eyes if you'd like, or just leave it as it is.

, Now it's time to enjoy your new butterfly creation.

Admire your work.",How to Make a Cow1," Cover all sides of a large wooden spool with white craft paint. Allow the paint to dry.


Note that the spool will be the body of the cow.
Since you need to paint the entire spool, separate the work into two steps so that the paint can dry properly. Paint the cylindrical side first, and after it dries, paint the top and bottom faces.;
, Cover the cylindrical side of the spool with spots of black paint. Let the paint dry.


These spots should extend all the way around the body and should look like the spots on a cow.
To make the spots more realistic, give them rounded but uneven sides and try to avoid creating any patterns or symmetry when laying them out.

, Place one flat, circular face of the spool on top of white card stock. Trace around this circle in pencil.


Cut out the resulting circle. You'll use it for the face of the cow.
Note that white felt or white craft foam could also work if you do not have white card stock.

, Give the cow a pink snout, black nostrils, and two googly eyes.


To create the nose, begin by drawing a semi-circle over the bottom half of the card stock circle. Color in this semi-circle with pink marker or paint, then draw to small black ovals near the top edge of the semi-circle.
For the eyes, glue two googly craft eyes halfway between the snout and the top edge of the spool.

, Draw two small leaf shapes on white card stock. Cut out both shapes for use as the cow's ears.


Keep the ears proportionate to the size of the face. Each one should be approximately the same size as one craft eye.

, Use pink marker to color in the center of each ear on one side of the paper.


The pink center should follow the basic shape of the overall ear outline, but it should only take up roughly one-half to three-quarters of the ear.

, Sketch out two rectangles in pencil, making each one long enough to wrap around the side of the spool once. Each should only be as wide as the width of one ear.


Cut out both rectangles when finished.
Each rectangle will turn into two legs. One will become both back legs and the other will become both front legs.

, Color both tips of both rectangles in black marker. These black tips will become the cow's hooves.

, Use craft glue to attach the face, ears, and legs to the spool. Let the glue dry before continuing.


Glue the face onto one flat end of the spool.
Position both ears over the top edge of the same end, gluing them in place behind the face.
Glue the center of one leg rectangle to the bottom of the cylindrical side, positioning it near the face end of the spool. Repeat with the other leg rectangle, putting it closer to the opposite end of the spool. Allow the ends of both rectangles to hang loose.

, Clip a small piece of black pipe cleaner and use craft glue to attach it to the blank flat end of the spool. Let the glue dry.


The tail should be roughly one-half to three-quarters the length of the spool body.

, The spool cow is finished and ready to show off.

Observe your work.",How to Make a Cow2," You can start with two empty toilet paper rolls or one empty paper towel roll.


If you use the paper towel roll, cut it in half. Refer to each half as a separate roll for the remainder of the instructions.
Cut one of the rolls in half. Save one half for use as the cow's head and discard the other half.
Cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off one end of the other roll. This roll will become the body of the cow. Discard the excess 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Using pencil, lightly sketch two ovals onto one end of the head piece, positioning them on opposite sides of the cylindrical perimeter.


These ovals will become ears. Each one should be about one-quarter the length of the tube.
Carefully cut along three-quarters of each oval outline, leaving the innermost end of each oval alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the sides of the tube, creating ears.

, Draw two small triangles near one end of the tube, centering them in between both ears.


These triangles will become horns. They should be smaller than half the size of one ear.
Carefully cut along two edges of each triangle, leaving the innermost edge alone. Fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the side of the tube, creating horns.

, Cut two compartments out of an empty egg carton. Discard the rest of the carton.


These two sections will become the legs of your cow. One section will form both front legs and the other will form both back legs.
Carefully cut out the front and back of both sections, leaving the sides and bottoms intact.

, Paint both cardboard tubes and both egg carton sections white. Allow the paint to dry.


You should paint both sides of the ear slits, but you do not need to paint the horn slits at this time.

, Use black paint to add spots to the head and body of the cow. Let the paint dry when finished.


To create realistic spots, paint spots with uneven sides. Avoid sharp points, opting for rounded corners instead.
Note that you should also space the spots apart in uneven intervals instead of creating patterns or symmetry.

, Paint a small pink oval in the front side of each ear. Paint both sides of each horn gray. Let the paint dry.


The pink inner ear should follow the outline of the ear slit, but you should leave some blank white space around the edge of each center.

, Using craft glue, adhere two googly craft eyes onto the face. Allow the glue to dry completely.


Both eyes should lie just in front of the ears along the length of the head. Place each eye in between one horn and one ear along the width (perimeter) of the head.

, Glue both egg carton pieces onto the same side of the body roll. Glue the head onto the opposite side of the body roll.


Turn both carton sections upside-down so that the flat bottoms become the tops. Place one section near the front of the body and the other section near the back.
With the cow standing on its egg carton feet, glue the back half of the head onto the top of the body.

, Once everything dries, stuff cotton balls into both open cardboard rolls.


Use enough cotton to tightly back both rolls. If you pack it tightly enough, you should not need to use glue to hold the cotton in place.

, Cut a small piece of pink pipe cleaner out and glue it to the cotton at the front of the face.


The pink pipe cleaner should roughly match the diameter of the cardboard tube.
Bend the pipe cleaner into a slight curve to give the cow a smile.
Use glue to attach the pipe cleaner to the bottom half of the cotton at the front of the face.

, Cut a small length of white yarn. Use glue to attach one end to the top of the cardboard body at the back of the cow.


The tail should be at least as long as the diameter of the tube, if not a little longer.

, The cardboard cow is finished and ready to admire.

Enjoy.",How to Make a Cow3," Use scissors to cut off the rounded toe end, removing roughly one-fifth of the sock in the process.


On a standard adult sock, the length of the cut portion should be between 4 and 5 inches (10 and 12.5 cm).
The cut toe portion will become the head of the cow. Save the rest of the sock for the body.

, Stuff the cut toe portion with a small bundle of fiberfill or similar filling material. Leave the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) empty; glue or sew the ends together.


Fold the raw open edge in by no more than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
To create a rounded head, you'll need to begin by gluing the sides of the empty portion together. Glue the opening closed, then fold it down over the stuffed bundle. Stitch or glue the folded material in place.

, Cut off the back opening of the sock, removing a portion equal in length to the original cut toe portion.


The cut portion should be about one-fifth the length of the original sock. On a standard adult's sock, this should be roughly 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm).
You'll use parts of this cut portion for the ears. The leftover sock will be used for the body.

, Cut the cuff in half, parallel to the ribbing. Cut out one long oval from each half.


Each oval should have roughly the same width and length of the cuff half.
These ovals will become the ears. You can discard the rest of the cuff material.

, Fold one oval in half crosswise. Using a needle and thread, blanket stitch over the the raw, rounded edge. Repeat with the second oval.


Alternatively, you can use hot glue to hold the ear halves together. Lay a thin stream of hot glue around the entire edge, then carefully press the raw edges into the glue. With the raw edges trapped, fold the oval in half crosswise, sticking both ends together.

, Place the flat edge of one ear along one fold of the head. Repeat with the other ear and the other head fold.


You should be able to attach the ears with either thread or hot glue.

, Sew two buttons two the front of the head, positioning them roughly halfway between the ears and the original toe-seam of the sock.

, Peel the backings off two small, self-adhesive round felt pads. Place each pad onto the original two-seam of the head.


Align these felt pads to the eyes of the cow.

, Flip the remaining sock over so that the heel faces up. Cut straight slits through both sides of the material from either end of the sock.


Keep both slits as centered as possible from either end. Each should span roughly one-half to two-thirds the space in between the open end and the nearest side of the heel. On a standard adult's sock, the slits should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) long.

, Turn the sock inside-out and sew along all of the raw edges, leaving roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) open along the back slit.


As you sew along the slits and the raw open edges, you should see the legs of the cow taking shape. The front of the sock should form the front legs and the back of the sock should form the back legs.
Once you finish sewing along these raw edges, turn the body right-side out again through the remaining gap.

, Insert fiberfill or a similar material into the body of the cow through the open gap.


When finished, carefully turn the raw edge inward. Glue or edge-stitch the opening closed.

, Place the head of the cow in between the heel and the front legs. Sew or glue into place.

, Cut a piece of brown yarn equal in length to the cow's back legs. Knot both ends of the yarn, then stitch or glue it in place.


The yarn become the tail of the cow. You'll need to attach one end to the back of the heel, centering it in between the two back legs. The other end should hang free.

, The sock cow should now be finished.

,
Congratulations!",How to Create an Adorable Pom Pom Pet," pick your favorite yarn and decide how big you want your new friend to be. For a small pet you should use about 10 feet (3.0 m) of yarn, 15-30 for a medium sized pet, and about 40-45 for a large pet. Also cut about two feet of yarn to tie him/her together.;
, Do not wrap too tightly or you might hurt yourself!

, You'll need to do this pretty tightly so your pom pom pet doesn't fall apart. It is recommended that you ask a friend to help you, unless you can tie it tightly by yourself.

, His fur will most likely look uneven, so give him a trim so he's neat and circular. As for the long pieces that came from when you tied him, you should cut those so they're the same length as the rest of his fur.

, You're not done yet! Your little buddy still can't see! So, grab some googly eyes (or be creative and make your own eyes), and glue or tape them on! Glue will stick better, but you will also have to wait a while before his eyes are dry, so if you can't wait, just tape them on!

, To do this, put some pipe cleaners in! (This is not needed though, because pom pom pets can cling to things and maneuver without arms and legs.)

Be sure to tear off the lid and front flaps so that you have just the strip.You can use any size egg carton you want. The more eggs it holds, the longer your caterpillar will be!
A cardboard egg carton will work better than the foam kind because it is easier to paint.;
, Green is the most popular caterpillar color, but you can make yours any color you want. To make a ""very hungry caterpillar,"" paint the first cup red for the head, then paint the rest green.Let the paint dry before moving on.


You can paint the inside of the carton, but you need to let the outside dry first.

, The holes need to be right next to the narrow edge. Use a pen, pencil, or skewer to poke the holes. It would be a good idea to ask an adult to help you with this step.

, Turn the carton so that you can see the inside. Stick each end of a pipe cleaner through one of the holes. Flip the carton over and tug on both ends of the pipe cleaner so that it's even.

The pipe cleaner can be any color. Yellow will work the best, but you can use black too!

, Twist the antenna together once or twice, then spread them open in a V. Use scissors to cut the antenna shorter, then glue a mini pompom to the top of each one. You can use any color of pompom you want. Red would work well with yellow pipe cleaners!Hot glue will work the best, but you can use tacky glue as well. Hold the pompoms in place for about 30 seconds to help them stick.
If you don't have pompoms, curl the ends of the antenna with a pencil instead.

, Glue some googly eyes to the front of the first cup, just below the antenna. Hold them down for about 30 seconds. This will help them stick better.Next, use a marker to draw on a mouth.

If you can't find googly eyes, you can draw them on instead.
For a girly caterpillar, add rosy cheeks and lashes.
For a silly caterpillar, glue a small, red pompom to the middle of the face for the nose.

, Your caterpillar is done, but you can make it look more colorful and interesting by adding some details. Here are some ideas:


Draw on the caterpillar with glitter glue.
Paint some polka dots or stripes onto the caterpillar.
Stick foam stickers onto the caterpillar.

For a regular caterpillar, use 7 pompoms.For a puppet caterpillar, use 11 pompoms., You can glue the pompoms together with hot glue or glue dots.You can also use fabric glue or tacky glue, but you will need to wait for the glue to dry.


An older child thread a needle with embroidery thread, then string the pom poms onto the thread. Be sure to knot the thread securely at both ends., You can use hot glue, tacky glue, or fabric glue. If you are using tacky glue, hold the eyes in place for about 30 seconds to help them stick. Let the glue dry before moving on., Cut two short pieces of pipe cleaner. Glue each piece to the top of the caterpillar's head. You can have them stick straight up, or make them angle outward like a V. Hot glue will work the best, but you can use fabric glue or tacky glue. Let the glue dry before moving on.


An older child can thread a needle, then pull two short pieces of colored embroidery thread up through the bottom of the caterpillar's head., Cut two long pieces of fishing line.

Consider using a soft, fuzzy sock for a fluffy caterpillar., If you can't find any, you can use cotton balls or scraps of yarn.You can also use six 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) Styrofoam balls. If you are using Styrofoam balls, you may not fit all of them into the sock. Don't try to cram them in., If the sock was very long, you may still have some leftover. Cut the extra sock off so that you have a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) stub.If you are using Styrofoam balls, leave enough space in the sock so that the balls can wiggle.

, You can also use pieces of colorful yarn instead. Plan on having about six segments. If you used Styrofoam balls, tie a rubber band/piece of yarn between each ball., Turn the sock caterpillar so that the toe part is facing you. Glue two googly eyes on top, right above the seam. Hot glue or tacky glue will work the best. You can also use a hot glue with an adult's help., You can use the seam on the toe part as a mouth. You can also draw your own mouth with a marker. If you want to, you can add some more details, such as rosy cheeks or eyelashes. For a silly caterpillar, glue a small pompom onto the face for the nose.

For a rustic touch, use buttons instead of googly eyes. You can sew or glue them on.

, The neck is the first joint behind the head. Find the middle of a pipe cleaner, then place it under the caterpillar. Wrap both ends around the neck, then twist them together once or twice., Pull the antenna apart to make a V-shape. Curl each end downward with a pencil.You can also cut the antenna shorter and hot glue a mini pompom to the tips., You don't have to do this if you don't want to.

, You can use acrylic, poster, or tempera paint for this. To make a ""very hungry caterpillar,"" you will need three green rings and one red ring.If you made the rings out of green paper, skip this step.

, Glue all of the rings together in a row with the side/curved edges touching. Glue the red ring to the end of the row to make the head. You will have something that looks like this: oooo.

Keep the rings straight. If they are crooked, the caterpillar won't stand.

, You can draw the eyes one with a black marker, or you can glue on a pair of googly eyes. To make a ""very hungry caterpillar, do the following:Cut two small ovals out of yellow paper.
Cut two smaller ovals out of green paper.
Glue the green ovals onto the yellow ovals to make the pupils.
Glue the yellow ovals onto the caterpillar's head.

, Use a black marker to draw a simple smile in the middle of the face, just below the eyes., Cut a pipe cleaner in half first. Set one of the halves aside for another project. Fold the remaining half into a V-shape.For a ""very hungry caterpillar,"" use a purple pipe cleaner.

, Fill the space between the red ring and the first green ring with glue. Set the antenna into the glue, pointy-side-down. Hold it there until the glue dries. If you can't wait that long, use a hot glue gun instead., Once the caterpillar is dry, you can stand it up on its side. If it keeps falling over, place some double-sided tape on the bottom, then stand it back up again. The tape will stick to your desk, and keep the caterpillar steady."

Break off a small piece of clay to form the head.,
Roll the head into a ball.,
Form arms and legs out of the snake.,
Pose the arms and legs.,
Form the head of the animal.",How to Create Clay Animals," Any sort of clay will work, though modeling clay will work best. Use a lump of clay that is firm enough to hold a position, but soft enough to be sculpted. The more clay you use, the bigger the animal will be. Start off with a piece of clay that you can comfortably hold in one hand -- about the size of a tangerine.


Make sure to place the clay on a flat surface.;
, Just place your hand flat over the clay and roll your palm and fingers up and down until you've created a long and round shape. You can even squeeze the clay a bit so it's already long and not too thick before you really start rolling it so the process is easier.

, Just break off about 1/5 of the snake to separate the clay that you'll use to make the animal's head. To break off the head, just gently pinch the snake at the part where you want to pull of the head and pull it off with your other hand.

, To roll the head into a ball, simply place your palm over the clay and roll it in a circular motion. It shouldn't take more than a few seconds to roll the head into a neat round ball.

, First, roll the snake one more time to even out the edge that you broke off to form the head. Take a popsicle stick or something with a similar shape and firmness and push it down through the left and right side of the snake. Lift it and see that you've created two arms and two legs for your clay creature.


Make sure at least 1/3 of the snake stays untouched. This will be the body of the creature.

, You can pose the arms and legs any way you want depending on what the animal is doing, whether it's sitting, standing, pouncing, rolling over, or lying down. Here's how you can pose the arms and legs a variety of ways:


Sitting. To make the pose the arms and legs in sitting position, simply bend the clay in the middle and bend the clay so that the entire body and the arms are bent forward, creating an upside-down ""U."" Then, move the back legs forward so that they face the same direction as the arms and are curved over as well. They should be partly resting on the floor in the back so the creature is in true sitting position.
Standing (on all fours). Just lift up the torso and lift up the back and front legs, resting it slightly more on the back legs, but making sure that both the arms and legs are positioned perpendicularly to the torso and floor. The front half of the creature will be lifted higher than the back half. This will help support the head.
Lying down. Tuck the legs slightly under the body and stretch the arms out forward so the creature can by spread out on the floor. You can also stretch the legs back instead of tucking them in, as long as it's clear that the creature is lying down. Just lift up the part of the snake that will support the head slightly.

, You can create eyes, ears, a nose, a mouth, and even eyebrows or whiskers if your want. You can use your fingers to pinch the ears of the animal gently upward, and use a toothpick to draw the creature's features onto the head.


If you're making a creature with floppy ears, you can roll two tiny snakes and then flatten them out and stick them to the sides of the head.
You can also make pointy ears by pinching the sides of the animal's head more strongly.
When you're done creating the features, connect the head to the front of the snake, or the neck. Gently pinch the clay below the head to help position it.
You can also use different colors of clay to add different features to the animal, such as spots or a cute bow-tie.

Choose vegetables with consistent coloring.,
Boil your vegetables.,
Dehydrate your vegetables or herbs.,
Grind the dried veggies into a powder.,
Select foods that are already in powder form.",How to Make Natural Food Coloring1," Greens with dark leaves (such as spinach) and many root vegetables (such as carrots and beets) tend to work well as food dyes because they have deep, consistent, opaque coloring. Your natural food dyes will be most effective if you choose veggies that are mostly one color throughout (and which have a color that is bright or deep).Some vegetables may seem like good candidates for natural food dye, but if they have high water content (as does celery) they will actually produce very weak, light shades.
Many vegetables (even those with vibrant coloring) lack the thick, concentrated juices produced by many fruits. In general, do not expect vegetable-based food dyes to be as bright or even as those made from berries. Beets (for red) and carrots (for orange) are exceptions to this rule.;
, Some vegetables leach color into the water when boiled. The vegetables that work best for this are those with lots of water content (and therefore juices) that are also deeply hued. Red cabbage (for purple) and beets (for red or pink) are two great examples of vegetables that can be boiled to extract their coloring.For a more concentrated color, only use as much water as is needed to barely cover the vegetables. The colored water becomes the dye -- the more you dilute it, the lighter the shade.
A good rule of thumb for figuring out which vegetables produce the best colors is that those that stain your fingers when handling them will also easily dye the foods with which they come into contact.

, Use a food dehydrator or set your oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit and place the item(s) inside on an oven-safe tray. Cook them until they are as dry as possible (without becoming burned); this could take up to six hours.For large vegetables (especially sphere shaped ones), cut them into extremely thin slices before dehydrating them. This will speed up the process and dry them more consistently.
Once dried, your vegetables can be safely stored in an airtight container for several months to a year.

, Use a coffee grinder or food processor to do this most efficiently. The finer the powder, the less the dye will affect the texture of the food you wish to color.You can also use a mortar and pestle to grind the veggies by hand, but this will take much longer and could result in less even consistency.
Thoroughly rinse off any utensils you use to make the powder before using them to grind up a different color of dried food. This will keep you from contaminating the color and flavor (if any) of your next veggie powder.

, Many vegetables/herbs can be purchased in dried, powdered form, which eliminates the need to do the drying and grinding yourself. Just be sure to select those without added spices or flavoring so you don't influence the flavor of the food you wish to color.


If you are not worried about watering down your food, you can mix the powder into a small amount of water or other liquid and then stir this into the food. Do this gradually to achieve the right color and avoid over-saturating your food.
For yellow dye, use stale turmeric. Turmeric is often used to give vegan puddings and tofu scrambles their ""eggy,"" yolk-like shade. Stale turmeric tends to have lost quite a bit of its natural flavor, so use this to avoid influencing the taste of your colored food.

"
"
Choose fruits with opaque juices.,
Juice or blend the fruit.,
Strain the juice.,
Reduce the juice.",How to Make Natural Food Coloring2," Although many fruits are very brightly colored, their juices do not always make for good food dye. Many citrus fruits, for example, have highly translucent juices (such as oranges and lemons), which do not stain other foods very effectively. Berries, on the other hand, are very effective for coloring foods.


To figure out which fruits will work best for your purposes, squeeze or blend fruits and pour the juice into a clear glass. Hold the glass up to the light; the less light that passes through, the better the juice will work as a food dye.
For red or pink coloring, raspberries and cherries are good options; strawberries produce a lighter, more pastel shade of pink. For blue or purple, try blackberries or blueberries., Unlike with boiling vegetables to leach out their color, fruit juice food coloring is made of the fruit itself. For berries, stick them in a food processor or blender in order to liquefy them for your dye. For hand fruits, you can use a juicer instead (but again, most of these types of fruits don't make good dyes).


You can start with either fresh or frozen fruit if you are blending it, but fruits must be fresh in order to juice them effectively.Be sure to remove any pits, large seeds, or inedible peels before tossing fruit into the blender; these can ruin your machine and will not help your food dye production efforts.
Add a very small amount of water to the fruit if you are using a food processor in order to allow the fruit to adequately liquefy., Any time you blend or juice fruits, tiny seeds, skins, or other fibers (pulp) can end up in the juice. In order to preserve the consistency of the food you wish to dye, remove these elements from the juice by passing it through a mesh sieve (with very small holes) or a cheesecloth.Straining is essential for maintaining consistency and smoothness in your dyes. However, if you are going for a less even look, you can choose not to strain the fruit juice (so long as there are no seeds in it!).
Very finely-blended berries will be impossible to strain completely and will most likely end up with tiny flecks of skin and fibers in them; if this is not acceptable, consider juicing or boiling instead.
Don't use a sieve or strainer with mesh that is large enough for seeds and fibers to pass through. Test-strain a small portion of your juice to make sure your mesh is effective.

, In some cases, the strained juice itself will be sufficient as a food dye. However, you can increase the intensity of the color by cooking off some of the water contained in the juice. Pour the juice into a small saucepan and cook it over medium heat until it becomes the consistency of a thick paste.This process results in a highly concentrated dye, which will have dense flavor, especially if it is made from berries. Be sure to use it sparingly to avoid flavor contamination.
Skip this if you are going for a lighter, more pastel coloring.

"
"
Pick compatible colors.,
Go for dye options with subtle flavors.,
Pay attention to consistency.,
Mask unwanted flavors when necessary.",How to Make Natural Food Coloring3," If the food you are attempting to color is already a color other than white, this will influence the result of your dyeing efforts. Don't expect blue frosting to turn red if you add juiced raspberries to it, for example.


When in doubt of how something will turn out, use a small portion of dye and food to test the outcome. You can then adjust the shade of your coloring substance if necessary by mixing it with other shades.
Avoid mixing too many different colored dyes together when trying to settle on a color. This can end up making the dye lose its vibrancy and turn out brownish.

, In many cases, there are multiple options for making one color of food dye; in such cases, choose the one with the more subtle flavor. For example, both turmeric and saffron can be used for yellow coloring, but turmeric is less intense and usually makes a better choice.An exception to this would be if you actually want to add flavor from your dye to the food. In such cases, be sure to match the flavor types (such as sweet with sweet) to avoid creating an unappealing mixture.Not all dye production methods are equal in terms of intensity. Generally speaking, juicing and blending will create dyes that are both brighter and more intense tasting than the boiling or drying methods recommended for some vegetables., To keep your food from becoming too wet while ensuring even coloring, take care to create food dyes that compliment the consistency of your food. This will take some trial and error, but common sense also goes a long way!


For powdered coloring, stir into wet, blended foods such as cake icing or mashed potatoes. Sprinkling powder on a dry food will not spread the coloring consistently.
For liquid coloring, use sparingly in all foods unless wetness is not a concern. Dry foods, for example, can become too soggy if too much liquid coloring is used.

, Depending on the kind of food you are coloring, you can get rid of flavor contamination from your food dye by adding additional flavors. For instance, a hint of flavor from beet juice coloring in cake icing can be easily covered up with a drop or two of vanilla or peppermint extract.This method doesn't work quite as well for savory foods colored with sweet dyes. If you color cauliflower red using raspberry puree, for example, even lots of salt and butter might not be able to mask the sweetness of the dye.
Many extracts and other substances that can be useful for masking flavors, such as truffle oil, are quite expensive (and potent), so use them sparingly!

Use the cornstarch paste in your arts and crafts projects.",How to Make Cornstarch Paste1," That's it! From there, the recipe can deviate based on your preference for thickness; you can add more cornstarch or water until the paste is your preferred consistency. Thoroughly mix the two ingredients together. As the cornstarch absorbs water the mixture will thicken and begin to resemble glue.For thin cornstarch paste, use 3 tablespoon (44.4 ml) of cold water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of cornstarch.
For thick cornstarch paste, use equal parts cold water and cornstarch.
Because the starch may settle, stir the simple cornstarch paste just before using it.;
, If you're creating a thick past, adding it to heat can make the mixing process easier. Place 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan. Place the pan over low heat. Stir the ingredients together until they're smooth. When the consistency is thick and gluey, remove the mixture from heat. The finished product will be somewhat translucent.Allow everything to cool before pouring it into a plastic container for use.
Using a whisk can work initially, but you'll need to switch to a heavy spoon when the mixture thickens.

, Use a clean plastic or glass container for storage. The mixture will keep for as long as a month in the refrigerator. If necessary, you add more water and slightly heat the mixture to soften it before use.


An old butter tub works well for larger amounts of paste.
If you're making paste for multiple projects or more than one person, small yogurt containers with lids work well.

Stir the mixture it until it's blended together well, then remove it from heat.

, Pour an additional 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water into the saucepan. Slowly and continuously stir the mixture until everything is well combined. The mixture will begin to thicken into a glue-like substance after a few minutes of stirring. , The mixture will be very hot, so handle it with care. After bringing it to room temperature, spoon the mixture into a plastic or glass container for storage.


Don't pour the mixture into a container while it's still hot, as it could melt the storage container.
Do not allow a child to use the paste until it has completely cooled.

Stir in some food coloring.,
Sprinkle in some glitter.",How to Make Cornstarch Paste3," If you'd like your cornstarch paste to dry quickly, you may want to add some white glue to the mixture. Blend enough cornstarch and water to make a thick paste. After heating the mixture until translucent, take it off the heat, and stir in the white glue.For best results, use a 50/50 mixture of glue and paste.


Make sure you stir thoroughly after the white glue is added. Otherwise, the glue will not bind with the cornstarch paste base.
The resulting mixture is a good choice for craft projects that require extra gluing power.

, Choose your favorite scent and stir in a few drops just before using the glue. A little goes a long way, so don't add more than 3-5 drops.


Rose oil is a great touch for glue on a love letter.
Peppermint would be an excellent addition to a Christmas card.

, Change the appearance by putting in a bit of food coloring. This is a great way to add flair to paper craft projects. Experiment with food coloring until you get the right color and desired transparency., When the paste is almost hardened, you can mix in some glitter to add sparkle. This is a great way to integrate glitter into arts and crafts without making a big mess. Ensure the glitter is not added too late, or it will be difficult to blend into the paste.

Star stringing.,
Wrap the strung popcorn length around itself so it forms a ring.",How to Make a Popcorn Wreath2," Use either very strong cotton or embroidery thread or monofilament thread. Measure the circle size for the wreath, then measure the thread to this length about three to five times, then cut to that length. A long piece is necessary to create a strong thread.


If using monofilament, just use the first circle's length, as it'll be strong enough on its own, without doubling up.
The color of the thread is completely up to you; it doesn't matter that much, unless you'd like to color coordinate it.

, This will double, triple or quadruple its strength. (Skip this step if using monofilament.)

, Thread a needle with the folded thread length and tie a knot at the end of the length. Push the needle through the middle of a piece of popcorn. Push it all the way along to the knotted end. Continue this method until you have added all of the popcorn you can fit onto the string, leaving a length for tying.

, Tie it in place with a firm knot. The wreath is now complete and ready to hang indoors or out.


A hanger can be attached to this wreath, as for Method 1's popcorn wreath.

Use the brush to clean off any dirt, paying special attention to the eyes.For small potatoes, try using red skinned or tricolor baby potatoes.
For large potatoes, try using white or Yukon Gold potatoes.;
, Slice regular-sized potatoes into half-inch pieces. Cut baby potatoes into halves or quarters. Leave the peels on for this recipe. Place the potato chunks into a bowl of cold water as you’re working if you want to prevent them from browning.The inside of potatoes will turn brown or pink quickly when exposed to oxygen. This effect does not alter the taste of the potatoes.Try to keep potato chunks about the same size, so that they will cook at an equal rate.You can keep the potatoes in the bowl of water overnight, if necessary., Remove the potato chunks from your work surface or bowl of water. Transfer them into a large, empty pot. Placing the potatoes in the pot before adding water prevents uneven cooking.Boiling water before adding the potato chunks is not recommended, as it can result in the outsides of the potatoes cooking faster than the insides.

, Pour cold water over the potatoes until the water reaches one inch above the potatoes. Add salt to the water.Use one teaspoon of kosher salt, or half a teaspoon of table salt., Leave the pot uncovered. Set the heat to high. Wait until large bubbles are breaking the surface of the water.If you’re in a hurry, you can cover the pot with a lid. Just keep an eye on it. If the water is rising and about to boil over, remove the lid., Reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Cover the pot with a lid. Let it simmer at a gently rolling boil.If the water is not maintaining a gentle boil at low temperature, raise the temperature to medium-low.

, Look for one of the largest chunks of potato. Pierce it with a fork or paring knife. Do this about every minute until the potatoes are done.The potatoes should be tender, but not too soft. If the fork goes in easily with just a little bit of resistance, the potatoes are fully cooked.Most potatoes will be cooked in ten to twenty minutes. For example, russet potatoes and Yukon gold potatoes cook slightly quicker than red potatoes.

, Use a colander to carefully pour out the water and separate the potatoes. Place the colander of potatoes inside of a pot., Dress the potatoes while they’re still hot. Putting the colander inside of a pot allows you to preserve the excess vinegar that the potatoes don’t absorb., Rinse the vegetables well and pat them dry. You can substitute any crunchy vegetables for those recommended, if desired. Dice a red pepper, celery stalks, red onion, and carrots.For example, you may want to substitute radishes, onion, broccoli, cauliflower, or arugula.

, Dice them into bite-sized pieces. Use a chef’s knife or a manual food chopper. Place the vegetables into a large bowl., Rinse parsley well, over a colander in the sink. Over a cutting board, separate the leaves from the stems and place the leaves in a pile. Rock a large chef’s knife over the parsley until it is minced.Alternately, you can use a hand-powered food chopper to mince the parsley.
Optionally, add up to 1/4 cup (total) of other fresh herbs such as basil, chives or thyme., Pour the vegetables you’ve already chopped into a large bowl. Chop a cupful of pickled vegetables and add them to the bowl. Mix in mustard seed, celery seed, salt and pepper.

Instead of mustard seed, you can use two tablespoons of yellow mustard.
You can substitute a half cup of sweet pickle relish for the pickled vegetables.

, Allow the potatoes to cool for at least 30 minutes before adding mayonnaise, so that the dressing doesn’t melt and turn oily. Stir the mayonnaise, vegetables, herb and seasoning together. Add the potatoes and excess vinegar from the pot. Gently toss the contents of the bowl.If you don’t want a mayonnaise base, use one cup of reduced-calorie ranch salad dressing.Another option to use instead of mayonnaise is three teaspoons of honey and the juice of one and a half lemons.For a mayonnaise mixture, use half the recommended amount of mayonnaise and half light sour cream., Take a bit of the salad on a spoon and evaluate the flavor. Add more vinegar, salt or pepper, if needed. If the salad isn’t tangy enough, add a bit of yellow mustard or freshly-squeezed lemon juice.If the salad tastes bland, add some kosher salt or freshly ground black pepper.

, Garnish the top of the salad with dill or parsley, if desired.Place the salad in an airtight container. Let it chill in the refrigerator for four to twenty-four hours before serving., Add crusty bread to the table. Optionally, give each person a small dish of olive oil to dip the bread into. Bread is a great compliment to potato salad.Instead, you could serve potato salad sandwiches, by putting potato salad on hamburger buns and adding sliced tomato and leaves of lettuce., Choose side dishes that go well with potato salad. For instance, baked beans, pasta salad or cole slaw. Serve a main dish that is popular for picnics or barbeques, such as hamburgers. Consider serving pie or cookies for dessert!, Beer that is full of flavor pairs nicely with potato salad. For non-alcoholic beverages, try lemonade or iced tea.

For example, try a German wheat beer or a Bavarian-style bear that is light amber in color."

Watch out for moisture.,
Store in a cool, dry, and dark spot.",How to Dry Mint," For any variety of mint, the herb is ready for harvest just before it reaches its flowering stage. Cut the mint in the morning, after any dew has dried, using garden pruners or a sharp knife.









Cut the mint about one-third of the length down the main stem. Doing so ensures that the plant will have enough strength to grow back.
Cutting the mint just before it flowers will give you the most aroma and flavor since this is the point in the growing cycle at which the leaves contain the most oil.
Gently shake each branch after cutting it to remove any insects that might be hiding out.;
, Rinse each branch of mint in cold, running water. Dry them thoroughly using clean paper towels. The mint must be completely dry before you continue.









Lay the mint out on a paper towel and pat it dry. Then, lay out the mint in a single layer on a paper towel and allow the stems and leaves to air-dry for another hour or two. Be sure that none of the mint is stacked.
If using a salad spinner, place the bunches of mint in your salad spinner and dry the visible water off using the device. You should still lay the mint out on clean paper towels afterward to continue drying for another hour or two.

, The only drying method that requires you to keep the stems is natural or air drying. For all other drying methods, you should separate the mint leaves from the stems before drying the mint, since the process will be easier before the mint dries









Simply pluck the leaves off with your fingers. You could also cut them off with a sharp knife.
Inspect the leaves for damage or disease as you remove them. Discard any bad leaves and keep all the leaves in good condition.

, Separate your mint into small bunches. Tie the bunches together using kitchen twine or thick string.









Make sure that you tie the bunches together tightly at the stem level, leaving as many of the leaves exposed as possible.

, Tie the other end of the twine to a hanger or clothesline, and place the entire thing in a room that receives good ventilation and warmth, but little light. Make sure that the mint hangs upside down.








A bedroom, spare room, or kitchen with darkening shades often works best, but if you cannot find a room that appears dark enough, you could also place a paper bag loosely over the mint, attaching it so that it stays on without smothering the herb.
The room should be at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).
Hanging the mint upside down will force the flavorful and aromatic oils to travel into the leaves, rather than gathering in the stems.

, After a week or two, the mint should be dry. Take it down and strip the leaves from the stems onto a plate.









Hold the tip of the stalk in one hand.
Run your other hand down the stalk. The leaves should fall off without any resistance, but you might need to pull the top leaves off separately.

, Keep them in a single layer, and do not let the leaves overlap.


By keeping the mint in a single layer, you can dry the leaves out faster and more evenly than you would be able to do if you piled the leaves inside a microwave-safe bowl.

, Place the leaves in the microwave and cook them 10 seconds at a time, checking frequently to see if they have begun curling and becoming crispy. The mint should be adequately dry in 15 to 45 seconds.Ideally, the leaves will stay green. You can use the leaves after they brown, but green leaves will have more flavor and a better aroma.
If you place a pile of mint leaves in a dish instead of keeping them to a single layer on a microwave-safe plate, you will need to stir the leaves every 30 seconds and microwave them for a total of 1 to 3 minutes. This tactic is not ideal, however, and may result in unevenly dried mint.

, Essentially, you only need to preheat your oven to the lowest possible temperature.


The temperature needs to be very low. High temperatures will dry the mint quickly, but they will also produce a flavorless, aromaless result. Do not use a temperature above 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius).

, After the oven has preheated and sat at that temperature for about five minutes, turn it off.


Again, this is done so that the mint can dry quickly in mildly warm conditions without drying out in excessive heat and losing their flavorful, aromatic oils.

, Arrange the mint leaves so that they are in a single layer on the baking sheet, and avoid letting the leaves overlap or touch.


If the leaves are piled together or touching, some of the leaves may not dry out evenly with the rest. As a result, during the drying process, you might find that some leaves have burned while others are still moist.
To the same point, you should also try to dry leaves of similar sizes on a single baking sheet at a time. If you dry mint leaves of varying sizes, some my dry out faster than others.
You do not need to place anything on the baking sheet before adding the mint, but if desired, you could use a sheet of parchment paper. Do not use cooking spray.

, Place the mint in the warm oven and let them dry in there for 5 to 20 minutes. Check every 5 minutes to see if the leaves have become adequately dry.


The leaves are dry when they begin to curl up and become crispy. They should still be green, though. Checking on the mint often can help prevent them from turning brown.

, Keep the mint in a single layer with as little overlap as possible.


Mint leaves will dry more evenly if kept in a single layer since each leaf will receive the same amount of heat as the others. Leaves that are in stacks or piles will need to be stirred during the process, and some may finish drying out well before others.

, Place the dehydrator tray back into the dehydrator and turn the device onto the lowest temperature setting available.


A low amount of heat is all that you need to dry mint and similar herbs.
If your dehydrator does not have a thermostat, you should check the device more often during the dehydrating process to prevent the leaves from burning.
Remove any unnecessary trays before you begin. Doing so will clear more room for larger leaves and increase the overall amount of air circulation the mint leaves receive.

, Check the mint every five minutes or so. Remove the mint from the device as soon as it appears dry.


The edges should begin curling up and the leaves should look crispy yet green.

, If you have a dehumidifier, the conditions of the air around the machine are ideal for quickly air drying mint. Turn the dehumidifier on and run it as you usually would.


A dehumidifier removes moisture from the air, so the air around the machine is usually quite dry. This is good since mint drying in moist conditions can develop mold.

, Spread the mint leaves out on a cooling rack used for cakes or cookies. Keep the leaves in a single layer and avoid overlapping them as much as possible.


A cooling rack is ideal since air can circulate from the bottom of the rack as well as the top. This is another feature that discourages mold.

, Leave the mint here for a day or two, until dried.


The leaves should curl up and feel crisp, but they should still be fairly green.
You can usually tell which spot on the dehumidifier is warmest simply by feeling around the machine with your hand.

, Stack whole dry mint leaves in airtight containers. Make sure that the containers are sealed as tightly as possible.


Canning jars with tight lids, metal, non-porous and non-absorbant containers. Paper, cardboard, plastic and wood containers absorb the volatile oils from all mint family plants.
Label each container with the current date, the contents of the bag, and the amount in the bag.
If possible, store the mint as whole leaves and crush it just before using it rather than crushing the mint before storing it. The flavor and aroma will last longer if the leaves are kept whole.

, Keep an eye on the mint for the first few days. If any moisture develops, you will need to dry the mint longer.Simply remove the mint and re-dry it using one of the processes outlined above.
Mint and other herbs will quickly develop mold if they are not stored in dry conditions.

, For the best flavor, use the mint within a year.


Do not use paper or cardboard containers. These containers will absorb the aromatic oils, thereby causing the mint to lose its flavor faster.

, For deep or dark colors, add powdered food coloring in with the liquid or paste so that the marzipan does not become sticky and difficult to work with., You can always add more coloring if desired.You can experiment with achieving different hues by adding dabs of multiple colors., Continue kneading until the color is consistent and free from streaks.If the color is darker or richer than you want it to be, you can add more marzipan to lessen the hue’s intensity.If you are using food coloring paste, its color may shift as it dries, so mix it into the marzipan at least 15 minutes before settling on the final color., You can smooth out any cracks that form in the marzipan by rubbing a little bit of water on them., Dip a paintbrush into the food coloring liquid or paste. Use your paintbrush to apply bold definition to the exterior of the marzipan.For example, paint markings onto petals or leaves.
You can use a toothpick instead of a paintbrush to get thin details like veining."

, Allow the marzipan to dry overnight.This makes a good surface to paint on, one that is not too moist.


Choose a dry, cool place - do not refrigerate., Choose your food coloring medium based on the strength of hue you want to achieve.


Liquid food coloring is water-based and produces lighter colors than paste.Paste has the strongest color.For a subtle, more delicate color, use powdered coloring., Wear disposable food preparation gloves and an apron or smock., Adding water allows you to achieve the color you want and a thinner consistency.Put a bit of food coloring in the bottom of a bowl.
Using your paintbrush, add water from a cup into the bowl until the food coloring is as diluted as you desire.

, Dip a paintbrush into the diluted food coloring paint you have just created, and brush it on the marzipan figures.


You can dip the paintbrush directly into undiluted food coloring to add strong definition to certain details – for example, the lines in a petal or leaf., For a watercolor effect, dilute clear, alcohol-based imitation vanilla with a small amount of water in a dish.Pick up powdered coloring with a paintbrush and swirl it into the water and vanilla mixture.
Apply to the marzipan with a paintbrush to create shading and/or the illusion of texture.

, You can achieve even more detail by adding petal dust to the coloring.The marzipan should be already shaped but not yet dry.Pour some petal powder onto a saucer.
Use a clean, dry paintbrush to add luster to the marzipan.

Ask an adult to do this step.
Choose one of the shorter ends. This will now be the top of your gong.
The holes should be 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) apart.
The tip of a scissors blade could also be used instead of a pocket knife.;
, Place one pipe cleaner into each hole. Securely twist the ends of each pipe cleaner together.


Each pipe cleaner should form a loop with the ends twisted together. You'll need two loops (one in each hole).
The loops should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) in diameter.

, Slide the cardboard tube of a wrapping paper roll or paper towel roll through the pipe cleaner loops, centering the loops on the tube.


You could use a broomstick, measuring stick, or other large stick instead of the cardboard tube if desired. Just make sure that the stick itself is longer than the width of your roasting pan gong.
This tube or stick will act as the support for your gong.

, Place two desk or dining room chairs back to back. Rest the support on the back tops of both chairs so that the gong hangs in place.


For added security, you could hold the support in place using more pipe cleaners.
Alternatively, you could use two large, thick books or any other evenly sized sturdy pieces instead of the chairs. This ""stand"" needs to be able to stay in place without additional support, though.

Fill a plastic bottle.,
Cut a cardboard tube lengthwise.,
Tighten the tube around the cap of the bottle.,
Attach the tube with tape.,
Cover the rest of the tube with additional tape.,
Create a second maraca in the same way.,
Play the maracas.",How to Make Musical Instruments with Recycled Materials2," Fill an 8-oz (250-ml) plastic bottle halfway with a noise-making material. Tightly secure the cap on the top of the bottle.


There are different options you can use for the filling. Pebbles, beans, rice, birdseed, beads, dry pasta, small washers, and paper clips will produce stronger noises. Sand, salt, and small erasers will produce quieter noises.
You can also mix different filling materials inside one maraca or use a filling idea not mentioned here. The filling just needs to be small enough to shake around inside the maraca.

, Cut straight down the length of one toilet paper tube. The cut should be as straight as possible.


Only cut one slit down the length of the tube. Do not cut the tube completely in half.
If working with a paper towel roll instead of a toilet paper roll, completely cut the paper towel roll in half crosswise before cutting it lengthwise. Only use one of these halves for one maraca handle.

, Roll the cardboard in on itself lengthwise. Fit one open end onto the cap of the bottle.


The opening should be about 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) in diameter, or just big enough to fit onto the cap snugly.

, Start wrapping the electrical tape around the bottom part of bottle, near the cap. Wind it around, overlapping the layers, until it also connects to the cardboard handle.


Wrap slowly and do not leave any gaps in between layers of tape.
To make the maraca more decorative, use tape that comes in a bright color or pattern.

, Continue wrapping the tape around the cardboard tube in the same manner until you reach the very bottom.


Use one piece of tape to cover the open bottom of the tube.

, The second maraca is made in the same way as the first, so you will need to repeat the previous steps with a second 8-oz (250-ml) plastic bottle.


Consider using a different filling for your second maraca. Many real maracas have different pitches, and using different filling materials can mimic these different pitches. For instance, if you place beans in one and rice in another, the rice maraca will have a higher pitch.

, Grab the handle of one maraca in your right hand and the handle of your second maraca with the left. Give them both a shake to hear them play. Experiment with rhythm and sound by shaking them at different intervals.

Thread the caps onto a wire.,
Wrap the wire around the arms of the stick.,
Play the tambourine.",How to Make Musical Instruments with Recycled Materials3," The stick must be y-shaped, with a distinguishable forked top and a single lower branch that can act as a handle.


Make sure that the stick is very sturdy. Use a hardwood branch, if possible.
To make the instrument more colorful, you can decorate it with paint, feathers, beads, or other embellishments. Make sure that none of these decorations hang off from the top forked section of the stick, though.







, Remove the rubber liners from the inside of each cap, then heat the caps on a hot outdoor grill for about five minutes.


This step should be done by an adult.
Do not touch the metal caps as they heat up. Only touch them using tongs.
This step is technically optional, but following it will improve the final sound of the instrument.

, After the metal caps cool to the touch, use a hammer to flatten them out as much as possible.


Mainly, you'll need to focus on flattening the raised, bumpy ridge around the outside of the cap.
Work carefully to avoid striking your fingers. You may need to perform this step with adult supervision, as well.

, Place a nail in the center of each flattened cap. Use a hammer to gently poke the tip of the nail through the metal, creating a hole.


Remove the nail after creating each hole.
Work with an adult during this step to minimize the risk of injury.

, Slide a sturdy piece of metal wire through each hole until all of the caps are lined up.


The wire should be a little longer than the distance in between the widest part of the forked portion of the stick.

, Wrap one end of your threaded wire around one of the forked arms of the stick. Wrap the other end of the wire around the other arm.


The wire should be wrapped around the top of the fork, or around the widest portion (if that portion differs from the top).

, Grab the tambourine by its handle portion and give it a good shake. The bottle caps should clang together, producing a musical sound.

Some cans worth considering include soup cans, tuna cans, coffee cans, and pet food cans.
If the top edge of the can seems jagged, apply a layer of thick tape to the rim to prevent any accidental cuts.







, Stand a can upside-down and place a thick nail in the bottom center. Use a hammer to puncture the bottom of the can with the nail.


This step should be performed with adult supervision.
Repeat this procedure with each can.

, String a long piece of yarn through the hole in one of your cans. Repeat for each can, using a different piece of yarn each time.


Use yarn, cord, or another type of thick string for this part of the process.
There should be about 8 inches (20 cm) of string sticking out of the flat top of the tallest can. The rest of the lengths can vary, but the cans will need to be able to bump into each other as they hang.

, Tie a metal washer onto the end of the yarn sticking through to the inside of the can.


You could use another object, like a rock, if washers are not available. The object should be heavy, though, so that it can create additional noise when it hits the side of the can.

, Knot the other end of each string to the bottom of a sturdy clothes hanger.


The cans should overlap each other as they hang.

, Place the chimes in a windy area and let the breeze play them for you, or strike the chimes with a chopstick to play them yourself.

Buy your supplies.,
Cut the pipes.,
Make a clay plug.,
Plug the bottom of the pipe.",How to Make Pan Pipes1," Straws and PVC pipe are two different materials you can use to make pan pipes. Straws are the easiest materials to use to make pan pipes. However, their sound quality is not as good as PVC pipes. PVC pipes give you better sound quality, but they are less easy to cut than straws. Take this into consideration when you are choosing the right material for your project.


If you are using straws to create your pipes, buy fat straws meant for smoothies or bubble tea. You can find these at stores like Walmart or at your grocery store. Make sure not to get normal or restaurant-style straws. These are not as effective as thicker straws, and are much harder to play.
If you are using PVC pipe, buy a ½ inch PVC schedule 40 pipe at stores like Home Depot or Walmart.;
, Use scissors to cut straw pipes, and a rotary conduit cutter or hack saw to cut PVC pipe. It can be difficult to say exactly what notes the pipes will create when you cut them to certain lengths, because the pitch also depends on the width of the straws or PVC pipe, which can vary across brands. However, you can get a well-tuned set of pipes in a diatonic scale by cutting your pipes to the following lengths:Pipe 1: 17.5 cm
Pipe 2: 15.5 cm
Pipe 3: 13.5 cm
Pipe 4: 12.5 cm
Pipe 5: 11 cm
Pipe 6: 10 cm
Pipe 7: 9 cm
Pipe 8: 8.5 cm
You can also blow across your pipes and see if they produce the sound you want. You can cut your pipes shorter if you want a different sound.
For this reason, it’s always a good idea to cut your pipes slightly longer than needed, because you can always adjust them to make them shorter.

, In order to produce sound, you will need to plug the bottom of the pipes. Take modeling clay and make it into a flat circle. Then take a straw or PVC pipe and stamp into the clay with an end. Twist the pipe or straw, then lift it up. This should leave a circle exactly the size of the opening. Take out this piece of clay., Take the clay plug you made and push it into one of the pipes you have cut for your pan pipes. This will plug the bottom. To make sure it stays, take some tape and wrap it around the bottom of the pipe to secure it. Do this process for the remaining pipes."

Play the harmonica.",How to Make Musical Instruments with Recycled Materials5," Place two popsicle sticks together, one on top of the other.


If you're recycling used popsicle sticks, make sure that they have been washed and dried before using them for this project.
Large popsicle sticks work best, but any size can be used.

, Tightly wrap a small strip of paper around one end of the popsicle sticks and tape the loop together. Repeat this with a second strip and the other end of the sticks.


Each strip of paper should be about 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) wide and 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.
You will need to wrap the strip around itself several times.
When taping the paper loop together, only tape the paper to itself. Do not tape it to either popsicle stick.

, Carefully ease out one of the popsicle sticks, working carefully to prevent damaging or disturbing the paper loops.


Set this stick aside for now.
The other stick should still be inside the paper loops.

, Place one large, wide rubber band over the popsicle stick and paper loops.


The rubber band should run from end to end. It should be taut, but not so tight that it can snap or fling off.

, Place the second popsicle stick back on top of the first, sandwiching one side of the rubber band in between the two sticks in the process.


The two sticks should line up evenly when viewed from the top, bottom, and sides.

, Use a small, thin rubber band to fasten the sticks together at one end. Use a second similar rubber band to hold the sticks together at the opposite end.


These rubber bands should be placed to the outside edge of the paper bands.

, The harmonica is done at this point. To play it, blow through the popsicle sticks, focusing your breath so that it is directly completely through the instrument and not around it.

Pick out or buy bamboo stalks.,
Cut the bamboo in front of its first node.,
Sand the node area.,
Measure out your pipes.,
Clean out nodes between sections.,
Cut the bamboo according to the measurements.",How to Make Pan Pipes2," If you are making your pipes out of bamboo, buy as many stalks as you need. If you live in a warm climate that grows bamboo, you may be able to find bamboo outside or at local shops. If you don’t have access to bamboo in your community, order it online. Make sure each stalk of bamboo has around a 5/8 inch diameter.It’s important that all the stalks have a similar interior diameter, or else it will be hard to make them sound good together.
Make sure the bamboo isn’t green, and instead is dried and tan in color.

, Take a stalk of bamboo and cut it at one end right before the first node using a saw. The nodes of the bamboo are the lines that run horizontally across the stalk that you can see from the outside. The nodes are closed on the inside, so they create a good natural bottom to your pipes., After you have made the cut before the node, use a belt sander to make the outside bottom of the bamboo stalk rounded. This isn’t necessary, but it will make the bottoms of your pipes less prickly and spiky, and will also make your instrument look better. Do the same process for all of your bamboo pieces.

, Use the same measurements for the straw pan pipes, starting with the longest pipe at 17.5 cm and the shortest at 8.5 centimeters. Use a ruler to measure and mark these measurements on the bamboo.

, After forming the bottom of the pipes around the node, you will want to clear the inside of the bamboo, still keeping the bottom node untouched. Since nodes are closed on the inside, they will stop air from going through the entire pipe and will interfere with your sound.Use a steel rod with roughly a 3/8 inch diameter to break through the nodes inside of the bamboo shaft.
An effective way to do this is to clamp down the steel rod, and then take the bamboo shaft and poke the nodes out using the rod.
You also will want to use the rod to scrape around the inside of the bamboo nodes so that the inside node area has the same interior diameter as the rest of the stalk.

, Using the measurements you already marked down, cut the bamboo into differently-sized pipes. Remember that it’s better to cut your pipes a little too long than too short, because you can always do another cut."

Test the sound.,
Adjust the number of pipes as you wish.,
Lay the pipes out.,
Reinforce the pipes.,
Sand the pipes.",How to Make Pan Pipes3," Before you put your pipes together, first make sure that the pipes give you the notes you want. You should have a diatonic scale by using the measurements provided, but you should still check it to make sure it sounds right. If you want your pan pipes set in a specific key, for instance the key of G, use a piano or music tuner to find the lengths that you want.For example, if you want your pan pipes in the key of G, play a G on a piano, tuner or other instrument.
Cover the bottom hole of the pipe with you thumb so it’s completely covered. Then place your bottom lip on the rim of the pipe, purse your lips and blow across the pipe.
If the note does not match the G, cut off a tiny bit of pipe and try again.
Keep doing this until you match the G. Then do the same on another pipe to make an A, etc. until you have all your desired notes.

, You can add more pipes if you want, or take off some pipes. There aren’t a set number of pipes used in pan pipes. Many pan pipes have either 5 or 8 pipes, but the number of pipes in your instrument is completely up to you. Romanian pan pipes even have twenty pipes!

, When you are ready to attach the pipes together, lay them out longest to shortest. Make sure that all the plugged ends of the pipes are all on the same side. Line the pipes up so that the top ends of the pipes are all in line with each other, and the plugged ends are staggered in a diagonal., You need to attach the pipes to each other so they can stay together as a unit.For straw pan pipes, simply wrap tape around all of the pipes several times. To keep the pipes straight, place a chopstick or popsicle stick across the middle of the pipes, and super glue it down.For PVC or bamboo pipes, you will need to use a stronger material to reinforce the pipes. Use duct tape and a lightweight wooden rod to reinforce the pipes. You can also use twine for a more attractive finished product. Criss-cross the twine across each pipe and the piece of wood to bind the wooden rod to the pipes.Super glue around the reinforcements for extra support.

, If your pan pipes are made of straw, you do not have to sand them. However, PVC pipe and bamboo can be jagged when cut. If you notice that the top ends of the pan pipes are sharp, use sandpaper to smooth them out. The last thing you want is to get splinters when you’re playing your new instrument!If you are making bamboo pipes, also sand the bottom of each pipe where you made the cut at the node.

While there are many types of harp to choose from, the Lever harp is one of the more common types of harps, and may be easier to build for a beginner.The Paraguayan harp, while less common, is gaining popularity. Paraguayan harps are much lighter than other harps, and are easier on the fingers due to a lighter string tension.;
, Look around at various harps and study them. Find qualities in each harp that you like, and those that you don't. If you're designing the harp for yourself, consider trying to copy the design of a harp you like.You can find a variety of harp plans online, even some for free. Some designs are simple, while others can be complex and quite expensive.If you feel confident in your abilities, you could try designing the harp completely from scratch.If you copy someone's design, do not try to sell it. The original designer may file a lawsuit against you for plagiarism., The type of wood you use in constructing your harp will have an effect on the sound quality and string tension. You can build harps out of several different types of wood, such as maple, oak, cherry, or spruce.Harder woods will allow you to build a harp with more string tension. You can use softer woods, but it may affect the lifespan of the instrument, Building a harp can get expensive, especially if you don't have access to the various tools required to work the wood. Other factors, such as what type of wood you decide to use, will also affect the final cost of your harp.If you are building a harp for the first time, consider building a simple harp. Use inexpensive materials and focus on getting the technique right. You can even try to salvage the necessary lumber.Building a harp also requires a serious investment in time. Expect to spend at least 28 hours on a simple design. It is possible to spend upwards of 100 hours or more on a complex harp build., Sound boxes, or shells, typically come in three styles: square back, round back, and stave back.The size of the shell depends on a few other dimensions on your harp. Consider the length and width of your soundboard, as well as the angles of the top and bottom of the harp relative to the shell.Square shells are easier to build than round or stave shells. A simple square shell consists of four boards screwed together with a plywood back.Stave shells consist of several planks attached to each other and then placed in a cradle to add a curve. Building a stave shell requires a lot of precision, as well as the construction of a cradle to curve the staves.A round shell requires more time and skill than both the square and stave shells, as well as some specialized equipment.If you purchased a harp plan, refer to your blueprints for shell construction.

, The material you use for your soundboard will contribute to the sound quality of your harp. You can build your soundboard out of redwood, pine, or birch plywood.Soundboards are constructed from several smaller pieces of wood glued and clamped together.Refer to your harp plans to determine how big your soundboard will be. Find several pieces of wood at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. The size of your soundboard will determine how many pieces of wood you need.Lay the pieces of wood out edge to edge, taking care to keep the grain horizontal on each piece. Glue the pieces together and clamp them for extra security.Once the glue has dried, you can cut out the shape of your soundboard as required by your harp plans.Taper the soundboard so that it is 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick at the top, or treble, end. The bottom, or bass, end of the soundboard should be around 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.
If you use plywood, make sure the grain of the wood runs across the width of the soundboard. This will prevent any premature cracking., The string ribs lay across the width of the soundboard. String ribs add support to the harp and prevent potential cracking.String ribs come in various sizes and depend heavily on the dimensions of the soundboard, as well as the preference of the harp maker. Consult your harp plans to determine the shape and style of your string ribs.You do not have to include string ribs in your harp. However, if you choose to omit them you will need to reinforce your harp. The tension from the strings may cause the wood to crack., Using epoxy or a glue of your choice, align the soundboard on top of the shell. Have clamps ready to hold the pieces together while the glue dries.Depending on the shape of your shell, glue may not be enough to securely fasten the soundboard. If you are using a round or stave shell, consider using staples or screws as well as glue.If you use staples or screws, take care not to use too much force or you may damage the shell., Follow your harp plans and trace the design of the neck and pillar on your chosen wood. Cut the neck and pillar to shape, and then sand any rough edges out.Do not smooth the joining surfaces, surfaces where pieces connect, until it is time to combine the parts.Drill holes in the neck for tuning pins. Use a 3⁄16 inch (0.5 cm) bit and work carefully. Don't try to drill all the way through in one plunge. Rather, make 3-5 plunges, each time moving a little deeper into the neck. Clear out any excess chips from the hole before starting the next plunge., While there are many ways to attach the neck and pillar, one of the easier methods is to use dowels. Dowels are pegs that fit into holes drilled into both the neck and pillar.To use dowels, drill three holes into the neck and pillar, taking care to remove any chips from the holes. Clearing the chips will keep your holes straight.Make sure the holes in the pillar line up with the holes in the neck. Cut three dowels long enough to fit into both pieces. Make grooves in the dowels to keep glue from escaping the holes.Test fit the neck and pillar before adding any glue. The dowels should be snug and you shouldn't see any gaps between the neck and pillar. If everything fits, add glue to the dowels and join the pieces. Use clamps to keep everything tight while the glue dries., Use dowels to attach the neck and pillar to the sound box. Do not use glue to fix the neck and pillar to the sound box. The dowels are there to keep the parts aligned. The angle of the sound box relative to the neck and pillar will hold the pieces together.Keep a gap about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) thick on the side near the strings. Once you add the strings, the tension will cause this gap to close. Without this gap, you run the risk of cracking the wood.Once you've attached the sound box, you can drill string holes in the sound board. Refer to your harp plans to determine the number of holes you need to drill., You will need eyelets, bridge pins, and tuning pins to mount your strings. You can buy these online, or your local music shop may carry them.Fit the eyelets into the holes in the soundboard. Coat the sides of the holes with glue, and push the eyelet into the hole.Fit the bridge pins and tuning pins into their respective holes. You may need to adjust the holes in the neck to properly fit the bridge pins. Do not glue these pins into the wood.Start at the bass end of the harp. Feed the string through the eyelet in the sound board and pull it up to the corresponding tuning pin. Wrap the string around the tuning pin a few times to set it. Don't worry about pulling it tight just yet. Mount all the strings before tightening them to the proper tension.It may take several tunings before the strings hold the proper tension."

Gather as many bowls as colors you plan to dye.,
Fill each bowl or bag 3/4 full of the pasta you would like to use.,
Fill the bowl or bag with alcohol or vinegar.,
Add your coloring.,
Place the bags or bowls on top of a sheet so they are easy to use and set out of the way.,
Stir the bowls or shake the bags occasionally so that you can make sure the inside and outside of the pasta is dyed.








,
Strain the liquid out of the bowl.,
Place a layer of towels on top of your sheets.,
String them onto necklaces or glue them onto paper in order to complete arts and crafts with children.",How to Dye Pasta For Crafts," You can also use medium to large-sized bags, as long as they seal very tightly.






;
, This will vary greatly on the amount of pasta you need for your projects. If you are doing crafts, you may only need 1/2 cup of pasta for each bowl, but if you are doing projects for a classroom, you may want to fill a large bag with a pack of pasta.








, Most sources suggest alcohol is the most effective. This is also called alcohol when it is sold in stores.









The liquid should cover all or most of the pasta.

, You should buy the drops, rather than the type. If you used about 1/2 cup (58 g) of alcohol, you should use drops of coloring. Increase the number of drops according to the amount of alcohol you used.









If you want to have very colors, use a few drops.

, You will need to store them overnight so you need to make sure they cannot be spilled. Allow them to sit for 8 hours.








,, If you are using a bag, you can puncture a hole in it over the sink and allow it to drain out.








, Lay each color of pasta onto a separate sheet to dry. Allow it to dry for 2 hours, depending upon how much pasta you used.








, They are versatile and can be saved for months without fading. However, they should not be eaten once dyed because of the alcohol.

Acquire a carrot.,
Cut 2 inches off the pointed end.,
Take a drill bit or knife, and carefully start drilling through the middle.,
Bring all the debris from your drilling out.,
Using a sharp knife, make a cut about 1 inch down from the end with a hole, and about half an inch deep .,
Move your knife about 1 inch backwards from the previous cut, and cut a wedge out of it, going all the way down to the bottom of the other cut.,
Take the piece you cut off earlier and cut off the very end.,
Carefully start to form a plug.,
Cut it in half from the flat edge so it is a semi-cylindrical piece.,
Insert the plug into the hole.,
If desired, cut away from the edge of the carrot to make a more comfortable mouthpiece.,
Blow on the mouthpiece.,
Use a drill bit or knife to cut two holes below the incision made before.",How to Make a Carrot Recorder," It should work with any carrot, but one about 7 and a half inches works best. It should be about 1 inch in diameter. It should also be fresh, and relatively straight.;
, Keep this piece for later, as you'll need it to create a plug.

, You can do this by hand, or if you have an electric drill you can use that as well. Take it slowly, be careful not to hurt yourself, and be careful not to drill through the sides of the carrot.

, You can dump most of it out, and run it under a tap if you need to.

, Be careful not to go any deeper, and gently slice it partially.

, There should be a triangular hole, and you should be able to see the sides of the carrot.

, This should make the end flat, and rectangular.

, Cut off slim pieces off the edges until it fits into the hole in the carrot. It should fit snugly, but you shouldn't have to hammer it into place.

, It should have 3 flat sides and one curved side.

, Insert it so the flat side faces up towards the cut you made earlier, and the curved part is facing down.

, It should resemble the mouthpiece on a recorder, or the reed on a wind instrument.

, You should now get a whistle. It should sound something like a train whistle.

, You can add more, but two is the ideal (3 tones). Three tones is enough to play simple tunes like Mary Had A Little Lamb, or Hot Cross Buns.

Add stickers, if you want to get really hardcore.",How to Make a Mock Electric Guitar from a Toy Acoustic," Does it tune? How does it sound? Determine whether or not you plan on playing it after modding it. This will tell you how roughly you can handle it and whether you can mess up vital parts like the sound hole and the tuning keys.;
, Get a guitar catalog, a real guitar, or look online and check out some different styles: Strat, Tele, SG, Les Paul, etc. Get a pen and sketch out what cuts you'll have to make to mimic the shape on the guitar body. For example, for a Les Paul or Tele you would need to chop off a piece below the neck to get the cutaway design, and for an SG or Strat you would have to do the top and bottom. Don't try anything like a Flying V or Warlock; these won't work with an acoustic.

, A bandsaw works best for this, but you can use a handsaw, craft knife, or X-Acto if need be. Expect rough results, though. Sand the edges.

, Cut it down to size and glue it in with wood glue (note: if your guitar has a gaudy toy label inside, you may want to cover it with something more authentic. The only way to do this is to glue the label in before you seal the cutaway.)

, Most acoustics aren't painted, while electrics are: painting your guitar can make or break the look. Black is a good colour for all guitars, but if the existing wood is pretty you may want to let some shine through by experimenting with spray paint to get a ""sunburst"" finish (fading from black, dark brown, or red around the edges to golden or orange in the center of the top).

, Look at the details (for example, knobs, pickups, fretboard inlays, strap pegs, rod cover, pickguard, etc.) and see how you could replicate them. Odds and ends from around your house or the hardware store will work for most details.

, We used a colored plastic binder cover for a pickguard, white colored pencil to do the inlays (adding light pink and blue highlights gives it a pearly shine), tiny plastic boxes for the pickups, a piece of the old pickguard for the rod cover, and nuts for the knobs.

, You can find inkjet sticker paper at the office supply store or just glue on pieces of paper. A strap wouldn't hurt, either. Sanding parts of your guitar will make it look road-worn and vintage, if you're after that.

Play your guitar.",How to Make a Rubber Band Guitar1," This guitar is more complex to make, but the results are well worth it. Here's a list of what you will need:


Shoe box
Box cutter and scissors
Cardboard
4 – 6 rubber bands
School glue
Cardboard tube, paper towel tube, or pvc pipe
Tape or hot glue
Paint, paper, stickers, etc (to decorate);
, Use a cup or mug to trace a circle into a shoe box lid. Then, use a box cutter to cut the circle out.This will be your sound hole.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.
If you can't find a shoe box, you can buy one from the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts shop. They are mainly used for storing photographs, but they are right size and come in many different colors and patterns.

, These will be your string holes. Make sure to align the top and bottom holes so that each string will run straight across the sound hole. The row of holes should not extend past the widest point of the sound hole.

, You can paint the box part using acrylic or tempera paints. You can also cover the lid and box parts (separately) with paper. Here are some more ways in which you can decorate your guitar:


Draw designs on the guitar using markers, crayons, or glitter glue.
Stick some stickers or foam shapes onto your guitar to make it look more colorful.
Decorate the rim of the sound hole.
Paint the inside of your box. This way, the color will show through the sound hole, and make your guitar look more interesting.

, Measure the distance from the far left string hole to the far right string hole, then cut the cardboard accordingly. Each strip of cardboard needs to be the same length.


If you’ve painted the body of the guitar, you may want to paint the strips of cardboard as well. For a more striking effect, paint them using a contrasting color.

, The strips should be right between the string holes and the top to bottom edge of the sound hole. The strips will help lift the strings off the body of the guitar and give you a better sound.

, The distance between the holes needs to be the same as the string holes you made on your box lid.

, You will be stringing these rubber bands through the string holes. Consider using both thick and thin rubber bands. Each will give you a different sound.

, Begin by tying a knot at the end of each rubber band. Thread the loose end through the holes in one of the cardboard strips. You will need one rubber band for each hole. The knot at the bottom of the rubber band will keep it from falling out.


Don’t make the knots too close to the ends of the bands or the ends might slip through and untie the knots.

, The cardboard strip will hold the rubber bands securely in place. If you want, you can tape the edges of the cardboard strip to the underside of the lid.

, You can use a binder clip to temporarily hold the rubber band strings in place once you have fed them through the string holes.

, Secure each rubber band by tying the end into a knot. If you want, make each string a little looser/tighter than the previous one. This will allow you to achieve different notes, sort of like in a real guitar. You can also tape the cardboard strip to the underside of the lid

, This will help cover the holes and make your guitar look neater. Each piece of cardboard needs to be long enough to cover all of the string holes on each side. Draw a line of glue across the top and bottom holes, then press the cardboard strip down onto it.


Consider painting the cardboard strip a contrasting color so that it stands out from the rest of your guitar.

, You can use a cardboard mailing tube, a paper towel tube, or even a plastic or pvc tube.

, You can paint it, cover it with paper, or even wrap tape around it to make it more colorful. You can also glue paper ""keys"" to the top of the tube to make the knobs. You can even draw 4 to 6 lines down the front of the tube to make the strings.


Note that if the neck is a different material than the body, the painted result might not match (even if you use the same paint).

, Use the base of your tube to trace a circle onto the top of your guitar. Then, use a box cutter to cut the circle out.


If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.

, Slide the tube about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) down into the hole. If your tube is made out of a heavier material, slide it down further. Secure the seam between the tube and the box with hot glue or tape. Make sure that you are putting the tape and glue on the inside of your box, so that you don't see it once you put your guitar together.

, Draw a line of glue around the inside edges of your box lid. Place the lid down onto the box and wait for the glue to dry.

, If you want, you can cut a triangle shape out of some colored cardboard and use it as a guitar pick.

, It should come away easily. If it doesn't, cut it out using a pair of scissors.

, You can also attach the roll using hot glue. The tube should be aligned with the vertical hole in the box.

, You can cover the guitar with paper. You can also paint it using tempera or acrylic paints. Here are some more decorating ideas:


Draw little designs on the guitar using markers, crayons, or glitter glue.
Stick down some stickers or foam shapes onto the guitar to make it more colorful.
Glue down some large beads near the top of the tub to make the knobs. You will need two to three beads on each side.

, Draw a horizontal line of glue above and below the tissue hole. Press a popsicle stick down onto each line of glue. Let the glue dry. The popsicle sticks will lift the rubber bands up a little and make the guitar sound better.


Consider painting or decorating the sticks once the glue dries.
You can also use crayons, pencils, or even straws to make the bridge.

, If you move ahead to the next steps too soon, your guitar will far apart.

, You want to end up with two rubber bands on the left side of the tube, and two rubber bands on the right side of the tube. Position the rubber bands so that they are right over the tissue hole.


Try to use thick and thin rubber bands. Each one will give you a different sound., Experiment with making different sounds. You can even cut a triangle out of a piece of colored cardboard to make the guitar pick.

, Draw a line of glue around the upper rim of a paper plate. Place the second plate right on top of it. The plates should be stacked, so that you end up with one thick plate.


Make sure that your paper plates are sturdy and have a ridge or rim.

, Cover the bottom third of the stick with glue. Press it against the back of the plate. The rest of the stick should be sticking out from behind the guitar; you don't want the neck to be too short or it will look silly. Try to center the stick as much as possible.

, You can paint the guitar using acrylic paint. You can also draw designs on it using markers or glitter glue. You can even make it look more colorful by covering it with stickers.


Consider clipping two wooden clothespins to the top of the stick. Space them about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. If you don't want the clothespins to fall off and get lost, place glue on the stick before clipping them on.

, If you move ahead to the next step too soon, your guitar will fall apart. How long it dries depends on how much paint and glue you used.

, Place two rubber bands two the left side of the stick, and two rubber bands to the right side of the stick. Try using both thick and thin rubber bands to create different sounds.

, Experiment with producing different sounds. Don't pull on the strings too tightly, however, or they may break.

Be sure to take into account being able to acquire and prepare the materials. Choose a piece of material that is about ¾” to 1” in diameter.


Bamboo is the ideal material for a homemade dizi, as it is easy to acquire and easy to manufacture into a dizi. It is also lighter and will likely be easier to play, which is useful if you are a beginning player. Bamboo can come from a regular bamboo plant with any extraneous leaves removed, or you can repurpose another bamboo object, such as an old bamboo fishing rod.There are different strains of bamboo that can be used; purple bamboo is typically used in the northern regions of China, while white bamboo is typically used in southern China.;
, The size of the flute will determine the musical key in which it plays. Flutes are typically available in the following keys (from longest to shortest): F, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F and F#.A good length is approximately 18-20” long. Longer flutes may have an additional finger hole (the larger dizi has this), and they play lower octaves. Small flutes with higher octaves are smaller than 16”, while longer flutes are ideally 24-26” long., Choose ringed ends, capped ends, or no ends for the dizi.These will determine how long-lasting your flute is, as well as how susceptible to cracking or molding it may become. The materials for the capped or ringed ends, called ferrules, can be made of brass, bone, plastic or wood.Ringed ends: Some flutes have a brass ring around the end. This helps the flute (especially those made of bamboo or other wood) from cracking. Moisture can get underneath the ring, however, and cause molding. These can also be installed on a flute that did not previously have a ring in order to stop a crack from getting bigger.
Capped ends: These ends are often made from plastic, cow bone or horn. Flutes with capped ends typically make brighter tones. Moisture can get underneath the cap, however, and cause molding.
No ends: You do not need to have any rings or caps on the end of your flute. Instead, you can paint the ends to add decoration, or you can leave them bare. However, bamboo flutes especially may be susceptible to cracking more easily than flutes with ringed or capped ends.

, Find the correct size of plastic or metal ring or cap to fit this diameter at a hardware store. If you are not using any ends, you can also opt to wrap string around the dizi to prevent cracking. , If you are using bamboo, measure a length of bamboo that is approximately 18-20” long, starting from just before one of the fibrous partitions of the bamboo stalk (this will be one of your ends). Mark it all the way around the stalk. Measure 18-20” from this line and make another mark all the way around the stalk. There should be at least a couple of fibrous partitions between each end, including the very last partition on one end. Cut both ends clean with a saw.

, Decide which side the top of your flute will be. Starting from the blocked end of your flute, measure 1” along the top and mark a hole (this is the mouth opening, or embouchure). Measure 3” from this first hole and mark a hole (this is the mokong hole, which will be covered by a dimo membrane). Measure another 3” from this mokong hole, and mark another hole (this is the first finger hole). Continuing on at 1” intervals from there, measure and mark another 5 holes for finger holes. You should end up with one mouth opening, one mokong, and 6 finger holes. These holes will end up being about ¼” in diameter., Burn out the inside to remove any fibrous material that might be inside the bamboo, stalk. Heat a ½” steel rod in a fire (do not use a kitchen oven) and hold the unheated end of the rod with protective oven mitts, as it will be very hot. Carefully insert the steel rod into the bamboo stalk, but do not poke it all the way through. Leave the blocked end intact. Twist the steel rod a few times to burn off any excess material inside the stalk. Remove the steel rod.

, Using protective oven mitts and vice grips, heat a ¼” drill bit in a fire (again, do not use a kitchen oven). Place the tip of the drill bit on top of each hole you marked. Twist gently to burn away the wood, but do not push it all the way through the hole (this may cause the bamboo to crack).

, Roll up a piece of 3x3 fine-grit sandpaper into a tube and place the end on top of one of the burned holes.Twist it back and forth to sand away the burned spots. The sandpaper tube should go through the hole and make the opening. Sand a little more on the mouth opening to make this opening slightly larger, but be careful to not make it too wide. It should only be about ¼” to 3/8” in diameter.

, Using a fine-grained sandpaper, sand carefully along the body of the flute. Spread out some newspaper on your work area to catch the dust. Take extra care around the mouth opening, finger holes, and ends. Sand the flute until it is smooth to the touch.

, Most dizi makers will carve their initials into the body of the dizi, and others will also include a Chinese poem or other saying along the body. The key of the dizi is typically carved into the flute next to the third finger hole.

, Some dizis are lacquered or painted, while others are natural and bare. One option is to use linseed oil to coat and finish the dizi.Pour a little bit of linseed oil on an old rag and gently rub it into the body of the flute. Allow it to dry before adding accessories, attaching the dimo membrane, or playing the flute.

, These can be purchased at Asian markets or online. Attach a silk tassel to the bottom hole of the dizi. Red is typically a color associated with good fortune in China and can be an appropriate color choice for a tassel.

, Traditional dimo is made from a thin internal membrane from bamboo. Other useable materials are garlic skin, rice paper, cigarette paper, or other very thin papers.Dimo paper is available from online music supply stores. You can use clear tape as an alternative material, but this won’t produce the best sound.

, These include small, sharp scissors, water, Erjiao (a traditional Chinese flute glue) or other water-soluble adhesive, the dimo membrane, and the dizi body. Erjiao can be purchased from online music supply stores.


Water-soluble glue, such as the glue specifically intended for adhering the dimo, is preferred, since you may need to adjust the placement of the dimo from time to time. If you use an adhesive that hardens, it will crack when you try to move the dimo, thereby ruining the membrane.

, The dimo will be placed on the second hole from the top of the dizi (this hole is called the mokong). Place the dimo paper over this hole and add at least 0.5 centimeter (0.2 in) on all sides of the hole. Cut the membrane to these specifications.

, Dip your finger in some water and rub glue on your finger. Apply this glue around the hole where you will place the dimo. Swab any residual glue away from the hole itself and the very edge of the hole. Glue on the membrane over the hole will disrupt the vibration of the membrane.


Another option is to use garlic juice to produce a sticky, water-soluble adhesive. Peel one garlic clove and gently rub the freshly cut garlic across the membrane hole. This will leave some adhesive material., Line up the dimo so it is even on all sides. Pinch the flute on either side of the hole with your fingers touching the dimo. Move your fingers up and down a few times gently to create lateral wrinkles in the dimo. The wrinkles should be evenly spaced on the dimo. If the dimo is completely smooth, the dizi will sound dull. If the dimo is not taut, even if it has wrinkles, the dizi may sound bright but may not emit any sounds at all from time to time, becoming unpredictable.

, Blow into the dizi to check the sound created by the dimo. Tap on the dimo a few times while you play to help it settle into place. The dimo should start vibrating when you play.


The membrane will cause the sound of the dizi to be lowered when played. It also limits the playability of high notes.
You can use the same dimo for several months on a dizi, but you may need to make minor adjustments as you continue to play.
Do not get discouraged if you have difficulties with the dimo. It takes skill and practice to apply the membrane correctly in order to achieve the best possible sound from the dizi.

, Place three fingers from one hand on the top three holes and three fingers from the other hand on the bottom three holes. Blow over the flute as you would a soda pop bottle, pursing your lips and directing air into the mouth opening. If you are not getting any sound, try pursing your lips even tighter so that the air hole is smaller.


Since the dizi is symmetrical, it can be held in either horizontal direction, and can be played easily by a left-handed person as by a right-handed person.

, A dizi can emit different tones depending on temperature and humidity, so oftentimes winter is a less desirable season to play certain dizis., Watch the shape that your mouth makes as you are playing. Take note of how your mouth looks when you are able to make noise with the flute.

, There are many different resources online that give instruction on how to play the dizi. Tim Liu is one of the most well-known dizi instructors, although there are a number of others as well., , Once you have mastered how to play a dizi, you can start to experiment with other techniques, such as sliding and popping notes, creating two tones simultaneously, using different tonguing techniques, using circular breathing, and so on, which can be accomplished by changing the embouchure and airflow.These are difficult to achieve, so a beginner should certainly not expect to be an expert player immediately. Dizi musicians spend decades perfecting their techniques.


Master dizi players typically use several dizis to be able to play in a range of keys.

, After you have finished playing the dizi, use a soft cloth to wipe it dry. You may use a long rod to push a cloth inside the dizi to catch excess moisture.

, Cloth bags, plastic airtight bags, or hard-covered soft-lined cases are ideal containers in which to store a dizi.

, Bamboo flutes are susceptible to expanding or contracting depending on temperature and humidity. Do not place in direct sunlight such as on a windowsill, as this will likely lead to cracked bamboo. If you are taking the dizi outside on a cold day, allow the flute to acclimatize before playing it.

, Since moisture may gather in the dizi, even if you’ve dried it, fungus spores may start to grow. Use food grade hydrogen peroxide to spot clean the flute to eliminate fungus growth.

, Some flute owners choose to oil their dizis with almond oil 3-4 times per year. It is best to wait until the flute is completely free of moisture (i.e., waiting a day after playing and drying it) before applying oil. Use just a bit of oil and rub it into the dizi with a soft cloth. You may also choose to oil the inside of the flute as well. Allow to dry completely before playing.

Lay the paper bag on its smooth side.,
Draw the lips.,
Draw the face.,
Draw the inside of the mouth.,
Fill in the body.,
Use your puppet.",How to Make a Paper Bag Puppet1," Keep the bottom flap facing up. Point the opening toward you.;
, Draw the upper lip on the flap, along its lower edge. Then draw the lower lip on the body of the bag, where the edge of the flap meets it. Use the entire width of the flap to create an exaggerated mouth if desired, or a smaller one in proportion to the other facial features.

, Use pencils, pens, crayons, and/or markers to draw outlines for the facial features (nose, eyes, eyebrows, and ears, as well as hair if desired).Then color them in.

, Open the flap. Be careful not to smooth out any creases. Draw the tongue below the crease that you find under the flap. Add the throat and uvula above the crease if desired.


Alternately, you can cut out a small hole here wide enough for your finger and use that as your tongue.

, Excluding the flap, use the lower three-quarters of the bag’s body to design your puppet’s body.For people, outline clothes and color them in. For animals, outline their color pattern and then color in.

, Slide your hand into the opening. Curl your fingers up and under the flap. Extend and curl your fingers to make your puppet “talk.”

"
"
Color your bag.,
Use alternate materials for facial features.,
Give your puppet some extra bite.,
Add hair.,
Create clothing.",How to Make a Paper Bag Puppet2," Outline your puppet’s design in pencil on the bag. Color in the areas either by painting them or by gluing cutouts of colored construction paper to the bag.For animal puppets of reptiles and fish, use cutouts from various colors of construction paper to create multicolored scales.
For birds, make cutouts of feathers from construction paper. Glue them to the bag in layers, starting at the bottom of the bag, with each added row slightly overlapping the one underneath it for a more textured effect.

, Glue a pair of googly eyes to the bag instead.With a steady hand, outline the bag’s lips with glue and then paint or ink them for added dimension once the glue has dried. For the nose, create a glue outline and color it in as you did with the lips, or glue either an appropriately sized pompomor a small piece of putty sculpted into a nose to the bag.

, Use a sheet of white construction paper to make a cutout of teeth.


For the upper row, add a half-inch of extra space along the top. Once you cut it out, apply glue along the top with your cutout facing up. Then stick it underneath the bottom of the flap.
For the bottom row, apply glue to the back of the cutout. Fix it to the body of the bag. As desired, either fit it in place so the upper row and bottom row meet when the mouth is closed, or hide it underneath the upper row and the bottom of the flap to create an overbite.

, Cut yarn into strips of any desired length. Glue the ends to the top of the bag’s flap. Use strips of ribbon to tie the yarn into pigtails or braids.Use yarn to make mustaches and beards as well.
For spiky or crazier hair, use colored pipe cleaners instead.
For animal puppets of mammals, use layers of yarn to create fur. Cut strips of desired length and glue them to the body of the bag. Start your first row along the bottom of the bag rather than the top in order to avoid having to lift layers of yarn to glue underneath them, which might make a mess. Use colored pipe cleaners for whiskers.

, Glue fabric swatches onto the bag. If desired, crease or pleat them beforehand for extra dimension. Then glue strips of ribbon along the collar for an eye-catching trim."
"
Add ears.,
Make legs.,
Create arms.,
Add a tail.",How to Make a Paper Bag Puppet3," Using a stiff sheet of construction paper, outline each ear with pencil. Outline an extra strip to each ear, about a half-inch wide, where the ear will connect to the head. Cut the ears out with scissors. Then, with each ear facing up, apply glue along the extra strip and stick that to the back of the bag, behind the flap.

, Use a stiff sheet of construction paper or thin cardboard for more durability. Design a pair of legs with pencil. Allow extra length at the top to use as a glue tab later on. Cut the legs out with scissors and then, depending on the materials you’ve used for the bag itself, use paint, construction paper, and/or fabric swatches to match your puppet’s skin and/or clothing. Then, with the legs facing up, apply glue to the extra length on top. Glue the legs to the inside of your puppet, underneath the front of the bag, so they dangle out of the opening and in front of your own arm when you’re wearing the puppet.


Since the legs will dangle out of the opening, be gentle with your hand as you slip it in or out of the puppet.

, Use a stiff sheet of construction paper or thin cardboard. Outline each arm separately with pencil. Allow extra length at the end of each, at the “shoulder,” where it will connect to the puppet. Cut each arm out. Depending on the materials you’ve used for the bag itself, use paint, construction paper, and/or fabric swatches to match the arms to the puppet’s design. With each arm facing up, apply glue to the extra length at the shoulder and stick the glue tab to the back of the bag.


To manipulate the arms, trace a second cutout for each arm once you’ve cut out the first: a front-side and a back-side. Glue the two together, leaving a small gap at or below the wrist. Fold the arm where its elbow should be to create a crease. Then insert the thin end of a chopstick (or a similarly long and tapered object, like a sharpened pencil) into the gap by the wrist. Manipulate the chopstick to bend and extend the arm.
For bird puppets, use the same method to create wings.
For fish puppets, use the same method to create lateral fins.

, Use a stiff sheet of construction paper or thin cardboard. Outline your tail with pencil, allowing extra length at the end where it will meet the body. Once you cut it out, crease the extra length to create a glue tab. Depending on the materials you've used for the bag itself, use paint, yarn, or construction paper to match the tail to the puppet's design. Apply glue and stick the glue tab to the back of the body.


For a more durable tail, trace your first cutout on more construction paper or cardboard to create a second cutout. Glue the two together except for the extra length at the end where they will meet the body. Then crease the extra lengths in opposite directions, apply glue to each, and fix the tail to the back of the body.
For fish puppets, use the same method to create a dorsal fin.

Fold a piece of construction paper into thirds, lengthwise.,
Tape the paper shut along the side seam.This will help keep your puppet together.,
Fold the paper rectangle in half, widthwise.,
Fold the open ends back towards the top.,
Make sure that the puppet is facing the right direction.,
Draw the puppet's face, but skip the mouth.,
Open the puppet up and color in the mouth.,
Play with the puppet.",How to Make a Simple Paper Puppet1," You will end up with a long, skinny rectangle. You can use any color you want. If you don't have any construction paper, you can use printer paper instead.;
, Do not tape the top and bottom openings shut, however. These will make pockets for your thumb and fingers to go into.

, The open ends should be at the bottom of the rectangle. The folded part should be at the top.

, Start with the side that is facing you. Once you have it folded up, flip the paper over, and fold the other side. You will end up with something that looks like an W or zigzag when you turn the paper sideways.

, The two folded edges should be facing you. They will make the mouth. The two open edges should be facing away from you. They will make the top of the puppet's head. This is important. If the folded paper is not facing the right way, your puppet may end up upside down.

, Add some eyes in the middle of the paper, and a nose towards the bottom. Don't worry about the mouth just yet. You can draw the eyes and nose using crayons or markers.


To make a fancier puppet, glue on some buttons or googly eyes for the eyes.
To make a silly puppet, glue on a pompom for the nose.
If you glued anything on, make sure you let the glue dry before you move on to the next step.

, If you'd like, you can even add a tongue and some teeth.

, Turn the puppet so that the two openings are facing you. Slip your fingers into the top opening, where the eyes and nose are. Slip your thumb into the bottom opening. Move your fingers and thumb towards/away from each other to make the puppet talk.

Make a two-handed bird.,
Make a one-handed greyhound.,
Make a swan.,
Make a one-handed camel.,
Make an old man.",How to Make Shadow Puppets1," Out of all the hand puppets you can make, this is probably the easiest, making it a great choice for young kids who want to participate in the fun but aren't coordinated enough to try some of the harder puppets. To make the bird, simply turn your hands so that your palms face you, cross your hands over each other, and lock your thumbs together. Stretch your palms open to make the bird's wings.To make the bird ""fly"", curl your fingers inward, then outward again.;
, This hand puppet is also quite easy, though it requires you to extend your ring finger and little finger without extending the rest of your fingers, which can be tricky for some people. To make the greyhound, start by raising your hand in a fist with your thumb facing you. Raise your little finger and ring finger so that they're parallel to the floor while keeping your index and ring finger curled in. Raise your thumb slightly to make the dog's ear.








To make the dog's mouth move, move your little finger up and down.

, This shadow puppet uses both hands and part of one arm, making it one of the biggest ones out there. To make the swan, begin by raising one arm, bending it at the elbow, and bringing the tips of the fingers together so that they make a point. With your other hand, spread your fingers wide and put the fleshy part of your palm on your bicep to make the swan's tail feathers.







, This shadow puppet is a great stepping stone for beginners looking to branch out into more difficult puppets. To make the camel, raise one arm, bending it at the elbow so that your hand points toward the ceiling. Curve your middle and ring fingers forward gently while you arch your index finger back to make the camel's eye — get used to doing this, as it's something that's used in many of the more advanced puppets. Let your little finger droop slightly to form the camel's bottom lip. Tuck your thumb out of the way behind your hand.









To make the camel's mouth move, let your little finger bounce up and down limply.

, This shadow puppet is great for puppet shows because it's easy to make him ""talk."" To make the old man, raise your palm, then point your index finger forward. Curve your middle, ring, and little fingers in an arc to form the man's eye. Bend your thumb in and raise it up to the index finger to form the man's jaw.









Making the man talk is a cinch — just move your thumb back and forth to match the words you say.

Get a piece of paper.,
Draw the shape of your puppet on the paper.,
Cut the shape out using a pair of scissors.,
Decorate the puppet.,
Tape or glue a popsicle stick to the back of your puppet.,
Play with your puppet.",How to Make a Simple Paper Puppet2," It can be construction paper, printer paper, or cardstock. If you'd like to make a ""shadow"" puppet, use black paper.

, Try to it roughly the size of your hand. If you make the shape too big, your puppet will be too flimsy and flop over. The shape can be anything you want: an animal, a circle, a square, and so forth.


Circles make great bases for faces.
Squares make great robot faces.
Animal shapes make great shadow puppets.
If you aren't good at drawing, print out a cartoon character or animal on a sheet of paper instead.

, Be sure to stay within the lines that you drew.

, Draw some eyes, nose, and a mouth. You can even add some hair or clothes. Remember, if you glue anything on, let the glue dry before moving onto the next step. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Monsters make great stick puppets. Get silly with your design. Give your monster one eye, or three. If you want to give him a tongue, draw polka dots on it.Cut shapes, such as arms, legs, ears, and horns out of construction paper, then glue or tape them onto your puppet.Glue on some yarn or colored pipe cleaners for hair. If you'd like short, curly hair, try macaroni.
Glue on some buttons or googly eyes for eyes, and a pompom for the nose.

, If you don't have any popsicle sticks at home, you can use a short, wooden dowel or even a drinking straw., Sit behind a table, and hold your puppet so that it sticks up from behind it. Wave your puppet from side-to-side to make it move and talk.

Draw a rounded shape the size of your palm on a sheet of colored paper.,
Cut the shape out using a pair of scissors.,
Cut two small holes near the bottom of your puppet's body.,
Decorate your puppet.,
Play with your puppet.",How to Make a Simple Paper Puppet3," This will make the body of your puppet. Your shape can be anything you want it to be, but good body shapes for puppets include circles, ovals, eggs, and lumps.


Make sure that the puppet is large enough to cover the back of your hand; you will eventually be sticking your fingers through it to make it ""walk.""
You can use construction paper, but cardstock will be sturdier.

, If your puppet has some thin parts, such as antlers or antenna, be sure to leave some space around them. This way, they won't break off.

, The holes need to be big enough for your first two fingers to fit through. They should also be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) apart.

, You can color it with crayons or markers, or you can glue on things like buttons or pompoms. Be sure to give it some eyes, a nose, and mouth. You can even give it some other details, such as clothing and hair. If you glued anything on, remember to let the puppet dry before moving on to the next step.


If you'd like to get fancy, glue on some buttons or googly eyes for the eyes, and a pompom for the nose.

, Turn your puppet so that the blank side is facing you. Stick your first two fingers through the holes in the bottom. Place your fingers on the table, and move them to make your puppet walk or dance."

Draw or print out a picture of a cartoon character on a sheet of paper.,
Cut the character out using a pair of scissors.,
Cut a ½ by 2 inch (1.27 by 5.08 centimeters) strip from a sheet of paper.,
Form a ring with the strip.,
Secure the ends with tape.,
Glue or tape the strip to the back of your character.,
Play with your finger puppet.",How to Make a Simple Paper Puppet4," The image needs to be about the same size as your finger. It's okay if the image is a little bit wider, but not by too much.


To make a more durable puppet, use cardstock paper instead.

, If the character has some thin parts, like antenna or antlers, leave some white space around those areas. This way, they won't break off.

, This will make the band for your finger to slide through.Try to match the color of the strip to the color of the puppet.

, Overlap the two narrow ends until you get a ring shape. The ring should be large enough to fit your finger. Don't make it too tight, or the paper will rip when you bend your finger.

, Once you have the right fit, wrap a piece of tape around the seam to keep the ring together.

, The bottom edge of the ring should be aligned with the bottom edge of your puppet.

, Wait for the glue to dry, if you were using it, and slide the puppet onto your finger. Wiggle your finger side-to-side and back-and-forth to make the puppet move and talk.

Make a face.,
Make a bulldog.,
Make an elephant.,
Make a deer.,
Make a doggy.",How to Make Shadow Puppets2," This tricky shadow puppet makes full use of both hands, but is positively lifelike when pulled off well. To start, face your left palm toward yourself and make a ring with your middle finger and thumb. Bring your ring and little fingers together and curl them inward. Let your index finger lay on top of the ring formed by your middle finger ad thumb, sticking out slightly. With your right hand, face your palm toward the floor, curl your little and ring fingers in, and make an arc with your index and middle finger to form the face's eye. Lay this over your other hand palm-down to complete the puppet.








To make the face talk, you need to move the ring and little finger on your left hand up and down independently from the rest of your hand. This can be quite tricky, so practice!

, The hardest part of this shadow puppet isn't what you need to do with your fingers, but the way you need to orient your hands. With your left hand, face your palm toward the ground, curl all of your fingers except your thumb inward at the second knuckle, and bend the thumb underneath. With your right hand, curl all of your fingers except your thumb in an arc to make the bulldog's eye and raise your thumb to make its ear. Finally, put your right hand on top of your left so that all of your knuckles are facing the same way and align your hands just right so that the bulldog is visible — harder than it sounds!









To make the bulldog bark, move your left thumb up and down.

, This puppet's trunk requires a unique arrangement of the middle and ring fingers. To start, face your left hand's palm toward the ground. Point your ring and middle fingers toward the ground while keeping your little and index fingers straight (like a ""rock on"" gesture). Bend your thumb and tuck it under the hand. Place your right hand palm-down on top of your left hand and bend all of your fingers except your thumb to make the elephant's eye.








Try moving the middle and ring fingers on your left hand to make the elephant's trunk move — you can also make it talk with the thumb on your left hand.

, This puppet can take lots of practice, but it looks amazing when it's perfected. To start, face your left palm toward the ground and bring your index, middle, and ring fingers together in a point. Tuck your thumb under your hand and extend your little finger straight slightly under your other fingers. Place the fleshy part of your right palm on the back of your left hand and extend your thumb, index, and middle fingers upward. Curve your ring and little finger to make the deer's eye.








To make the deer talk, move the little finger on your left hand up and down. Be gentle — deer are usually quiet and composed (until they're startled by a friend's elephant puppet, of course).

, This hand puppet makes a pretty convincing terrier or dachshund. Start by raising your right arm and bending it at the elbow so that the hand points at the ceiling. Bend your little and ring fingers down so they point forward. Bring your middle finger over your index finger and arch it to make the dog's eye. Tuck your thumb up into the crook of your index finger. Bring the palm of your left hand against the side of your right forearm and extend your index and middle fingers while sticking your thumb behind the forearm to make the dog's tail. Keep your left ring and little fingers tucked out of the way.








Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way to make the dog talk, so you'll just have to use your puppet's ""body language"" to express its emotions!

Gather your materials.,

Design and draw your puppets.,
Cut out your puppets.When you're satisfied with the designs of your puppets, use a pair of scissors to carefully cut along the outlines you drew.,
Attach sticks to your puppets.,
Get ready for your show.,
Start your show.",How to Make Shadow Puppets3," If you're having a hard time contorting your hands into the bizarre shapes needed to make hand shadow puppets, don't worry! You can make wonderful, detailed miniature shadow puppets with just a few common materials you'll probably have lying around the house. For this project, you’ll need:


Construction paper
A light source (like a lamp or light bulb)
A cardboard box (for your ""stage"")
Straws or balsa wood sticks
Tape
Thin tissue paper or baking parchment (for your “screen”)

, To begin, cut the bottom out of the cardboard box, leaving a 5 cm (about 2 inches) border around the edges. Next, fasten a thin sheet of tissue or baking paper onto the frame with tape or glue so that it covers the hole you've just cut. This will be the ""screen"" for your puppet show — you'll hold your puppets in between your light source and the paper to project their images onto the screen.








, Next, grab a sheet of construction paper or cardboard (whatever you use, it should be thick enough that light doesn't shine through it). Draw the outlines of your puppets on this paper or cardboard. Your puppets can be as simple or as detailed as you like, so be creative!









One good idea is to draw small details like eyes or smiles on the puppet so that, when it's cut out, these details will appear in its shadow. However, this can require some tricky detail work on your part — you may need to use an X-acto knife to make these small cuts in the middle of the puppet.

, As noted above, for minor details like eyes, facial features, hair, and so on, you may need to use a small, sharp X-acto knife.









Another good idea is to use the sorts of special children's scissors that are often sold at back-to-school sales. These scissors can sometimes have designs like zigzag lines and curves incorporated into the blades of the scissors, making it easy to make these sorts of designs in your puppets.

, Grab a thin wooden stick (like a coffee stirrer or popsicle stick) or a drinking straw for each puppet. Put a piece of tape or a drop of glue on one side of each stick or straw. Fasten the sticks or straws to the backs of your paper puppets. If you're using glue, give it time to dry before using your puppets.









For especially big puppets (or puppets with moving parts), you may need to use more than one stick.

, Grab an audience, and, if needed, a few friends to act in the show with you. Position the box so that your paper ""screen"" is facing the audience, then crouch behind the box. Make sure that you can easily fit your hands into the box — if you need to, you may want to cut the sides of the cardboard box down a little to make it easier to put your hands in. As long as your box can still stand up on its own, anything you do to it is fair game.









You'll also want to put your light source (lamp, lightbulb, flashlight, etc.) behind the box so that its light shines clearly through the box and out of the screen. This light will make the puppets cast their shadows on the screen during your show.

, If you're not already behind the box, duck behind it, making sure it's positioned with the screen in front of you, and the audience in the front of the screen. Grab all of your puppets and turn on the light behind the box. Finally, turn off the light in the room. Showtime! Move your puppets between your light source and the box so that their shadows project onto the thin paper screen for your audience. Break a leg!









If you can't get it dark enough in the room for your puppets to cast clear shadows on the screen, try drawing all of the curtains in the room to keep light from outside from entering.

Choose a figure.,
Make the figure.,
If you'd like, consider using paper plates.,
Color it in.,
Make the handle.,
Add any decorations.",How to Make Puppets1," Try to choose characters with an ambiguous identity or description, so that you can reuse them in other puppet shows. You can find figures anywhere, but the Internet has a wealth of options available at the touch of a button.;
, On a piece of paper, trace out the figure to the desired size. You may like to reinforce the paper with card, or draw it directly on to card, so that the paper doesn't flap around during your performance.


Think about the back side, too! Will your puppet be turning around during use? And if you do make a back side, does it need fins or a tail?

, If a circular shape would aid well to your project, consider using this sturdy, textured material. It works well for fish, crabs, clams, and other plump creatures.


If you use two, it gives ultimate volume. Cut a slit to the center and reglue them together with a bit of overlap. Taking a section out forces the paper to bend into more of a shallow cone shape. Place the wide sides together to form the body of your animal.

, Color is an important part of any puppet show. Make your characters bright and interesting, so that the audience's eye is pleased.

, Find a clear plastic straw and attach it to the back of the puppet with cello-tape or blue tack. Be sure that it is long enough that your hand is some distance from the actual puppet. You don't want your arm in the show!


Alternatively, get some fishing wire and attach it to your puppet so you can hold it from the top. This, however, requires you to stand up while performing.

, For eyes, use the googly kind (attach with glue). If you're making a Puffer Fish, like in the pictures, consider using straws cut down at an angle to about 2"" (5 cm) and attached all over the body.Cut some small fins out of your paper or paper plate. Tada!

"
"
Choose the sock.,
Put the sock over your hand and arm.,
Add the eyes.,
Add any additional features.",How to Make Puppets2," Try to find some that would come up to your knee, so that when you wear them as puppets it doesn't look as if half the puppet is your arm. Stay away from ones that have stains or holes.


Choose colors that match your character's personality. Stripy socks make the character seem bright and happy, while plain black makes them look mysterious or criminal. If your sock is taking on an animal persona, use the color of the sock as the color of their body.

, When you're wearing the puppet, poke some fabric down into the hollow between your thumb and index finger. This will make a mouth. Also hold your wrist perpendicular to your arm, so that the audience can tell where the head ends and the body begins.


This is the quickest way to make a sock puppet. If you're looking to get a little more creative, take a gander at wikiHow's Make a Sock Puppet for a few more intricate varieties.

, You can find a variety of types of eyes at your local arts and crafts store. Choose big 'googly' ones that will make your characters look slightly unreal. Be sure that they suit the character as well. Attach each one with a dab of glue


Pom pom eyes are also a cute addition. They add a bit more shape to the normal sock silhouette. They're also easier to rest glasses on!

, A sock puppet can be the bare minimum or it can be dressed to the nines. Add a felt tongue, a clump of string for hair, a ribbon, a necktie, or whatever your sock character might wear.

"
"
Trace your finger on a piece of paper.,
Cut out your felt pieces.,
Sew on the additions.,
Place the top and bottom of the body on top of each other and sew together.",How to Make Puppets3," Leave 1/2"" (1 cm or so) extra on all sides, stopping just below your second knuckle. This is the template for your finger puppet.

, You'll need two of your template (front and back) plus any extra bits. Wings for your butterfly? A nose for your elephant? A beak for your chicken? Ears for your rabbit? Get as intricately detailed as possible.


If your brain isn't firing on all pistons at the moment, look up a few generic cartoons for detailing inspiration.

, Before you get to sewing the base of the puppet, sew on all the small, finer details. While you have your thread out, sew on a grin with a backstitch.


A whip stitch will probably be best for adding your eyes/nose/beak/wings/general details. If sewing isn't your forte, you may be able to get around most of it with hot glue. But take care -- glue and felt isn't always pretty, especially if too much glue is used.

, Do a blanket stitch around the entire body; if you've added a piece that doesn't allow for this, switch to a running stitch.


Now all you've got to do is put 'em on and get to creating. Unless you want to give your puppet 9 more friends, of course!
