Get a hold of a large styrofoam ball and start sculpting.,
Cover your puppet head with fleece.,
Add on the facial features.,
Give it some clothes.,
Make a hand for your puppet.",How to Make Puppets4," Soft foam works, too, but styrofoam is easier to carve out. The tough part about this is that you have to sculpt a face. The easy part is that puppets come in all shapes and sizes and you can't really mess it up.


The major points to cover are indentations for the eye sockets, a bulge for a nose, and removing the lower jaw (if you want it to talk).
If you do want it to talk, leave a space for your hand to go into!

, Start at the middle of the face and work your way out, hot gluing as you go along. Spray adhesive also works, but it's a bit harder to work with. Readjust and stretch as you glue, keeping the fleece tight against the styrofoam. Get deep into the indentations (like the eye sockets) and keep it secure, like skin would naturally be.


You can either have the nose be part of same material as the head, stick it onto the styrofoam ball, or cover it in fleece and then add it to the face. One way is not better than any other.

, Bottle caps can be used for eyes, but so can beads, puff balls, or anything you can find wandering through your local craft supply store. As far as the lower jaw goes, if you removed it, cover it in fleece and hot glue just the very edges to the head. The styrofoam jaw should still be able to move -- just the fleece should be hot glued and attached.


Depending on the size of your puppet, it could be donning a full-fledged wig or hat on its head. Neither of those available? Throw on a hoodie! Problem solved.
Add felt eyebrows and ears, if desired. Every puppet is different, so if yours doesn't have something, it won't be cause for alarm.

, A naked puppet is, for some reason, sufficiently awkward. Grab something you never want to wear again and glue the top to the ""neck"" of your puppet (for this reason, you may want to employ a scarf or turtleneck).


To give the puppet a body, simply stuff the shirt with newspaper or some type of foam or quilt batting. Stay away from short sleeves so you don't have to deal with making arms.

, Since one is probably operating the face, make at least one hand movable to give your puppet even more life. All you need to do is trace your hand on a piece of felt, cut it out twice, and sew them together (inside out, to hide the seam).


Leave just short of an inch (2 cm) around all sides of your hand to give yourself some wiggle room. To have a four-fingered puppet (including the thumb), just keep your index finger and ring finger together as you trace.
Place your hand in it and through the sleeve of your puppet. Now your puppet talks and can gesture! Move over Achmed.

Gather your materials.,
Glue the eyes onto the bag.,
Glue the mouth onto the bag.,
Glue the hair onto the bag.,
Draw the nose.,
Play with your puppet.",How to Make Puppets5," Get a paper bag, googly eyes, construction paper, wool, markers, and glue or tape.

, If you don't have googly eyes, you can cut out eyes from the construction paper, making tiny black pupils and gluing them onto larger white circles. Regular glue will work just fine for this -- you don't need to use the stronger stuff.

, Cut a little red mouth out of the construction paper and glue it in place.

, Now, either use strips of construction paper or wool onto the top of the paper bag. Wait for it to dry.

, Use a black marker to draw a nose on the paper bag in between the eyes and the mouth.

, Once you've made face and everything is ready to go, you can play with your puppet!

Find a suitable sock.,
Lay the sock flat.,
Paint a large open mouth on the sock, using fabric paint.,
Paint teeth.,
Paint dripping blood.,
Paint some scars on the body and face of the sock.,
Choose two spots for adding the eyes.,
Use red thread to suggest blood.",How to Sew a Zombie Sock Monkey," Choose a sock that looks like it has seen better days. Bits missing, dye runs and anything else wrong with the sock will make it the ideal candidate for turning into a zombie sock puppet.


Green fuzzy socks make for a sickly looking zombie.
If the sock is white, consider painting or dyeing it a darker color; it doesn't matter how messy a job you do!;
, The top of the sock will be where your fingers end when you place the hand in the sock. Just below this area, draw a very large mouth using fabric marker.

, Paint it like a big ""O"", with black paint.

, Paint on fang-like teeth at the top and bottom of the ""O"" shape. Use white fabric paint for the teeth.

, Use red fabric paint for blood dripping from the mouth of the zombie. Paint some blood on the upper lip as well.

, Scars can be shown by a long line with some shorter cross lines added on.

, Make sure that they're not level as no self-respecting zombie would have eyes on straight. Use buttons for the eyes; for best effect, have one small button and one large button.

, Add a bunch of long red threads hanging out from the center of the button (eyeball), to suggest more streaming blood and general messiness.

Make a stage.,
Design the background.,
Put on your show.",How to Make Puppets6," To make a basic stage, cover a table with a tablecloth that comes down to the floor. The table needs to be high enough that your children (or you) can easily kneel behind it without being seen.

, Paint a mural onto a large piece of cardboard and hang it from the wall behind you. The mural can be a setting (park, beach, etc) or just the name of the show in large letters. But remember, a sign should be put on the front of the tablecloth announcing what the show is. If you're doing this, the name of the show is not necessary in the mural.


Make a few props for your puppets to work with, too. In a couple of minutes, you can whip up a tree, a rock, some flowers, or whatever might be found in your puppet show setting.

, What's your opening music? Are you doing it improv style or will there be lines? Is there a moral to your story, or just for fun? If you're working with children, make sure each gets a turn at their favorite puppets -- each child will inevitably have one.

Consider other possible ideas, including an alien, a fairytale character or a mythical beast.;
, Use masking tape to stick pieces of tissue paper and scrap material to your wooden spoon for clothing (or scales, armour etc.). This is a lot less messy than glue and you can change the features any time you feel like it. Stick the craft items to the handle to create a costume for your puppet.

Congratulations!",How to Make a Rod Puppet," Make sure these holes are close to the ends. (But not too close, otherwise they would have openings.)
, It is extremely important to make sure your smallest dowel fits inside this hole. This dowel will support the body., Make sure this hole is near one of the ends. 

The end where the hole is will be both the top and the end connected to the hand, so choose carefully!

, You are now ready to make the head., You are going to build your puppet's head bottom to top, so make sure you have enough., Crumple them up and stick them onto the tube. Continue adding crumpled paper until you have formed a head shape, keeping in mind that the papier-mâché will make it slightly bigger once applied.

You can use glue and masking tape to stick papers to each other. Don't use too much masking tape, though, or it will be hard for papier-mâché to stick afterwards!

, Do not make it too thick (will result in too much bulkiness) or too thin. (Will cause the head to fall apart.)

This is your time to prepare for facial features. Create indents for eyes if you want, and shape a nose and a pair of ears.

, This time, make the pieces small--the smaller, the better. Use the paste to stick them onto the papier-mâché., Too thick, and that means scrape-y time is a good time. Too thin, and that mans you must add more bits of newspaper.

For necks that are too thick, once you scrape, wrap masking tape tightly around the neck to hold it in place and possibly make it thinner.

, (Not the corn-syrup-paste.) Repeat step two of ""Making the Head"", but this time you have more tube to attach newspaper to. Bonus!, However, instead of creating preparations for facial features, form the likings of a body. See below for examples.

Broader shoulders/men, curvier shoulders/women
Optional: Make the waist narrower than the chest if the puppet is a woman (or you feel like it).

, Stick the ends deep into the papier-mâché near the shoulders, leaving the curve to tie the arms to., Now, prepare for creating arms!, Next, push it through one of the holes of the four remaining dowels (assuming your puppet has two arms) and tie it to the curve in the wire, leaving leeway for the arm to move. This is the upper half of one arm., That means the lower hole of one dowel will be attached to the upper hole of the second. Using a hand saw, cut the unattached end of the lower arm so when finished, it resembles a chair. This is the lower arm., Get ready for hands!, Using a hand saw, cut a simple hand shape. Do this one more time for the other hand.

By no means does the hand have to be elaborate; a reasonable-sized oval shape with a straight bottom should do.

, It should fit well enough. Use clamps or binder clips to secure the hand where you want it while the glue dries., Tie it to the hole in the rod. Repeat for other hand., This is the ""skin color,"" the ""default color"", whatever you call it. It will be, as the first example states, the color of your puppet's skin.

It helps to apply multiple coats.
If you would prefer for no one to see the skin color under the puppet's hair, (should you choose to make hair) you can paint it the color of the yarn being used.

, Paint the following onto the puppet's face:

Eyes
Eyebrows
Mustache or beard
Accessories (i.e. nose ring, earrings, et cetera)

, Wrap your yarn around the cardboard 25-100 times. Change the length of the short end for longer/shorter hair. Keep in mind, though, that the hair will be half the length it is now., It should be in a loop. ""Fold"" it in half and hot glue the center to the head, making sure there is hair on the back of the head as well., Cut a hole big enough to fit through the body dowel., (Yes, the one that supports the body.) This will cause the body to fall, leaving only the body dowel and the head., Then, slip the body through and put the supporting dowel back in place. Magic!, With a needle and thread, stitch the ""sleeve"" into place.,, You are finished."

Set the frame on edge with its top surface facing you.",How to Make a Puppet Stage from Wood," Either use one that you already have or build one from scratch. If you are using an existing one, it must be wide enough to accommodate the top of the stage that you'll be building in the next part. If building one from scratch, cut three base panels to the height of choice, using the following widths:

Cut one piece 59"" long for the front panel.
Cut two pieces 34"" long for the two side pieces.


The height should be determined by what will be high enough to cover an adult squatting down behind the panel. Only your hands should be observed (covered in the puppets), none of your body or head.

, Screw these into place firmly. You may also need to glue the edges together for a firm fit, that depends on how well the brackets are holding the pieces together.





The image demonstrates another option for attaching the panels together, using metal square pole joints instead of bracketing the wooden pieces closely together.
Cut the flagstaffs (long poles, see image above) to size.
Don't make any shelves, as they'll only get in the puppeteers' way. If you need a place to hold items, boxes can be shifted in and out from the back of the stage, as needed.

, After you've built the lemonade stand, you have made the base of the puppet stage. You'll now need to make the top of the stage, from which the curtains will hang., They are now ready to be cut as follows:

Cut two pieces 59"" long. These will become the long sides of the curtain-top frame.
Cut another pair of pieces 34"" long.These pieces will become the short sides of the frame.
Cut two 23"" lengths which will become the filler pieces.


 

;
,





Place the 34"" side pieces first. One goes on the left and the other on the right.
Set the 59"" front and back pieces perpendicular to the 34-inch side pieces, with their ends resting on top of the 34"" pieces. This forms a rectangle.
Set the 23"" filler pieces on top of the 34"" side pieces and between the 59"" front and back pieces. You should now have a rectangle in one plane on the top. Square up the pieces using a framing square to align the outer edges.

,





Carefully lift up the filler pieces and put carpenter's glue along the bottom surfaces.
Replace them and check the alignment with a framing square again.
Drive four #8 or #10 x 1-1/4"" long screws through each filler piece into the end pieces below, securing the two pieces.

,, Holding the long side in place, drive three 1/4-inch screws through each end, into the side piece below Avoid driving a screw in the extreme outside corner of each corner; you'll be drilling holes for the curtain rods there later.,, (Perfection is not required.), At each corner, square a line 3-% inches in from each outside edge, so that you have two lines that intersect. Use an awl to punch each intersection point.




,, Repeat at the other three corners., Square lines across the nearer long side 28 inches (71.1 cm) in from either end. On one of these lines, mark a point 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the near edge of the frame.,, Mark the point where the two lines intersect. Do the same on the other far corner. If there is a screw in the way at these crosshairs, rake it out now., Drill a hole all the way through the top frame at each of the four points you've marked.

These smaller holes are for the curtain-rod ends.

, Each one should measure 11 f 'ct by 12 inches., You should now have three 11-feet by 6-inch lengths of cloth., surface. Clamp the frame in place. Then find the center of the front edge of the frame and make a small pencil mark there., At the midpoint, staple the unfolded edge of the cloth to the center of the front edge of the frame, keeping the edge of the cloth flush with the top edge of the frame. At this stage, the unfolded edge of cloth should be stapled to the wood and the folded edge should hang down.







,

Grab hold of the top edge of the cloth a few inches to the left of the midpoint.
Bring that top edge back against the midpoint staple, making a loop of cloth that points out toward you.
Keeping the top edge in position, flatten the loop to the left and staple its end to the edge of the frame. The new staple should be just about an inch away from the midpoint staple. You've just made one pleat.

,


Grab the cloth a few inches to the left of the pleat, pull the top edge back to the staple you just placed.
Fold the loop of cloth down to the left, and staple it flush to the top edge of the top frame.
Working to the left, create a series of flat, folded pleats across the top of the top frame. The end result will appear just like the tops of old-fashioned curtains.


Try to keep each of the folds even, stapling every inch or so. You may also find that pleating may be an easier task with two people working together, one to fold and hold the cloth and the other to staple.

, Get another length of fabric, and keep going. Overlap the new fabric over the ""ruffle"" of the old fabric by an inch or so.




,, At this point, cut the fabric about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than you need, and fold this extra underneath before putting in the last staple, just before the corner.,, Start at the end of one short side, moving across the front, and finishing on the other short side. Cut off any excess ribbon when you are finished.

Gluing, smoothing, and holding the ribbon in place may require a few extra sets of hands.


The result will be a beautiful finished ruffle.

, Each piece should be 5 1⁄2 feet (1.7 m) long (but longer is okay too).,, Iron it down. Then, staple it in place., Then bring the other piece of fabric to the work surface, ironing and stapling using the same three folds., Figure out how much you'll have to fold over to make the final width of each cloth 36 inches (91.4 cm). If your fold is more than 2 inches (5.1 cm), use two or even three rows of staples to hold it down.

Alternatively, you can trim off some of the extra cloth to make your fold less than 2 inches (5.1 cm).

, Start at a corner and place a clip every 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so., Bend them until they are basically straight.






To bend (or straighten) the tubing, grasp it with both hands, with your thumbs pointing toward each other and about an inch apart. Gently push in with your thumbs until you feel the tubing move. Shift your hands along the tubing and press down again with your thumbs, bending the tubing just a little in each place along its length to avoid creating kinks.

, Mark both tubes together at three even intervals where the tubing is going to be bent into shape: a bend in from each end of the tubes and one bend in the middle. The two end bends at each side should be exactly the same measurement in from the ends, about 11 inches in from each end, while the center bend is dead center, 31 3/4 inches from the end (see the image to help you see where to make the bend points).





, Hold the end you have just measured from in your right hand. About 11/2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end, begin bending the tubing. Bend a little, moving your hands farther down, then bend a little more. When you reach the first layout mark on the tubing, stop bending and check your progress.

Your goal is to make the tubing turn 90 degrees evenly between the end of the tube and the first layout mark. Adjust the curve being shaped by bending more (or unbending if necessary), spreading your efforts along the whole length of bent tubing. (Perfection is not required, and you will be able to make adjustments later.)

, Begin making a second bend along a horizontal plane, trying to complete a 90-degree turn by the time you reach the third layout mark. You should end up with a left-hand bend., Make the end bend as for the first end bend., The second curtain rod will be a mirror image of the first., Hold the completed curtain rods up to the curtain frame to check their alignment, remembering that they overlap at the center of the frame., The rods should curve around the outside of the larger holes (so that on opening night the curtain can follow the same path around the pole that will run through the holes). If the rods are out of alignment, bend them into position now., Slip the curtains onto them., Work the ends of the rods down into the holes until they reach all the way through the frame to the work surface., Drive the sheet-metal screws into the tubing until the screw head contacts the wood frame. This is an unorthodox use of screws and copper tubing, but with some extra force, the threads should bite into the copper and flare it right against the sides of the drilled hole.

Print out the pattern and cut out the parts for the mouth, ears, and tongue so that you can trace them onto the craft foam.You can download the parts pattern at: http://anadiycrafts.com/mouse-sock-puppet/


, Make sure that you give the hot glue gun enough time to warm up before you use it. Otherwise, it will not be as effective. Try switching it on about 15 to 20 minutes before you get started.


Also, when using a hot glue gun, keep the gun tip close to the item that you are gluing. If you hold it too far away, then the glue will dry before it reaches the item., Take the mouth pattern and lay it over your cardboard piece. Then, use your marker to trace the mouth shape onto the cardboard. Next, cut along the marker lines to create your cardboard mouth piece., Lay the sock heel side up on your work surface and position your cardboard mouth piece to see where you will need to glue it. You will need to place it near the toe of the sock and allow a little space around the edges.Once you have decided on the best position for the mouth, apply some hot glue to the back of your cardboard piece and press the cardboard piece onto the sock.

, Curl up the sock around the cardboard piece's edges to create a raised border. Apply a line of hot glue to the edges as you go.Make sure that you press the sock into the edges and hold for a second.

, After you have finished creating a border around the cardboard piece, take the mouth pattern and lay it over the red craft foam. Use the marker to trace around the edges of the pattern and then cut it out., Lay the red foam mouth piece over the cardboard piece. Then, apply glue to the back of the red foam mouth piece and secure it to the cardboard piece.Make sure that any remaining marker is facing down.
Check the position of the red foam mouth piece before you attach it to the cardboard piece.

, Use the tongue pattern to trace the tongue piece over the black craft foam. Then, cut out the tongue piece. It should look like a black heart when you are done. Position the tongue piece over the lower portion of the mouth piece.When you have decided where to position your tongue piece, apply glue to the back side of the tongue piece and press it into place.

, Your foam ball or ball halves will be the eyes of your puppet. If you just have a foam ball, then you will need to cut it in half. Then, take the two halves of the foam ball and lay them flat side down. Next, use the precision knife to cut off a piece of the foam near the edge.When you are finished, you should have two foam ball halves that have a flat edge on one side. You should be able to place the foam pieces side-by-side and they should fit together.

, Cut out two thin strips of black craft foam. Then, use hot glue to attach these strips to the rounded parts of the foam so that they look like the edges of eyelids.Next, cut off a piece of your second fuzzy sock. The piece should be wide enough and long enough to wrap all the way around the foam ball.
Glue the sock material over the eyelid area to create the fuzzy eyelids.
Cut off any excess sock material from the edges of the eyelids.

, Cut out two 1.5 centimeter circles from the black craft foam. Then, cut out a small wedge from each of the circles. Next, glue the circles onto the rounded foam part of the eyes so that the wedges are pointing in the same direction (either to the right or to the left)., Once your eyes are finished, you can glue them to your sock. Glue the eyes onto the fuzzy side of the sock, opposite the puppet’s mouth. The flat sides of the eye pieces should be facing each other. The eyes should also be placed close together so that the fuzzy sock borders are touching., Use a dot of hot glue to glue the pompom to the center of the sock’s toe area. This will be the puppet’s nose. The pompom should be positioned on the opposite of the mouth side and just a little below the eyes., Use the ear pattern and your marker to trace the ears onto the green craft foam. Then, cut out the two ears from the green craft foam. Check the position of the ears and then glue the ears to the sock and to the backs of the eyes.Apply a line of hot glue along the flat edges of each ear and apply a dot of hot glue to the bottom part of each ear as well. Make sure that you press the ears firmly into place.

, Cut out six long, thin strips of black craft foam. Then, attach each of the thin strips to the base of the nose using a small dot of hot glue at the base of the nose. After all of the whiskers are attached, trim the whiskers to that they are all about the same length., Cut out two white foam squares for the teeth. Then, apply some hot glue to one side of one of the foam squares and fold it in half. Make sure that the edges are lined up and hold the edges in place for a few seconds. Then, apply hot glue to one side of the foam and fold it in half again in the same way.Repeat this process for the other tooth.
Trim the short edges of the teeth so that they are about the same length and so that the edges are even.

, Take one of the teeth and apply a line of hot glue to one of the short edges. Then, press the tooth into top part of the puppet’s mouth near the edge of the red foam.Make sure that the tooth is placed on one side of the nose and that there will be room for the other tooth on the other side. Leave a small gap between the teeth as well.
Press gently to make sure that the teeth stay in place.
When both teeth are attached, trim them down a bit so that they are even with each other.

, Your sock puppet is now finished and ready to use! You can use your puppet to play, entertain your friends with it, or make some more puppets and put on a puppet show!

Give your puppet a nose.,
Accessorize your sock puppet.",How to Make a Hand Puppet1," The most basic requirement for your sock puppet is a clean sock. If you want to make a specific character, keep the color of the sock in mind.


Remember that a black sock will be harder to draw on. Understand that you’ll need to attach materials to make the face rather than draw it on;
, Slip your sock on your hand, and use your thumb as the lower jaw and your fingers to form the face and upper jaw.This will help you block out on the sock the space for the eyes, nose, hair, etc.

, You can use a variety of objects to make the eyes for your sock puppet.



Try using googly eyes. You can find these at craft stores or in the craft section of big box stores. You could also draw the eyes on a piece of construction paper. Using overlapping circles of felt for the whites, color, and pupils of the eyes is an option. Try using beads as eyes. You can find plenty of beads in a wide variety at a craft store.
If you need to take the sock off your hand to make the eyes, then mark the position for the eyes with a small pen mark, so you can see the rough size you want to make the eyes.

, Depending on what you decided to use for the eyes, you may have to attach them in separate ways. For quick and easy results, you can simply use a glue stick, but a hot glue gun will yield better results.


For beads and felt, you can also consider sewing the eyes to the sock.
If you use a hot glue gun, make sure to take the sock off your hand first so as not to burn yourself.

, You can make the mouth for your sock puppet as simple or complex as you'd like. For a simple mouth, try using crayons or a fabric marker to draw lips. Put your hand in the sock puppet and figure out where the mouth would be given the dimensions of your hand. Draw the lips around where your fingertips form the lips of the sock puppet.


You could also make a more complex mouth. You can consider making a tongue out of construction paper or felt , making teeth with beads, or drawing a more elaborate mouth., If you decide that you want your puppet to have hair, you can easily use yarn, string, felt, or anything else you want to get creative with. Simply cut the material down to size and glue it to the top of the sock at your chosen hairline for your puppet., You have even more options for the nose of your puppet than some of the other features. You can use felt, a pompom, crayons, markers, or even leave your puppet without a nose.For many puppets, simply drawing in nostrils with a black or color marker is more than enough for a nose.

, Once you have the basic puppet, feel free to add any other accessories you wish. You can make antennae with pipe cleaners and pompoms, make ears with folds of felt, add glasses or a hat, etc."

Finished.

",How to Create a Marionette1," Lay the cardboard or poster board on a flat surface. Sketch out individual body parts for the marionette. The puppet will need two separate arms, two separate legs and a torso section with the head attached.;
, Decorate the sketched puppet with markers, crayons or paint, and cut out the pieces.

, Assemble the puppet face-up on a flat surface. Lay the torso piece down first, then arrange the arms and legs on the marionette so that a section of each overlaps with the torso piece.

, Push a brass brad through each joint in the puppet; punch holes in the paper if it is too thick to be pierced by the brad alone. The joints should remain loose and flexible enough for the limbs to move easily.

, Lay down two chopsticks or pencils to form a cross. Tape the sticks together where they intersect.

, Thread a needle with fishing line. Piercing a hole through the cardboard just above the knees and the wrists, knot the line and draw the fishing line through. Knot and cut the line after making each attachment. The length of fishing line extending from each section needs to be long enough to reach the sticks, which should be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) above the shoulders (longer if the head is large).

, Knot the fishing line extending from the puppet's shoulders to the center of the cross. Knot each of the four strings connected to the puppet's limbs to an individual arm of the cross. Dot school glue on each knot to keep it from untying.

Buy felt, cloth, or whatever other fabric material you would like to use to make your hand puppet.,
Make your template.,
Place two pieces of fabric on top of each other.,
Cut the template out of both pieces of fabric.,
Sew the two pieces of fabric together.,
Embroider your puppet.",How to Make a Hand Puppet2," You have to buy something that you can stitch together, but otherwise it’s totally up to you. Use a left over pillowcase or even the old drapes.

, There are a couple ways to get a template for your hand puppet. You can buy them at crafts stores, download them online, or make them yourself. 








If you want to make a basic hand puppet yourself, put your hand palm down on your piece of fabric. Now draw small dots on the fabric on either side of your hand to designate the width. This is how wide you’ll want the body of your template to be.
Once you’ve done that, you can start drawing the outline of your puppet. If you want your puppet to have arms remember that your thumb and pinky will be controlling the arms. Put your hand back down on the fabric and designate where your thumb and pinky emerge from your hand. This is where you’ll want the arms to begin.
Make sure you leave room for your fingers in the head of the puppet as well. Your index, middle, and ring finger will need to rest in there, so ensure that it is wide enough for those three fingers to fit inside.
Otherwise, the drawing is up to you! Using the width of your hand as your guide make two straight parallel lines. Now round these lines off away from each other diagonally to create the arms. Try to keep them the same length. Keep in mind that they should be pretty short. Once you’ve completed the full outline of the arms draw a wide half circle for the head. Add ears, horns, or whatever else you would like to the outline.

, Put the fabric that you drew or traced your template onto on top of the second piece of fabric. 







, Try not to cut so much that your hand will not fit in there. Make sure that the two pieces of fabric are lined up well. Once you start cutting make sure that you don't move the two pieces of fabric away from each other at all. If you're worried you can trace your template onto a piece of paper first and then cut one piece of fabric at a time.








, Sew around the outline of your cut out fabric. Make sure you leave a hole at the bottom so you can put your hand in there.








, You can add string for eyes and a mouth, different colored fabric to give your puppets spots, or anything else you can think of. If you sew on another piece of fabric to your puppet make sure you only sew through one layer of your puppet fabric. Otherwise it will be stuck together.

Pin the template to a piece of felt.,
Cut out the hand puppet shape from the felt.,
Accessorize the body of the hand puppet.,
Give the hand puppet a face.,
Sew the front and back pieces of the hand puppet together.,
Bring your puppet to life.",How to Make a Hand Puppet3," The hand puppet should be roughly the size of your hand from your wrist to the tips of your fingers. Trace around your hand on a piece of paper while extending your thumb. Your thumb will be one arm of the puppet, your pointer finger will be the head, your middle finger will be the other arm, and your two smallest fingers will be bent toward your palm.








Remember to include any other details your want to include in the shape of the felt, such as little semi-circles on top of the head for ears.
You may want to leave a little more room past the edges of your fingertips to accommodate the space where you will sew the puppet together.

, Once you have a template you’re happy with, you’ll need to cut it out from the paper. 







, You’ll need felt from a craft store or the craft section of a big box store in your desired color for this method. Rather than tracing the template onto the felt, you can easily just pin the template down against the felt.Remember to make sure that the bottom portion of the template (where the template reaches your wrist) lines up with the bottom edge of the felt. This is where your hand will go into the puppet.
You’ll need both a front and a back piece of the hand puppet, so you can easily place two pieces of felt on top of each other and pin the template to both of them at once.

, With the template pinned firmly to the felt, you can cut out the pieces of the hand puppet.Try to cut in smooth, fluid lines rather than jagged ones to ensure that you have a polished finished product.









If you did not line up two pieces of felt together, then pin the template to the second piece of felt and cut it out as well.

, It’s easier to add things to the body of the hand puppet before sewing the two halves together, so now is the time to accessorize the body. For instance, if you are making a teddy bear hand puppet, then you may have dark brown felt for the body, and you can add an oblong, tan piece of felt for the tummy.








You can attach the tummy felt with either a hot glue gun or by sewing it.
All of the sewing required for this project is very simple, but you can learn more about sewing if you need to at: How to Sew.

, Now you’re ready to accessorize the face of the hand puppet. You can use a variety of different objects to help you create the face.








Consider using beads, other pieces of felt, or even googly eyes for the eyes.
You can use a bead, a pompom, other felt, or even just a knot of stitches for the nose.
For the mouth, you can create lips or a tongue with felt, stitch a mouth, or come up with another idea for a mouth entirely.
If you made the shape for ears in your felt, your can also give more definition to the ears by sewing or gluing a smaller semi-circle of felt onto the ear. For the bear example, you can easily use the same lighter color you used for the tummy.

, Once you’re happy with the body and face of your puppet, you are ready to sew the pieces together. Follow around the edges of the two pieces of felt and sew them together with stitches close enough that you can’t accidentally stick your fingers through the edges of the puppet.








Remember to leave the bottom edge of the puppet stitch free since this is where you need to put your hand inside the puppet.

, Once you’re done with all of the sewing, you are ready to bring your puppet to life. Put your hand inside the puppet in the most comfortable position with your fingers and start practicing working the arms and head of the puppet.

Create your skeleton.,
Add your under-structure.,
Add the clay.,
Bake the parts.,
Assemble the puppet.,
Create the handle.,
Attach the strings.,
Add finishing details.",How to Create a Marionette2," You'll need FIMO clay, aluminum (also called tin) foil, sturdy but flexible wire, string, and something to make a handle (chopsticks will do in a pinch).

, Bend, cut, and straighten the wire until you have 1 piece for every section of the body. You'll want to make a small loop at each end of every section. These loops will become the joints.


For the head, you will want a loop coming out at the top of the head as well. For this particular set of instructions, the head is not a moving piece, so you can make the head and torso a single section, if you want to.

, Crumple and ball the tin foil and add it to each section of the wire bones. This acts like muscle, giving the marionette some substance. Don't add too much and don't worry about it being smooth: the clay will cover this part.

, Shape the clay onto each part of the marionette and carve it until you have the look you want. Leave the loops exposed.

, Bake the body parts according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, Connect the loops to create the joints for the puppet.

, Purchase a premade handle or create a basic one by joining two chopsticks together into a cross.

, Attach strings at the knees and wrists, tying them to one of the joint loops. Attach the other end to the ends of your four handles. Then, attach a string from the head loop to the center of the handle.

, You may want to paint some details onto your marionette and make it some clothing as well. This will give it a great final look!

Relieve the rounded seams you just sewed.
,

Turn the puppet right side out to see the basic shape.
,

Make a tack or pleat to close up the neck a little bit (optional).
,

Decorate the puppet any way you want.",How to Make a Trash Can Puppet," It will help if the fabric has a bit of stiffness to it. This sample started out as corduroy and some reclaimed denim from an old pair of jeans. If your leftover fabric isn't stiff enough or if you think it should be stiffer, iron it to some interfacing before you sew.
, A round object, such as a pot lid, bowl, or CD, will help. Here, the red corduroy will become the top of the puppet's head and the black denim will be the inside of the mouth.

Make these circles decently large, about 6 inches (15cm) in diameter. You can size the other piece to them, so don't worry about the exact diameter.
Sew a zig-zag stitch around the edges of the rounds if necessary to keep them from fraying.

,, Sew only halfway around, leaving the other half open., Reliefs help keep the fabric along a curved seam from bunching and puckering when it's turned right side out., Make the length of this rectangle the same as the circumference of the circle, plus a little extra for seam allowance. Make it as long as you want the neck of the puppet, plus a bit for a lower hem and upper seam allowance.,, Then, fold over twice and hem the end that will be the bottom of the puppet., You'll have to think inside out a little.

Pin right sides together but wrong sides out.
Start at the back of the head, and place the seam from the tube so it will end up at the back of the head.




 Another view of the pinned puppet.

Pin all the way around. You should end up with the top of the tube pinned halfway around to the loose part of the back of the head (here, red corduroy) and the other half pinned to the loose part of the bottom of the mouth (here, black denim). It should look like the finished puppet, only inside out.

, Half of this seam will go into the head fabric; the other half will go into the mouth fabric. This is the last major seam for this puppet.

Remove the pins and turn the puppet right side out at this point, to make sure you're on the right track.

,,,, You can glue or sew on eyes, hair, ears, a tongue, horns, or just about anything else. See the sock puppet article for lots of ideas. This puppet has yarn hair and a larger variation on these yarn eyeballs that started with short chunks of PVC pipe."

, Once you the sock on, make a C-shape with your hand. Put your fingers into the toe part. Try to get your thumb into the heel part. If you can't reach it, tuck the sock into the groove between your thumb and fingers.








Open and close your hand. Your sock should already start looking like a puppet.

, If you want your puppet to have a nose, make a dot for that as well.







, Spread it flat on the table. The marks for the eyes and nose may look out of place, but that's fine. This is why you made them while wearing the sock.








, You can do this with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or tacky glue. For the actual eyes, you can use buttons, pompoms, or googly eyes. You can also draw the eyes on with a marker.









If your puppet is a girl, draw some eyelashes with a marker!

, You can also cut a triangle or circle out of felt and use that instead. A button would also make a cute nose. If you don't have any of these, you can draw a nose on instead!








, Your puppet is done at this point. You can still glue items onto it to give it more character. For example, you can glue some yarn to the top for hair. For more ideas, click here.

A solid sock would work for just about any character, while a spotted one could make a leopard. You can even used a striped sock to make a zebra! Once you are happy with your sock, cut the toes off with fabric scissors, using the toe seam as a guide.









Those funky, fuzzy socks work the best for this type of puppet, but you can use plain socks too.

, Get some thin cardboard. Draw an oval on it that is about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) long. It should a little narrower than your sock.Cut the oval out with a pair of scissors.









You can use an old cereal box for the cardboard.

, Use the cardboard oval you just cut out to trace another oval onto a sheet of felt. Cut the felt oval out, then set it aside. You will be gluing this to the inside of the mouth later.









Pink or red would work the best, but you can use a different color too.

, Make sure that you are folding it in half hamburger style. Unfold the oval when you are done. It will be bent like a V, which is good.








, Keeping it bent like a V, tuck the oval into the sock. Pull the cut edges of the sock over the edges of the oval. Don't worry if things don't look perfect. You will be fixing that later.







, Set the sock down and open the mouth. Pull the edges of the sock over the top and bottom (narrow) ends of the oval by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter). Glue them down with hot glue. Don't worry if the sides get messed up. You'll fix that next.








If you don't have hot glue, fabric glue or tacky glue may also work.

, Pull a bit of sock over the side edge of the oval by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) and glue it down. Work your way from the top edge of the oval to the bottom. When you are done, do the other side of the oval too.







, Draw a line of glue around the inside of the puppet's mouth. Press the felt oval into the glue. Make sure that the edges match up. This will give the inside of the mouth some color and cover up the cut part of the sock.








If you are using hot glue, work a little bit at a time so it doesn't dry too fast.

, You can have the heel part be on the top or bottom of the puppet. Glue some googly eyes or buttons for the eyes. Add a smaller pompom or button for the nose. If you want to give your puppet a tongue, cut a long tongue shape out of red or pink felt, then glue it inside the mouth.


Don't glue the tongue all the way down. This way it can flap around!

, Fold a pipe cleaner in half. Fold a piece of felt around the pipe cleaner, then secure it with glue. Trim the felt down so that it is the same length as the pipe cleaner, plus 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Cut one end of the arm into a hand shape, then glue the other end to the puppet.









Repeat this step to make the other arm.

, Wrap some yarn around your hand (short) or a book (long). Slide it off and cut apart the loops on one end. Tie a piece of yarn around the middle to hold it all together. Glue this to the top of the head, right above the eyes.








The more times you wrap, the thicker the hair will be. Wrap it at least 10 times.
You can use a similar technique to give your puppet a mustache!
Leave the hair down or cut it. You can also braid it or put it into pigtails.
You can also make hair out of pipe cleaners or cut shapes out of felt.

, Glue two large pompoms to the top of your puppet's head. The pompoms can be as close together or as far apart as you want. Next, glue a googly eye to the front of each pompom (not the top).








, Here is where you can get really creative! All you need is a fabric marker or a permanent marker. Try one of the ideas from below:









Draw eyelashes if it's girl puppet.
Draw freckles or a beauty mark under the eyes.
Add some thick eyebrows or a mustache.
Outline the puppet's mouth in red for lipstick.

Measure the width of a doorway, preferably the door where the theater will go.,

Choose a suitable piece of fabric.,
Wash and iron the fabric.,

Measure and cut the fabric.,

Hem the lower curtain on three sides.,

Turn the edge under and sew a wide casing on the fourth side of the lower curtain.,

Hem the three ""free"" edges of both side panels.,
Hem the three ""free"" sides of the valance.,




 The same thing in a diagram.,

Sew the valance casing so that the side panels are sewn into either end.,
Adjust the length of the tension rod to fit the doorway where the puppet theater will hang.,

Insert the tension rod into the valance casing.,

Insert the dowel into the lower curtain.,

Suspend the dowel from the tension rod using a strip of leftover fabric, heavy cord, or ribbon.,

Hang the finished product in a doorway, provide some puppets, and challenge some young puppeteers to present a puppet show!
",How to Sew a Doorway Puppet Theater," These curtains, and most tension curtain rods, are adjustable, but it will help to have an approximate finished size in mind as you sew. This doorway is about 28 inches wide.
, This is a red tablecloth, found at a local thrift store. It was chosen because it was large, inexpensive, lightweight, and fairly opaque. It also happens to be red (as many real theater curtains are) and it has an interesting but not overpowering pattern. This entire project used a piece of the tablecloth that was 5 feet (1.5 m) x 6 feet (1.8 m). A dark colored or satin bed sheet or a lightweight blanket might also work., This is a particularly good idea if the fabric was previously used for some other purpose or if it came from a garage sale or thrift store. It will help the finished project to have a smooth, finished appearance and to hang straight., You will need a total of four rectangles: a valance, two matching side panels, and a lower curtain. The sizes are easy to adjust, according to the doorway and your preferences. Here are the measurements and the reasoning behind them.




 These rectangles will form the valance and two side panels.

Valance: 12 inches (30cm) tall x 60 inches (150cm) wide. The valance forms the top of the theater frame. It will hang down about six inches from the tension rod at the top. It also needs a casing large enough to fit over the tension rod. The width, 60 inches, was the width of the original tablecloth, but it makes the curtain about twice as wide as the door where it will hang. Aim for at least one and a half times as wide as the door.
Side panels: 30 inches (75cm) tall x 15 inches (40cm) wide. These are the sides of the frame. The thirty inches will be the height, and it takes into account both the desired finished height of the theater and the original width of the tablecloth. The width includes a bit of extra for hems on both sides. It will bunch to about half that dimension when hung up.
Lower curtain: 36 inches (90cm) tall x 60 inches (150cm) wide. Again, the 60 inches was the original tablecloth width and includes excess for bunching. The 36 inches, minus a hem and a casing, will be the height of the lower curtain. It was chosen to be tall enough to hide young puppeteers if they choose not to be part of the scene but short enough to allow them to stand or kneel and join in the action.
The heights will be somewhat adjustable once the curtains are hanging.
A yardstick or tape measure will help to keep things fairly straight.

, In this case, all three of these hems came with the tablecloth, so there was no need to sew them. Run a zigzag stitch around if necessary, to keep the edges from fraying., The casing should be large enough to fit easily over the dowel, at least 1.5 inches (4cm) wide.
Sew a zigzag stitch along the edge of this side before sewing the casing, if the fabric seems inclined to unravel.

, That is, hem both long edges and one short edge. Leave one side raw or with a zigzag stitch. Take advantage of any existing hems., That is, hem one long edge and both short edges. Take advantage of any existing hems., The black is the side panel, the green is the valance, and the red dashed line is where the stitches will go.

Pin the casing on the fourth side of the valance, and pin the raw edges of the side panels into the casing as shown, on either end. Use a ruler or tape measure to keep the valance length and casing height consistent across the width of the valance. Make it a generous width, at least 2 inches (5cm) when flat., This casing will run all the way across the valance, and it will catch the side panels at either end., This is likely to be easier to do without the curtain on it., Arrange the upper curtain on the rod so that the bunching is fairly even., Arrange the curtain on the rod so that the bunching is fairly even., Adjust the heights as desired.,"

You can also cut away the nose and create a different, more pronounced one later.
Cut eye sockets as well.
If you'd like your puppet's jaw to move more freely, entirely cut away a jaw section. Make a ""flap"" jaw from cardboard.

, You can use hot glue or spray adhesive. The latter provides a stronger bond, but is harder to work with. Cut a piece of fleece that is big enough to cover your puppet head and start gluing it to the middle of the face. Make sure you glue the fleece deep into the eye sockets. Moving out from the center, keep readjusting, stretching and gluing until you have cover the face evenly and securely. Be sure to leave some extra for the neck.


If you cut off the nose earlier, apply the nose after you put the skin on. Cover the nose with fleece after you apply it.
Use the fleece to hold the jaw onto the face.

Play-Doh is mostly made of flour, water, and salt, so adding life back to the hardened dough can be as simple as adding back the water that’s evaporated.


If your Play-Doh has been out for an extended period of time (more than a couple months) and has fully hardened, it may not be possible to revive it.;
, Massage the wet ball in your hands, working the water into the dough. Continue sprinkling the ball with water and massaging it., Once the dough has absorbed a sufficient amount of water and has become moist and malleable again, knead it on a countertop for a few minutes, until it has returned to its original form. Sprinkle it with more water as you’re kneading, if necessary.


Try kneading one-half teaspoon of glycerine into the Play-Doh to help moisten it further., Play-Doh will dry out when it’s exposed to air, so store it in an air-tight container. Consider wrapping it in a re-sealable plastic bag first."

Make party favors.",How to Make Kool Aid Playdough," You will need a clean workspace, a medium-sized saucepan, a large spoon or spatula, one cup of flour, half a cup of salt, one envelope of unsweetened Kool-Aid drink mix (any flavor), two teaspoons of cream of tartar, a cup of water, and a tablespoon of oil.If you want more vivid colors, use two packets of Kool-Aid instead of one.
Avoid using plastic or wooden spoons. The Kool-Aid may permanently stain the material.;
, First, mix the flour, salt, Kool-Aid, and cream of tartar together with a whisk until they’re completely combined. Next, stir in the oil with a spoon. Once the oil is completely absorbed into the dough, carefully pour in the water. The dough should be wet enough to pull away from the sides of the pan when stirred but dry enough to hold its shape.


Add the water very slowly. You can always add more, but you can’t take water out!
Make sure to scrape the corners of the pot to completely saturate the dry mixture.

, Place your saucepan on medium heat. Carefully stir the mixture as it cooks; if it sticks to the bottom of the pan, it may burn. Let the mixture cook for about five minutes. If it starts to look too dry, add a splash of water to the mixture. After about five minutes the mixture will start to roll into a large ball when you stir it. Transfer the ball of dough to a plate to cool.If you want the mixture to cool quickly press it into a pancake shape with your spoon. This will allow the excess heat to escape the dough.
If you feel like your dough is too sticky, sprinkle some flour over the dough and mix it in., If you want to make multiple colors, cook the dough in batches. You can either make a full batch of each color or split one batch into multiple colors. For example, you could make two colors with the same batch of dough by halving the ingredients before cooking them. First, completely cook the first half-batch. While it’s cooling on a plate cook the second half-batch.


Wash the saucepan between batches to prevent color contamination.

, If the dough is exposed to air it will dry out and harden. Airtight Tupperware containers are commonly used for storing playdough. You could also use sealable plastic bags. Just make sure you press all of the air out of the bag before you seal it. Store the dough in the refrigerator between uses. This dough will last for about two weeks.


If you want to store the playdough creatively press the dough into plastic Easter eggs.
Write the date on the bag or Tupperware container so that you know when to throw the dough out.

, If your child gets playdough on a hard surface, simply wipe the dough away with a damp paper towel. If needed, spray the area with a household cleaner before wiping the dough away. If the dough gets on your carpet, allow the dough to completely dry. Next, vacuum the affected area until all of the crumbs disappear.


Playdough and Kool-Aid are difficult to remove from untreated wooden surfaces. If possible, cover the surface with newspapers or a plastic tarp.

, Kool-Aid powder is notoriously hard to remove, especially from fingertips. First, wash their hands with warm, soapy water. Next, gently rub tarter-control whitening toothpaste over the affected area. Rinse the toothpaste off with water.This method is also useful for lip stains. Skip the soap and simply rub the affected area with the toothpaste.
If the stain is hard to remove, wait a few hours before trying again. You can irritate your child’s skin if you wash it too much.

, First, spray the stain with ice cold water. Next, cover the stain with a thin layer of borax. Using an old toothbrush, gently work the borax into the fabric. Blot the area with a clean cloth. Repeat the process until the stain has disappeared. Wash the clothing in cold water and air dry the clothing.Borax is a hazardous chemical and should be handled with care. Wear gloves when you use it and keep it out of the reach of children.
To avoid this problem altogether, wear old clothing when cooking or playing with Kool-Aid.

, Playdough is fun to mold into any shape, but children especially enjoy rolling the dough out and cutting fun shapes out of it. Plastic cookie cutters can be found at any grocery store. If you want really unusual shapes visit your local baking supply warehouse.


Plastic utensils such as spoons and forks can be used to make interesting patterns in the dough.
Cups and bowls can be pressed into a sheet of dough to make perfect circles.

, Kool-Aid powder is usually white until liquid is added. If you conceal the Kool-Aid package, you can have children guess what color the dough will be before you add the water. Give out prizes such as cookie cutters or stirring privileges to the winners.


Never leave the stove unattended around children. If you need to move to a different room while cooking, turn off the stove and take the children with you.

, Kool-Aid playdough is a great party favor for children’s birthday parties. Mix up a few batches of colorful dough and split the dough into smaller amounts. Purchase small plastic ramekins with lids from a restaurant supply store. Next, fill the ramekins with the dough, close the lids tightly, and group the different colors together to create sets.The presentation is important as well. Either wrap the sets in wrapping paper or tie a ribbon around them to keep them together.
Make sure to tell the parents that the dough is non-toxic and sugar free!

Add water.,
Knead the Play-Doh.,
Be persistent.",How to Make Playdough Soft Again1," Put the Play-Doh into a small cup or bowl, then squeeze a drop of water onto it. Do not douse the dough. Go slowly, one drop at a time, so that you don't use too much. Try to fill in the cracks.If you are working with a large amount of Play-Doh, feel free to start with more than one drop of water. Try using a teaspoon-full.;
, Use your fingers to work the water deeply into the dough. Roll the Play-Doh into a ball, stretch it out, pull it apart, and fold it into itself. If the Play-Doh is still hard after 15-20 seconds of this, add another drop of water and keep kneading., Continue to add water and knead the Play-Doh until the putty is soft again. Don't worry if the dough is wet and slimy – just keep kneading.Within a few minutes, the dough should be soft and pliable as new.

Squirt the paint into the cornstarch.,
Mix the ingredients until a paste forms.,
Knead the dough with your hands.,
Repeat the process with as many paint colors as you’d like.",How to Make Safe and Easy Play Dough1," Add 2 large, heaping tablespoons (18 to 20 g) of cornstarch to a medium size bowl. Squirt some tempera paint in your chosen color into the cornstarch. There’s no exact measurement for the paint -- add what looks like enough to help form a dough with the cornstarch.








Don’t worry about adding too much or too little paint. You can mix in more of the paint or cornstarch as you go to get the right consistency.;
, With a plastic spoon, carefully mix the cornstarch and paint together to combine them. Continue mixing until they form a thick paste that clings to the spoon.








If the dough is too dry and crumbly, mix in more paint.
If the dough is too wet, mix in a little more cornstarch.

, Once the dough has formed a paste, set the spoon aside. Use your hands to gently knead the dough to remove any lumps. When you’re finished kneading, roll the dough into a ball and start playing.








If the play dough is leaving paint on your hands as you knead it, sprinkle some cornstarch on a piece of wax paper and roll the play dough through it. Knead it again to help mix in the cornstarch.

, Because the play dough only has two ingredients, you can only make one color at time. Complete the steps for each shade of play dough that you want to make.You can create custom shades of play dough by mixing two or more paint shades into the cornstarch.
Be sure to store the play dough in an airtight container, such as a plastic zipper bag, when you’re not playing with it. It should keep for several months.

"
"
Wrap a wet paper towel around the dough.,
Put the dough into a sealed container.,
Leave the Play-Doh to soak overnight.",How to Make Playdough Soft Again2," You can also use toilet paper, a tissue, a napkin, or any other soft, absorbent paper product. Run water over the paper towel so that it is thoroughly soaked. Then, wrap the wet paper around the dough.


This is a good second method once you've already tried kneading water into the dough. The kneading trick is quicker and more straightforward, but it doesn't always work.
Make sure that the dough is relatively compact. Try rolling it into a ball or a clump. This way, it will be easier to wrap the towel.

, Consider using original plastic Play-Doh container, if you have it, or just using a small Tupperware. Make sure that the container is airtight so that the moisture from the towel doesn't evaporate.

, Wait a day or so before you remove the Play-Doh from the airtight container. Peel the paper towel away – it should no longer be wet. Feel the Play-Doh: squeeze and pull it. Gauge whether it is soft enough.


If the dough still isn't soft, try adding more water and kneading it in directly. The Play-Doh mixture is mostly water, salt, and flour, so you might be able to restore the balance by re-hydrating the putty with enough water.If the dough doesn't become soft again with repeated efforts, it might be time to throw it out. Consider buying or making new Play-Doh.

Put the Play-Doh pieces into a plastic bag.,
Mix water into the Play-Doh.,
Leave the water and Play-Doh in the bag overnight.",How to Make Playdough Soft Again3," Snap it down into shards so that each piece can absorb water more quickly. This should not be hard to do if the dough has stiffened. If your Play-Doh is very crumbly, be careful not to spill!

, Make sure that the bag is seal-able and water-resistant. A Ziploc bag is ideal, but you can use a non-resealable bag as long as you tie it shut.

, Seal the bag, then knead the water and the dough together. Start with just a few drops of water, to be safe, and keep adding water as you squeeze. Do not add so much water that the color bleeds and the bag becomes soggy. Go slowly and methodically. Keep kneading until the dough feels soft., Let the dry dough absorb the excess water. Make sure that the bag is sealed so that the moisture doesn't escape! Within a matter of hours, the Play-Doh should be soft, supple, and as good as new! The exact time will depend on how much dough and water you've used.


Don't take the Play-Doh out of the bag until it looks fairly dry. If the dough is still very wet, the color might bleed off onto your hands.

Mix in your baking soda.,
Add green food coloring.,
Play with your slime.",How to Make Slime Using Baking Soda1," Add seven tablespoons of non-fat or skim milk to a glass or bowl. The fat in whole milk may not result in the right texture, so do not substitute whole milk or 2% milk for skim milk.





;
, Stir one tablespoon of vinegar into your milk. This is enough to cause the protein from milk to separate from the liquid. Adding the vinegar raises the acidity of the liquid and forces the protein out of solution.








Solid chunks of milk begin to form as the milk reacts to the vinegar. These chunks should slowly sink to the bottom of your glass as the reaction occurs.

, Once the chunks of milk have settled at the bottom, pour the solution through a coffee filter. The liquid will move through the filter and leave only the chunks of milk behind. Pat the chunks of milk with a paper towel to make sure they are dry and to squeeze out any excess water. Transfer the solids to a clean mixing bowl.







, After moving the chunks of milk to a bowl, add ¼ tablespoon (about 4 mL) of baking soda. The baking soda will help to pull the proteins together and give a more solid consistency. Your mixture will start to resemble slime. Mix the baking soda into the milk until you have a mixture that resembles vanilla pudding.








Depending on how big your chunks of milk were, you may need to add more baking soda. If you're having trouble getting a vanilla pudding mixture, sprinkle in small amounts of baking soda until you get the right consistency.

, A few drops of green food coloring will turn your slime green. Add a few drops and stir it in. If you want the green color slightly darker, add more green food coloring.








, Once your slime is done, you can play with it. You can try to shape it using your hands. You can also use it to decorate something like a diorama. Use slime, for example, to represent a murky pond in a forest.

, Xanthan gum is a thickening and stabilizing agent. You can buy it online or in some grocery stores. Add 1 ¼ teaspoons (about 6 mL) of xanthan gum to the bowl of vinegar and stir. Continue stirring until there are no more white particles in the mixture and it's smooth and even throughout.








Xanthum gum is sometimes hard to find at supermarkets. You may have to order it online, so keep this in mind. Order it a few days before you want to make this kind of slime.

, A few drops of green food coloring will give your mixture a slimy feel. Start with a few small drops and add more until your mixture is your desired color.







, The mixture will be too runny to use at first. In order to get a gooey texture, chill your mixture in the fridge. While it only takes two to three hours for the mixture to thicken, it's best to leave it in overnight. This gives the xanthan gum time to dissolve completely., Make sure to do this over a sink or in the bathtub so you're using a surface that's easy to clean afterwards. Sprinkle the baking soda all over the bottom of your chosen surface







, When you remove the mixture from the fridge, stir it again. Keep stirring until the slime looks cloudy and somewhat creamy.







, To test to see if your mixture is ready, lift some of out of the bowl with a spoon and pour it back in. It should pour somewhat quickly. If it's too thick to pour easily, add a splash of vinegar and stir it again. Keep adding vinegar until your mixture runs smoothly.







, Once your slime has thickened, pour it over the baking soda. The baking soda is basic and your slime is acidic because of the vinegar. The addition of the baking soda will turn the slime into a bubbling, fizzing slime. The more baking soda you use, the longer and more vigorously the slime will bubble.








, There are many ways to play with bubbling slime. You can pretend your slime is something like toxic water on a foreign planet, for example, and play with astronaut toys in the slime. You can use dinosaur toys to pretend the slime is prehistoric slime. Some people simply enjoy watching the slime make bubbles.









Make sure to wash your toys completely after playing with them in the slime.

, Squirt a small amount of dish soap into your baking soda. Make sure it's green so your slime comes out green. Use a spoon to mix the dish soap in. Gradually add more until you have a creamy, solid substance.








The precise amount of dish soap you need varies. Add a little bit at a time to get the right consistency. It should look something like green pudding.

, If you accidentally add too much dish soap, your slime will come out a little runny. If the slime starts to look watery, pour in a little more baking soda to correct this.







, If the green you produce isn't quite as dark as you want, add a few drops of green food coloring. This should get the slime a little greener.








, You can play with your toys in the slime. Pretend it's toxic waste and have actions figures fall in and rescue one another, for example. You can also add slime as decorations for a diorama. Make a diorama of a haunted house, for example, and have the slime be a scary attraction.

Add one cup of water to your glue.,
Add your food coloring.,
Stir the mixture thoroughly.,
Examine your Borax mixture.,
Stir the mixture.,
Play with your Gak.",How to Make Gak," To make Gak, you will need the ingredients above, most of which can be already found in your house! Some of the ingredients, like the food coloring, are not necessities, so if you don’t have them, don’t worry., Over your kitchen sink, fill your empty container one fourth of the way full with Borax. Add water to the container until the container is full, then seal the container.









Make sure to run the water over the sink for a few minutes after you’re done with the Borax. If you don’t do this, the Borax in your sink may clog your pipes., After you’ve checked to make sure the container is tightly sealed, give it a good shake. This will cause the water to become saturated by the Borax. You’ll want to make sure the water is completely saturated before moving on to the next step.








, The more glue you use, the more Gak you’ll be able to make (the volume of your Gak will be two times the amount of glue you use.) To make twice the amount of Gak, use twice the amount of glue.









Double check that you're using non-washable glue. If you use washable glue, the Gak will not form.
Don’t worry too much about the measurements. Even if you’re eye-balling it, it should still work.Make sure your mixing bowl is more than two times bigger than the amount of glue you pour into it. Otherwise, you won’t be able to stir effectively.
You can also try using a large, plastic resealable bag. Mixing in a bag can sometimes be less messy than mixing in a bowl. , If you have doubled your glue amount, make sure to double the amount of water you’re using as well. The amount of water you use should be equivalent to the amount of glue that you use.









Stir the mixture with your hands. You can also use a spoon if you don’t feel like getting dirty., This is an optional step, so if you don’t have food coloring, don’t worry. Thirty drops per small bottle of glue gives a good color, but you should feel free to add as much food coloring as you’d like.









The more drops you add, the deeper your color will be.
Try mixing shades to create a new color. Mix blue and red to make purple or mix blue and yellow to make green.
You can also try making the mixture with glitter.If you mix too many colors, your mixture will turn an unpleasant shade of brown.
You can always make the color darker, but you cannot lighten your color, so it's best to go slowly and add more color later if necessary.

, If you choose to mix the glue mixture with your hands, make sure to put on rubber gloves first. The dye can stain your hands. If your hands do end up getting stained, try soaking a paper towel in white vinegar and then rubbing that towel on your hands.







, Make sure the water is completely saturated with Borax. Once you’ve confirmed that it is, pour one fourth of the Borax mixture into the glue mixture.








If the water is not saturated, shake it until the Borax becomes more evenly distributed.

, You can stir the mixture using an implement, like a spoon, or you can continue to use your hands. As you stir, you will notice that the Gak begins to form almost immediately. Mix the mixture thoroughly and have fun with it!









When you reach the point where the Gak begins to break off in clumps in your hand, add more water from your second cup.
Continue to add water until you reach your desired slime consistency.
If you find that you have too much water in your mixture, just pour the water out., Your Gak is finally complete, so enjoy it! Make sure that when you are not playing with it, that you store it in a sealed container. Otherwise, your Gak will dry out and you will not be able to play with it anymore.








Do not leave your Gak on any fabric, like a couch or a rug. The Gak will dye the fabric.
If you store your Gak in a plastic, sealable bag, it will last forever.
If your Gak gets a little dried out, trying adding some water.
If your Gak is sticky, add a little more Borax.
When your slime starts to feel like powder in your hands, it’s time to throw it out. Make a new batch and start fresh!

Store your floam properly.",How to Make Floam2," You will need two crayons, vegetable oil, water, flour, polystyrene beads, a knife, a pan, and a stovetop or hot plate. This method should be done by adults only.


The crayons should be from the same color family. For example, maroon and scarlet can be used together since they are both types of red., If the crayons are wrapped in paper, remove and discard it first. Using a sharp knife, slice up each of the two crayons into small pieces. The thinner the sections, the faster and easier they'll be to melt./images/thumb/6/64/Make-Floam-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Floam-Step-9-Version-2.jpg

The exact amount of beads you'll need will vary. You'll want to add enough so that your floam is relatively thick and holds its shape well, but not so much that it crumbles apart. Add a half cup of polystyrene beads at a time until your floam reaches the right consistency.

, Since your floam is made from flour and oil, it can grow mold and go bad just as quickly as bread can. Refrigerate your floam when not in use to extend its lifespan. It's also a good idea to keep your floam in an airtight container or zipper bag to prevent it from drying out.

Gather your materials.,
Squeeze the glue into your jar.,
Let the glue dry.,
Scrape the glue out of the jar.,
Store your new eraser properly.",How to Make Eraser Putty1," All you'll need is a small disposable glass jar and a tube of clear silicone craft glue. This type of glue stays relatively flexible, no matter how dry it gets. Other types of glue will not work for this method., The size of your final eraser will be roughly determined by how much glue you add. Keep in mind that your glue will shrink slightly before it's ready. Be sure to add enough glue to make an eraser big enough to be usable.







, Leave the glue to set. This should take about 24 hours. Once it has congealed, it should look similar to dried wax. To double-check, touch the glue first. If it's still sticky, wait a while longer., Once it's no longer sticky, simply pick the now semi-solid glue up with your fingers. Roll and knead the glob around in your hands for a while. It should now be ready for use.







, Keep it in a plastic zipper bag or some other small airtight container. This will ensure that your eraser maintains its putty-like consistency over time.However, if you choose not to store your eraser this way, it should continue to be somewhat flexible and erase well even when completely dried out.

Play with the putty.",How to Make Silly Putty1," Purchase a 5-ounce (147-milliliter) bottle of clear school glue. Unscrew the cap and pour the glue into a mixing bowl.For interesting silly putter, use the type of school glue that already has glitter in it.
For opaque silly putty, use white school glue instead.;
, This will give your silly putty extra color. Stir in a few drops, then add more if you want a deeper or darker color. If your glue already has color and glitter in it, skip this step.Don't use acrylic, tempera, or poster paint. It's too thick.

, How much glitter you add is entirely up to you. For best results, use the extra-fine scrapbooking glitter, and not the chunky craft kind. If your glue already has glitter in it, skip this step.For metallic putty, try mica powder instead.

, Keep stirring until the color is even and the glitter is spread throughout the glue. You can do this step with a spoon, fork, or even a popsicle stick., Pour in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of liquid starch, then give the mixture a stir. Keep adding starch and stirring until the glue and starch comes together and forms a putty.Plan on using ½ to ¾ cup (120 to 180 milliliters) total.
Avoid using too much starch, or the silly putty will turn gooey, like slime or ""Gak.""

, At one point, the putty will clump together and become difficult to stir. Once that happens, take the lump of putty out of the bowl and knead it until it turns firm. There may be some liquid left in the bowl, which is fine., Silly putty is similar to slime or Gak, except that it is more firm. You can stretch it and bounce it. When you are done playing with it, put it into a plastic, zippered bag. You can also use a plastic box with a tight-fitting lid.

Play with your slime!",How to Make Bubbly Slime,", Be generous with the soap if you want a lot of bubbles. The original recipe used 48 pumps of soap!,, You'll want to add about 1 1⁄2 cups (350 ml) of shaving cream, or hold down the button for about 9 seconds., The mixture should be fluffy and liquidy., Start off with one to two drops; if you want a stronger color, then add more. Afterwards, stir until the slime mixture is colored thoroughly with no white streaks., Add about 3 tablespoons (44 ml) at a time, and then mix. Continue adding liquid starch until the slime has clumped up enough that you can't mix it anymore.

Don't add the liquid starch all at once. Otherwise, your slime will harden.

, Once the slime has solidified enough that you can no longer mix it, use your hands to knead it together so it doesn't stick to the rest of the bowl., If you want your bubbly slime to be particularly stretchy, then add a few pumps of lotion into your slime and knead it in. Don't hesitate to be generous!, Preferably, put it in a container that isn't too big - you want your slime to fill up the container, but not be up to the brim., Spray about a cup of shaving cream on top of the slime and use your hands to spread it evenly over the top of the slime. Don't knead it in.,, The slime needs awhile for the bubbles to form. Two days is recommended., Bubbles will have formed on top of the slime, hence the name ""bubbly slime"".

Wait for 20 minutes if you want crunchy, dry bubbles.
If you don't let the slime dry, the bubbles won't be crunchy. This is a matter of personal preference, but it does give the slime a different texture.

, The bubbles on your slime will have a completely different feel than the rest of the slime and will be fun to poke, pop, and smooth out. Store your slime in an airtight container when finished.

Gather your materials.,
Try to ""erase"" the glue off of the sticky note.,
Collect your eraser shavings.,
Knead the shavings together.",How to Make Eraser Putty2," You'll need a solid rubber eraser and a few dozen sticky notes. Keep in mind that your final kneaded eraser will be about the same color as whichever one you choose to start with. A multicolored eraser won't produce a smooth, uniform putty eraser.The color of your sticky notes won't have any impact on the final eraser. However, since the sticky notes won't be usable after you're finished, consider using up a color you dislike.

, Rub your eraser along the sticky part of each note. Use enough force to remove the glue from the paper but not so much that you tear the paper. When one sticky note runs out of glue, move on to a new one., After you've finished each sticky note, sweep the eraser shavings into one large pile. Keep rubbing your eraser against the sticky notes until you have enough shavings to make a new eraser. A pile containing about a tablespoon's worth of shavings is a good size to shoot for., The thin shape of the rubber makes it more malleable, while being coated with glue from the sticky notes will make the small pieces much easier to stick together. Carefully scoop the pile of eraser shavings into your hand. Squeeze the shavings into a smaller clump. Roll the clump around in your hand. Continue working it until the clump becomes nice and smooth. When that happens, your eraser putty is finished."

Gather your materials.,
Drag the rubber eraser over the vinyl eraser.,
Sweep the shavings into a pile.,
Knead the shavings together.",How to Make Eraser Putty3," For this method, you will two different types of eraser. The first is any standard solid rubber eraser you would like to turn into putty. This rubber eraser will make up the bulk of your final kneaded eraser, so pick one with a color you like. Softer rubber will make a better eraser putty. You will also need a ""hi-polymer"" vinyl eraser. It must be big enough that you can comfortably rub the first eraser against it. Only a small portion of this eraser will be in your final kneaded eraser, so its color doesn't matter as much as the rubber eraser's., Keep the vinyl eraser flat on your desk. Vigorously rub the rubber eraser over it. Use the same motions as you would to erase pencil, but press down harder., The friction between the two erasers will create eraser shavings. These will mostly be made up of the softer rubber eraser, which will wear down much faster. However, you will also notice a crater begin to form in the center of your vinyl eraser. Periodically sweep away the shavings from this crater and into one big pile nearby.


If you want a larger piece of eraser putty, you can always repeat this with multiple rubber erasers and combine the shavings together at the end., Scoop up the pile of eraser shavings into one hand. Make a fist to squeeze the shavings together into a clump. Roll the clump between your two hands. Keep squeezing and rolling the eraser clump until it forms a smooth, finished eraser putty."

Make sure that you use the basic, all-purpose kind of school glue and not the ""washable"" kind. The washable kind of school glue does not work as well.For more interesting silly putter, get the kind of glue that already has glitter and color mixed into it.
For opaque silly putty, use regular white school glue.

, Squeeze in a few drops of food coloring. Next, add in a few spoonfuls of extra-fine glitter. Stir everything together until the color is even and the glitter is spread evenly throughout.

Skip this step if your glue already has color and glitter in it.

, Keep stirring until the glue and water are completely mixed together. Set the bowl aside when you are done.

, Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of warm water into a cup. Add 1 teaspoon of borax. Stir the two together until the borax has dissolved.If you are a child, have an adult supervise you.

, Keep stirring the two together again until the glue starts to turn into gel. You will have a clump of gel in your bowl, with some water, glitter, and color around it., Pick up the glob of gel from the bowl. Knead and squish it with your fingers for about 5 to 10 minutes. There may still be some water and glue in the bowl, which is fine. The borax will have picked up as much glue as it could have.If you have sensitive skin, it may be a good idea to put on a pair of plastic gloves during this step.

, You can stretch it, bounce it, and pull it apart. When you are done playing with it, put it into a plastic, resalable container, such as a lidded box or a zippered bag. When you take it out again, you may need to knead it again for another 5 to 10 minutes.

, If your glue is clear or white, you may want to add some color and/or glitter into it. You will only need a few drops of food coloring or liquid watercolor. How much glitter you use is up to you. A few spoonfuls of extra-fine glitter will be plenty.


Stir the glitter and color into the glue well so that there are no streaks or swirls left.

, You can use either liquid or powdered detergent, but the liquid kind will work better. Keep stirring until the glue starts to ball up and harden.You may have some liquid in the bowl around the glue, which is fine.

, Once the glue starts to ball up, you can knead it with your hands. This will help the glue pick up more detergent and turn into putty.

Boil a pot of water.,
Whisk the flour and cool water together.,
Stir the runny mixture into the boiling water.,
Remove from heat when thick and smooth.,
Perfect the batch.,
Let the mixture cool.,
Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.",How to Make Wheat Paste1," Pour 3/4 cup (200 mL) water into a saucepan and bring to a boil.






;
, Take 3 Tbsp (50 mL) flour or starch and gradually add room temperature water while stirring or whisking. Stop when all the flour is wet and the mixture is runny enough to pour.








, Once the water is boiled, add the flour mixture while stirring constantly.









The mixture will foam as it boils. Stirring or whisking prevents the mixture from boiling over, burning, or forming lumps.
To reduce the chance of these mishaps, make a double boiler by placing the pot of wheat paste in a larger pot containing roughly 2 cups (500 mL) boiling water.
If it thickens too much to stir, add more water.

, This can take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.








If using starch, the mixture will be translucent when ready., In many cases the batch will be ready to use once it cools. However, it's easy to make adjustments while the goop is still hot:









If the batch isn't sticky enough, stir in sugar or white glue. Begin with 3 Tbsp (50 mL) sugar or glue and add more if necessary.
To preserve the mixture longer and deter bugs from eating it, mix in a small amount of copper sulphate., Once at room temperature it should hold together as a gluey gelatinous paste.









Each brand of flour and starch is a little different, so the exact consistency will vary. As long as there are no lumps it should work well.To remove lumps from the paste, strain it through a thin sieve or pair of tights., Left at room temperature, the paste will begin to smell after 2 days and grow mold within a week.Even for pastes without copper sulphate, there are easy ways to extend this shelf life:









Reheat unused paste in a covered container after each project to sterilize it.Pour a little water on top of the paste for storage. If the paste is cool the water will sit on top of the paste and prevent mold from reaching it. Pour out the water again before using.

Place your slime into a plastic bag.",How to Make Slime Without Borax1," Heat until the water is warm but not hot or boiling. You do not want to use boiling water because then you will have to wait for it to cool before you can use your hands to mix the slime.


You can also pour the water into a microwave-safe bowl and place it in the microwave for 45 seconds to 1 minute to heat up the water.;
, Add three to four drops of green food coloring until the water is about a shade darker than you want the slime to be. When you make the slime, the color will be diluted slightly. Mix the water well with a spoon.








, Cornstarch is known as cornflour in the UK and elsewhere. Place it into a separate large-sized bowl.

, Pour the colored water in slowly. Use your fingers to mix the ingredients together. Thoroughly blend the mixture into the consistency of a thick paste.








, You can add more cornstarch if the slime is too thin. Add more warm water from the amount remaining in the pan if the mixture is too thick. This is a matter of personal preference.









Keep doing this as much as needed to obtain a mixture that is of the right slimy consistency for your needs. You should be able to put your fingers into the mixture easily. When you run your finger along the slime's surface, it should feel dry.

, You can use rubber worms, plastic insects or eyeballs, etc. This is a great idea for a Halloween party, a science party or for a party or camp based on nature or environmental themes.

;
,,, Adding the foaming body wash or soap can make the slime fluffier, but it's okay to forget this step.








, The substance should have a thick and fluffy texture, similar to marshmallow cream.








, The cornstarch helps to thicken the slime and allows it to retain its shape.









The cornstarch isn't necessary for the recipe, but leaving it out will result in a thinner slime that won't hold its shape so much.

, (Cornstarch is easy to spill.)








, To make your slime stretchier, add in two pumps of hand lotion to your slime.









It's okay to skip this step if you don't want to add it at the moment - it can always be added later.

, Too much of some kinds of food coloring can stain your hands or other surfaces, so if it's a potent one, start with just two drops. Mix it well until there are no more white streaks.








, Stir thoroughly, then continue adding the borax mixture 1-3 teaspoons at a time until the slime is at the consistency you’d like it to be.









You will likely not use all of your borax mixture! It is important to not add too much of it or your slime will harden and break. The original recipe only uses 6-9 teaspoons (44 ml) of the borax solution.

, Once the slime has clumped into a ball and is easy to remove from the bowl, place it on a flat surface and begin kneading it with your hands to thoroughly mix it.









If the slime is still too sticky, add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of the borax mixture and carefully knead it in.

, If your slime is fluffy, but not very stretchy, add a few pumps of lotion into your slime, rub it into the slime, and then knead it again. Repeat until your slime is as stretchy as you want it to be.









It can take up to 16 extra pumps of lotion to reach the desired stretchiness, so don’t hesitate to be generous!

, This slime is stretchy, squishy, and fun to play with - it's great for keeping your hands busy!

Apply additional paste over the poster.",How to Make Wheat Paste2," Using your preferred tool (such as a paintbrush or your gloved hands), apply a liberal coat of paste to a wall. It will adhere strongly to wood, stone, and most other surfaces.









Remove any lumps from the paste to prevent bubbles and lumps from tearing the poster.
Attaching posters to other people's property or in public places is illegal in some regions.

, Do this slowly, rolling it up from one side to prevent wrinkles from forming.









For very large posters or high surfaces, a push broom may be useful.

, A glossy, sticky layer over the whole poster will dry into a strong adherent.








If you used whole wheat flour, the paste may have brown flecks or tinge. Apply such paste lightly to avoid obscuring the poster.

Line up 8 popsicle sticks side-by-side.,
Hot glue 3 popsicle sticks down on top of the 8 popsicle sticks.,
Flip your frame over and place a 4 by 6 inch (10.16 by 15.24 centimeters) photo on top.,
Draw a vertical line of hot glue to either side of the photo.,
Press a stick down onto each line of glue.,
Glue a stick down across the top and bottom of your frame base.,
Stack three sticks, one of top of the other, and secure them with glue.,
Glue each stack to the bottom of your frame base.,
Paint or decorate your frame.,
Slide a photo down through the top of the frame.",How to Make Photo Frames from Ice Cream Sticks2," Orient them horizontally. This will make the base of your frame. You do not nee to glue them together., Orient these sticks vertically. Glue one stick in the middle of the frame base. Glue the other two sticks to the left and right of the frame base. These three sticks will hold the frame base together

, Position the photo in the center of the base, but do not glue it down. You will be using the photo as your template.


At this point, the top and bottom of your frame should have straight edges. The sides of your frame will have the wavy edges created by the curved ends of the sticks.

, Make sure that the line of glue goes from the bottom of the frame base to the top. Be sure to leave a small gap between the glue and the edge of the photo. This way, the glue won't accidentally bleed onto the photo.

, Keep the sticks vertical. Make sure that the inner edge of each stick overlaps the photo. This will help hold the photo inside the frame. If you don't overlap the photo, the photo will fall out.


At this point, you can remove the photo.

, Place a drop of glue onto the top of each vertical stick. Lay a stick down horizontally across the two vertical sticks, pressing the ends into the glue. Repeat this for the bottom.

, Make another stack just like this one. These stacks will make the bottom of your frame so that it can stand up.

, One stack will go on the front of your frame, which will hold the picture in place. The other stack will go on the back, so that the frame stand up straight., Paint your frame and let it dry before using it or decorating it further. You can write something on it, such as your name or a short message. You can also glue items onto it, such as glitter, gemstones, or buttons. For more decorating ideas, click ].


Make sure you take the picture out before decorating the frame.

, If you want to change the picture out, simply pull the photo out, and replace it with a new one.

Make a princess frame.",How to Make Photo Frames from Ice Cream Sticks3," Use contrasting colors so that the designs stand out. For example, you could paint your frame red, and then add green stripes to it. You could also paint it white, and then add black spots into it.

, This can be done onto a painted frame or an unpainted frame. If you are adding designs onto a painted frame, make sure that the paint is completely dry first.


Try some fun, simple designs, such as hearts, starts, spirals, and squiggles.

, Make sure that the stamp is narrow enough to fit on your frame. Small, simple designs, such as stars or chevron patterns, will work best.Do this on an unpainted frame. Stamp ink does not show up well on paint.

, Consider tying the theme of the items into the theme of the photo. For example, if the photo in your frame was taken at a beach, consider gluing down some tiny shells onto the frame. Here are some more ideas to get you started:Buttons or pompoms
Natural items, such as twigs or shells
Sand or glitter
Sequins or gemstones
Small ribbon bows or silk flowers

, You can glue the ribbon right onto the sides of the frame, or wrap it around the sticks, like a candy cane. Consider painting the frame a solid color first, and then gluing the ribbon on.To continue the ""sewing"" theme, glue a large button in each corner of the frame.

, Glue tiny/mini puzzle pieces onto your frame. Wait for the glue to dry, then paint the entire frame a solid color. Make sure that you get the paint into the cracks between the puzzle pieces. Wait for the paint to dry, then attach a ribbon on the back so that you can hang it.Consider gluing mini foam letters to the front of the frame to spell a message. The letters should not stick out beyond the edges of the frame.

, Paint the entire frame your favorite color. Great princess colors include pink, purple, white, and light blue. Wait for the paint to dry, then glue some glitter onto it. Great colors include silver, gold, and iridescent. When the glitter dries, glue a sparkly gemstone in each corner of the frame. Silver gemstones will match most frames, but you can also use colors like pink and purple.Consider painting the glitter on instead. Mix some white glue with a few drops of water. Stir some glitter into the glue, then paint it on with a paintbrush.
Most gemstones will be round or oval. You can use those, or a special shape instead, such as a star, heart, or crown.

Add your pollen.",How to Make Homemade Paper Flowers2," Get red crepe, wax, or glassine paper and cut it into circles at the size you want your poppies to be. Once you have the circles, form the petals by cutting rounded indents at three points just a short way into the paper. You will need 2 circles per flower that you want to make., Press your finger into the center of the circles and pull the edges of the circle up around in until you have a cup-like shape. Squeeze, roll, and generally further create wrinkles that start at the base and move toward the edge of the petals. Flatten the circles back out when you feel it is wrinkled enough.

, Cut from the rounded indents that you made until about two thirds of the way into the circle.

, Put a dot of glue at the center of one circle and attach it to another circle, staggering the petals to make the flower look more real and full.

, Using small squares or circles of green and black tissue paper, do a similar wrinkling process to create the center of the flower.

, Place the black tissue center on top of the green tissue center and glue them together in that way. Then, glue them at the center of the flower.

, Using white out or white paint, dab dots of white onto the tips of the black paper to complete the poppy look.

, You'll also want to fold 2 coffee filters a bit differently. Fold these in half twice but then, instead of doing that again, do the final fold into thirds.

, Using scissors, cut the eighths triangles so that the top, wide end becomes rounded. This forms your basic petal shape. Cut one and then use it as a pattern to cut the rest. When they're done, unfold them into semi circles and cut the semicircle in half. Set aside the petals that were folded into thirds at the end, as these will form the center of your rose.

, Starting with the petals that were folded into thirds, take one set at a time and fold up the bottom point. Glue from this folded up point to whatever you decide to use as a stem, wrapping it around the stem. Add on the rest of the petals the same, way, being sure to stagger them and alternate where they start.


You can make a stem out of a green pen, a thick wire, green pipe cleaners, or even buy fake stems from an art supply store.

, When you are done with the thirds-petals, move on to the rest of the petals. They should also be folded up at the bottom, glued, and wrapped around the other petals. Do not forget to stagger them. Keep adding petals until your rose looks full.

, When the rose is done, you might want to add a few finishing touches. You can finish off the base by gluing green tissue paper around the bottom of the flower or you can even curl the edges of the petals using a pencil.

Drill a hole through each of the four plastic lids.,
Place the bottle caps onto the axles of the car.,
Use the string to pull the car.",How to Make a Toy Car1," Take the label off the bottle. Let the bottle soak in hot water and dish soap for ten minutes. This will make it easier to remove any residue left on the bottle as well as cleaning off any bacteria.






;
, These holes will be where the axles will go. The holes should be parallel with each other.








, You can use a variety of objects for your axles: straws, sticks, toothpicks, or wire (like that from a wire hanger), etc. If the object is long, like a pencil, then you will only need two pieces. If it is short, like a toothpick, then you will need four pieces.








, You will use these caps as your wheels.








, You can paint the outside of the bottle and the wheels. It’s easier to paint bottle and bottle caps before you fully assemble the car.








, Depending on the material you chose, this might be two or four axles. For a longer object, run the axle all the way through the set of holes on the other side. For a shorter object, like a toothpick, place one in each hole.








, Knot a string and then thread it through the lid. Make sure the knot is on the inside of the lid. Screw the lid onto the plastic bottle.








, Using a sharp object like a box cutter, cut a rectangle or square into the top of the bottle. Only cut three sides of the shape so that you can fold it up. Cut it so that when you flip it up the windshield faces the lid of the bottle.








, Using a drill or sharp object, create a hole in the center of the lids.








, Run the axles through the holes you drilled in the bottle caps. See how the car sits. If the lids are too big or too small, then the car may not move. Have the top of the lids face the car so that it has more stability.

, Cut the skewers so that they are slightly longer than the width of the milk carton. The skewers will act as the axles for the car. If you want the axles to run through the milk carton, take this time to puncture two parallel holes on each side of the carton.







, Make sure the top of the lid is facing towards the milk carton as this provides better stability. Use glue where the skewer and cap meet to make it sturdier. Be sure to let the glue dry before proceeding.








, Slide the free end of each skewer through a straw. Cut the straws down until they are slightly shorter than the skewer. Having the skewers inside of the straw will make your car move faster.








, If you punctured holes in the milk carton, run the free end of the skewer through the holes before adding the other wheel. This completes your axles.








, They should be parallel to the width of the carton.








, Use construction paper, paint, or markers to decorate the carton. You can also cut shapes into the milk carton to give it character.

Pour the water until it covers all the paper.

,
Leave it there overnight for proper paper absorption.

,
Stir the soaked paper with a wooden stick or spatula.,
Drain most of the water.,
After that, add the wheat flour.,
Continue stirring until it becomes a smooth dough.,
Now, using the paper dough, you can start covering the box, bottle or whatever you chose to work with.,
Leave it under the sun or in the driest place possible.,
Once it’s completely dried, it’s time to paint it!",How to Make Objects from Recycled Materials," Is it a utensil for the kitchen; is it a flower vase, or something else? Using this simple method, and using a proper framework, it’s even possible to make furniture!


For example, to make a container with a lid, we can use some egg cartons and an oatmeal box. Their packages are all made of paper and we produce a great deal of garbage when we throw them away. So, instead of increasing our garbage, we can collect it for a couple of weeks and create something useful, some piece of art that could be interesting to look at, or even both at the same time.





;
,,,, You might find it better to use your hands to do that. After a few minutes mixing the paper with the water, it will turn into “liquid” paper.

, You may use a sieve if you prefer.

, One or two cups of flour should be enough for a small amount of paper such as a supermarket plastic bag full of torn paper.

, Drain away some more water if necessary.

, You only need to add a layer of one or two centimeters. Make sure that you press the dough against the container well enough so that it doesn’t peel off.

, Depending on the weather conditions it may take from one day to one week to completely dry it. If you have an oven you may want to put it in there for about 30 minutes at a very low temperature. If you do this make sure your art craft is on the middle or highest shelf to prevent burning your work.

, Feel free to paint it the way you like it. You may also add a second layer of paint once the first one is dried to make sure the paint will completely cover the entire object and prevent it from peeling off easily after some time.

, You can look in dollar stores, craft stores or even collect your own from ice creams and ice desserts that use the same type of flat stick. If you plan to decorate the frame, buy decorating items while you are at the store or use what you have at home or in class already. Useful items include markers, colored puffballs, small fake flowers, sequins or glitter, etc.

, Starting with the back, you need to make the back as big as your picture. If your picture is long, use more sticks. If it is short, you'll want to use less.

Lay the number of sticks that you will need in a straight line.
Take a stick and lay it in a cross on top of the others. Use some glue to keep it in place. You may want to put another stick a bit lower on the frame.
If you want to make it a bit more finished-looking, you can lay more sticks on the other side.

Not sure what to draw? Do an online image search of real rockets for suitable images to inspire you. You could even print off decals, etc., and glue them on the rocket tube.;
, Also decide on the amount. Two to three fins is about standard for a rocket, so choose how many you prefer.


Measure the fins up against the size of the paper towel tube and draw fin shapes on cardboard. Then cut them out.
Glue against the sides of the tube, checking that they're firmly held in place. (Alternatively, make slits and push them upward, then glue in place).
Check that the fins are balanced each side before gluing; they should all reach down the same distance.

, Its diameter should match the circumference of the paper tube. (Use your judgment or a compass.)

,,, Pack it tightly to help the cone keep it shape. Tape it in at the base, so that it can't fall out.

, Check that it fits snugly; if not, continue to add tape on it until it does. If it's too big, you'll have to make a new, smaller cone.

, Do this twice. Cut out the circles and check they are able to slide inside the tube.

, Angle them slightly, for the rocket's internal engine.

,, Trace around a round object such as a can, onto paper. Cut out the circle for the template.

, These holes become the rocket windows and sitting areas for toys.


Keep the holes away from the top and base of the rocket, as these areas will have the rocket cone and fins added to them.

, Use a large drill bit.

, Gently guide the jigsaw to cut out the circle design you've marked. Repeat for each circle on the tube.

, Use a strong craft knife to cut three slits at even places around the base of the tube. These may need to be adjusted later, but for now, just begin them.

, You can either paint with a paintbrush or spray paint the whole tube. Either way, ensure that you have adequate ventilation and that wherever you're doing the painting is covered for spills.

, This will form the fins at the base of the rocket, so measure the fin height against the tube, to ensure it will be stable enough to hold the rocket up. Cut out the fin shape and use this as a template.

, Repeat three times, then cut out the fin shapes with a craft knife or a box cutter.

, These are best done in a contrasting color to the color used for making the rocket colorful.


Alternatively, cover the fins with colored paper or colored duct tape.

, Draw a large semi-circle on the poster board. Its diameter should match the circumference of the tube. (Use your judgment or a compass.)


Cut out the semi-circle.
Twist into a cone shape and tape in place.
If you didn't use colored poster board, it can be painted or use colored duct tape.

,, Make adjustments as needed; stand the rocket on the fins and see if it is level or needs changes.


It might help to glue the fins in place.

, The rocket can be played with imaginary beings or dolls/stuffed toys can be put into the holes of the rocket and sent skyward (just be sure to advise the kids to hold onto it still, as although it's strong, it's not suitable for throwing).

Find a tall, narrow, empty container.,
Add flair to your container.,
Cover your container in twigs or similar materials.",How to Make a Pencil Holder for Your Desk1," Anything that’s a little shorter than a pencil and not too wide should work. As long as it’s clean and sturdy, just about any material can be repurposed as a pencil holder. Take a look around for an empty, unused container such as a:


Coffee can
Mason jar
Tin can
Large yogurt cup
Pasta jar
Raisin canister;
, The sky’s the limit when it comes to decorating your container. Gather glue, paint, glitter, colorful paper, and any other supplies you have lying around and let your imagination go wild. Try things like:Painting the outside of your mason jar, coffee can, or other container.
Wrapping the container with washi tape or even decorative duct tape.
Brushing Mod Podge on the outside of the container, then wrapping it in decorative paper, ribbon, or yarn.

, If you want to give your pencil holder an entirely new look, you can cover it in a material that will completely cover the container. Look items that are slightly taller than your container. Apply hot glue to the outside of your container, then set them in place vertically around it. Good choices include:Twigs

Gather a few basic materials and tools.,
Mark where you’d like to place your pencils.,
Wrap tape around your drill bit to mark the hole depth.,
Drill the holes into your block of wood.,
Give your pencil holder more character (optional).",How to Make a Pencil Holder for Your Desk2," Crafting a wooden pencil holder is a quick and easy project. You’ll just need a few supplies, all easily available from a craft or hardware store:A block of wood. The size is really up to you -- just choose one that’s at least a few inches in all dimensions.
A drill and a 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) drill bit (this will be wide enough so you can use your holder for pencils and most other writing utensils as well).
(Optional) supplies for decorating your pencil holder, like paint or stain.

, Unlike an open canister-style pencil holder, the wooden block will have an individual hole for each pencil. Use a pencil, pen, or marker to mark the spots where you’d like the holes to be positioned -- you can place them in even rows, randomly, or in an arrangement like a zigzag or star shape.Whatever pattern you use, make sure to leave some space (at least 0.5 inches (1.3 cm)) between each hole.

, The holes you’ll drill should be at least a couple inches deep to hold the pencils securely in place. You don’t want them so deep that they’ll go right through the bottom, however. Take a piece of painter’s tape or other take, and wrap it around your drill bit at the depth you want the holes to be.For instance, if you want the holes to be 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep, wrap a piece of painter’s tape that far from the end of the drill bit.

, Set the drill bit on the first hole mark you made on your block, and carefully drill the hole. Keep the drill vertical so that the holes will be straight, and don’t forget to stop drilling when the tape you placed on the drill bit just touches the top of the block.Repeat this step for all of the holes you marked in your block.
Turn the block upside down when you are finished, and lightly tap it to remove all of the sawdust.

, At this point, your pencil holder is ready to use as-is. If you’d like, however, go ahead and add some flair. You could paint the block with spray paint, finish it with wood stain, apply Mod Podge to the sides and paste photos on it, or use any other method you would like to decorate it."

Grab a few paper tubes.,
Get your crafting gear ready.,
Trim your tubes to the perfect size.,
Add some flair to your tubes.,
Join the tubes together.,
Finish off your holder by adding a base.",How to Make a Pencil Holder for Your Desk3," If you know you want to make a pencil holder, start stock piling tubes from paper towels, toilet paper, aluminum foil, etc. You’ll need at least a few. The sturdier, the better -- choose thicker tubes, if you have them., This pencil holder project won’t require any unusual tools or supplies. If you’re used to crafting, you’ll probably already have most of the necessities. If not, you can easily get them from any hobby or craft store. In addition to your tubes, you’ll need:Decorative supplies (paint, ribbon, paper, or whatever else you want to use)
Scissors
An X-acto knife
A flat sheet of thin cardboard (such as from a cereal box)
Mod Podge or glue

, If you are using longer tubes, you’ll need to cut them so that they’re not taller than your pencils. Stand a full-size pencil next to your tubes, and use scissors to cut the tube so that it’s at least an inch or two shorter than the pencil.Cut as many tubes as you think you’ll need to hold the number of pencils you have.
If you want some variation in your design, cut the tubes to slightly different lengths.
While you’re at it, you can also designate some tubes to hold other supplies, like pens, scissors, or a ruler. If you want to keep small items (like paperclips) in any of the tubes, however, make sure to cut the tube fairly short so you’ll be able to reach the items.

, Plain cardboard tubes will be functional, but not very pretty. Adding some decorative touches is easy and will make your pencil holder instantly more classy. For instance, you could:Paint the outside of the tubes
Brush them with Mod Podge then wrap them in paper, ribbon, yarn, etc.
Wrap the tubes in washi tape or decorative duct tape.

, Once you have your individual tubes decorated to your liking, stand them all up on their ends. Place them next to each other in various arrangements until you find one that looks good to you. Then apply a thin line of glue or Mod Podge just where each tube touches another. Hold the tubes together for a few seconds to set the glue, then add another line of glue to attach the next tube.For best results, arrange your tubes in some sort of cluster shape. This will keep the pencil holder sturdy.

, The paper tubes are open on both ends, and adding a base will keep them from accidentally falling out if you move or lift up your pencil holder. Luckily, this is quick and easy. Grab your sheet of thin cardboard. Apply glue or Mod Podge to the bottom of your tubes, then set the tube cluster on top of the cardboard.Let the glue dry.
Take an X-acto knife and trace around the edges of your tube cluster. This will remove the excess cardboard and give your pencil holder a clean look.

Super glue, tape, a ruler, and scissors are all necessary to help build your robot. You may also want to add different colored pipe cleaners, buttons, and beads onto your robot.;
, First, you will want to find paper which is thick, like card stock. The dimensions of your cube will be 2X2X2 inches. Using a ruler, draw a 2X2 square on the paper. You can use a protractor to check whether each of the angles are 90 degrees. After you have drawn the first square, you will now have to draw three more of equal size.The next three will go directly next to the first square. Each new square will use a line from the previous square. Continue this until you have four squares, all connected together in one large rectangle.
You will now have a rectangle of four connected squares, with a total dimension of 2X8 inches, and three visible pencil lines.

, The last two squares are placed apart from another, at square number two on the rectangle. Place a square on each side of that rectangle at the same position. You should now have what looks like a cross.

, Use scissors to cut around the outside edges of the cross. Do not cut on the inside pencil marks. After you have cut out the cross, throw the excess paper away., For this step you can use either glue or tape. Fold up the three squares at the top of the cross. Lift up the long end of the cross and fold the top over. You should now have what looks roughly like a cube. Use small pieces of tape, or dabs of glue, to join together the edges. If you use glue, hold the edges together for at least 30 seconds so that the glue can dry., This follows the same steps as the normal cube. The only difference is the dimensions. Draw a 2X4 inch rectangle. On top of that rectangle, on the long side, draw a 4X8 rectangle. Make sure that the lines of both rectangles connect with one another. On top of that rectangle, draw another 2X4 rectangle. Then, on top of that one, draw another 4X8 rectangle. At the end, you should have a rectangle that is 4X20 inch rectangle, with three pencil marks.Remember, 4 inch sides need to match up with 4 inch sides. 8 inch sides need to match up with 8 inch sides. For example, when drawing the 4X8 rectangle above the 2X4 rectangle, the 4 inch sides need to match up.
On both sides of one of the 4X8 rectangles, draw a 8X2 rectangle. At the end, you should have what looks like a cross.

, Use a pair of scissors and cut out the cross. Fold up the two 8X2 rectangles, and one 2X4 rectangle. Then fold up the other section, so that you end up with a rectangular cube. Use dabs or glue, or small tabs of tape to secure the edges. If you use glue, hold the edges down for 30 seconds to ensure that the glue dries., If you decide to paint your cubes, you will need to buy acrylic silver spray paint. Take your cubes outside so that fumes don't build up in the house. Spray the cubes from about 1-2 feet away. Make sure that you get all the sides and edges. You can let one side dry before you spray paint the other sides.If you decide to wrap your cubes in tin foil, simply peel off large sheets of tin foil. Cut two long strips which will wrap around both cubes. You also want to cut out four smaller pieces to wrap around the smaller areas and edges.
You can either wrap the tin foil tightly around the cubes, or glue them down with dabs of super glue.

, Take the smaller cube and place it on one of the 2X4 rectangles in the larger cube. Place the cube in the center of that rectangle. Place a healthy amount of super glue underneath that cube and press down for 15 seconds., Choose any color you would like, but darker colors work best. You want to cut out two strips, each that are 1X7 inches long.

, This means that the first 1/2 inch you will fold up, the next 1/2 inch you will fold down, the next 1/2 inch up, etc. Do this to both strips until they have been completely accordion folded., Place a dab of super glue about one inch below the head of the robot, on both sides of the body. Take the ends of your accordion folds and press them against the super glue. Hold them there for fifteen seconds so that the glue can dry.

, Each of these squares should be 4X4 inches. After you have cut them out, feel free to dispose of any excess construction paper. The color of this construction paper should match what you chose for the arm accordion folds., Take each of the squares in your hands and roll them like a cigar. You want to make sure you leave at least an inch or two in diameter. Then take a small piece of tape and place it on the overlapping edge so that the roll stays in place., Spread super glue around one of the ends of your roll. Do this to both of the legs. Then press and hold them on the underside of the body (large rectangular cube). The legs should be the same distance from one another, and about a 1/2 inch inwards from the edges. Hold the legs there for 15 seconds to allow the glue to harden and dry., Choose from a vast array of buttons or small items you might want to use as eyes. You might want something shiny, so that it matches the essence of a robot. After you have chosen the buttons you wish to use as eyes, super glue them onto the head. Make sure that they are placed on the front of the head, each about an inch inwards from the sides., You can do this with a sharp knife, or a pair of scissors. You want to do this on the top part of the head. Each hole should be about an inch inwards from the edges. Make sure the holes are tiny, otherwise the antennas won't hold. Take a pipe cleaner and cut it in half. Stick one piece in one of the holes and one in the other. Bend them slightly as if they are receiving signals., These can range from 1/4 inch squares to 1/2 inch squares. Cut these out of construction paper using scissors. Make sure you are using a multitude of different colors. Glue them on the front of the main body. You can do these in any order you wish. Press each of the pieces down for 15 seconds to allow the glue to dry. These squares will represent blinking lights/electronics on the robot., Cut out two circles, each the same size, about 2 inches in diameter. If you have a hard time drawing a perfect circle, try to find a small circular object, like the end of a paper towel roll, and trace the edge of it. You should use a different color than the color you used for the legs and arms. Place your robot down on its back. Place glue around the edges of the lower paper legs. Press each of the circles onto the legs, and hold them for 15 seconds. This will allow the glue to dry., Find two small beads that are the same color. You will want to use gold or silver beads. Take a small amount of super glue on each side of your robot's head. Place a bead on each side, and hold them against the super glue. Make sure to hold them for 15 seconds to allow the glue to dry.,"

Fold the beak and wings down.,
Add some eyes to the top cup.,
Fill the chick with candy, if desired.,
Close the chick.",How to Make Egg Carton Chicks," The best type of carton to use is the cardboard kind. It soaks up paint much better. You can try using the foam kind, but the paint may not stick as well.









Make sure that you cut the cups apart so that they are two separate pieces.
Trim the edges so that they are nice and smooth. You want a nice round shape.;
, Set the cups down, side by side, with the inside facing up. Fold a strip of masking tape over the edges where the cups are touching. This tape will act as a hinge.









For extra security, close the cups, and add a strip of tape on the outside. Make sure that it's on the same side as the inside tape. You want to be able to open and close your chick., Hold the cups from the inside, with the hinge resting loosely between your thumb and forefinger. Apply a coat of yellow acrylic or tempera paint. Make sure that you get the paint inside the crease between the two cups as well.








, If the color looks dull or dark, you may need to apply another coat or two of paint. Let the coat dry before applying the next one., You don't have to do this, but it will give them a nicer finish. You can use the same color as you did for the outside, or a different color. If you plan on filling the chick with candy, try to use a non-toxic paint.Most children's paints are, but double-check the label to make sure.








, You can use construction paper or cardstock. You can also paint plain paper orange/yellow on both sides, and use that instead.

, Make the beaks a little bit taller than you want them to be. This will allow you to attach them to the chick. The triangles should be the same size, and no larger than the bottom of your egg cups.








, The triangles can be the same size as the beak, or a little bit bigger. Again, make the wings a little bit longer than you want them to be, so that you can attach them to the chick.








, Chicks have three toes, so draw something that looks like three skinny triangles attached together at the base. You will need two pieces. Make sure that they are smaller than the base of your egg carton cup.








, Don't worry about folding the bottom edges to make a hinge.








, Close the chick and glue the feet to the bottom cup. Make sure that the toes are pointing away from the hinge, and that they are sticking out from under the chick.









The hinge will be on the back of the chick.

, Set the chick down on the table so that the inside hinge is facing up. Turn the cups so that one cup is facing you and the other is facing away from you.








, Draw a line of glue along the bottom edges of the orange triangles. Press the triangles against the inside top and bottom edges of the egg cups. The beaks should be parallel to the hinge.







, This is the cup that has the feet attached. The upper cup should only have the beak piece attached.







, When you glued the beak and wing pieces down, they were sticking straight up. This is not very chick-like, so fold them down over the edges of the egg cup. Don't worry if they stick out a little.








, Close the chick and turn it so that the beak is facing you. Use a black marker to draw two dots on the top cup, right above the beak.You can also glue on two tiny googly eyes instead.







, You can also turn it into a mini Easter basket by stuffing the bottom cup with Easter grass, and placing a few chocolate eggs on top.








, Set the chick down so that its feet are planted on the floor. You can adjust the beak and wing pieces as well, so that they stick up or down.

Cut a long strip of paper.,
Fold the paper accordion style to make a rectangle.,
Draw the outline of a person in the middle of the rectangle.,
Cut out the person.,
Unfold the paper slowly.,
Work with the finished product.",How to Make a Paper People Chain1," Cut the paper as wide as you want; a wider strip means both more drawing surface and a bigger figure to draw. If you wish to be really precise, try folding the paper and then cutting the strips on the creases. If you have a ruler, you can measure to be exact., Make the folds as even as possible.









A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style., For this step, you can draw it free-hand or use a stencil. Draw the person with the head, feet, and hands touching all the edges.







, As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact.







, The chain of people should be holding hands.








, Paper-people chains are neat in and of themselves, but with some markers, crayons, or color pencils, you can draw details on the people. Be creative and pick themes, draw different clothing, add stickers, or glue some glitter."

Cut a long strip of paper.,
Fold the paper accordion style in to a rectangle.,
Draw half a person on one edge of the rectangle.,
Draw the second person on the opposite edge.,
Cut out the figures.,
Unfold to reveal a boy and a girl holding hands.",How to Make a Paper People Chain2," The strip can be wider than the first method because you'll need more drawing surface.








, Make the folds as even as possible.


A good trick is to first fold the strip in half multiple times. When the desired rectangle size is met, unfold the paper. Using the creases made from the folding, fold it accordion-style., The person's torso and head will be on the edge. The arm will extend out to exactly the middle of the paper. Be sure to be precise. You can use a ruler to measure the middle and draw a line, or use a stencil. 








The drawing will be the main difference for this type of paper-people chain; it'll give the opportunity for more creativity be giving you the option to use more than one figure for the chain.

, The second person can be different. Try drawing a girl with a dress. Her head and torso will be on the edge. Her arm will extend out to the middle with her hand meeting the other person's. The hands must be touching.








You can be a bit creative with where the hands meet. The hands can hold different symmetrical figures such as a heart, a star, a small child, etc.

, As you trim out the people, make sure the hands stay connected.








, The chain should be boy-girl, boy-girl.









This approach gives you the chance to mix different figures and explore the space on the rectangle. As long as the figures you draw connect, the final product will be a unique chain.

Draw and cut a large circle in the middle of the paper.,
Fold the circle in half four times.,
Draw either a single or multi-figure person in the middle of the triangle.,
Cut out the person.,
Unfold the paper.,
Decorate with the circle chain.",How to Make a Paper People Chain3," Place a bowl with its rim down on the middle of the paper. Trace it lightly with a pencil, and cut out the circle as perfectly as possible.The bigger the circle, the better. The final product will be like a wreath of people.

, You want to create a symmetrical isosceles triangle with the small side rounded. It will roughly resemble a perfect slice of pizza.







, You can draw half a person on both edges of the triangles with their hands holding in the middle, or you can draw a person in the middle of the triangle with the person's hands touching the edges.








, As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact.








, A circle of paper people should be holding hands.








, The benefits of this style is the chain can stand on its own. The circle chain lends itself for Christmas decorating because it not only resembles a wreath but also a mini tree when it stands. With some creativity, you can create unique and wonderful paper-people circle chains for any occasion.

Make two tree trunks.,
Cut a center line.,
Fit the trunks together.,
Make the leaves.,
Decorate and enjoy!",How to Make a Paper Tree for Kids1," On cardboard, draw out two tree trunks with branches and cut it out. An adult might need to help you cut the cardboard, since it can be really tough and unsafe to cut.


Make sure that the tree widens out at the bottom of the trunk, like how roots go into the ground. This will help the tree stand up!;
, Cut a line in one of the trunks from the top of the trunk (where the branches start to grow), until just past the halfway point on the trunk. Then, on the second trunk, cut a similar line that goes halfway up from the bottom.

, You can now slide one tree trunk onto the other! The tree that is cut from the bottom should fit into the one that was cut from the top. Now the tree can stand up!

, Using small squares of colored tissue paper, put a small spot of glue on the center of the paper and stick it on one of the branches of the tree. Keep going until you think your tree is done. You can make it look very full!

, Once you're done adding leaves, you can make your tree look even more special by adding other decorations. Try drawing and cutting out a squirrel to keep your tree company, or make a bird nest out of a pipe cleaner.

Gather your materials.As with any craft, there are things you'll need to get in order to make your newspaper basket a reality.,
Fold a section of newspaper in half.Take a number of sheets and fold them horizontally.,
Cut newspaper along the fold into strips.It saves time to cut the newspaper multiple sheets at a time.,
Roll individual strips up.,
Trace the foundation on cardboard.Thin cardboard will give you a solid foundation for your newspaper basket.,
Set stripped rolls on the foundation.,
Allow your basket foundation time to sit.Whether you're using craft glue or hot glue, it's a good idea to give your craft some time to sit.,
Glue a strip the base of a spoke.,
Weave the strip through the foundation spokes.,
Glue and secure a new strip onto the end of the next.,
Weave your way up the spokes.,
Tuck the top of the spokes into the basket.For the sake of stability, it's a good idea to leave at least an inch of spoke unwoven.,
Make a handle.A handle can be made from take a strip and gluing it to opposing ends of the basket rim.,
Decorate your basket.Decorating a basket isn't necessary, but some people like the extra colour that decoration provides.,
Consider uses for your basket.Newspaper baskets may be used like any other basket.",How to Make a Newspaper Basket," Fortunately, they're all probably lying around your home. If not, the materials are inexpensive. Here are the main things you'll need for this craft:


A cardboard box, such as a cereal box or cracker box. Anything with thin cardboard will work for this craft.
A newspaper. It's preferable that you get a bigger newspaper for this. That will maximize the material you get to use.
Scissors and glue. Crafts glue like Elmer's glue will be perfect.
A circular template. Any solid circle shape should work. You will use this to trace the foundation of your basket. Make sure the template is as big as you'll want your basket to be.;
, Following a fold, each sheet should be half the width it originally was. Folding these sheets as such will prepare them for cutting into strips.

, Because they're all the same size and very thin, you can line them up and cut them into equal-sized pieces. You will need approximately 30-40 of these strips to create a basket, although more may be needed for larger crafts.









Approximately, these strips will be about 10cm wide.The cuts don't need to be perfect. You won't be able to see the exact measurements in the resulting basket.

, By rolling up your strips of newspaper, you can make the pieces your basket will need to come together. Place a pencil on a strip lengthwise and roll the newspaper strip around it to make a tight roll. Roll Watch TV or something while your make your rolls.









Leave your pencil slightly protruding so you'll be able to take it out afterwards. This will make it easier to pull out when the roll is complete.

, Take a round shape (like a plastic lid for butter) and trace around it. Cut it out with scissors once you've traced the circle.









You should make a second cardboard of the same size to act as an overlying piece for your foundation. If you want to give your basket a lid, make a slightly bigger cardboard circle cutout.

, Now that you have a foundation and rolls, it's time to put the two together. Place strips of newspaper crossing through the centre of the foundation. Place them like spokes of a wagon wheel, then glue them down. Once this is complete, set another identical cardboard layer of foundation on top of the glued spokes and glue it down.









It's important that these ""spokes"" are evenly centered. The protruding lengths of either side will make up the pillars of your basket, and having them uncentered at this stage will make your basket's walls uneven.
You need an odd number of strips to make the basket work.

, With regular craft glue, at least an hour should be enough time to resume. Because hot glue dries a lot faster, waiting may not be necessary.









Place a book atop the foundation to allow the glue to set properly.

, The ""walls"" of your basket will be made by weaving the same type of strips you used for the spokes around the spokes in a knitted format. Take the end of a strip and glue it to the base of a spoke where it meets the cardboard foundation. Take a paperclip to further secure it.








, Prop the spokes up and move the strip back and forth on alternating sides of each following spoke. In this fashion, the a strip should hug the bottom running around the circumference of the foundation. Continue to weave it around until the strip is done.









This step may seem difficult at first, but it gets quite a bit easier once you get the basic hang of it.

, With most baskets, a strip should last approximately one lap around the foundation. When a strip is done, glue on another strip to the end of the one you just used, thereby extending it. Use the clip you used on the first strip and spoke to keep the new pairing intact as you move forward. Once it's secured, continue weaving between the following spokes.








, Once you get a few rows up, the spokes will stand up on their own. This will make it easier to keep going. Continue the process of gluing and clipping until you've reached near the top of your basket.

, Instead, fold it in inside the basket. You can either secure it with glue, or lace them through the existing weave.








, This should be done before you take to decorating it, as a handle should be coloured in the same as the rest of your craft.

, Acrylic paints will allow you to pain vibrant designs and patterns over the basket's surface. You can use a variety of other art products, from markers to pens and pencil crayons.


If you're looking to do an elaborate pattern on the basket, you might consider using the existing text on the newspaper to your advantage. For instance, drawing speech bubbles around headlines is one way of taking advantage of the material's news-related origins.
Watercolours will allow the newspaper text to show through.

, Because they're homemade, they're perfect as a gift. They're also useful as wastebaskets or gift baskets. Depending on how much time you've put into decorating it, you may even put it on display as a work of art in your home.


Looking at other newspaper basket crafts by others may even give you inspiration to try new variations on it. Because it's a homemade craft, there are virtually endless ways you can go about it."

Start with a small cardboard box.,
Make an incision around the sides and over the top.,
Fold down the front section you've just cut around









You now have a front end.

,
Shape the rear of the car.,
Pierce the sides at the points where the wheels should go.,
Insert two skewers for axles.,
Make wheels.,
Attach the wheels to the axels.,
Decorate your car.,
Have fun with your car!








",How to Make a Cardboard Car2," Cereal boxes or tissue boxes are particularly good choices.


If using a long tissue box, turn the box over so the open end (for tissues) isn't seen.

, Start about 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the front of the car and 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the top. Cut upwards to the top, across the top, and 3 inches down the other side.









Use sharp scissors or a box cutter for this step.

,, This step depends on what kind of box you're working with, and what kind of car you want.


For a sedan, repeat Step 2 on the opposite end of the box.
For an old-fashioned Model-T type car, skip this step.

, Do this with the sharp end of the scissors. You may want to measure out and mark the points in advance to make sure they are equidistant.








, They should run between the two sets of pierced points where the wheels will go.









Alternatively, you can use plastic straws, pencils, or pens. Do not use pipe cleaners, as they bend too easily.

, Cut four wheels of equal diameter out of another piece of cardboard.









It's preferable to use a stiffer type of cardboard than the type found in cereal and tissue boxes.

, If using a skewer, you can poke a hole in the wheel with the sharp end. Otherwise, you'll need to make a small hole in the wheels so they can fit on the axel. Use the sharp tip of your scissors; don't make the hole too large or the wheel will fall off!








, You can use markers, crayons and stickers, or glue colored paper onto the car. If you're really ambitious, you can paint it with tempera or finger paints.









Don't be afraid to leave the original design of the box as is, if you like it. The novelty can be a very charming part of the toy, and you can make a collection of several cars from different boxes.

Neaten up the edges of the cups with a pair of scissors. The caterpillar will wiggle more if they are rounded and don't have corners.

, You can paint all of them the same color, or different colors. If you want to make a ""very hungry"" caterpillar, paint one cup red, and the rest green. Let the paint dry before moving on.Acrylic paint, tempera paint, or poster paint will work the best.

, Use scissors or a pencil to poke a hole in the first cup along one of the four top edges. Do the same thing for the second cup. The holes need to be about ¼ to ½ inch (0.5 to 1 centimeter) down from the edge. These will make the head and tail of the caterpillar.Young children may need and adult's help for this step.
If you made a ""very hungry"" caterpillar, use a red cup and a green cup for this step.
Make sure that the holes match up. They should be in the center of the edge.

, This time, poke the holes straight across from each other. You will need one hole on the left side edge, and another hole for the right side edge. These will make the body pf the caterpillar.Make sure that the holes are aligned.

, Cut a piece of string that's longer than all six cups put together. Tie a knot at one end, then thread it through a yarn needle. Take one of your single-hole cups, and push the needle through it.Make sure that the needle comes out on the outside.
If the knot falls out of the hole, tie a bead around the end of the string instead.

, Thread the two-hole cups onto the string. Finish off with the other single-hole cup. Tie another knot at the end of the string.If you have any string left over, cut it off.

, Flip the caterpillar over so that you can see the bottoms of the cups. Choose an end to be the head. Use a pair of sharp scissors or a pencil to poke two holes in the top of the head.If you made a ""very hungry"" caterpillar, the red end is the head.

, Flip the caterpillar over so that you can see the inside. Poke each end of the cut pipe cleaner through a hole. Flip the caterpillar back over, then twist the ends of the pipe cleaner together.

Cut the lid and side flaps off of the egg carton. Next, cut the carton down the middle so that you have two strips.

A 12-cup egg carton will work the best, but you can use a smaller one too.
This method will turn your caterpillar into a flower pot for small seeds, such as grass.
Trim the excess cardboard away from each cup so that the edges are nice and smooth.

, Flip the strip over so that you can see the bottom and outside of the cups. Paint the cups a bright color. Acrylic paint will work the best, but you can use poster and tempera paint too.Paint the inside of the cups with clear, waterproof, acrylic sealer to keep the caterpillar from getting soggy.

, Turn the strip so that the inside is facing you. Punch two holes into one of the narrow ends of the strip, close to the top. You can do this with scissors or a pencil., Feed the pipe cleaner through the inside of the cup, so that it comes out the front. Twist the ends together, then bend them upwards. Spread the pipe cleaner apart to make a V shape. Glue a small pompom to the tips, or curl them with a pencil.

If the antenna are still too long for you, cut them shorter.

, Glue two googly eyes to the front of the strip, just below the pipe cleaner antenna. Use a marker to draw a small face beneath the eyes.If you don't have googly eyes, you can draw the eyes instead.
Add lashes to make the caterpillar a girl.

, Get some soil from the garden or a flower nursery. Add enough water to make it damp. Use a spoon to fill each cup with soil, about ¼-inch (0.5 centimeter) from the rim., You want to use a pinch of seeds for each cup in case they don't all grow. You can also try herbs, like basil or chives., Remember to water the seeds often. If you planted grass, you need to water them every day. Do not water them too much, or the caterpillar will get soggy and fall apart.The caterpillar will eventually fall apart. When that happens, cut the cups apart and plant them in your garden.
If you used grass, use scissors to give the caterpillar a haircut!
If you have a cat, be aware that he or she may try to eat the grass.

Go crazy by adding recycled parts from all sorts, be creative.",How to Make a Storm Trooper Helmet from a Milk Jug," These are listed under ""Things You'll Need"" below.

, This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit.


Cut a round circle out of the bottom of the milk jug. This circle will be used as the top of your helmet so make sure it is a perfect circle. If possible, use a pencil and protractor or stencil. Label this part “B.”
Cut an opening in the front of the same jug. Hold the milk jug by the handle and hold it so that you're looking at the front of the milk jug. The opening you cut is meant to accommodate the other milk jug; therefore, cut a rather large “C” shape into the front of the jug. Label this part “A.”

,


Cut the top third of the second jug and put the remainder of the jug aside.
Slice the opening off the second jug by creating a round circle on the top. Because the circle you cut from the first milk jug should fit on top, use that as a guide. Discard the remainder.
Cut the top in half so that you're left with the front portion of the milk jug without a back. Label this part “C.”

, Turn on the hot glue gun and set at either low or medium. Be careful––if the glue is too hot, it may melt the plastic.


Glue part “C” on top of part “A.” This will serve as the lower and front sides of the helmet. The top of the jug is the helmet “nose.” The top opening on the top of the part “C” should be on top where you will be able to affix part “B.”
Glue part “B” into part “C.” Part “B” should fit snugly into the top of part “C.” Hold this piece together until the glue dries.
Glue a milk cap on either side of the milk jug opening. Flip the cap upside down and affix the top of the cap to the mask. Make sure the caps are evenly distributed on either side of the jug hole.

, At this point you should have a helmet that you could place on your head. Now you can begin to add details so it resembles a real Storm Trooper helmet:


Create eye-holes in the front. It’s important that you see while wearing this mask so put the mask on and have someone draw dots where your eye-holes should be. Make the eye-holes as small as possible since “eyes” were not overly apparent in the real Storm Trooper mask.
Punch holes on either side of the back of the mask and thread the piece of elastic string through the holes. The elastic will hold your mask in place. Tie a knot on the outside end of the elastic to hold it in place. If you need to adjust the length, do so while threading the string.
Spray paint your helmet completely white. Place the helmet on top of several newspapers, preferably in an outdoor area and spray the entire mask completely white. Allow the mask to dry for several hours or overnight.
Add details using the electrical tape and black, white and grey craft paint. This is when the totally white mask transforms into a scary Storm Trooper helmet. Print out a photo of the real thing and follow the details based on the film helmet. Use the black electrical tape to form a band around the forehead area and cut a circle from the tape to seal the milk jug opening. Use the black Sharpie for adding in the more intricate details.

, These are listed under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, Cut a circle out of the bottom of the jug, cut the handle of the jug as well. This jug will provide the “skeleton” of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper’s) to ensure a decent fit.

, Leave about 3 inches (7.6 cm) plastic, this will be use to connect to the second jug to form the half of the helmet.

, The most important about what you're cutting with is that it does the job, the brand doesn't matter at all.

,,,, You can see the Storm Trooper’s helmet already taking shape.

,,,, Make sure you paint them black. If you have some broken or old or very cheap sunglasses hanging around your house you can disassemble it and glue them in the eyes, this would really add realism to your helmet.

, Add an old washing machine hose to act as a breathing apparatus use on board flying TIE Fighters. Enjoy and serve the dark side well soldier!

Glue the shells into place on the canvas backing.,
Place a hanging clip, string or hook on the back of the collage if hanging on a wall.",How to Make a Shell Collage," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". When choosing the shells, here are some thoughts to consider:


Choose shells that you find interesting because of their color, shape, texture and perhaps also because you can pair or group them
Widen the choices to include smooth beach glass, dried seaweed, dried sponges, shiny broken pieces of shell (look for mother of Pearl type pieces––paua/abalone shell is especially pretty)
Coral fronds if they've washed up on the beach (never take coral from the sea; it is protected in most of the world, for good reason).;
, Pin, staple or glue into place.

, It's recommended that you experiment with the placement of the shells to obtain a collage design that you like first. Some ideas for creating a design with shells include:


Create a pattern using the shells in pairs, trios or other arrangements.
Consider making a border using very small shells.
Create one large shell shape using the shells moving around in a spiral.
Select shells for similarities in color, shape or texture and group them together.
Make a scene from the shells, such as a landscape or a seascape.
Make an animal or face design using the shells.
Make a design that represents something in nature, such as a tree, leaf, rainbow or flowers.

, Work across the board so as to avoid knocking any shells already placed from their positions.


If you find shells shifting before they're dried, use pins to make a barrier around them and to prevent sliding. Remove once the shells have dried.
Let the collage dry completely before attempting to display it.

, Alternatively, attach a stand that will hold the collage up if placed on a shelf or mantle piece.

Apply the paint to your cooler, making sure it is thick enough to cover the surface.,
Paint 1 side at a time.,
Let the cooler dry for 24 hours when you have completed your design.

,
Apply a coat of polyurethane sealer, such as Minwax Polycrylic.,
Allow the coat to dry completely.",How to Paint a Cooler,"


Look for a beat up cooler at a thrift store or garage sale. As long as it seals at the top, paint can cover other superficial damages.
Buy a cooler at a box store, such as Walmart or Target. Plastic coolers range from $20 to $100.;
, The more flat surfaces, the better, since you will be able to apply paint directly.


A cooler with a flat surface is better than a cooler with a ribbed surface.

, If you have dents or an indented logo, you will want to follow this step.

, This paste is available at most home improvement stores, just like primer and other painting tools.

, Wait approximately 12 hours for it to dry.

, Sand all the surfaces that you plan to paint.

,, Then, wash it with a mild soap. Rinse well and allow it to dry.

,, You will want to do all of the priming and painting outdoors.


For best results, try a primer especially made for uneven plastic surfaces. Look for Rustoleum Fusion for Plastic or a similar product. The spray paint allows for easy and fast application.

, Apply 2 coats, if recommended by the manufacturer.

, You can print out stencils and logos.

, Copy the design over to the tracing paper if you have printed out designs.

, You can also draw freehand onto the cooler with a pencil, and use the lines to guide your painting.

, You can also buy a bulk paint, like Gesso, and mix your own colors.

, Outlines and small illustrations are much easier with these pens.

, Take your time to ensure you fill out the design completely.


Use blue painter's tape to form straight lines. Put the paint onto the primed surface. Then, take it off afterward and paint the outline of the tape.

, Do not tilt the cooler onto painted sides, while the paint is still curing.

,, Make sure you apply an even coat.

, Apply 1 to 2 more coats.


The care you take with sealing your painted cooler will determine how long the paint job lasts.

, These could be beads, costume gems, glitter, lace, ribbon, bows, etc. Decide whether these will form part of the pattern or will be additional decorative elements on top.

, It's useful for keeping pins and needles in a sewing basket, paperclips on a desk, earrings/rings, etc. on a dressing table and tacks in the kitchen, etc.

Cut doormat to size.,
Lay out stones on doormat.,
Add glue to the back of each stone.,
Allow for at least 24 hours of dry time before moving mat into place.",How to Make a Smooth Stone Doormat," The goal is to find a doormat that has no texture but an easy surface to hold the stones. Look for something with a sturdy backing as the stones will be heavy and you don’t want them to fall when moving the mat.


Measure the size you desire and then mark with the pencil.
If you are satisfied with the size, you don’t need to cut the mat.;
, Before adding a drop of glue you’ll need to position the stones so that they cover the mat.


Make sure they work cohesively on the mat, fitting together like a puzzle.
Check to ensure no spaces are between stones or that you can see the mat.
Design the mat to create a shape that closely resembles the mat shape you cut.

, Without disturbing the layout add a layer of glue to the back of each stone and press into place.


Work slowly so that you don’t disturb the other stones in the layout that haven’t been glued into place.

, Consider using a piece of board to slide underneath the mat to make moving it into place a smooth transition.


Use caution because although the stones are held by strong glue, they can still shift in transition so either use a hard surface to move the mat and/or slide it into place.

Get a medium-sized plastic or foam pumpkin from the craft store.,
Cut off the stem from the top of the pumpkin.,
Paint the pumpkin, if desired, then let the paint dry.,
Cover the top of the pumpkin with hot glue.,
Place a round tray on top of the pumpkin.,
Fill in any gaps between the tray and the pumpkin with more glue.,
Consider adding a second tier.,
Use the tray.",How to Make an Autumn Serving Tray1," This will create the base for your serving tray. Choose a pumpkin that is relatively flat on top, and don't worry about the stem.;
, You should be able to do this with a box cutter, craft blade, or even a saw from a pumpkin carving kit. Don't worry about being too neat here; you will be covering the top of the pumpkin. Removing the stem simply helps the serving plate or candle charger sit better on it., You can leave the pumpkin as is, or you can paint it a different color using spray paint or acrylic paint. You can also apply a light layer of paint using a wide, dry paintbrush to create a streaked, weathered, vintage look. Gold will work great, but you can paint your pumpkin any color you want. It might be a good idea to match it to your serving tray, however!

, Focus on the highest part of the pumpkin, as this will be the part that touches the tray. Don't worry so much about the dipped or hollow areas, such as the groove around the stem.

, You can also use a large, plastic, candle charger from the craft store instead. Keep the tray proportionate to the pumpkin. You want it to be wider than the pumpkin, but not so wide that it becomes unstable and tips around.


Make sure that the tray is centered.
Choose a tray or candle charger that goes well with your pumpkin. If the design is nice, but the color clashes, paint the tray with spray paint. Let the paint dry before you use the tray.

, Flip your pumpkin try over and take a look at the seam between the pumpkin and the base of the tray. If you see any gaps, fill them in with hot glue. Alternatively, you can add a line of hole glue along the seam between the pumpkin and the tray to extra stability.

, You can do this by hot gluing a smaller pumpkin and smaller tray on top. You can also do it by hot gluing your medium pumpkin to a large tray, and then gluing the tray to a larger pumpkin. Remember to chop the stems off of the pumpkins, however., Hot glue only takes a few minutes to set up, so your tray will be ready in no time! To clean it, simply wipe the surface of the tray down with a damp cloth. You can decorate it further by adding some autumn leaves, acorns, and a fall-scented candle on top.

Get some fake, silk autumn leaves.,
Find something to use as a background.,
Take apart your frame.,
Paint the frame, if desired, and left it dry.,
Seal the frame if you painted it.,
Paint the backing of the frame with decoupage glue.,
Press your background against the glue.,
Glue the leaves to the backing.,
Allow the glue to dry, then use a craft blade to trim off any excess backing and leaf.,
Pry the stand off of the backing if there is one.,
Measure your handles.,
Drill some holes for the screws, then attach the handles.,
Reassemble the frame.,
Use the tray.",How to Make an Autumn Serving Tray2," You can find them in the arts and crafts store. You can use real autumn leaves, but you will have to rinse them, pat them dry, and then press them for 4 to 5 days. Alternatively, you can print out pictures of autumn leaves, cut them out, and use them instead.

, You will need something to cover the backing of your picture frame. You can use rustic things, such as linen or burlap fabric. You can also use sheets of scrapbooking paper, but make sure that the design is not too distracting. Consider something simple, such as dark brown or bronze scrolls on top of a cream background, or black calligraphy on top of an ivory background.


The background needs to be the same size as the backing of your frame, or a little bit larger.
Consider laying two or more different backgrounds to create a collaged effect.
Avoid anything with a autumn leaf print, or that is red, orange, or yellow. While these are great fall themes, they will blend in too much with your autumn leaves.

, Flip the frame over, and undo the hooks on the back. Pull out the backing and the glass. If your frame came with a scrape of paper behind the glass (such as a fake picture), discard it.


Choose a simple frame, preferably one that is wider and angled, so that it forms a ""tray"" when you set it down.

, You can leave the frame blank, or you can paint it a new color using spray paint or acrylic paint. Choose a neutral color that goes well with the autumn theme, such as gold copper, bronze, brown, ivory, or cream. If you can, you can also try using a dark red or rusty orange. Let the paint dry, then add a second layer, if necessary.Remember to paint the sides and back of the frame as well.

, This will help make your paint last longer. Choose a finish that you like best (glossy, satin, or matte), and spray the front, back, and sides. Allow the sealer to dry before applying another coat.


If you painted your frame a metallic color, such as gold, be sure to use a glossy sealer. A satin or matte finish will dull down the shimmer.

, Take the back part of the frame, and flip it over so that the smooth side is facing you, and the stand is on the back. Apply the glue in a thick, even layer using a paintbrush.You can also make your own decoupage glue by mixing together equal parts of water and white school glue.

, Position one side of the background with the edge of the backing, then slowly lower it down, smoothing out any ripples, wrinkles, or bubbles as you go. Don't worry if the backing is too big. You will fix that shortly. #* If you have several different backgrounds, layer them to create a collaged effect.

, Brush the back of each leaf with your glue, then press it against the backing.If you want, you can make some of the leaves extend over the edge of the backing; you will trim them off later. You don't have to cover the entire backing with leaves either; experiment with using your positive and negative space. Also, don't be afraid to overlap the leaves.

, Once the glue has dried, flip the backing over and place it onto a cutting mat. Run a sharp craft blade along the edges of the backing, cutting away any excess paper and leaves.

, Most frames will have a stand on the back that folds out so that you can stand the frame up on your table instead of hanging it. Since you are making a tray, you will no longer need this stand. Simply slide an ice pick or a sturdy butter knife under the hinge, and carefully pry it away.


If some of the backing tears away, and this bothers you, you can paint over the revealed cardboard with some matching paint.

, Choose two cabinet or drawer handles, and place them against the shorter sides of your frame; make sure that the handles are positioned on the top part of the frame, and not the narrow edge. Use a pen or pencil to make a mark where the screw holes are.


Choose handles that match the colors on your serving tray. Bronze, gold, or copper go well with warm, fall colors.

, Take the handles away, and drill some holes over the marks you make. Place the handles back on top and insert the screws. Twist the screws into place with your screwdriver.If your frame is very thin, the screws may poke out the back. In this case, consider attaching the handles to the frame using some strong, industrial-strength glue or epoxy.

, Flip the frame over so that the back is facing you. Clean the glass with glass cleaner, then carefully insert it into the frame. Place the backing on top, and slide the hooks back into place.

, Because this tray is topped with glass, it is very durable and resistant against spills. Despite this, it would not be a good idea to stick the tray into the dishwasher. If it gets dirty, simply wipe the surface clean with a damp cloth.

Get some autumn leaves.,
Clean and dry the leaves.,
Press the leaves for 4 to 5 days.Place the leaves between two sheets of paper, then tuck them inside of a book.,
Consider painting your tray with spray paint or acrylic paint.,
Place the leaves on your tray in a nice design.,
Glue the leaves down.,
Allow the glue to dry.,
Get some clear epoxy resin, and mix it together following the instructions on the package.,
Pour a thin layer of your prepared epoxy onto the tray.,
Wait 5 minutes or so, then gently blow on any bubbles that appear.,
Allow the epoxy to cure.,
Use the tray.",How to Make an Autumn Serving Tray3," These can be bright, colorful autumn leaves that you found outside, or they can be silk leaves that you bought from the store. Choose nice leaves, that aren't ripped, torn, dry, or brittle. Also, try to get a variety of colors: red, orange, yellow.


Your leaves don't have to be the same type. You can use a combination of maple and oak, for example.
How many leaves you use depends on the size of your serving tray and your design. You can cover the tray completely with leaves, or leave some gaps.

, Rinse the leaves under cool running water. Gently run your fingers over them to dislodge any dust or dirt. Once the leaves are clean, gently pat them dry between two sheets of paper towel.


If you bought the leaves from the store, you do not have to do this.

, The paper will help keep the pages of your book clean. Next, place several heavy books on top. If you don't have any, you can use other weights, such as a flower pot, a heavy cooking pot, etc.


If you have a flower press, use that instead.

, You can leave your tray as it is, or you can paint it to help the leaves stand out better. Copper, gold, bronze, brown, ivory, or cream are all great options. Black may also work if you want something dramatic and elegant, but consider painting the edges of your tray in gold; this will take away some of the harshness. Let the tray dry completely before moving on.


If your tray is made out of natural wood, consider leaving it blank, or training it a nice, warm color.
Avoid red, orange, and yellow. While these are great autumn colors, they will match the colors of your leaves. As a result, your leaves won't stand out as much.

, Move the leaves around until they are where you want them to be. Experiment with overlapping, positive space, and negative space. Keep in mind that you do not have to use all of your leaves.


You can trim the stems off or you can leave them on.

, Once you have the leaves where you want them to be, pick them up one by one and glue them down. You can do this by coating the back of each leaf with white school glue and a paint brush. Gently place the leaf back onto the tray, and smooth it down.Make sure to get the glue all the way to the edges to prevent gaps.
Go easy on the glue. If you accidentally use too much and it leaks out from under the leaf, wipe it away.

, Your tray is not complete yet, but the glue will help keep the leaves steady during the next step.

, You need to get the type of liquid epoxy that you can pour over tables and dries clear; do not get the clay type of epoxy. Each brand will be a little different, but in general, you need to mix together equal amounts of Part A and Part B in a disposable cup.Work in a well-ventilated area. Epoxy can cause some lightheadedness.
Work on top of some newspaper or a cheap plastic tablecloth to protect your work surface.

, Use your stirring stick to help spread it around; be careful so as not to dislodge any of the leaves.You want the epoxy to cover the entire surface of the tray, from edge to edge, corner to corner. Keep the layer thin. Remember, you can always add more later.

, Epoxy sometimes traps bubbles, which don't appear right away. Blowing on these bubbles causes them to pop and go away!, This will typically take a couple of days, but it also depends as to what kind of brand you are using. Refer to the packaging that your epoxy came in for specific curing times. This will typically take a few days.If you home gets dusty, place a box over the tray to keep the dust from getting stuck to the epoxy.

, Once the epoxy is fully cured, it is ready to use! Unlike glue and decoupage, epoxy is waterproof. You still want to be careful with it, however. Do not leave it sitting in water, and wipe it down with a damp cloth if it gets wet.

Find an old glue stick.,
Roll and stretch the glue.,
Color the sticky tack.,
Enjoy your homemade sticky tack.",How to Make Sticky Tack1," You want one that has some glue left that's too dry to spread. If you want, you can use a brand new glue stick. Just let it sit without its cap for a few days so it can dry out and become more tacky.


Don't try this with a new glue stick that's still spreadable. The sticky tack will be too sticky, and it could glue your pictures to the wall instead of temporarily adhering them there, like sticky tack does.
To quickly dry out a glue stick, remove the glue from the plastic stick and put it in an oven-safe container. Cook it on the oven at a very low temperature for an hour or so, until it's dry enough that it doesn't feel sticky to the touch. Be careful when you're handling the hot pan and glue.;
, Place it between your palms and roll it around, smoosh it, and form it into a ball, then stretch it out. This will help it dry out a little more and create the right texture for sticky tack.









If it's not quite dry, sprinkle a little baby powder onto the glue ball and work it in. The powder will absorb the remaining moisture.

, Take a marker (preferably blue, the color of real sticky tack) and color the sticky tack. Any type of marker or ink will do. Add a few drops of color, then roll and stretch the glue ball to mix the color in. Keep adding more color and mixing it in until you're happy with the way it looks.









If you're concerned that the sticky tack could leave marks on your pictures, you don't have to add color. Just use the sticky tack as is. It'll work just as well!

, Take a pinch and stick it to the back of your pictures, posters, and other lightweight items, then press the items against the wall. When you're ready to take them down, the sticky tack will peel right off.

Measure out your glue and starch.,
Mix the glue and starch.,
Add a few drops of food coloring.,
Knead it with your hands.,
Use or store the sticky tack.",How to Make Sticky Tack2," You'll need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white glue (also called school glue) and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of liquid starch, the kind that's used to starch shirts. These ingredients will give you a small batch of sticky tack. If you want a larger batch, just remember to use the ratio of 2 parts glue and 1 part starch.

, Put them in a container and use a spoon to mix them together. The mixture will immediately begin to stiffen, due to the interaction between the glue and starch. Soon it will form the consistency of sticky tack.








, Use blue or another fun color to color your sticky tack if you'd like. Add just a few drops, since a little goes a long way. Stir it in so that the ball of sticky tack gets thoroughly colored.








, Scoop the sticky tack into your hands and knead it so that it becomes firm, but pliable. If you think it feels a little sticky, work in a little more starch. If it's too dry to stick, add a bit more glue. Keep working the sticky tack until it reaches the consistency you want.








, Pinch of a few small pieces to hang a poster or picture. You can store the sticky tack you don't use in an airtight jar or another container. If it gets a little dry before you use it again, you can add more glue and work it in with your hands to achieve the right texture again.

Get the right ingredients.,
Pour some acetone into the glass jar.,
Break up the styrofoam into small pieces.,
Push the styrofoam to the bottom of the cup.,
Remove the plastic.,
Sculpt it into a fun shape.",How to Make Plastic1," For this method, you're basically melting styrofoam in paint-thinner, creating a semi-hard plastic-type substance that you can use to mold in different shapes and forms. To do it, you'll need:


Acetone or paint thinner, commonly available at hardware stores
A mason jar, or other glass container
Styrofoam cups, or some other kind of expanded polystyrene
Gloves
Eye protection;
, To complete the job, you'll need a half-inch or at least a few centimeters of acetone at the bottom of the jar.









Put on your gloves and glasses at all times when handling acetone, which is quite dangerous. Avoid breathing in the fumes and make sure you do this in a well-ventilated area with adult supervision, if you're under 15.

, Whether you've got some old packing styrofoam or styrofoam cups lying around, start tearing them into pieces small enough to fit into the glass and push all the way to the bottom.







, You should start to see the reaction relatively quickly, so it's important to keep your safety glasses and gloves on while you do this. Put the cap on the top of the jar, or cover it with a heavy object like a book and let the jar sit for several minutes while the acetone breaks down the styrofoam.









The more you wait, the more solid the melted product will become. In general, it's at a good moldable consistency between 3 and 5 minutes.

, When you remove the styrofoam from the jar, you'll have a weirdly moldable plastic substance you can shape and mold, much like clay. Keep your gloves on and mold it into a shape you'd like, then let it dry.









In about 12-24 hours it should be fully formed and solid.

, Use your imagination and mold your new plastic into a fresh shape, making a small plastic sculpture you'll be able to paint later, or some other cool design. This is a fun science project for kids and students, providing them with a cool souvenir for later.

Assemble the right ingredients.,
Dissolve borax in one of the cups.,
Prepare the glue.,
Add a spoonful of the borax solution to the glue.,
Keep it away from the air.",How to Make Plastic2," Polymers are somewhere between a liquid and a solid, molding to the shape of their container, but stretchy and moldable like a solid. To make a basic polymer from simple ingredients, you'll need:


White craft glue, like Elmer's
2 cups
Water
Borax powder (laundry detergent)
Plastic spoon

, Add a small spoonful of borax to the cup and enough water to dissolve it. Stir it up until it dissolves completed, then set aside.








, In the other cup, add a small amount of glue. A few spoonfuls, three or so, of water to the glue and stir it up, thinning it out some.









If you want to color your polymer, you can also add a few drops of food coloring and mix it up to create a fun color.

, As you stir, you should notice a slimy texture start to form in the glue, and it may start to stick to the spoon some. Let it sit for 30 seconds, then remove it from the spoon.









The slimy polymer plastic is fine to touch with your bare hands. Play with it, stretch it, mold it, make crazy shapes. It's difficult to get it to hold it's shape, but it makes a great creepy plastic alien goo for kids to play with.

, To store the plastic slime, keep in a sealed plastic bag. It'll last a while if you take care of it, or you can make some more the same way!

Assemble the right ingredients.,
Heat the milk.,
Add the vinegar.,
Strain the mixture.,
Harden the plastic by freezing.",How to Make Plastic3," To make a simple and natural plastic-like substance from simple household ingredients you've probably already got in your kitchen, assemble the following:


1 cup of whole milk or heavy cream, fatter is better
Vinegar or lemon juice
Saucepan
Strainer

, In the saucepan, heat the milk gently and bring it just to a simmer. Be very careful not to boil the milk, which will ruin the reaction.








, Adding a few tablespoons at a time, stir in the vinegar with a spoon until the milk starts to separate into solids and liquids. This is basically the cheese-making process of separating and creating curds.








, Remove from heat and pour the milk through the strainer when it's cool enough to handle. The rubbery and soft stuff in the strainer is the ""milk plastic,"" called casein, an essential part of cheese-making.









By heating the milk and adding the vinegar, you started a chemical reaction that brought out the natural polymers of the milk, and made a natural plastic-like compound.

, See how your plastic stuff reacts when pinched, stretched, or dropped. If you let it sit for a while, or put it in the freezer, it will get hard.









You could also pour it into candy molds or other shapes and allow it to harden in a fun shape. If you haven't painted it already, paint it to make holiday ornaments or natural jewelry as a fun project for kids.
The plastic will be good for a few days, but has the basic shelf-life of food. Throw it away before it molds.

Deciding when you are done.,
You can then decide what to do with this rose.",How to Make Plastic Spoon Roses,", This can be any kind of candle, scented or not. You may want to make this rose outdoors because burnt plastic has a very strong and unpleasant smell.

, Hold one spoon concave down about and inch or two over the flame. When it starts to melt and wrinkle, remove it from the flame and carefully pinch it into a bud by pulling the outside edges toward each other, then snip the handle. Be mindful of the hot plastic!

, Hold spoons over the candle one at a time, concave side up. Allow the spoon to become pliable, then form the petal by pulling the tip downwards to stretch it. Leave about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of handle on the spoons. The farther away from the bud, the longer and flatter the petals should be.

, You can start on the outside by melting the handles of your longer petals together, or build off off the bud by working your way outwards. Every once in a while, put the rose over the flame to soften the bottom to adhere the petals and then lightly press the bottom of the rose against your hard surface to flatten it.

, Each rose may look a little different, some taller or shorter, wider or smaller. If you started from the bud outwards, you can stop adding petals once your rose is the size you want it.

, You can make a pin, a pendant, a wreath, or you can glue multiple roses to a globe for a unique decoration!

Weave the other end of the top strand through the loops.,
Re-place your finger on top of your first stitch.,
Tighten the stitch.,
Begin your next stitch.,
Repeat the loop/weave/tighten process.,
Finish your lanyard.",How to Make Lanyards1," You can cut them as long as you'd like, but bear in mind that with thick craft lace about 3 feet (1 m) of craft lace will yield about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of lanyard.


Thinner gimp and boondoggle laces will yield more length in the final product.
Using two different colors will be easier at first while you're learning the crown sinnet method.;
, All you need to do to find the centers is fold the strands in half until the ends are even. Then hold your thumb and finger around the centers so you don't forget where they are.








, Lay the two centers over each other on the top of your working station, arranging the strands in a plus sign.


Securing your lanyard strands at the end with a clip or keychain may make it easier to thread. Slip it onto the bottom strand and gently move it toward the center. It doesn't have to be exactly at the center right now, you can adjust it later.

, Holding one finger down on the center for the entire first stitch so that the two strands stay where they are, use your other hand to grab one end of the bottom strand. Draw it up over the center, creating a large loop. Grab the other end of the bottom strand and do the same thing.









Do not cross the strands as you draw up the loops; just make sure they both loop over the finger that's holding down the center.

, Grab one of the ends of the top strand, draw it toward the center, and simply weave it over the first loop it encounters but under the second loop.









Your two ends for the top strand should now be facing the same direction.

, Grab the other end of the top strand, draw it toward the center, and simply weave it over the first loop it encounters but under the second loop.









Make sure the strand you're weaving isn't the one you just weaved through a loop and draw it toward the center.
Note that the loop your second top strand went under is the loop your first top strand went over.

, Remove your finger from the center and place it on top of the first stitch (the two weaves you just completed). Use your finger to steady the center while you tighten the stitch.

, With your free hand (the one not holding down the stitch), gently tug on each strand in succession to tighten the stitch. You might have to go around a few times to get it tight enough.









Flip the stitch over and make sure your hook is in place. It should be directly over the ""box"" you just created. Continue tightening the stitch after you move the hook.

, Repeat what you did for the first stitch: using the same color that was the bottom strand during the first stitch, draw up two non-crossing loops again. Then, with one end of the top strand, go over the first loop and under the second one; repeat this with the other end of the top strand. Tug the strands to tighten the stitch.








, You will continue this same process until until you almost run out of lace. Stop before you run out completely, because you may need to make a final stitch to secure the end.








, How you finish the lanyard will depend on what material you're using.









If you're using a thread-based material, such as craft lace, simply cut the ends close to the lanyard and burn them with a match or secure them with crazy glue.If you're using gimp or boondoggle material, you'll need to do a finishing ""stitch."" Loosen the loops of your last stitch a bit first. Then take one of your strands and pull it through the loop of the other strand of the same color, going under the same-color strand as well as the different-colored strand beneath it. Finally, pull your strand up through the center of the lanyard. Repeat this for all four strands, pulling each strand tight when they're all through, and then trim the strands to your desired length.

Cut two equal lengths of material.,
Thread both strands through your lanyard hook.,
Secure your lanyard hook.,
Knot the strands to the hook.,
Separate your strands.,
Cross your same-color strands.,
Cross your two, middle, different-colored strands.,
Repeat this process.,
Tie a knot.",How to Make Lanyards2," Both strands should be 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 m) long, and, to easily differentiate between strands, you will probably want to choose different colors.









This method requires only two pieces of material: the ""four"" comes in when you double over the strands by threading them through your lanyard hook.

, Draw the hook up to the center of your strands by doubling the strands over until their ends line up.








, Securing your lanyard hook will make braiding easier. To secure your lanyard hook, you can hook it to a tack on a wall or a table, pinch it between your knees, or simply tape it down.









Securing your lanyard hook allows you to maintain a tight tension while you're braiding, making the process easier.

, Pull the strands together, grab them all from the bottom, twist your wrist so they create a loop together, and draw their loose ends through the loop. Maneuver the knot near your lanyard hook and continue to pull the loose ends through the loop to tighten.








, Separate the strands by their color, keeping the same-colored ones together, and holding each pair in a different hand.








, In each hand, take the strand on the right and cross it over the left. You should then have two, crossed, same-color strands in each hand.








, With your two pairs of strands in each hand, cross the two, middle, different-colored strands by bringing the left middle strand over the right middle strand.








, You will now repeat crossing the strands in each hand and crossing your middle strands until you almost run out of material. Stop before you do run out, however, because you will need to make a final stitch to secure the end.









You may now disregard the color-specific aspects of the process (which were included for clarity) because what matters is the position and sequence of the weaving.

, Just before you run out of material, as close as possible to your braid, tie a knot at the end by wrapping all four strands around your forefinger and drawing their ends through the loop (that was created around your finger). Then pull to tighten. (See the video below for more help with the modified braid.)

Cut two equal lengths of material.,
Secure your lanyard hook.,
Thread both strands through your lanyard hook.,
Pull the right-most strand.,
Pull the left-most strand.,
Tighten your braid.,
Repeat weaving.,
Finish your lanyard.",How to Make Lanyards3," You can cut it as long as you'd like, but keep in mind that the thicker your material, the smaller the length. Additionally, you should use different colors to make your lanyard look prettier and to help you differentiate between your strands as you weave.









For boondoggle, 3 to 4 yards is a good length for a beginner's lanyard., To secure your lanyard hook, you can use a push-pin on a desk or a wall, tape it down, or pinch it between your knees. The more secure, the better, as you will want to be able to tug on your strands of material throughout this process to tighten the stitching.








, Draw your lanyard hook up to the center of your strands by doubling the strands over it until their ends line up. You will need to arrange your strands so that the two halves in back are positioned to the left of the two halves in front.







, Your right most strand is one of the halves in front, so pull it around behind the two, center strands and on top of the center-left strand.







, Pull the left-most strand around behind the two, center strands and on top of the center-right strand.







, Pull your strands to tighten the weave you have just made. Your lanyard hook will need to be secure for you to do this effectively.








, Repeat the exact same process with whichever strands are in the positions designated (e.g. right-most, center, left-most). You will repeat this process until you are satisfied with the length or you almost run out of material.









Stop before you run out of material, as you will need to tie-off your end to secure your stitching.
Do not twist your strands as you bend them around behind the others, otherwise it will disrupt the diamond pattern., When you are finished, tie a granny knot using the two, uppermost strands: that is, the two strands that are higher up the braid, one of which would have been your next strand to weave.









A granny knot basically consists of two half knots: cross the strands, wrap your top strand around your back strand, and then repeat this for the ends of the half knot you've just created."

Find an appropriate mold.,
Wear the appropriate protective equipment when dealing with carbon fiber.,
Prepare the mold.,
Spray the inside with resin.",How to Make Carbon Fiber1," Before you can start making something from carbon fiber, you need to have a mold. The mold shapes the carbon fiber into the form that you want. You can buy molds online, or at other retailers. Carbon fiber parts are popular in automobile and motorcycle industries, and you can often buy molds from suppliers.In some cases, you can use the original part as a mold to make the carbon fiber part. This will not work well if the part is damaged.;
, At a minimum, you should wear protective gloves, goggles, and a face mask. This gear will help prevent the inhalation of potentially fatal fumes or the absorption of harmful solvents through the skin. In addition to the gear, work in an area that is relatively well ventilated to avoid excessive gas build up.

, Before proceeding, the mold should be sprayed with a material that allows the part to separate from the mold once it is finished. These materials are usually a specialized type of wax that does not interfere with the curing process of the part. You can order a mold lubricant online or buy one from a carbon fiber retailer.The wax is not to be confused with the resin. The wax creates a layer between the mold and the resin, and does not harden.

, For best results, make sure that all nooks and crannies of the mold are completely saturated with the resin. Depending on the size of the mold, you may need multiple cans of resin This will create the surface needed to apply the carbon fiber.Unlike the wax, the resin will harden and be removed from the mold as part of the carbon fiber piece.

"
"
Apply the fiber cloth.,
Add additional resin.,
Bag the mold.,
Heat the carbon fiber.",How to Make Carbon Fiber2," Quickly press sheets of carbon fiber cloth into the mold. As with applying the resin, make sure you completely cover all sections of the interior mold with the fiber cloth. If there are particularly small corners or angles, you may want to consider pressing the fiber cloth into the crannies with a screwdriver or other small tool., Spray the inside of the mold with more resin. The fiber cloth should be completely saturated with the resin. This is what bonds the fibers of the cloth together and gives carbon fiber its strength., To avoid dirt and dust falling into the resin and to get the fiber cloth to conform better to the mold, you can bag the mold. This means placing a bag over the mold with a vacuum attachment. Then, use a vacuum pump (or for a crude version a vacuum cleaner) to pull suction on the bag. This will also help the resin dry faster., Heating the carbon fiber part will speed up the curing process. You should heat the part to between 250 °F (121 °C) and 350 °F (177 °C) for several hours. Alternatively, you can allow the part to cure more slowly without heat. This usually takes at least 24 hours.Most resins will not cure well below 60 °F (16 °C).
You should not cure the part in a kitchen stove. The fumes given off smell terrible and they are toxic. You need an autoclave or other heat source for the curing process.

"
"
Apply at least three more layers of resin.,
Sand the top layer of resin.,
Polish the part.,
Inspect the carbon fiber part on all sides.",How to Make Carbon Fiber3," These layers of resin are intended to improve the look of the part, not the strength or functionality. Allow each layer of resin to set up before putting on the next layer. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours, but you will be able to tell because the resin will get tacky (sticky) when it is ready for the next coat., Once you have applied three to seven layers of resin, it is time to sand it. You should sand out any imperfections in the resin, like dust particles or uneven surfaces. Take care not to go through the resin, if you sand the fibers underneath you will destroy the part., After you have sanded the imperfections out of the resin, you can polish it. You can buy a polish appropriate for your resin at the same retailer that you purchased the resin. Apply the polish with a clean, soft rag, and wipe it off with another clean, soft rag. This will give the part a nice shine., Make sure that there are no cracks or other deformations on the part. If the part is damaged, you will have to start over and make another part. If you don’t see any imperfections, you can use the part.

"
Dissolve the precursor.,
Spin the polymer.,
Add oxygen.,
Pyrolyze the polymer chains.,
Treat the fibers.",How to Make Carbon Fiber4," Precursor is the material that you use to make the carbon fiber. Almost all carbon fiber is made from a polyacrylonitrile precursor. You should dissolve the polyacrylonitrile in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide., Once the precursor is dissolved, you put it in a coagulation bath. Then, run the slush through a spinneret. The material is forced through the fine holes of the spinneret to create long strands., Oxygen is needed to crosslink the polymers and make them more suitable for fibers. To oxidize the strands, heat them in an oxidation oven that ranges from 200 °C (392 °F) to 300 °C (572 °F). You must maintain appropriate airflow during this process to avoid catching the strands on fire., Once oxidized, the strands must be heated in an oxygen free environment. Since there is no oxygen, the strands will not burn. Instead, they undergo a process called pyrolysis, which removes almost all impurities, such as organic solvents. A series of pyrolysis ovens are used that range anywhere from 700 °C (1,292 °F) to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F)., Pyrolysis leaves you with carbon fiber threads. Before being shipped to customers or processing plants, the threads must be treated. This includes etching the fibers with an acid, such as nitric acid. After etching (referred to as treatment) the fiber is coated in a process called sizing. The coating increases the size of the fibers and makes them more sturdy for processing and customer use."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Combine all of the ingredients and stir together.,
Heat on medium-low.,
Pour the mixture onto foil or parchment paper.,
Allow the plastic to dry for at least two days.",How to Make Bioplastic Easily1," To make this type of bioplastic, you will need cornstarch, distilled water, glycerol, white vinegar, a stove, a saucepan, a silicone spatula, and food coloring (if desired). These items should be readily available at the grocery store or online. Glycerol is also called glycerine, so try searching for that if you’re having trouble finding glycerol.The following amounts of each ingredient are needed to make the bioplastic:10ml distilled water
0.5-1.5g glycerol
1.5g cornstarch
1ml of white vinegar
1-2 drops food coloring
Adult supervision is recommended.;
, Add all of the ingredients to the saucepan and stir to combine with the spatula. Stir until you get rid of most of the lumps in the mixture. At this stage, the mixture will be a milky white color and quite watery.If you add the wrong amounts of ingredients, just dispose of the mixture and start again.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium-low. Stir continuously as the mixture heats. Bring it to a gentle boil. As the mixture heats, it will become more translucent and begin to thicken.Remove the mixture from the heat when it becomes clear and thick.
Total heating time will be around 10-15 minutes.
Lumps may begin to form if the mixture gets overheated.
Add one-two drops of food coloring at this stage, if you would like to color the plastic.

, Spread the heated mixture onto a piece of foil or parchment paper to let it cool. If you would like to mold the plastic into a shape, it must be done while it is still warm. See the last method for details on molding the plastic.


Remove any bubbles that you see by poking them with a toothpick.

, It will take time for the plastic to dry and harden. As it cools, it will begin to dry out. Depending on the thickness of the plastic, it can take longer for it to dry. If you make one small thick piece it will take longer to dry than a thinner larger piece.Leave the plastic in a cool, dry place for this process.
Check the plastic after two days to see if it has fully hardened.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Stir together all of the ingredients.,
Heat the mixture to 95°C (203°F) or until it begins to froth.,
Pour the plastic onto a smooth surface covered with foil or parchment paper.,
Leave the plastic to harden for at least two days.",How to Make Bioplastic Easily2," To make this type of bioplastic, you will need gelatin or agar powder, glycerol, hot water, a saucepan, a stove, a spatula, and a candy thermometer. These ingredients should be readily available at your local grocery store. Remember, glycerol is also known as glycerine, so look for that if you can’t find glycerol. You will need the following amounts of each ingredient:3g (½ tsp) glycerol
12g (4 tsp) gelatin or agar
60ml (¼ cup) hot water
Food coloring (optional)
Agar is a substance derived from algae that can be used in place of gelatin to make the bioplastic vegan friendly

, Combine all of the ingredients in the saucepan and stir until there are no clumps left. You may need to use a whisk to disperse all of the clumps. Place the saucepan on the stove and start heating the mixture on medium-high heat.If you want to color your plastic, you can add a few drops of food coloring at this step.

, Put the candy thermometer into the mixture and monitor the temperature until it reaches approximately 95°C (203°F) or begins to froth. If the mixture begins to froth before it reaches temperature, that is okay. Remove it from the heat when it either reaches temperature or starts frothing.Continue to stir the mixture while it is heating up.

, After you remove the pan from the heat source, you will need to remove any excessive froth. Spoon it out before pouring the plastic out of the pan. Stir everything to remove all clumps from the plastic.


If you just want to make plastic for fun, pour the mixture out onto a smooth surface. Make sure the surface is covered with foil or parchment paper so the plastic can be removed easily.
If you want to mold the plastic into a specific shape, you will need to do it during this step. Refer to the last method on molding for more details and help.

, The amount of time it will take the plastic to harden is dependent upon how thick the piece is. Generally, it will take at least two days for it to fully dry out and harden. You can make this process go a little faster by using a blow dryer on the plastic. It’s easiest to leave the plastic undisturbed for a few days so it can dry on its own.Once the plastic hardens, it can no longer be molded or shaped. If you want to shape it, you must do it while it is still warm and moldable.

Make a mold for the plastic.,
Pour the hot plastic into the mold.,
Let the plastic dry for at least two days.,
Remove your plastic from the mold.",How to Make Bioplastic Easily3," A mold is the negative of a shape that you would like to make. You can make a cast of an object you would like to reproduce by sculpting two pieces of clay around the object. When the clay dries, remove the two pieces. If you fill each half with the liquid plastic and then put the halves together, you can make a copy of that object. You can also use a cookie cutter to cut shapes out of the plastic while it is still warm.An alternative to making your own mold, is to purchase a mold at a craft or hobby shop.

, Once you have a mold, you can use it to make more objects. While the plastic is still hot, pour it into the mold. Make sure that the plastic gets into the entire mold and try pop bubbles by lightly tapping the mold on the counter.To make the object easier to remove when it dries, coat the mold with a non-stick spray before pouring the plastic in.

, The plastic will take a few days to dry and fully harden. The amount of time it takes to dry is dependent upon the thickness of the object. If the object is very thick, it can take longer than two days to fully harden.After two days, check the plastic. If it still appears to be wet, let it sit for another day and check it again. Continue to do this until the plastic is fully dry.

, After waiting a few days, the plastic will be fully hardened and dry. At this point, you can remove the plastic from the mold. You have now made your own plastic version of whatever object you chose to mold.You can reuse this mold to make as many plastic versions of the object as you like.

Everything else is usually laying around the house. So basically, here are your ingredients: About one bag of Starbursts, a clean empty jar, white liquid glue, like Elmer's (not a glue stick), water, and a paintbrush.
, This project does involve a lot of glue so it would be a good idea to put newspaper down on the surface you're working on., It is best to unwrap them as you need them to avoid being wasteful.

Put the Starbursts in an airtight bag so you do not waste the candy. Or you can do the preferred method where you eat the candy as you go along!

, Get the paintbrush and dip it in the glue. Brush the back of the Starburst wrapper, covering all the corners. Then place the Starburst wrapper on the jar. You can put on the Starburst wrappers in any way, so they're overlapping, next to each other, or any other way.,, This is very important before you go on to the next step., This should be about one part glue and one part water. You may have to alter this so it's not too thin or thick., Once you've done so the project will look like a horrible mess, but it will look better because the glue does dry clear. When it does dry, paint another coat on. You will be repeating these two steps about five times until the final coat dries., This vase can hold pencils, flowers or anything else. This is also just good for decoration. Remember you can do this with just about anything you want to do with it, not just a vase or jar."

Get your materials.,
Drill a hole in the bottle.,
Insert one of the male hose adapters.,
Cut the bottle.,
Put the hose adapters in the ball valve.,
Cut and attach the tubing.",How to Make a Siphon1," For this project, you'll need: at least 10' of 5/8"" by 7/8"" vinyl tubing, an empty clear plastic bottle, a 1/2"" ball valve, three 1/2"" male hose adapters, and plumber's tape.


You can always use more than 10' of 5/8"" by 7/8"" vinyl tubing if you need your siphon to be longer than 10'.
These can all be found in a hardware store, usually the irrigation section.
You'll also need scissors, a wrench, and a lighter.;
, First, take off any labels on the plastic bottle. Wash it out if it had something besides water in it. Drill a 3/4"" hole in the cap of the bottle. The easiest way to do this is with the cap still on the bottle, tightly screwed., Stick the thick end of one of the 1/2"" male hose adapters in the hole you drilled in the cap.








, Use scissors to cut off approximately two inches of the bottom of the bottle. Use a lighter to heat up the edges of the cut. Just run the flame along the edge to strengthen the plastic.








, First, wrap a few layers of plumber's tape around the thick ends of the remaining two 1/2"" male hose adapters. Then thread them into both ends of the ball valve. Use a wrench to make them tight.








, Use your scissors to cut 3' to 4' of tubing. Attach one end of this 3' to 4' tube to the male hose adapter connected to the bottle, and attach the other end to one of the male hose adapters on the ball valve. Attach one end of the remaining tubing to the last male hose adapter.








The function of the ball valve is to give you the ability to stop and start the siphoning without having to put your mouth back on the tube that's been in dirty water.

Put the larger tube over the smaller one.,
Blow into the excess tube.",How to Make a Siphon2," To siphon your homebrewed beer, or other beverage, from one container to another you need: a rubber sink stopper anywhere from 1 and 1/8th inch to 1 and 1/4 inch in diameter, 2 feet (0.61 m) of 1/4th inch tubing, three feet of 3/8th inch tubing, scissors, and a drill or a dremel.You need to have a drill bit that's smaller than 1/4th of an inch.
The rubber sink stopper needs to be the kind that's concave or hollow on the side that goes into the sink, not solid.

, Drill two holes in the sink stopper. The holes should be on either side of the small bump used to pull the sink stopper out of the sink. They should be as close to this bump and as vertically aligned with each other as possible.

, Stick the smaller tube through one of the holes. Place the sink stopper on the opening of the bottle you're siphoning into, and run the tube down to the bottom of the bottle.


If the tube doesn't fit in the hole, you can drill it a little bit bigger, but be careful. Don't make it any bigger than necessary. You want the tube to fit in very snugly, and airtight.

, Now you want to cut the tube you just placed in the bottle through the hole in the stopper. Cut it about two inches from where it comes out of the hole. Don't throw away the excess tubing.

, Run the left over tubing that you cut off into the other hole, about one inch in.

, Fit the larger tube over the smaller tube, the one that reaches the bottom of the bottle. Fit about 2 inches of the larger tube over the smaller one so it won't slip off.

, To siphon, place the sink stopper over the rim of the bottle with the brew in it. Place the other end of the long tube into the container you're siphoning into. Blow into the excess tube. This will start the siphoning."

, Stick the sharp end of the straw you just cut into the end of the other straw. It should go into the end that's closest to the bend. Fit it in far enough so that it doesn't slip out.

, Tape around where the two straws are connected. Use plenty of tape, as you want the seal to be air tight.

, Place either end of the newly created double-length bendy straw into the container with liquid in it. Make sure it's in far enough that the bend is submerged in the liquid.

, Put your finger over the top of the straw. Begin lifting the straw out of the container. You'll see the liquid come up into the straw as you lift it. While keeping your finger over the end of the straw, place that end into the container you're siphoning into. Once it's in there, remove your finger.

Begin with a square sheet.In the vast majority of cases, the most accessible plastic bag will be a shopping bag.,
Triple fold the square and cut it into a circle.First fold the square diagonally so that it becomes a triangle.,
Make six marks around the circle.Use a compass protractor and mark dots 60 degrees apart from each other.,
Tape the marks.Taping over your marks will make the holes sturdier.,
Punch holes through marks with a nail.Take a nail and push through your assigned marks.",How to Make a Plastic Bag Parachute1," These are extremely common place, and large enough to pick up air. First cut the bag so that it can lay flat on a surface. Next, using scissors or a precision knife, cut the largest square you can from the material.


The larger your parachute, the slower it will fall.;
, Next, fold the triangle in half using one of the long ends as the divider. This should result in a much thinner triangle. Repeat the same fold to your thin triangle. Once you have your third fold, cut the wide end off with scissors. This will cut all the degrees of the circumference at once. Once you have accomplished this, unfold the plastic to reveal your circle.









Alternatively, you can cut the corners off the square to make an octagon shape. Any additional amount of angles is good; what's important is that it starts to resemble a circle., You should make marks with permanent marker to ensure the highest visibility. These marks will ultimately become the holes for your parachute strings.









Six marks is optimal because it allows for the parachute to hold its shape and isn't overly complicated.

, Take a small square for each hole from a roll of paper tape and run it over the top and bottom of the hole. Because the tape holds its form better than the bag will, it will give you an easier time when it comes to stringing up the parachute.








, Because the plastic is fairly fragile, you won't need much force to do this. Hold up the bag and push it gently through. If the nail you're using is large, don't push it through all the way. The parachute holes should be just big enough for the strings to fit through.

Make a small hole in the parachute's center to make it fall straighter.Punching a small hole in the center of your parachute will guide the air through the center.,
Wrap the string around the screw when storing your parachute.The strings on your parachute will knot easily if you don't store it in the right way.",How to Make a Plastic Bag Parachute2," Cut out six equal pieces of string. The string should be thin enough to fit through the holes you created in the plastic bag.


A foot of string should suffice, provided the parachute is the size of a regular shopping bag.
It's a good idea to place the strings up against one another to ensure they're the same length. When you prop them up all in a row, you can cut off parts of any string that protrude from the rest.

, Run each piece of string through their respective holes and tie them each in a small knot on the parachute's roof. When you are done, each of the taped holes you made should be filled with their own string.









Try to keep your knots consistent. Different knots may result in different lengths for the strings.

, In order to secure these strings, fix a nut on the screw and turn it around until the strings are caught in the middle. This screw will give your parachute some much-needed weight to work with.








, Because you'll be throwing your parachute up in the sky, adorn the parachute with eye-grabbing colours. Detailed designs won't be picked up by the human eye from a distance, so it's best to keep your decorations simple. Coloured marker is perfect for decorating your parachute.








, Alternatively, you can throw the screw high in the air. The parachute will catch air and slow the descent.









Dropping it down from a higher altitude will give the parachute more time in the air.

, This has the effect of straightening your parachute's descent. If you don't have a hole, it will be much more likely to float off course. Straightening the parachute is ultimately optional, but it is valid to keep in mind if you're dissatisfied with the way your parachute is gliding.









The marks should be placed a centimetre into the plastic bag from the outer perimeter.

, Take the strings and wrap them around the screw weight. When the strings are secured, you can fold in the plastic bag. Take care to treat the parachute gently; any rips or tears could ruin the parachute completely.









If you do end up ripping par of the parachute, you may be able to save it by taping the rip shut. The parachute won't likely work as well as it used to, but it should be able to pick up air all the same.

, Cheap welding goggles can be found online or at most home improvement stores. If possible, select a pair that at least has removable lenses, detachable straps, and a top that can be unscrewed. The goggles should be separated into as many pieces as possible.

, If the lenses pop out completely, this step is not necessary. If the lenses are still held together by plastic, however, the plastic will need to be painted along with the outer rim or base. To protect the lenses from getting paint on them, cover the inside and outside with painter's tape or masking tape.

, To create steampunk goggles with an antique or worn appearance, you will need to apply several coats of different metallic colors. Start by applying a silver or nickel metallic finish to the base section or body of the goggles. Use a dull finish, rather than a shiny one, to create an old-style look. Apply the finish with a cotton swab or cheap paintbrush. Let dry.

, The lens piece or lens pieces should be a different color than the body. Consider using a dull copper finish, applying it to the pieces with a clean paintbrush or cotton swab. If there are other pieces, such as buttons that go on the side of the body, paint these a different color, as well. You can either use the same dull copper finish used for the lens piece or you can use a dull gold finish. Let dry.

, Paint over any piece that you painted copper or bronze with a copper patina paint. The paint should look brown or greenish-brown. If there are ridges or raised portions of the area being painted, apply the patina paint to the crevices in between the raised portions; otherwise, apply it around the entire area. Do not paint a solid layer of patina over the finish. Instead, dab it on using a painting sponge or apply some over the area before rubbing some off with a wrinkled paper towel.


A patina is a type of film that that appears over the surface of bronze and copper over time due to oxidation of the metal.






This gives you the aged effect to the goggles.







, If you painted any pieces with gold finish, make those pieces look aged by making the gold look worn. Even though gold does not corrode, many pieces are made with gold leaf to save on cost, and gold leaf eventually wears off over time. To create the appearance of scratched gold leaf, apply a pewter or dull silver paint along the edges or raised portions of the gold pieces.

You could use old or damaged jewelries to add as ornaments if you can't find a gold leaf. just paint it and attached it later to the sides of the goggles.







, Once all the paint has dried, put the goggles back together. Remove the tape from the lenses or pop them back in place if they were completely removed. Leave the strap or band off the goggles.

, Random gears of various shapes and sizes are the standard embellishment of choice, but you can also use a variety of other objects, like custom pieces crafted with polymer clay, animals or objects from old Lego sets, or Victorian-style brooches and small cameos. The idea is to select pieces that either look Victorian in style or that look very industrial in nature. If these pieces already have an antique look to them, nothing more needs to be done. If not, you may want to paint them with dull metallic finishes so that they match the worn style of your goggles.

, Use super glue or a hot glue gun. It does not matter much where you glue them, but generally, the pieces should be kept off the lenses and on the body of the goggles or in between the lenses on a solid lens piece.

Add broken watch gears to give detail and add an industrial look.







, If desired, you can further embellish your steampunk goggles by attaching a clip on lens or detachable loupe set to the front of your goggles. The screw of the loupe set should be positioned in between the lenses, pointing outward, so that the lenses of the loupe set can be spun in front of the lenses of your goggles. Adhere the clip-on loupe set in place with hot glue or super glue.


Using a broken element of a camera lens, glue them together with other embellishments.







, Once all the paint and glue has finished drying, the goggles are ready to be worn and admired.

, The belt should be thin enough to slide into the strap holders. Ideally, if you want your goggles to have a worn appearance, the belt will also look worn or distressed. Cut the belt into three parts, removing a large portion of the middle section and making sure that the buckled section and holed section are large enough to wrap around your head.

, If the belt is too thin and will not stay on its own, you may need to use a few dots of superglue to keep it in place.

,


Admire your one of a kind steampunk goggles!

Clean your steel or iron thoroughly.,
Apply the acid solution.,
Allow the metal to rust.,
Finished.

",How to Make Metal Rust1," Only metals containing iron will rust, and some iron alloys will rust slowly or not at all. Stainless steel, an alloy of iron and chromium, will be very difficult to rust. Cast iron or wrought iron will rust most easily.;
, Hydrochloric acid is readily available in low concentrations at hardware stores, often labeled as muriatic acid. Handling it carefully, pour about 2 ounces (60 ml) into a sturdy plastic bottle. You should wear rubber gloves and safety glasses when doing this., Dissolving copper into the acid solution creates a wash that will speed the rusting process. The best way to dissolve copper in the acid is to wrap a short length of copper wire into a coil and submerge it in the acid for about a week.


When leaving the copper to soak, do not cap the bottle tightly. The gases produced during the chemical reaction will cause pressure to build inside the bottle. Also, make sure to clearly label the bottle and store it out of reach of children or pets.
Copper coins can be used as well. Make sure the coin's content is largely copper; for instance, United States pennies made after 1982 are only 2.5 percent copper. However, pennies made before 1982 are 95 percent copper.

, After some of the copper has dissolved into the acid, put on protective gloves and carefully remove the the copper from the solution. Once you have taken it out of the solution, you can discard it. Dilute the acid with water in a ratio of roughly 1 part acid to 50 parts water. If you used 2 ounces (60 ml) of hydrochloric acid, you should mix it with about a gallon (3.8 L) of water., The acid and copper solution will work best when the metal is very clean. There are commercially available products designed for cleaning scale or corrosion from metal, but a wash and rinse with soap and water will generally be sufficient.

, Apply a light layer of the solution to the metal and allow it to air dry. The acid can be applied with a spray bottle or paint brush, although the acid will quickly deteriorate any metal components of the spray bottle. Wear protective gloves and safety glasses when applying the acid solution, and work in a well-ventilated area, preferably outdoors.

, Within an hour, you should see noticeable rusting on the metal. You do not need to wipe or rinse away the acid wash; it will dissipate naturally. If you desire a heavier layer of rust, apply another wash of the acid solution.

Select a well-ventilated area to work in.,
Transfer the peroxide to a spray bottle.,
Sprinkle salt onto the piece of metal.,
Let the metal piece air dry.,
Experiment with this method.",How to Make Metal Rust2," Peroxide can be dangerous if too much is inhaled at a time. Choose a piece of metal that is either iron or tin--both will work with this method.

, The spray bottle will make it much easier to apply to your metal. Spray your piece of metal with a sizeable amount of peroxide. Spraying more peroxide will help to speed up the rusting process., You should do this while the peroxide is still wet. The rusting process will begin almost immediately and is actually easy to see. You can pour on more or less salt depending on how thick or crusty you want the rust to be., Let your metal air dry. If you wipe of the salt while the peroxide is still wet, you will disrupt the rusting process and cause your rust to come out blotchy. Once dry, rub the salt off and admire your work.

, While you have just read about the basic way you can use peroxide and salt to cause metal to rust, the sky is really the limit when it comes to this technique. Rub the salt off and then spray the piece with peroxide again. Try different amounts of salt or dip your metal into water once it has dried. The water will give the rust a smoother texture.

Cut the wire.,
Thread one button with wire.,
Twist the wire ends.,
Glue the fabric over each wire end.,
Trim the ends.,
Repeat with the other button.,
Wear the cufflinks.",How to Make Cufflinks1," Use wire cutters to snip off two 4-inch (10-cm) lengths of 20-gauge craft wire.

You can use a different wire gauge, if desired, but it must be thin enough to bend without pliers.
If you don't have any craft wire available, try unfolding two small, uncoated paperclips and using them, instead.;
, Insert one of your wire pieces through the hole on the back of a small shank button.

You'll need to use two shank buttons for this project. Ideally, the two buttons should match. Choose buttons with a design you like since the decorative face of the button will show.
Check the size of the buttons, too. The buttons themselves must be able to slide in and out of standard sleeve buttonholes. The holes on the back of each button must be wide enough for the craft wire to fit through.

, Once the wire is halfway through the hold on the back of the button, fold it in half and twist the ends together once or twice.

This secures the button in place at the center of your wire.
Note that the two wire ends should still be separate and distinct beneath the twist.

, Place one scrap of fabric, wrong-side up, beneath one wire end. Lay a thin line of glue over the fabric and alongside the wire, then fold the fabric over to cover the wire.

Fray-resistant fabric works best, but most medium to heavy weight materials can be used.
Repeat with the other wire end. Note that you should use matching or coordinating fabric scraps.
Let the glue dry before continuing.

, After the glue dries, trim away any excess wire and fabric.

Use wire cutters to trim the length of each wire end to approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm).
Use scissors to trim down the width of the fabric. Cut away all fabric that lies to the outside of the glue seal.

, Create a matching cufflink with your second button and second length of wire. Follow the same steps used to complete the first cufflink.

Check the fabric after you complete both cufflinks. If the material starts fraying, you can apply a little seam sealant to the raw edges.

, Insert the wire ends of one cufflink through the buttonhole of one sleeve. Bend the covered wire ends back in opposite directions to hold the cufflink in place.

Repeat with the second cufflink and the second sleeve.

Sand the edges.,
Buff the knuckle dusters.,

Try them on.",How to Make Brass Knuckles," Use your favorite Internet search engine to find photographs of traditional knuckle dusters. Choose the best image and save it for use as a reference.


The image you choose should clearly show the front side of the knuckle duster by itself. This image does not need to be to scale, but it should show an accurate outline.
If you've memorized the way knuckle dusters look, you don't need to use a reference photograph. You can skip this step and move onto the next one if you feel comfortable doing so.;
, Using your reference image as a guide, sketch the design of your knuckle duster onto standard paper. You'll need to draw your design to scale, so it needs to be big enough to fit over your hand.


For an average adult male's hand, the distance between the bottom of the middle finger holes and the bottom of the handle should be between 1.18 and 1.38 inches (30 and 35 mm).
Each finger hole should be between 0.98 and 1.06 inches (25 and 27 mm). Instead of making perfect circles, try to make the holes slightly oval in shape.
After sketching your design on paper, carefully cut it out. Cut around the perimeter of the design and cut out the holes, as well.

, Tape the paper design onto the metal you plan to use. Use permanent marker to trace around the paper and create an outline on the metal.


You may want to trace the design onto the metal using pencil first. Doing so will allow you to correct any mistakes you make. Afterward, though, you should still trace over the same outline in permanent marker.
After transferring the design to the metal, you can remove the paper pattern.
Note that 2024 or 7075 aluminum, 1/4 to 1/2 inch (7 to 12mm) thick, will be the easiest to find and work with. You can use actual brass measuring the same thickness, but the metal may give you more difficulties.

, Before you begin cutting into the metal, put on a pair of safety goggles.


Since the metal will be tough to work through, there is some risk that a drill bit may snap off in the middle of the process. That bit could be hurdled toward your eyes and may cause injury if you leave your eyes unprotected.

, Attach a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) drill bit to a power drill, then drill along the entire outline on your metal.Drill along the perimeter of the overall design and around the perimeter of each hole you intend to make.
The drill holes should be close but distinct. As a general rule, leave no more than half the diameter of the drill hole, roughly 1/16 inch (1.6 mm), in between separate holes. Do not overlap the holes since doing so may cause the bit to slip.
Also note that you should use a corded power drill instead of a cordless one, if possible. A cordless power drill will be more likely to overheat, so you may need to take more breaks as you drill if you choose to use one.

, Place the tip of a flathead screwdriver on the metal in between separate holes, then use a hammer to strike the base of the screwdriver. Continue striking the screwdriver with the hammer until it breaks off the remaining metal.


You'll need to repeat this around the entire pattern, breaking off the metal bridges in between drill holes one at at time. Punch around all of the previously made drill holes, including all exterior and interior ones. You may need to punch from both the back and front of the design.
This part of the process can be very time consuming and will require plenty of physical strength.
Note that you can cut the outside edge off in pieces using a hacksaw if you feel confident in your ability to control the direction of the machine around curved edges,but doing so is not necessary. You can punch the entire thing out using nothing but the hammer and screwdriver.

, After you've punched through the drill holes, you should be able to push the knuckle duster form out of the metal block using nothing but your fingers.


At the completion of this step, you should be able to see the clearly defined knuckle duster shape. The edges will still be very rough, however, so handle the piece carefully.
Recycle or otherwise reuse the remaining metal. It is no longer needed for the rest of this project.

, Use a Dremel-style rotary tool to smooth down the rough edges of the metal. Make sure that the tool has been fitted with a round bit designed for use with soft metal.If you inspect the edges of the knuckle duster, you should notice the presence of harsh grooves. The dip of each groove comes from the original drill holes you made, and the point corresponds with the punched-out space in between those holes.
Focus the bit of the Dremel tool over the point of each groove. Sand down the point until it feels smooth and blends into the dip of the grooves around it.
If you have difficulty filing down the edges, hold the knuckle duster in a vise grip as you work. Wedge a piece of paper or cloth in between the metal and the teeth of the grip to prevent the metal from getting scratched.

, Once most of the metal grooves have been filed down, you can use metal files to make the edges even smoother.


Use a round file to work on the grooves inside each finger hole and a triangle file to help create the notches in between the finger holes from the outside. You can use a flat file to work on the remainder of the outer edge.
You can technically file down the entire knuckle duster without using a Dremel tool as long as you use these files to do it. Smoothing down the edges will be much more time consuming without the use of power tools, however, so it is not recommended.
As before, you can hold the knuckle duster using a vice grip as you continue to file down the edges.

, Even though the edges should look notably more rounded after you finish filing them, you should still make them even smoother by grinding them down with sandpaper.


You can sand the edges by hand. You do not need to use a sanding belt or other power tool for this part of the process.
Work in steps. Start with a large grit sandpaper, like 60 or 80 grit, and work around the edges until you're satisfied with the results. Gradually work through different grits in this manner until you reach a fine grit like 320 or 400.
If desired, you can finish the sanding with fine grit wet/dry sandpaper. Doing so is only optional, though, and may not be needed if the edge already seems smooth enough.

, Grab a pad of #00 steel wool and buff the surface of the metal, working in small, circular motions. Work your way around the entire surface on both sides of the piece.


You can buff over the edges, too, but doing so shouldn't be necessary at this point. Focus your energy and attention on buffing the flat metal surfaces during this step.
When finished, the metal should appear less dull and more polished.

, Spray or wipe metal cleaner over the entire piece, working over the flat surfaces and the edges.


You can use either metal cleaner or metal polish. Either way, make sure that the product you choose is approved for use with aluminum so that you do not accidentally tarnish or otherwise damage the metal.
Thoroughly work the product into the metal. Continue polishing and shining with a soft cloth until the surface of the metal is no longer moist from the cleaning spray.

, At this point, the knuckle dusters should be complete and ready to wear. Put them on and see how well they fit.


Your fingers should fit comfortably into the finger holes and your hand should be able to bend over the base of the knuckle duster while it's on.
You won't be able to make any changes to the piece if it is too loose, but if it feels too snug, you might be able to widen the finger holes slightly depending on how thick you left the metal around each hole. If you do make any changes, it is best to do so by filing the metal down with a Dremel tool or file instead of attempting to punch or saw it away.

Choose two sets of buttons.,
Separate a few chain links.,
Attach a large and small button to the chain.,
Repeat for the other cufflink.,
Wear the cufflinks.",How to Make Cufflinks2," You will need two large shank buttons and two small shank buttons. Both large buttons should match each other. Likewise, both small buttons should match each other, too.

The small buttons should be small enough to fit snugly through standard sleeve buttonholes.
On the other hand, the large buttons will work better if they are too large to fit through average buttonholes.

, Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to separate one to three links from a standard metal chain.

The right number of chain links will depend upon the thickness of the chain. You need to separate a section that is just long enough to fit through the thickness created by a folded shirt cuff.
If you don't have excess chain to work with, you can use a small jump ring or piece of elastic hair tie, instead.

, Open one link of the detached chain and slip it into the hole on the back of one large button. Open the link on the opposite end of the chain and slip it into the hold on the back of one small button.

Close both chain links to complete your first cufflink.
If using a single link of chain or jump ring, you'll need to open the ring and insert it through the holes on both the small and large button.
If using elastic hair ties, cut the hair tie and insert it through the holes of both the small and large button. Knot the hair tie so that it is roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) away from both buttons, then trim away the excess elastic., Follow the same steps to create a second cufflink from the remaining small and large button.

Use the same number of chain links for both cufflinks.
The two cufflinks should be identical when finished.

, To put one cufflink on, slide the smaller button through the buttonhole of one sleeve. The decorative faces of both buttons should be visible from either side of the buttonhole.

Put the second cufflink on your other sleeve in the same manner.

Glue one embellishment to one cufflink back.,
Repeat.,
Wear the cufflinks.",How to Make Cufflinks3," You'll need two matching embellishments, both with flat backs that are roughly the same shape and size as the flat surface of your cufflink backs.

Most cufflink findings have square or circular flat backs measuring approximately 0.4 inch (10 mm). For cufflink backs of this size, the flat back of your embellishment should be between 0.4 and 0.8 inch (10 to 20 mm).
Popular options worth considering include small Lego bricks, flat-back metal charms, coins, non-shank buttons, and polymer clay charms.
If you're feeling especially crafty, you can even layer together thin flat embellishments, like watch cog.

, If you want the embellishments to match the cufflink backs, spray paint them an appropriate metallic color. Let the paint dry before continuing.

This is only optional, of course. It isn't necessary if the embellishments already match the cufflinks. Even if they don't match, you can still leave the original color to create cufflinks with a more informal appearance.

, Apply a dot of hot glue to the flat surface of the cufflink back. Quickly center the flat back of the embellishment over the cufflink and press it into the glue.

Allow the glue to cool and dry completely before handling the cufflink.
Note that superglue could be used instead of hot glue, if desired.
If layering cogs or other thin, flat objects, apply a dot of glue to the cufflink back and press the largest piece on top. Give it a few seconds to dry, then apply another layer of glue on top before pressing the next piece into that. Repeat as needed to create the desired effect., Glue the second embellishment onto the second cufflink in the same manner.

When finished, you should have two nearly identical cufflinks.

, To put the cufflinks on, simply insert the stem of each cufflink into the buttonholes of each sleeve."

Glue both glass tiles onto the paper.,
Allow the glue to dry.,
Trim away the excess paper.,
Glue one tile onto each cufflink blank.,
Let the glue dry completely.,
Wear the cufflinks.",How to Make Cufflinks4," You'll need to use cardstock weight paper for this project. Choose a ready-made design or print one from the computer.

Grab some scrapbook paper with an appealing design for a simple option.
Alternatively, you can print a special design, set of text, or photograph to use for your cufflinks. Make sure that the part of the design you want to use has been resized to match the dimensions of your cufflink blanks and glass tiles.
If you print a design from an inkjet printer, allow the ink to dry for at least an hour before continuing.

, Apply a dab of clear-drying craft glue onto the center of your chosen design, then firmly press the back of the glass tile into the glue.

To ensure even adhesion, use a paintbrush to spread the glue over the entire surface of the design before pressing the glass tile on top.
Continue pressing down on the glass tile until you can see the full design through it.
Readjust the placement as needed to center the tile over the design, and carefully shift the tile around to pop any air bubbles that appear in between the glass and the paper.

, Let the glue dry completely before attempting to handle the glass tile further.

If the moisture of the glue causes the paper to start bubbling up during the first few minutes, firmly press down on the tile for one to two minutes to smooth it out.
You will need to wait at least four hours for the glue to dry, but waiting overnight would be an even safer option. The glue should be completely dry when ready.

, Use scissors to cut the excess paper from around the glass tiles, trimming it as close to the edges as possible.

If you have trouble getting close to the tile using scissors, consider using a craft blade.
After you think you've cut away enough paper, try placing the tile paper-side down into the indentation of the cufflink blank. If it doesn't fit, trim away more paper and try again.

, Spread a small dot of craft glue into the inside indentation of the cufflink blank, then firmly press the paper-side of the tile on top of it. Repeat with the second cufflink.

As before, place a dab of glue into the center of the cufflink blank and spread it around with a paintbrush.
If some of the glue squeezes out over the sides of the tile when you press the pieces together, simply wipe the glue away with your fingers or a damp paper towel.

, Allow the glue to dry for at least four hours before handling the cufflinks.

To exercise even more caution, wait overnight before using the cufflinks.

, Simply insert the foot of each cufflink through the buttonholes of each sleeve to put them both on."

Visualize, also, the entire fabrication process that will give you the awesome metal flower you visualize. Consider also any jigs you might use if you really like your finished flower and want to make more. Jigs for individual flower parts like petals and leaf forms might be a good investment. They will certainly save time.

, Use heavy gauge sheet metal for the petals and leaves and a metal rod anywhere from 3/16"" to 5/16"" for the stem. You will need a fastening method/tool for piecing the flower together, perhaps a welder. The forge used for flower-shaping can be a propane forge or a coal forge. You'll also need an anvil with a horn, a cross peen hammer or swage block, a ball peen hammer, a vice, channel locks, needle nose pliers and a jigsaw with metal-cutting blades.

, Layout out some petal plates with four and five petals in a star configuration. These should have the same radius all the way around. Use anywhere from three to six of these petal plates for one flower depending on the steel thickness. A star with thin stems can be made as a bottom piece bent downward as sepals.


Drill a hole in each petal plate with a diameter 1/4"" larger than the stem.
Cut the petal plates with a jigsaw . Leave at least 3/8"" between the petal cuts to the hole in the middle.

, Leaves aren't necessary, but make the flower seem that much more realistic. Draw and cut the general shape of the leaf. It should be at least a 1' long and 1/4' inch wide.

, Heat the flower parts in your forge. Don't let any of them get hotter than an orange heat. Hotter might cause the metal to melt and you want to avoid phase changes of the metal.


Detail a leaf with the cross-peen hammer, making a ridge from the tip to the stem. Add light radial ridges for scratch detailing. Flatten the stem end with the flat face (peen) of the ball-peen hammer. This will enable the leaf stem to wrap around the flower stem (rod).
Use the ball peen hammer to make shallow bowls out of each petal plate.
Rough up the flower stem a bit while it's hot for a realistic look.

,


One at a time, heat a leaf stem and bend the edges around the flower stem. This can be faggot welded onto the stem using a wire feed welder.
Weld each individual flower petal plate onto the flower stem, starting with the bottom one. Alternatively you can upset the stem while all of the petals are in place. If you use the latter method, rivet the top over the last petal plate. Welding is preferred, but if you don't have a welder these welds might be hard to do with forge welding.

, Heat the entire assembled flower. Bend the petals upwards and curve each into the middle using a pair of needle nose pliers. Do this plate by plate in one direction around the stem. You should only do two petals per heat to avoid creating stresses and fractures.


You can leave the flower as a bud. For a full-flower look, bend the petals outward.

, A wire brush finish leave a shiny, bumpy edge, which is a favorite. You can leave the metal scale finish, which is usually flat gray with some oxidation effects, or grind off the scale using a belt grinder. This needs to be done to at least a 400 grit for a nice shine. Note that you won't be able to get into the inside of the flower.

Get a piece of silver paper, cloth, etc.,
Glue it to a piece of wood or stiff paper.,
Get a sheet of glass and put over the paper/cloth.,
Design an appealing frame.",How to Make a Mirror1," Something that's rather shiny and reflective. Cut it to the size you need. Aluminum foil works well for a prop-like mirror.;
, Whatever type of glue you use, make sure you can spread it on evenly. Be careful if you're using a hot glue gun -- burning yourself with glue isn't a fun part of a DIY project.

, This top layer makes it look a lot more professional and keeps the mirror from getting damaged or torn. The glass on a cheap frame is ideal for this step.

, This could be cardstock, cardboard, fabric, or any material that can form a border. Add glitter, ribbons, beads, or any embellishment you have available.


The easiest way is to use a real frame and spruce it up how you like. Find a cheap one and spray paint it, paper mache, or otherwise make it your own.

"

Take a block of steel and cut it.,
Polish it.,
Cut the mirror to the desired shape and size.,
Add a nice trim.",How to Make a Mirror2," This requires tools and a good deal of know-how, so if you only have one or neither, a different method is your best bet.


Or make do with the shape it's in, of course. You can always cover the edges if you don't like it's actual size or shape.

, You can either use a professional polish or raid the oil and flour from your kitchen. Either way, don't skip this step! It'll make your mirror much shinier and better looking.

, Keep in mind its weight and mobility when you decide on how big or small to make it.

, And you're done with the mirror! Pictured are sequins to make a bird design, but let your creativity flow. You could attach fabric, beads, ribbons, or any other material you have at your disposal.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out your images and spread the fronts with glue.,
Place the images in a pleasing arrangement on the back of your glass.,
Go outside and spray paint away.,
Put the glass back in your frame.",How to Make a Mirror3," It will be easier if you have everything ready and a space cleared. You'll need:

A frame with glass






Copied images you like






Krylon looking glass spray paint






Paintbrush






Scissors






White glue







, Yep, the fronts. You'll be adhering the pretty side of the images to the front of the glass. This is easiest if you put the glue in a plastic bowl and use a paintbrush to spread. It needs to be a thin, even layer.


Don't use too much glue! If anything, use too little. You don't want globs of glue all over your mirror. When you're applying the glue, place an old newspaper down on your surface -- you also don't want glue all over your table.







, If it wasn't clear, remove the glass from the frame to do this. Make sure the glass is clean before you apply the images! Just wipe it down with a bit of glass cleaner and a clean cloth.

, The smell is quite intoxicating (literally), so you'll want to be outside in an open area. Apply several layers and spray as evenly as possible.


Let it dry for 15 minutes. After the time is up, flip it over and see what it looks like underneath! If you're unhappy with the results, apply some more spray.







, Reinsert the back and secure all the sides. Ta da! Hang on a wall or display on a shelf.

Alternatively, you can try to trace out the shapes of the parts using pencil and paper..
Cut out each part of the sunglasses from your paper template, leaving room to attach the earpieces.
Make sure to include eye-holes in the area where they should be present.

, Using glue, attach the arms to the frame. Be careful not to use too much glue, or it might soak the cardboard and make it too soft.

, On a sheet of acetate, use the cut-outs you made earlier when you cut the eye-holes to trace out the shapes of the lenses. Cut the shapes of the lenses out of the acetate sheet, leaving a little extra around the edges.


Acetate is a type of plastic. The type used here comes in sheets and is used as a thin plastic over in photo albums or presentation booklets. You can buy it at any office supply or craft store.

, Using any color you like, paint the frame. Acrylic paint is best for this, but if you don't have any, watercolors will do.

, Using a little glue, attach the acetate cut-outs to the frame. Again, you don't want to be heavy handed with the glue or you'll risk softening the cardboard too much.

Make the lenses.",How to Make Sunglasses3," Heat your oven to about 400 °F (204 °C). Put a pan containing the plastic in the oven and heat it until it is completely melted.


Parental supervision is suggested
Make sure the plastic is in a pan large enough to support the melted goop.

, Allow the plastic to cool enough that it is still pliable. Do not let it harden.

, Carefully shape the plastic into sunglasses with eye-holes. This allows you to fit the accessory to your head quite well.

, Cut off the earpieces in a shape like this. _/\_ Then, drill small holes in the ends of the shapes /\ and \/. Finally, screw on the earpieces to the main plastic part of the sunglasses.

Apply mineral oil and buff with beeswax.,
Pop the lenses into the frames.",How to Make Sunglasses4," Take apart a pair of cheap sunglasses and use the parts to create a templatefor your wooden sunglasses. An easy way to do this is to lay each part on a photocopier and make a copy.


Alternatively, you can try to trace out the shapes of the parts using pencil and paper.
Cut out each part of the sunglasses from your paper template.
Also keep the lenses from the cheap sunglasses to use in your new wooden pair. Remove them by pushing them gently out.

, Each block of wood should be approximately the length of the cheap sunglasses. Don't worry about depth, as you'll need a margin of error.

, It's quickest to use a scroll saw or some other powered saw for this. However, you can use a coping saw to do it by hand. It will take longer, however.

, Place the lenses on top of the openings where they should go and trace their shape with a sharp pencil. Use a drum sander attachment in a drill press to sand near, but not over the lines you just traced. You could also probably do this with a rotary tool with a drum sander attached. The reason you are doing this is to leave a groove for the lenses to sit.

, Make sure you don't cut too much away. Next, observe the curvature of the original frame, and attempt to copy it on your wooden one. You can use a drum sander attachment on a drill press to do this, or a rotary tool with the appropriate attachment.


At this time, you'll also want to sand down the frame and the earpieces until they are smooth. You can do this using a combination of a rotary tool, wood files, and sandpaper.

, For this, you can cut away the hinges from the cheap sunglasses you've been using. You can also cannibalize the hinges from another pair that no one wants.


Cut away little cavities approximately in the shape of your hinges in the frame and earpieces.
Then glue the hinges into place. You'll need to use clamps to hold them in place while the glue sets. Leave the clamps on for about an hour.Attach the earpieces to the frame using the screws that came with the hinges.

, With a piece of cloth, apply a coat of mineral oil to the wooden frame. This is helpful because of the amount of time the frame will be in contact with the skin. Finally, buff the frame with beeswax for a smooth finish.

, The final step is to snap in the lenses for the last time. Don't force them in, or you might break them. Simply push gently until the lenses pop into position.

Make sure you have access to plenty of steel and a furnace.,
Have essential materials such as a black smiths hammer, anvil, tongs, gloves, and a pair of clear safety classes.

,Cut steel to roughly 2 1⁄2 feet (0.8 m) - 3 1⁄2 feet (1.1 m)

,
Plan out where the tang (hilt), tip, and edge of sword will be.

,
Preheat the furnace until at a steady temperature.

,
When setting metal into furnace, DO NOT put metal directly in front of flame as it will cause uneven heat distribution and will cause the blade to have later defaults.

,
When the metals color changes to a bright orange or slight yellow color take out with tongs and begin to hammer the bottom of the metal where you wanted your hilt to be until it is almost squished until it begins to look like the end of a file with the handle missing (do this process slowly and evenly, as it is one of the most critical parts of the blade).

,
When hilt section is mostly done, begin to hammer ONE half of metal for the edge.,
When the hilt and mid section of the blade is complete, begin to flatten out the top of the metal to prepare the tip.,
When the tip is on shape, you can strengthen the blade by simple taking the wedge edge of the hammer and making small limes in the TIP of the blade, this way if a crack does form, it has to make its way all the way down the dents in the metal, thus ensuring a longer life for the blade.

,
Now straighten the blade until it is 100% straight or else you will never be able to get it into a sheath and you will lose almost all of your cutting power.

,
Once the metal is straight and has the correct shape you intended you can now begin to harden the metal by heating it up to a bright yellow color (almost until it is white-hot) then taking it out and laying it on a safe surface in a room that is as cold as you can get it (the more the difference the temperature the better!).,
After the metal is back at a safe to touch temperature, you can now begin to shine it up a bit by grinding the sides and blade with a table grinder or what ever you have, just make sure not to burn or scar the metal as all your hard work would go to waste!

,
Find or make a proper hilt for your sword, a hilt maker can be found near hobby shops or a store that sells weapons as such.

,
Now sharpen your blade and tip to a perfect 33% angle, ensuring you have a straight ramp of a blade and not a slope.

,
Clean it off, engrave the blade to however you want it, and go cut up some samurai!

",How to Make a Ninjato," 4-6 gauge steel would be ideal, but you could always go smaller;
,,,,,,, The edge should take up near half the width of the metal as it has to have enough slope to make a perfect 33% angle. (don't worry about the tip of the blade, just begin to make the edge all the way to the end of the metal).


The edge should have two side to it.

, (the tip can be tricky to make on a one-sided blade, to after flattening it is OK to simple cut it off or grind it away as a beginner).

,,, Repeat by setting the metal back into the furnace and so on for a MINIMUM of 10 times or until you are satisfied.

Transfer the ice cube tray or popsicle mold to the freezer.,
Use the frozen sidewalk chalk.",How to Make Sidewalk Chalk with Cornstarch," Stir with a fork or small whisk until the cornstarch dissolves. There should be no lumps or clumps. The mixture will be somewhat thick. This will be enough for one color.


If you are muffin tin with shallow wells use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water per well.;
, Keep stirring until you get an even color. There should be no streaks or swirls. Try to use washable tempera paint for easy clean up.


If you can't find any tempera paint, you can substitute several drops of food coloring or liquid water color instead. 5 to 20 drops should be enough. The more food coloring you add, the brighter the color will be.

, If you can't find a muffin tin, use a small, plastic cup instead.

, Pour each color mixture into a separate well. You can use whatever color you want.

, You can also use some foam brushes instead. The colors may appear translucent at first, but they will become more opaque once they dry.

, Pour each flavor into a separate well. The drink mix will not only color the sidewalk chalk paint, but also make it smell nice. Set the muffin tin aside.

, Stir the two together with a spoon or whisk until the cornstarch has dissolved. There should be no clumps or lumps. The mixture will be a little thick.

, Stop when the water is about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the rim. This will lessen the chances of the paint spilling when you take it outside.


You will likely end up with some left-over cornstarch water. If this happens, just pour it out, or use it to make more scented sidewalk chalk paint in a separate container.

, Use a small spoon, a fork, or a toothpick to do this. The color should be even, and there should be no streaks or swirls.

, Carefully carry the muffin tin outside. Use paintbrushes or foam brushes to spread the paint onto the sidewalk. The paint may appear a little bit translucent at first, but it will be brighter once it dries.

, Mix everything together using a whisk or fork. There should be no lumps or clumps. The mixture will be a little bit thick, which is fine. This will be enough for one color.


Try to use a bowl or cup that has a little pouring spout. This will make it easier to pour the mixture into the spray bottles later on.

, You will need about 5 to 20 drops. The more drops you add, the brighter your color will be. Keep stirring until you get an even color. There should be no streaks or swirls.


You can also use liquid watercolors instead of food coloring.
You can try using washable tempera paint, but it might make the mixture too thick to squeeze out of the bottles.

, Close the bottle and shake it to mix everything together. If you are having troubles pouring the mixture, try sticking a funnel into the next of the bottle first. Pour the mixture through the funnel.

, If you want to make more colors, mix up a new batch of water, baking soda, and cornstarch. Use a different color for each bottle.

, The vinegar is important. It will react with the baking soda, and cause the paint to fizz. If you are having troubles getting the vinegar into the spray bottle, stick a clean funnel down into the neck, and pour the vinegar through the funnel.

, Open the tip of the squeeze bottle and squirt out some designs onto the sidewalk. The colors may look a little translucent at first, but they will become brighter once they dry.

, The vinegar and baking soda will react with other. They will bubble and fizz, and create a new, foamy design.

, How much water you use will depend on how many colors you want, and the size of your ice cube tray/popsicle mold. Stir the two together with a fork or whisk until the cornstarch dissolves. There should be no lumps or clumps. The mixture will be a little thick.


Try to use a cup or bowl with a little pouring spout. It will make it easier to transfer the mixture into the ice cube tray/popsicle mold later on.

, You will need about 2 tablespoons of tempera paint per 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) of water. Keep stirring until the paint is completely mixed in. The color should be even. There should be no streaks or swirls.


Try to use washable tempera paint for easy clean up.
If you can't find any tempera paint, you can substitute food coloring or liquid watercolors. Start with a few drops, then keep adding until you get the color you want.
If you want more colors, you will need to mix them separately.

, Don't fill the wells all the way. Water expands as it freezes, after all. If you are using a popsicle mold, be sure to pop the stick part back into the mold once you have it filled.


Ice cube trays will allow you to experiment with more colors. They can also come in many fun shapes. Popsicle molds have the benefit of coming with a holding stick. Some kids may find these easier to hold.

, Leave it there for several hours, until the mixture freezes. The larger your mold is, the longer it will take to freeze.

, Once the mixture has frozen, take it out of the freezer and pop it out of the trays or molds. Consider separating the cubes by color into smaller bowls so that the colors don't mix when the ice melts. You can draw with the chalk directly, or you can leave them on the sidewalk and watch them melt.


The colors may be a little translucent at first, but they will become brighter once they dry.

Preheat the oven at 325 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Remove the tray from oven.,
Obtain a piece of #6 plastic.,
Draw your design on the plastic, using permanent marker.,
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.,
Finished.

",How to Make Shrinky Dinks," Use the colored pencil on the rough side of the sheets, and use Sharpie or permanent marker on the smooth side. Some Shrinky Dinks come pre-cut and with designs already outlined on them, and others will just be the plastic sheets.Don’t use oily or waxy substances like crayons or oil paint on Shrinky Dinks because they will melt in high heat. Some sheets are machine-sanded frosted sheets that usually come in packs of 10. Some Shrinky Dinks come as non-sanded sheets, though; that version requires permanent markers.
Printing from a computer directly onto a sheet is also possible, and works great with photos. Print letters in a mirror image so they can be read from the nicer shiny side once shrunk. Tracing is popular as well.;
, You may want to add decorative edges to the plastic, cut out your design, or punch holes in it to make it into a necklace or charms for a bracelet.Use paper punches if you want holes in the plastic. You might want holes if you are making jewelry or just for decoration. Punch any holes before you bake the Shrinky Dinks.
Cut out your design with decorative or regular scissors.

, You could also create a mock tray by folding aluminum foil.


Place the Shrinky Dink cut-out designs on the tray, rough side up. Leave space between the Shrinky Dink plastic shapes or they might stick together.
Ovens should only be used with adult supervision.

, You probably only need to pre-heat the oven for 1 to 3 minutes. You can use a toaster oven or a conventional oven.


Once the oven is preheated, put the tray with the Shrinky Dinks into the oven.
You only need to bake them for 1 to 3 minutes. At first the Shrinky Dinks will curl up, but they will flatten back out. Once they flatten back out, bake for 30 more seconds.

, Use a potholder so you don’t burn yourself, and be careful.


You could flatten your Shrinky Dinks more by pressing them flat with folded paper. However, this step may not be necessary.
Let the Shrinky Dinks cool for a few minutes before handling them. The finished piece will shrink to 1/3 the original’s size, but it will become 9 times thicker. The artwork will be brighter and bolder, and you can more easily preserve it.

, For example, this is the kind of plastic often used in salad bar containers.Look for a “6” on the bottom of the plastic. The plastic needs to be relatively thick to work.
Cut away the extra plastic until you are left with a flat square.

, It’s best with this kind of plastic not to use colored pencils.


Once baked, the image will shrink to about a third of its size and will increase in thickness.
Cut your design out and/or punch holes in it. Round the corners a bit as edges may sharpen upon baking.

, Put the rack in the lowest oven position. The reason the plastic works for designs is because it’s made out of polystyrene just as Shrinky Dinks are.Make a tray out of aluminum foil by folding it until it’s thick enough to hold the plastic. Put the plastic designs on the tray.
Bake for about 3.5 minutes. The plastic will curl, and then straighten itself out.Remove, and allow to cool.

Clean the salad spinner.",How to Make Spin Art with a Salad Spinner," Purchase or find a salad spinner with a hand crank, then disassemble it and take out the inner tray that usually holds the lettuce of the salad.Try to use an old salad spinner or one that you won’t use for making food, since you will be using it to mix paint.;
, Lay a paper plate or a piece of cardstock under the inner tray of the salad spinner. Use a pencil to trace all around the outside of the tray to make a circle on the piece of paper.This is the paper that you will create the painting on, so to support the paint you will need to use a thick, durable piece of paper that is thicker than the average piece of computer paper.

, Freehand a circle that is about ½ inch (1.27 cm) inside from the original circle on all sides. You want the paper to sit comfortably within the spinner, so it’s a good idea to make it slightly smaller than the diameter of the salad spinner.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut around the second circle that you made. If you want a square piece of paper as opposed to a circular one, first draw a square inside the inner circle whose four corners all touch the circle, then cut it out.

, Put the salad spinner back together, keeping the lid off. Then place the piece of paper you cut in the center of the inner tray of the spinner., To make a fun and randomized pattern on the paper, squirt lines, shapes, or spots of paint onto the paper. Try to use different colors and spread out your dollops of paint, as this will make your artwork more visually interesting.You need to use large dollops of paint squeezed directly onto the paper, because the excess paint that comes from squeezing the paint is what will fly around and create streaks when you spin the salad spinner.
Make the dollops of paint completely random. For instance, you could add several drops of red paint to the top and bottom corners, then a circle of blue paint in the middle and four large dollops of pink paint spread around.

, If you want your artwork to have a more symmetrical look, use different colors to create a bulls-eye pattern. Start with a small circle in the center, then use a different color to make a circle around that circle, and then do two or so more circles of different colors.This type of design is great for using rainbow colors. You can start with a red circle, then do an orange or yellow circle, then a green and a blue circle.

, Instead of dabbing paint directly to the paper, first paint the paper black with a paintbrush, wait for it to dry, then place it inside the salad spinner. Add dollops of silver and gold glitter paint along with any other colors you want.This method of applying paint will give you a striking effect, with the glitter paint shining brightly on the black background.
You can also start with black paper if you have any.

, Make sure that the paper is centered inside the salad spinner, then place the lid on the top of the salad spinner. Place the salad spinner on a table, counter, or even surface., Hold onto the side of the salad spinner with one hand and use the other to vigorously turn the crank. Spin the salad spinner for about 10 seconds., Open up the salad spinner so that you can see your art inside. If you aren’t satisfied with your piece and want to make it more interesting, add more dollops of color and repeat the process of turning the crank and spinning your art., When you are happy with how your art looks, reach into the salad spinner and take out your artwork by the corners, trying not to touch the piece where it still may be wet., Leave your artwork out untouched for about an hour to let it dry. You can move it in front of a fan or dehumidifier if you want to speed up the drying process., Before the paint has time to dry, wash the salad spinner in the sink with warm water and dish soap to clean it. Disassemble the salad spinner and wash each individual element separately.


You can still wash the salad spinner once the paint has dried, but it is more difficult. Soak the spinner in warm water before scrubbing if you are trying to dislodge dried paint.

Link 25 to 30 paper clips together.,
Use scissors to cut out squares of wrapping paper.,
Wrap the center of each paper clip with a paper square.,
Coat the necklace with glue that dries clear.,
Apply several coatings of glue.",How to Make Jewelry for Kids1," Insert the outer end of one paper clip over the closed end of a second paper clip. Follow the wire of the first paper clip around until the two paper clips are connected at closed ends. Continue connecting the remainder of your paper clips in this manner until all of them are connected into a long chain. Clip the last and first paper clips together to make the chain into a closed necklace.


You can also use this method to create a paper clip bracelet. Simple use fewer paper clips to create a shorter chain.;
, Cut the paper into 1 in. by 1 in. (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) squares. Create as many squares as you have paper clips.


Bright foil wrapping paper works well, but you can also use origami paper, construction paper, magazines, or other decorative paper. Whatever paper you use should be fairly thick, however, to minimize the odds of tears or rips.

, Fold the square over the paper clip, gluing the paper together where it overlaps in the back. Continue until all the paper clips have been wrapped.

, Coating the necklace makes it more durable by preventing the paper from ripping and the paper clips from becoming unlinked.

, Wait at least 30 minutes in between each application before using more. Three to four layers of glue should be plenty to protect the chain.

Put salt in a closable container.,
Mix in food coloring.,
Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet.,
Heat in the oven.,
Let the glitter cool.",How to Make Glitter1," You can use table salt, sea salt, or any other kind of white or colorless salt. Place the salt in zip-locked bags or containers with a sealed lid. Use one container for each color of glitter.


Use an amount of salt equivalent to the amount of glitter that you want. There are no other ingredients besides food coloring, so the amount you start with will be the amount of glitter you get.
For a sweeter glitter, you can try using granulated white sugar instead. There's a risk that sugar might melt into a syrup, which will not happen with salt.;
, Add one drop of food coloring, then seal the container and shake vigorously. Repeat until you get the color you want.


If you're using a zip-locked bag, lay it on the counter and knead it to distribute the color.

, Spread the glitter onto a baking sheet in a thin, even layer.


If you're using sugar, cover the baking sheet with parchment paper first. This makes cleanup easier if the sugar melts.

, Preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC). Place the tray inside and heat for about 10 minutes. The glitter is ready once the salt is dry again.


If using sugar, preheat it to 300ºF (150ºC) instead. This should stop it melting, but keep a close eye on it if your oven runs hot.
You can just leave the tray out overnight to dry. Make sure it is out of reach of pets and young children.

, Turn off the oven and put on an oven mitt. Take out the tray and place it on a heat-safe surface. Let cool for about one hour, or until glitter has reached room temperature. Store in a sealed container or salt shaker until you're ready to decorate your food.


If the salt has clumped together, break it up with a spoon.

Open a bag of wrapped candies.,
Overlap the end of one wrapper with the end of another.,
Staple the overlapping ends together.,
Continue overlapping and stapling the wrappers.,
Monitor you child after giving him or her the necklace.",How to Make Jewelry for Kids2," Think of something like salt water taffy or peppermints. You can use either hard or soft candy, depending on your preference, as long as the candies are securely wrapped. Colorful wrappers tend to be more fun and appealing to kids.

, The two overlapping ends should only consist of the paper or plastic wrapper and not the candy.

, Lightly tug on the two pieces of candy to confirm that they are secured together.

, Repeat the process until you have a long enough chain to slip over your child's head. Secure the first and last pieces of candy together with a staple to create a closed loop.


You can also create a smaller chain for a bracelet by using fewer candies.

, While the necklace is certainly a real ""treat,"" it can be problematic in a number of ways. For starters, eager kids may be tempted to eat all the candy at once instead of taking their time going through it. The staples also present a threat to younger kids who may not be vigilant about what goes in their mouths.


You can use a candy necklace as a type of reward system. When your child does something positive, like making her bed or sharing a valued toy with a sibling, reward the child by granting permission to eat a piece of candy from the necklace.

Get a bouquet of daisies or daisy chrysanthemums.,
Cut the stems to about 4 inches (10 cm).,
Slice into each stem.,
Slip one flower stem through the slit in a second stem.,
Slip the stem of a third flower into the slit of the first.,
Continue weaving the flower stems together in this manner.,
Make a second slip in the stem of the first flower.,
Reinforce the stems with twine.",How to Make Jewelry for Kids3," Daisy mums are considerably sturdier than actual daisies, and they tend to last longer than daisies when kept out of water. If you want something a little more traditional, however, you can still use real daisies.

, Use scissors or a sharp knife. Anything longer will make the necklace look sparse of blooms, but anything shorter may not be sturdy enough to hold together.

, Use scissors or a knife to cut a 1 in. (2.5 cm) slit toward the bottom of each stem, but not through the bottom. The slit needs to be closed on both ends, rather than hanging open.

, Slide the stem all the way through the slit until the base of the bloom sits at the entrance of the slit.

, At this point, there should be three flowers, and two slits should have stems poking through them.

, Keep going until you have enough flowers to make a chain that can fit over your child's head.

, The first flower is the flower at the start of the chain. Slip the stem of the last flower through this second slit to close the loop.

, Wrap and tie a small piece of twine around each stem, where the flowers connect, to make the chain more secure.

Place a small rock in the center of a piece of wire.,
Wrap the wire around the rock.,
Twist the ends of the wire together.,
Wrap the twisted ends around a pencil.,
Trim away extra wire.,
Cut a piece of leather cord.,
Slip the leather cord through the wire loop.",How to Make Jewelry for Kids4," Use coated, colored wire and select a piece that is about 15 in. (38 cm) in length.

, Do not use the entire piece of wire, though. Wind the wire around the rock several times, just enough to secure the rock in place.

, Twist the ends tightly until the remaining wire is used up.

, Only wrap the twist around the pencil once in order to form a loop. Close the loop by squeezing it shut with a pair of excess wire.

, Since the loop is only the width of your pencil, there will likely be some excess wire hanging off of it. Cut this extra wire away, making it as short as possible to prevent it from scratching the child who wears the necklace.

, Make the piece long enough to fit over your child's head. You can choose brown leather cord for a natural look, or you can use colored leather cord for something a little more fun.

, The cord acts as the chain, and the rock becomes the necklace pendant. Tie the ends of the cord into a tight knot before giving it to your child.

Collect or make shiny paper.,
Cut with scissors.,
Cut shapes with a hole punch.",How to Make Glitter2," Here are two ways to get the shiny paper you need:


Collect and wash brightly-colored sweet wrappers or gift wrapping paper.
You can also lay sheets of tissue paper out over newspaper, and cover completely with clear nail varnish or clear-drying glue. Wait until dry, then repeat until there are two coats on each side of the paper.

, Place two or more wrappers on top of each other, as many as you can still easily cut with your scissors. Cut it into thin horizontal strips, leaving the last edge intact so the paper is still in one piece. Rotate 90º and cut into strips in the other direction. You'll end up with tiny squares of glitter confetti. Store in a closed container, or attach to craft projects with glue.

, Alternatively, you can stick a few sheets of paper into a hole punch and press down to turn it into small pieces. This method is faster, but tends to waste some paper by tearing it or sending it flying across the room.


You can get special hole punches that cut your paper into hearts, stars, or other shapes.

Apply a sealant.,
Place the pebble boot tray in your mudroom or entrance way.,
Keep the tray clean.",How to Make a Pebble Boot Tray," If the boot tray needs cleaning, do so now and dry thoroughly before proceeding.;
, If making a pattern, you could do something like these suggestions:

Add different shades of pebbles in varying ways, such as stripes, wavy stripes, geometric shapes, etc.






Design a letter, number or symbol in the center or across the pebbles; use differently colored pebbles to make it obvious.







,

Work in small sections at a time, starting at a corner edge and working methodically across the tray. Paint a small area of the tray's corner with glue, then add a dab of glue to each pebble.






Press the pebble in place. Keep the pebble as flat as possible––the surface should not be too bumpy for the boots and shoes to sit on.






Repeat for each pebble in that section.






Move onto the next section. Move across and add pebbles according to your pattern or randomly.







, When you near the end, it is a good idea to test which pebbles will fit before adding the glue, as there may be some rearranging required before everything will fit neatly. Try not to leave large gaps!

, Also follow the manufacturer's instructions with respect to time.

, Paint or spray a suitable sealant across the top of the pebbles.

, Encourage all members of the household to place their muddy, wet or snow-covered boots and shoes on the tray to drain.

, Wipe down and wash it regularly. It may also need to be drained every few days if water has amassed in it from melting snow, etc.

Prepare the pears.,
Arrange the pears on the stand or in the bowl.,
Place in the center of the table.",How to Make a Pear Centerpiece," Basically, you'll need about 8 to a dozen pears, depending on the size of the container you're using, velvet ribbon, pieces of greenery, such as boxwood stalks, and a container. The container should be something you're proud to place on the table, such as a stem bowl, large bowl, cake stand, etc.


The pears must have their original stalk intact; don't use those which are missing a stalk.;
, Aim to have the better looking pieces facing outward to view.

, Wash the pears first and ensure that they're dry before proceeding. Washing them is important because people can take a pear and eat it as they wish if they know it has been cleaned. Then, cut equal lengths from the velvet ribbon and tie bows on the stalks of each pear.

, Simply arrange them pyramid style, with the most at the base, building up to a single one at the top. Check that the pears are sitting firmly and that all stalks are clearly visible with their pretty bows.

, Another alternative is to place the arrangement on a sideboard as a room decoration––ideal for parties, open home inspections and for creating a cheery ambiance.

Measure your head and add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).,
Cut a piece of sturdy wire according to that measurement.,
Make a ring with the wire and overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).,
Wrap florist's tape around the overlapping ends to secure them.,
Choose your flowers and cut the stems down to 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) below the bloom.Use scissors to cut real or dried flowers, and wire cutters to cut fake flowers.,
Arrange the flowers in a pattern you like.,
Attach the first flower to the wire base.,
Lay the second flower just behind first one and secure it with florist's tape.,
Continue placing and taping the flowers.,
Consider adding some ribbon.,
Try on your crown and make any adjustments, if necessary.",How to Make a Flower Crown1," If you are going to be wearing this wreath over a hairstyle (such as for a wedding), get your hair into that style first and then measure your hair. Some hairstyles, such as French braids and braided crowns, can add bulk to your head., Try to use some thicker floral, like the kind that has paper around it. This will help the florist's tape stick better to it. Do not use scissors to cut the wire or you will dull them. Use wire cutters instead.

, The ring should hold its shape. If it is too floppy, twist two to three strands of wire together, and make the ring again. This should make it sturdier.

, You can also wrap some more tape around the entire wire ring. This will give you a base to work on. It will also make the color more consistent.

, Try to cut all the stems down to the same length. This will make the crown neater in the end.


Try using large, medium, and small flowers. This will give your crown some variety.

, Don't tape the flowers to the base just yet. You want to get your design down first. It is easier to make changes while the flowers are still on the table. Try alternating between different shapes, sizes, and colors. Here are some more design ideas:


Place the largest flowers in the top/front of the crown. Use smaller and smaller flowers as you go towards the back of the crown.
Try having all the flowers pointing in the same direction, towards or away the top of the crown.
The flowers don't have to be right up against each other. You can have them spaced as close together or as far apart as you want.
Instead of attaching flowers all the way around the wire base, place them only on the top.

, Hold the flower against so that the stem is laying horizontally alongside the wire. Wrap some florist's tape around the stem and the wire. Start just below the bloom, and keep wrapping until you are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) past the end of the stem. Cut the tape and press the edge down to seal it.

, Place it so that the bloom overlaps the first flower's. The closer together the two blooms are, the fuller and heavier your crown will look in the end. The further away the blooms are, the thinner and more delicate your crown will look.

, Keep working your way around the circle, until you've used up all of the flowers you laid out in the beginning.

, Fold several long pieces of ribbon in half and place them just behind the spot where the wires overlap. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the loop just above the wire. Wrap the ribbon ends over the wire and down through the loop. Gently tug on the ribbons to secure them.

, If you see any gaps or places where you want it to look more full, gently part the flowers, insert another one and tape it in place.

Wrap the boa down the length you want the branch, then twist the rest of the wire through the trunk and cut at the bottom of the trunk.

,
Repeat with each branch.,
You should have one branch straight off the top of the tree and 3 just below it for the top round of branches.,
The bottom branches should be longer than the top branches, for a traditional pyramidal shape.

,
You can leave the trunk bare, especially if the wire twisting was done in a careful and pleasing way, or you can wrap the trunk with tape or florist's tape.

,
Place the tree in the pot and fill the pot with sand or concrete.

",How to Make a Feather Tree," Twist the rest around itself down the length of the wire. This will form the trunk.;
, You will not have any branches below this point.

, Glue the end of the feather boa around it.

Stop when the garland is just a few inches too big.,
Wrap some wire around the end of the garland.,
Bring both ends of the garland together.,
Wrap wire around both ends to hold them together.",How to Make a Flower Crown2," You want the stems to be at least 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) long. You can use just one type of flower, or a variety.


Daisies and dandelions are classical, but you can also use alyssum or forget-me-nots.
Flowering herbs, such as mint, thyme, oregano, chamomile, and lavender work as well. They will also smell great.

, This will make the flowers easier to braid and take off any unnecessary bulk.

, This will keep the flowers fresh while you work. Braided flower crowns can take a while to make, and the picked flowers may wilt by the time you get around to using them.

, Wrap a small piece of wire around the stems a few times, and snip the excess off. Try to get wire as close to the blooms as possible. You want all the blooms to be at the same level; if one sits higher than the other, your crown will look uneven. The wire will hold the flowers together while you braid them.


If you don't have any floral wire, use twist ties or thread instead.

, Take the left stem and pull it over so it ends up between the middle and right stems. Take the right stem and bring over so that it ends up between the left and middle stems. Keep doing this until your braid is 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) long., The new flower should sit just beneath the one that is already in the braid.

, Keep them together; they will count as one stem.

, The new flower should sit just below the flower that is already in the braid.

, Don't let the stems spread apart. Try to keep them together and think of them as one thick stem.

, The sections you are braiding will get thicker and thicker as you continue to add flowers.


Try using different types of flowers. This will add color, texture, and beauty.
Don't be afraid to weave in a few leaves, vines, or grasses.

, You want the garland to be a little large, because you will be overlapping the two ends. This will make the crown more secure in the end.

, Place the wire just beneath the blooms of the last bunch of flowers. Wrap the wire around the end of the garland a few times, then snip the excess off with a pair of wire cutters. This will hold your flowers together and keep the garland from unraveling.

, Overlap the ends until the crown sits comfortably on your head. Hold the two ends together as you take the crown off.

, When you come across a flower, thread the wire underneath the bloom. You are binding just the stems together. Once the crown is secure, snip the excess wire off. Gently tuck both ends of the wire into the braided stems.

Snip the bottom part of the stem off, if necessary.,
Squeeze out some hot glue onto the bottom of your first flower.,
Press the flower down onto the headband.,
Move onto the next flower when the glue dries.,
Fill in any gaps with smaller flowers or leaves.,
Pull off any glue threads before wearing the headband.",How to Make a Flower Crown3," You will be gluing the flowers to this headband.

, This will help conceal the headband's original color and give the glue something to grab onto. You can use any color of ribbon you want, but green might blend in with the flowers better. If you don't want a green ribbon, then try to match the color to the flowers you are using instead. There are two ways you can attach the ribbon:


Choose a ribbon that is the same width as your headband. Cut it so that it is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) longer than your headband. Center the ribbon on top of the headband, and hot glue it down. There will be an inch (2.54 centimeters) of ribbon handing off of each end. Cover both ends of the ribbon with glue, and fold them under the headband.
Put a drop of hot glue onto one end of the headband. Press the end of a long piece of ribbon down onto the glue. Wrap the ribbon around the headband, like a candy cane. Start from one end and move towards the other. Try to overlap the ribbon slightly. This way, you will cover the headband entirely and not get any patches.Secure the end of the ribbon with a drop of glue.

, If the bloom won't come off, use wire cutters to snip it off. Try to cut as close to the bottom of the flower as possible.

, Sometimes, when you pull the blooms off the stems, you may get a little nub on the bottom part of the flower. This may keep the flower from laying flat against the headband. If you want the flower to lay flat, then snip this nub off.Don't snip too much off, however. This little nub helps hold the flower together. If you cut too much off, the flower may fall apart., Swirl the glue around the base first, where the stem connects to the flower. Next, place a large drop of glue right on the bottom of the stem.

, Hold it there until the glue starts to harden.

, Try to place the flower as close as possible to the first one.

, Put the glue directly onto the headband, and gently press the flower or leaf into the glue.

, Sometimes, hot glue will leave behind long thread-like strands of glue. This can make even the most beautiful headband look messy. Carefully go over your headband, and gently pull off any strands.

Get a strapless bra that fits you.,
Get two shells big enough to cover your bra.,
Paint the shells with spray paint or acrylic paint, if desired.,
Coat the shells with extra-fine glitter for extra sparkle.,
Hot glue the shells to the bra.,
Embellish the seashell bra with rhinestones, sequins, or beads.,
Fill the gaps in on the bra with more embellishments.,
Add some final touches, if desired.",How to Make a Mermaid Shell Top1," You will be covering this bra with shells, glitter, and other things, so make sure it's one you don't care about.The bra can be any color, but a skin-toned one would be the best.You can also use something that matches your mermaid costume, such as teal or purple.


A strapless bra works best because it has less fabric to peek out from behind the shells. If you can't find one, try to get one with re-moveable straps instead.
You can also use a tank top instead of a bra.;
, You can find large shells in an arts and crafts store. You can also find large, plastic shells in a party or costume shop. If they came from a mermaid costume, you may have to cut the strings connecting them off.Avoid getting abalone shells. They are too heavy for shell tops.
If you are getting real shells, make sure that they match up as closely as possible.

, You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add color to your costume. You can use any color you want, but purple is especially popular amongst mermaids. For extra sparkle, choose a metallic or pearlescent paint.Let the paint dry before moving on.


Keep in mind that most paints will dry a shade or two darker.
For an interesting effect: paint the shell a flat color, let it dry, then lightly go over it with a dry brush and a matching metallic color. The paint will stick to just the raised surfaces, giving it a subtle shimmer.

, Coat the shells with glue first, then sprinkle glitter over them.Use iridescent glitter or glitter that matches the shell color; this will prevent the glitter from clashing against the shells.


You can use spray-on glue or liquid glue (ie: Mod Podge, school glue, etc).
Extra-fine scrapbooking glitter will look much better than the chunky, craft glitter.

, Coat the back of the shell with hot glue, then quickly press it against the bra cup. Repeat this step for the other shell and bra cup. You can have the shells pointing straight up-and-down, off to the sides, or at slight, outward angles.You can also use industrial-strength glue, such as E6000.

, Use hot glue or superglue to attach rhinestones, sequins, or beads to the shells. You can glue them randomly over the shell, down the groves, or focus them on the bottom of the shell. For something more subtle, glue mini rhinestones along the top edge of the shell instead.


Use colors that match the shell or your mermaid costume. White, clear, or iridescent are great options too.

, Focus on the spot between the two shells. If you have any bra cup material peeking out, it would be a good idea to cover it up as well. Avoid putting anything on the bra strap itself, otherwise it may lose its stretchiness.


Consider gluing a smaller shell or starfish in the spot between the two shells.

, Here is where you can get really creative, and add those last few touches to bring character to your mermaid bra. Listed below are some ideas:


Glue lace trim to the edges of the shell for a more feminine look.Add a strand or two of pears or beads between the two bra cups. They will dangle against your ribcage.If you don't want the bra strap visible, you could loosely cover it with some fish net to make it is obvious.
If you used a tank top, you could glue some more embellishments to the shoulder straps.

Sleeveless shirts, cropped shirts, and shirts with lace insets work especially well.
The cardboard will protect the paint from transferring to the back of the shirt. Make sure it is big enough for your design.

, Draw a large, fan-shaped shell onto a sheet of thick paper and cut it out. If you don't know how to draw a shell, find a simple template online, print it, cut it out, and use that instead.The shell needs to be big enough to cover your breast, or between the size of your palm and hand.

, Position the shell where your breast would be on the shirt, just below the sleeve. Trace around the shell with a pen or pencil. Move the shell over for the other breast, and trace it as well.


You can have the shells pointing outward at slight angles, off to the style, or straight up-and-down.
Try the shirt on, place the shell against your chest where you want it to go, then make a light mark with a pencil as a guide., Start by painting the outline first, then fill the shell in. If you can, try to use a brush meant for fabric paint; it is usually sold in craft stores, right next to the fabric paints.


Mix some extra-fine scrapbooking glitter into the paint for a sparkly effect. Use iridescent or a matching color.
Your shells can be any color you want, but purple or teal are popular mermaid colors.
You can also use acrylic paints as well, but you'll need to add one part fabric medium to two parts of paint., Let the first coat of paint dry to the touch. If it looks blotchy or uneven, you will need to apply a second coat. Let this second coat dry before moving on., You can make these details any color you want, but they'll look better if you use a darker shade of the same color as your shell. A great idea would be to outline the shell, then paint the ridges., This may take a few hours, but it would be better if you let it dry overnight. From time to time, pull the shirt away from the cardboard. This will prevent it from sticking., Some types of fabric paints/mediums need to be heat set to make them permanent. Check the bottle of paint or fabric medium you used for specific instructions. In most cases, you will need to cover your  design with a tea towel, then iron it for about 2 minutes., Rhinestones, sequins, and pearl beads make great choices. You can also outline your shells with a skinny sequin trim instead. Lay them out first, to make sure you like the design, then glue them down with fabric glue. Let the glue dry, preferably overnight.You can remove the cardboard after everything dries.

Find long, flexible plant stems.,
Bend the stems into a loop.,
Shape the rest of the nest.,
Decorate with scavenged materials.,
Place eggs inside (optional).",How to Make a Bird Nest1," These will form the main shape of the nest, and are much easier to work with than hard, short twigs. You can use straw, long grass, vines, willow fronds, bendy reeds, or seagrass found outdoors or at a garden supply store. Raffia is another good option, obtainable from a craft supply store.If Mexican feather grass grows in your area, grab a clump of it and pull your hand upward to remove a handful of hairy seeds clinging together. Once you have enough seeds, clump them into a ball and make a nest shape by sticking your thumb into it.;
, Grab a thick handful of the stems, and bend them into a U shape, adding more stems if necessary to form a full circle. Tie it in place using a piece of string or florist wire.If the plant stems have many little leaves, or if they're wiry and dry, you can even weave them together without using any attachment.









If tying the nest together is too hard, you can clip them temporarily in place while waiting for glue to dry.Don't use glue if you plan to keep the nest outdoors.
If your fresh-cut plants won't stay in position, try hanging up the bundle in a windy area to dry for 24 hours. Some plant stems are easier to bend when fresh, but grasses and straw benefit from drying.

, Grab a second, smaller handful of stems and shape it into a smaller loop. Wedge this inside the larger loop and push it downward to form the base of the loop. Depending on how well the stems fit together and how sturdy you want the nest to be, you may need to use a thread  or glue to fasten the two loops together.








, Real birds sometimes spend days collecting bits and pieces to build a nest. Hopefully you're a little faster, but you can still have fun gathering objects from nature or your craft boxes. Here are some ideas to get you started:









If you plan to leave the nest outside, only use materials found outdoors, and nothing that could hurt an animal.
Feathers and pieces of eggshell fit the theme. Be aware that collecting most wild feathers is illegal in the United States, but they are mostly harmless from a disease perspective.Look for twigs, leaves, bark, and moss in interesting shapes and colors.
If the nest is for indoor decoration, you can use bits of string, colored paper shreds, and confetti.

, Finish your art project by placing eggs or fake eggs inside the nest. You can quickly add marbles or colorful pebbles, or hollow out real eggs, decorate them, or even carve them if you have the right tools.

Find a small area with slightly damp dirt.,
Collect many twigs and sticks.,
Using the sticks, create either a square formation, circle formation, or a Teepee formation.,
Build your exterior walls.,
Build your roof.,
Decorate.",How to Make a Fairy House in the Woods," To tell if the dirt is good enough, stick a twig in the dirt and check if it stays standing. The area should be at least 1 square foot, but it can be as big as you want.;
, Depending on the size of house you plan to build, they should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Make sure that the sticks you collect are not too thick, in case you need to break them.

, These are your foundation pieces, so ensure that you stick the twigs at least half an inch into the dirt.

, Use the bigger sticks on the outside to make it sturdier.

, You can use either a leaf or a wide strip of bark. If you use a leaf, it may be helpful to stick a thin twig through the leaf and plant it in the dirt, to prevent the leaf from blowing away.


If you made a Teepee, you will not require a roof. However, you will want to secure the top with either a long blade of grass, or some twine.

, Try using pebbles, flowers, leaves, and moss. Make the house authentic. Add a pond, see-saw, slide, mini-garden and flags.

Look up the nesting habits of local birds.,
Leave nesting material in your yard.,
Provide a variety of plants.,
Build a nesting box.,
Make a bird's nest.",How to Make a Bird Nest2," Find a local wildlife guide at a library or bookstore, or search online for information on local birds. Choose one or more species you want to attract, and look up their nesting habits to discover what shape and style of nest will be most effective.









If you live in North America, NestWatch is an excellent resource for nesting information, and one you can expand with your own data., This is an easy way to attract birds, and might be worth it even if you end up building a full nest as well. If you managed to find specific nesting information, you'll know what materials to leave, but you can't go wrong with a few items from the following list, left in visible locations:








Rigid twigs (for platform nest species) and flexible ones (for cup nest species)
Yard clippings such as dry grass and straw, bits of bark and moss, dead leaves, etc.
Human or animal hair or fur (no longer than 6 inches / 15 centimeters)
Yarn or string
Mud, spiderwebs, and/or caterpillar cocoons to help birds bind nesting materials together
Never leave out materials that have come into contact with harsh chemicals, including dye, pesticides, or anti-flea treatments. Dryer lint and clothing rags are not recommended.

, If you want to attract birds that make nests in existing holes, leave dead tree stumps and fallen logs in the yard. Living trees and bushes will attract more visible nests from other species, especially if the plants are native to your area. For best results, plant a ""staircase"" of grass or moss, flowering perennials, shrubs, and trees.







, If there aren't obvious crevices or hollows in your yard, building a nesting box or birdhouse is a simple carpentry project. Make sure the birdhouse is constructed to match the size of the birds you want to attract, or the size of the birds you see flying near your home.


For a higher chance of success, follow birdhouse building instructions specific to common North American species.
Clean out the birdhouse regularly whenever birds are not nesting.

, Many birds prefer to make their own nest rather than move in to a ready-made one. Lining natural hollows with the nesting materials listed above may give a bird an attractive head start. If you want to make a different type of nest, such as a cup or platform nest, it's best to follow the specific habits of the bird species you want to attract. Each species tends to prefer certain materials.









Placement of the nest is also important. Many bird species hide their nest amidst thick branches, but some prefer more open branches, bushes, or open patches of ground. Look for more information on NestWatch, through online searches, or in a local bird nest identification guide.

Inflate the balloons.,
Cover your work surface.,
Tape the balloons together.,
Prepare your paper mache supplies.,
Dunk each newsprint shred into the paste.

,
Coat the balloons in paper mache.,
Let everything dry.,
Apply an even coat of spray adhesive to one of the cloud lumps.

,
Apply the stuffing in patches.,
Dry and adjust as needed.,
Use your new balloon cloud.",How to Make a Cloud1," Blow up roughly one dozen white balloons using your mouth or a portable air pump. Knot the openings of each balloon to prevent air from escaping.


You can vary the number of balloons to create larger or smaller clouds as desired.
If desired, you could experiment by filling the balloons with helium, but the results might seem less than spectacular. The helium will give the cloud a slight lift, but due to the weight of the other materials, the cloud may not rise very high. Moreover, the helium will eventually leak out, causing the cloud to sink even further.;
, Spread a large drop cloth over your work surface. Set the balloons and the remaining supplies on top of this cloth.

, Arrange the balloons in a pile, altering the shape of the pile as needed to form the shape of a cloud. Carefully tape the finished form together with masking tape.


Play around with the placement of your balloons, and consider adding more balloons to the pile or taking some away. Clouds are naturally lumpy and unevenly shaped, so there's no need for perfection here.
Work carefully during this stage to avoid accidentally popping the balloons. Punctured balloons won't matter much once you set the final shape with dried paper mache, but you still need to keep them intact for the time being.

, Mix a batch of paper mache paste in a medium bucket and tear apart 20 to 30 sheets of newsprint into thick ribbons.


Paper mache paste made with flour is recommended for this project. Whisk together three parts water with one part flour until the paste becomes smooth.For clouds made with a dozen balloons, 6 cups (1.5 L) of water and 2 cups (500 ml) of flour should work well.
Tear the newsprint into crosswise shreds measuring 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15 cm) wide.

,, Then apply the shred to the surface of the balloon. Repeat as often as needed until the entire balloon structure is covered.


Keep the cloud lightweight by letting the excess paste drip off as you lift each strip from the bucket.
Use your hands to smooth out the strips as you apply them, leaving as few wrinkles as possible. Make sure that the connecting space in between individual balloons also gets covered.

, Set aside the cloud base and allow all of the paste to dry. This may take 12 to 24 hours.


You should be able to get rid of any extra paste and newsprint ribbons during this time since later steps do not require them.

,, Gently press polyester fiber stuffing into the adhesive.


Grab a handful of stuffing and bunch it up before sticking it in place. Do not stretch the stuffing across the surface of the cloud since doing so will not create the correct effect.
Repeat the process as needed until you cover the entire cloud with stuffing, working in small patches to prevent the adhesive from drying out after application. Take your time to ensure a better result.

, Allow all of the spray adhesive to dry so that the stuffing remains secure. Use your fingers to gently pluck, fluff, and maneuver the stuffing as needed to improve the appearance.

, The process should now be complete, and the balloon cloud should be ready to use.


If desired, you can pierce the top of the paper mache base and weave sturdy twine through the opening. Doing so will puncture the balloon lying beneath the surface, but the paper mache should be sturdy enough to continue holding its form. Use the twine to hang the cloud from a hook, branch, or similar object.

Open up the paper lanterns.,
Glue polyester stuffing to each lantern.,
Hang the support dowel.,
Attach the first covered lantern to the dowel.,
Build out the cloud.,
Hang LED lights through the lanterns.,
Enjoy your new paper lantern cloud.",How to Make a Cloud2," Unfold and expand four to seven white paper lanterns. Vary the sizes of the lanterns between small, medium, and large.


By default, this project calls for standard paper lanterns. You can save time by using paper lanterns that already come with LED lights built inside, however.

, Coat a small patch of the paper lantern with hot glue, then press a handful of polyester stuffing on top. Continue until the entire lantern is covered, then repeat with the remaining lanterns.Work in small patches and take your time to create a natural effect. Bunch up each handful of stuffing before sticking it on, and do not stretch the stuffing across the surface. The final result should look fluffy and a little lumpy.
Allow the glue to cool and dry while you continue onto the next step.

, Tightly tie 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) of clear twine to either end of a 2-inch wide wooden dowel. Form loops with the tail ends of the twine, and hang those loops from screw hooks or other similar hardware.


The right hardware and correct placement will depend on where you wish to hang the cloud. Adhesive hooks might be better if you wish to use the cloud as a temporary decoration. You could also use larger strands of twine and loop them directly over the ends of a tree branch if you plan to hang the cloud outside.
Note that the length of the dowel will depend upon how large you want your finished cloud to be and how many covered lanterns you plan to use.

, Tie additional clear twine onto the top wire of the paper lantern. Attach the other end of the twine to the center of the hanging dowel.


Since this first covered lantern serves as the base of the cloud, it's best to start with one of the larger ones.
Adjust the length of the twine as needed to change the height of the cloud.

, Tie additional covered lanterns to the dowel in the same manner used to attach the first. Vary the lantern size, lantern placement, and string length as needed to build the cloud outward to either side.


You'll also need to build onto the top and bottom of the cloud, but ideally, the width should be longer than the height.
Continue attaching more covered lanterns to the dowel as needed until the cloud looks the way you'd like it to look. Use your fingers to gently pluck and fluff the stuffing as needed while hanging each cloud piece.

, Drape mini LED curtain lights over the wooden dowel, then position the hanging strands so that they fall through the tops of each lantern and out from the bottoms.


Use clear lights or pale blue lights to create the most natural effect. LED lights that blink are also ideal since they can mimic the behavior and appearance of lightning.
The curtain lights will likely be visible from the bottom of the cloud, creating the appearance of cascading rain.
Note that this step is only optional. You can skip it if you decide to use paper lanterns with built-in LED lights or if you would prefer a non-illuminated cloud.

, Now that the cloud is finished and hanging up, it's ready to use as a decoration. Turn on the LED lights when you want to see a stormy shower and leave them off when you want to create a more serene ambiance."

Done.",How to Make a Braided Jute Wall Hanging with Dried Flowers," These must be fixed, not movable, as you be pulling and tugging while braiding. Place or fix these anchors at a distance of 45–50 inches (114.3–127.0 cm). Hence, if you've chosen to work from a door handle, you need another handle or hook at this distance away from the first handle.


Alternatively, you may use two chairs having weight on them in front of each other at a distance of 45–50 inches (114.3–127.0 cm). This may be easier, as you can place the chairs precisely where needed.;
, One must be dark in color and the other two jute rolls two shades lighter.

, Tie it firmly to the handle, hook or chair back that you've chosen to work from.

, Then take it back to the first handle. Repeat this procedure until you have 25 to 30 rope lengths.

, Start by making a knot between end of lightly colored rope and the darker colored rope. Keep the other lightly colored rope aside for now.

, Make a knot off the second (darker) colored rope, forming equal lines, as you have made in first one 25 to 30 rope lengths.

, Hold them in your hand.

, Cut the rope at one end. Take off the hanging lengths.

, Cut the jute lengths so that all lengths are equal.

, Curve one end into a loop. This will serve as a hanger. Keep in place by wrapping one jute length around all the jute lengths to form a tight holding knot.

, Use a single colored length to wrap around the lop. Twist it all around the hanger loop tightly. Vary the colors used if wished, as shown in the image. Once it has been completely wrapped, finish off by knotting the loop length firmly, to prevent it from unraveling.

,, Ensure that a good mixture of colored ropes is found within each of the three divisions you're making.


If wished, tie the ends of each portion loosely, to keep the portions together during braiding (see image).

, Knot the end of each completed braid piece using a single jute length. Tie firmly and tightly to prevent the braids from unraveling.

, This ensures that they will remain in the right place, aligned neatly alongside each other.

, Aim to make the same size of wire to ensure that each of the petals is even.

, Wind the excess wire at the ends together, to prevent unraveling. Repeat to make five to six petals per flower. Thus, if you want more than one flower, make enough petals to form each flower. It's recommended that you make six flowers for this wall hanging.


The finished wire products:

, This will cover the wire and forms the pretty colors for the flowers (select colors of your preference). Use glue to help keep the wound-on rope in place, and tie off firmly at the end, plus add some glue for additional strength. Then, glue onto the jute fabric as background and allow to dry fully. Once dried, cut out the petal shapes, keeping the jute fabric in the center as part of the whole petal.

, Do this by turning each petal slightly downwards. See image for the result.

, Tie five to six stems together, twisting to hold, thereby forming a flower.

, This neatens the look, prevents the wire from snagging and finishes the flower. Shape the flower again and it is ready for use on the wall hanging.


Repeat for the other flowers. Make at least five to six flowers.

, These can be purchased from florists or craft stores or you can find items in your own garden, such as gumnuts, flowers that have dried naturally or flowers you have dried.

, This is optional but makes for a nice touch to the final appearance of the hanging.

Heat the sticker.,
Lift with a smooth, flat object.,
Pull off with tweezers as you heat.",How to Get Stickers off Wood1," Use a blow dryer or heat gun on the lowest setting. Heat the entire sticker for a few seconds, then point it at one corner. Keep heating as you continue to the next step.


Keep the blow dryer two inches (5 cm) away from the wood, and the heat gun at least 3 inches (7.5 cm) away. Heat for no more than 10–15 seconds.Too much heat can damage wood finish, or cause the sticker to leave a stain.;
, A plastic credit card or scraper is safest for the wood. If the wood isn't valuable or antique, you're probably safe with a putty knife, artist's palette knife, or non-serrated, thin butter knife. Scrape the edge of the sticker gently to lift it, at the corner being heated. If it doesn't work, move on, but keep the tool handy.









If you are handling a valuable or antique piece of wood, use your fingernail instead.
If your knives are too thick to get under the card, cut a square of plastic from the middle of a plastic container lid.

, Once you have one edge lifted, grasp it with tweezers or needle-nose pliers. Bend this 180º and gradually pull the sticker. For fragile wood, pull across the wood grain to avoid picking up fibers. Angle the blow dryer as you do this, softening the glue as you go. Do not try to rip the sticker off, or you could end up with a more difficult paper backing stuck to the table.

Clean stickers off with white vinegar.,
Use a damp cloth for product labels.,
Use a commercial glue remover.,
Try petroleum jelly or a vaporizing rub instead.,
Dampen with oil.,
Apply powerful solvents cautiously.",How to Get Stickers off Wood2," Soak a paper towel or cloth in white vinegar. Lay it over the sticker and let it sit five minutes. Gently peel off the sticker using your fingernail or tweezers.







, Product labels on furniture and toys can usually be dissolved with a damp cloth. However, do not add water to stickers that come on sheets for peeling off and pressing on. These pressure-sensitive stickers can become more firmly attached when exposed to water.








Don't soak the wood, or you could swell the grain and cause damage.

, If the cloth doesn't work, try a product such as Goo Gone, Goof Off, 3M General Purpose Adhesive Cleaner, or cleaning products that contain citrus oil. Use just enough to wet the sticker. Give plastic or foil stickers a couple minutes for the product to soak through, or try to lift the edge and apply an additional drop underneath. Once wet and soft, attempt to peel or scrape it off as before.









Read the label instruction first to make sure the product is safe for wood.

, These can take up to eight hours to penetrate and soften the adhesive, so this is only worth doing if it saves you a trip to the store. Once soft, scrape the sticker and goo off. Add a few drops pure, concentrated dish detergent to the remaining residue. Rub it in to make a paste, then wipe off with a paper towel.








, Alternatively, you can use a vegetable or plant oil (particularly eucalyptus oil) or a low-strength mineral oil such as WD40 or baby oil. Dab a few drops over the sticker, let sit a couple hours, then attempt to scrape off. Plant and mineral oils can have different effects, so you may wish to try one of each, separately.









This can darken the color of unfinished wood. This is not harmful for most wood — and may even improve its lifespan — but you may wish to apply oil to the rest of the wood so it matches. Use a product intended for the purpose, not the oil you just used.

, Consider these chemicals a last resort, as they can potentially damage some wood finishes and paint. Use them only in well ventilated areas or outdoors, since the fumes are toxic and most are quite flammable. Test the product on a corner of the wood first to make sure it's safe.









Lighter fluid is usually safe on paint, and evaporates quickly from the wood. It can still damage some finishes.
Paint thinner's probably the next safest bet, but will damage many finishes. Make sure to test in a corner first.
Acetone or acetone-based lacquer thinner will destroy lacquer and plastic-based wood finishes — in other words, most of them.
Rubbing alcohol is an absolute last resort, since it can dissolve through most lacquers and damage the wood underneath."
"
Use something oil-based like lemon oil.,
Pick up residue with magic tape.,
Wipe off residue with the solvent you used.,
Scrub the wood with soapy water.,
Sand off the wood if nothing else works.",How to Get Stickers off Wood3," It wouldn't scratch but would pick up any stubborn residual stickiness. It's best to use something normally used on wood, so it doesn't have to be washed off with detergent.








, The transparent Scotch tape labeled ""Magic tape"" can remove sticker glue without leaving more behind.Lay it over the glue and rip it off once. If there are no significant results, move on to the next step.









You can try other types of tape if the wood is not valuable. Do not use duct tape, which may leave its own residue on the wood.

, If you used a solvent to dissolve the glue, it should work on the remaining stickiness as well. Dampen a cloth with a little more of the same substance. Rub for up to 10 minutes, in gentle circular motions.









Do not do this if the wood feels rougher or looks discolored due to the solvent.

, A mild dishwashing detergent and water may remove small amounts of residue. Use just a drop or two of detergent in a small cup of water. Dampen a cloth or sponge and scrub.








, If the sticker or sticker residue will not come off, sand through it. Rub with 80 grit sandpaper until the sticker and residue is gone, replacing the paper whenever it gets clogged. Restore the smooth surface with 120-grit sandpaper, then 220-grit.








Once sanded, reapply whichever finish or paint was used on your wood. If you do not know which finish was used, you may need to sand off the entire surface and apply a new coat from scratch.

Pre-heat your oven to 200°F (94°C).,
Slice some oranges into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) thick slices.,
Bake the oranges in the oven for 4 hours, turning them every hour.,
Buy a big bag of bay leaves and empty it into a large bowl.,
Consider drilling holes through the middle of your cinnamon sticks.,
Cut a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland piece of twine, thread it through a yarn needle, and tie one end into a small loop.,
Start stringing your orange slices, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks onto the twine.,
Repeat this pattern until you run out of items or the garland reaches the length you want.,
Tie another loop at the end of the twine.",How to Make a Scented Garland1,";
, How many oranges you end up using depends on your final design and how long you want the final garland to be. Plan on using about 11 oranges for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland., You can place them directly onto the rack in the oven. Avoid using a baking sheet, as this will trap too much moisture and will prevent the orange slices from drying out properly. Every hour, use a pair of tongs to turn the orange slices.If you'd rather not dirty up your oven, place a metal rack on top of a baking sheet, then place the orange slices on the rack.

, Again, how many bay leaves you end up using will depend on how long your garland is, and how you choose to arrange the oranges, bay leaves, and cinnamon sticks on it. You will need about 250 bay leaves for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland.It might be a good idea to go through the bay leaves first and pluck out any damaged or broken ones. Save those for cooking.

, You can always just tie the twine around the cinnamon sticks instead, but they will stay on the garland better if you use holes instead. Plan on using about 18 cinnamon sticks for a 4-foot (1.22-meter) garland.Drill the holes from the curled/seamed side using an electric drill and a small drill bit.

, The loop does not have to be very big; something big enough for your finger to slip though will be plenty. The loop will help prevent everything from sliding off. It will also allow you to hang the garland up.

, Slip your needle through the a cinnamon stick first, then pierce it through the center of an orange slice, followed by 5 to 8 bay leaves. Add another orange slice, 5 to 8 more bay leaves, and then a final orange slice. Slide everything towards the end of the string.If you did not make holes in the cinnamon sticks, simply wrap the twine around the center of the stick and tie it into a double knot.

, You can also vary the pattern, if you'd like, use more of certain items, or use fewer of others. Remember to leave a few inches/centimeters at the end of your twine.

, At this point, you can hang your garland from hooks or nails in doorways, above fireplace mantles, or over windows. You can also wrap them around your Christmas tree!

Tie small loops into each end of your garland, then hang your garland up.",How to Make a Scented Garland2,", Pour 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl, then add ½ cup (150 grams) of salt. Next, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground allspice, ½ teaspoon of ground cloves, and 2 teaspoons of ground ginger. Stir them together with a whisk until they are all evenly combined., Pour in a little bit of water, and stir it in with a rubber spatula. Stir in some more water, and mix again. You may end up using up to 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water. Avoid using too much more, or the dough will turn out too sticky.

, The dough should be soft and smooth. If it is sticky, add some more flour, and knead it some more., You can make your garland all one color, or many different colors. Start by separating your dough into clumps—one for each color. Next, add a few drops of food coloring into each clump, then knead it in until the color turns consistent. Fall colors, such as red, orange, and yellow work great for this.You can always paint the pieces after you bake them, but the paint may cover up the wonderful aroma.

, Lightly flour a smooth surface, and roll the dough out using a rolling pin. Try to get the dough to be about ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) thick.

, Hearts and stars are very popular, but you can also use circles, leaves, or other shapes.

, Use a straw or knitting needle to punch the holes; keep them about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) apart from each other.If you'd like a touch of extra fragrance and design, stick whole cloves, pointy-side-down, into your ornaments., Return them to the oven, and let them baking for another hour, or until they are completely dry.Don't raise the temperature. This will cause the dough to rise and form bubbles., If the holes got covered up, gently open them back up by twisting a wooden skewer or knitting needle through them., Although not necessary, this can make your garland look prettier. Try not to get too carried away, however!Once you have decorated your pieces, let them dry.


For fancier ornaments, decorate them using glitter and glue.
For rustic ornaments, glue some simple, 4-hole buttons onto them., If you choose to use ribbon, be sure to use the thinnest kind you can find. How long you cut your string depends on how long you want your garland to be. Most garlands will be about 4 feet (1.22 meters).

, Take an ornament, and push the needle up through the first hole, then down through the second. Drag the ornament along the string until it is a few inches/centimeters from the end.

, Leave some space between each ornament. If you decorated your ornaments, make sure that they are facing the same direction.

, You can hang it from hooks or nails over a window, doorway, or fireplace mantle. You can also wrap it around a Christmas tree instead."

You can also use more spoon tops on the top or bottom of the butterfly to create different sized wings. For example, to have bigger top wings than bottom ones, you would have three spoons for each wing on the top and two spoons for each wing on the bottom.

, You may also paint the spoons (make sure the paint can adhere to the plastic.) If you're going to paint the spoons, you will need a couple coats of paint so the butterfly will look bright — so there won't be any streaky bits of plastic showing.

Understand the rules.,
Select a basic task for your machine to accomplish.,
Look for inspiration.,
Collect your materials.,
Experiment with the materials.,
Develop a building plan.,
Build a prototype.,
Test your machine for feasibility.,
Build your final product and test is repeatability.,
Test the machine’s reliability.",How to Build a Homemade Rube Goldberg Machine," If you’re building a Rube Goldberg machine for a class or official competition, you will get a packet of information and rules. Before you plan or build your machine, read through this material carefully. While you read, identify the goal, requirements, and restrictions.


If the material is unclear, ask your teacher, parent, or an official to clarify.
If you don’t follow the rules, you may get a poor grade or be disqualified from the competition.;
, Rube Goldberg machines are complex structures that rely on chain reactions to execute one simple task. Before you design your machine, determine what you want the machine to do. If you are competing in a Rube Goldberg competition or completing an assignment for school, you may not have the freedom to choose this task. If can pick, consider some of the following options:


Open or close a door
Turn on a light
Turn off an alarm
Pour a bowl of cereal
Turn on a faucet, Developing a zany, complex machine is not an easy task. Before you create your own Rube Goldberg machine, you may find it helpful to see some examples. While you should use these examples as a source of inspiration and direction, do not copy someone else’s machine. Instead of replicating these machines, make it your goal to improve, alter, or modernize them. Potential sources of inspiration include:


Rube Goldberg’s original cartoons

Rube Goldberg Competition submissions
Youtube videos of functioning Rube Goldberg machines

, Rube Goldberg machines transform traditional building materials, everyday items, and unique objects into functional pieces of equipment that work together to execute a simple task. Spend time gathering items from around your house, purchasing materials from stores, and/or hunting for unique objects at flea markets. Possible building materials include:


Dominos
Wooden boards
Toilet paper rolls
CDs or floppy discs
Fans
Toy cars
Skateboards
Action figures
PVC pipe
Duct Tape
Peg boards
Zip Ties
Magnets
Marbles
String
Get creative!, Lay out all of your materials on your work surface. Once you’re organized, start playing with the items. As you experiment, combine the materials in unexpected ways to form chain reactions. While you work, keep a record of what combinations worked.


Ask yourself questions throughout the process. What object can you use to send a car down a wooden ramp? What materials will you need to make a pendulum? What can you make with a lever, a marble, and an action figure?

, Rube Goldberg machines complete a simple task with a complex chain reaction. You can break down the chain reaction into several different steps, or phases. The steps are connected together by a link. When you design the machine, it is helpful to start with the last step and work your way to the first step. You can create the building plan by listing these steps or drawing the machine. For example:


Task: Pop a balloon.
Step 3: A tack will pop the balloon. The tack will be attached to the front of a toy car.
Link 1: The toy car will slide down a wooden ramp.
Step 2: A pendulum will swing into the car and push it down the wooden ramp.
Step 1: I will send the pendulum towards the car at the top of the wooden ramp.

, Sit down at your workspace with your notes and building plan. Quickly construct a prototype of your Rube Goldberg machine. This version of your machine doesn’t have to be perfect. You’ll build a final product later after you test it.


If you run into an issue, don’t panic. Return to your notes and see if you can combine the materials in a different way.
If you are using tools, ask an adult for help., Once your prototype is complete, test the machine. This first test is to determine if your machine works. If the machine completes the task, proceed to the next step. If the machine doesn’t complete the task, rethink—don’t scrap—your design.


Can you quickly fix the problem?
Do you need to replace an entire step?
Are you using the best materials?
Is your task possible to achieve?

, When you machine has passed the feasibility test, you can construct a sturdier version of your Rube Goldberg machine. Assess the machine’s repeatability—its ability to complete the task several times in a row. A test is successful if the machine operates on its own. Test and adjust the machine until it completes the task five times. If the test is successful, make minor alterations and continue on to the final test. If you the machine doesn’t produce five successful tests within an hour, redesign your machine.


What steps are working?
What steps are preventing the machine from working?
Is your task achievable?

, After your machine passes the repeatability test, determine if it is reliable. You will test the machine a total of four times. A reliable machine will complete the task at least three out of four times. If your machine passes this test, you’ve created a working Rube Goldberg machine.


Before you present the machine, practice taking it apart and putting it back together several times.

Finished.

",How to Make Plastic Tubing Necklaces2," Instead of haphazardly throwing a bunch of filling into the tube, thinking about how you want the necklace to appear and what look you hope to achieve. Perhaps draw the design on paper.

, This should be done based on personal preference and overall fashion goals.


Use other necklaces to help you determine the length of your necklace. While other necklaces won’t lay the same way, using other pieces of jewelry as your guide can give you somewhat of an idea of how long you’d like the tubing to be.
Remember that plastic tubing does not lay the same way as chains or pearls so keep that in mind when styling longer necklaces.

, Slide the thin, metal nail through the top of the cord end with the head portion facing the bottom.


Cut the thin metal nail approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) from the top once it’s fully threaded through the cord end. Use wire cutters if your scissors can’t cut through the metal.
Bend the metal nail backward and into the top of the cord end so you create a loop.

, This will provide a barrier at the end and prepare the tube for filling.


Allow the glued cord end ample amount of time to dry before filling. If it is still wet, the cord end could become unglued after being filled, creating a mess.

, This may take some time as you will want to be neat and tidy when adding glitter or stones.


Consider using a small funnel to guide filling neatly into the plastic tubing. If you don’t own a small funnel, simply create one from a piece of paper by rolling it sideways and then placing the smaller end into the top of the tube.

, This time you may want to add a clasp. The easiest way to add the clasp is to slide it through the cord end loop as you create it. Before you bend the thin metal nail backwards to create the loop, slide the clasp through the nail and then bend the nail into the loop.

Cut the bag lid or top as shown by the lines within the pink area of the diagram. Cut a slight curve across the top of the base part of the bag, as shown in the diagram.






Cut off a ring from the very top part of the tube (the area just under the neck that you've already removed). This will become the bag's handle.






Use a hole punch to punch out a circle in the top part of the bag, as shown in the diagram above. The hole must be the same size as the plastic bead you're using as the button clasp.






For the smaller hole, use a small sharp object to pierce it. You may want to leave making this until the next section (Making the Button Clasp).






If needed, tidy up the base of the bag by trimming (but don't cut it open).







, If the tube already has a design printed on it that you're happy with, you can skip this step. On the other hand, if you don't like the proprietary design, you can fix it using decorative tape.
Stick on a basic shape or make a collage using decorative tape.






Make sure that it covers up any ugly print or imagery that you don't want to show.






Use any other decorative items to embellish as liked.







, Going by the measurement of the plastic thread, make a small hole as shown in the diagram, large enough to admit the plastic thread.

, To know how to make the ball, refer to the plastic ball making method outlined in How to make a reminder ring from a plastic tag thread.

, Follow with the large plastic bead. Pull this tight against the small hole in the bag.

, Pull the bead tightly against the small hole. Make another plastic ball to firmly attach the remaining thread in place (see method above). Trim off any excess thread.

, When the lid is closed, this will turn into a handle that can be held upward.

Draw the blade.,
Decide on blade length.,
Design the tang.",How to Make a Knife1," Use graph paper to design the shape of your blade. Try to keep it as close to actual size as possible to ease construction.


Get creative with your blade design, but keep functionality and practicality in mind.;
, The length of the blade is largely a personal preference, though large blades can be unwieldy and require lots of steel.

, The tang is the piece of the blade that attaches to the handle. The easiest method is known as the “full tang.” The tang will be the same thickness as the knife, and the handle is formed by attaching a piece of wood to each side with rivets.

"
"
Obtain carbon steel.,
Pick your handle material.,
Trace your blade.,
Assemble your tools.",How to Make a Knife2," There are many different kinds and grades of steel. Do not use stainless steel, as the metal is difficult to work with and the blade will not be as fine. 01 is a popular carbon steel for blade making because it is easy to douse when hot.


Try to get a slab or bar between 1/8 to ¼ inch thick.

, Wood is an easy one to work with, though you can make a handle out of anything you would like. Since this guide is for a full tang knife, pick a material that you can attach with rivets. G10, micarta, and kirinite all are good choices and are waterproof.

, Using a permanent marker, trace your blade onto the slab. This will be the guide you use when you cut the steel. Be sure to trace the tang as well, because the blade and tang are one connected piece.


Make adjustments to the size as necessary once you see the outline on the metal.

, You will need a hacksaw, an angle grinder with a hard wheel and flap wheel, a vise, a drill, and protective wear also a few other tools you could have are bandsaw and a grizzly or KMG grinder. You will need several replacement blades for the saw.

"
"
Use the hacksaw to cut the metal.,
Grind the profile.,
Grind the edge.,
Drill your rivet holes.,
Finish the blade.",How to Make a Knife3," Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade.

, Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade.

, Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade.


Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over.

, Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes.

, Sand the blade using successively finer grits of sandpaper, up to 220 grit. Be sure to take the time to sand out any scratches. Sand all areas of the blade. This will increase its luster and quality.


Sand in opposite directions each time you change grits.
You can use a file to add ridges to the inside near the handle. Trace a pattern and file the metal away.

"
"
Prepare the forge.,
Heat the blade.,
Preheat your oven.,
Sand the blade again.",How to Make a Knife4," The best way to heat treat a blade is using a forge. For smaller blades, a torch can work as a substitute. For a forge, either a coal or gas forge will work.


Prepare your hardening bath. To cool the knife, you will need to douse it in a hardening bath. What you use depends on the type of steel, but for 01 you can use a bucket of motor oil. You need to be able to completely submerge the blade in the bucket.

, Keep it heating until the metal is orange. Tap it against a magnet to see if it is hot enough. When the steel reaches the correct temperature, it loses its magnetic properties. Once it does not stick, let it cool by air. Repeat this process 3 times.


On the 4th time, instead of letting it air cool, douse it in the oil bath. Be aware that there will be fire when the blade is put into the oil, so be sure that you are properly protected.
When the blade is hardened, it can break when dropped, so handle carefully.

, Set your oven for 425°. Put the blade on the middle rack and cook it for 1 hour. Once that hour is up, heat treatment is complete.

, Use increasingly finer grits of paper, going past 220 and up to around 400 grit. Polish the blade if you want some extra shine.

"
"
Cut out your handle pieces.,
Attach the pieces with epoxy.,
Use a saw to perform the final cuts and adjustments to the handle.",How to Make a Knife5," For a full tang knife, there are two pieces of handle, one on each side. Cut and sand the pieces at the same time to ensure that both sides are symmetrical.

, Drill the holes for the rivets on each side. Avoid getting epoxy on the blade, as it can be difficult to remove. Place it in a vise and let it dry overnight.

, Insert the rivets, leaving about an extra 1/8” sticking out each side, and peen them with a ball-peen hammer. File the rivets down and sand the handle.

Prepare the sharpening stone.,
Hold the blade at a 20° angle from the surface of the sharpening stone.,
Test the blade.",How to Make a Knife6," You’ll need a large sharpening stone for these steps. Lightly coat the rough side of the stone with sharpening oil.

, Push the blade across the stone in a cutting motion. Raise the handle while moving the blade to sharpen all the way to the tip. After a few strokes, flip the blade over to the other side.


After you have a sharp edge on every part of the blade, repeat the sharpening on the fine side of the sharpening stone.

, Hold a piece of printer paper in your hand and cut down near where you’re holding with the knife. A properly sharpened blade should be able to easily slice the paper into ribbons.

Cut the ball bearing track.,
Drill holes in the ball bearing track.,
Drill a hole in the tier tab.",How to Make a Hidden Blade1," This hidden blade is the real deal, and you're probably going to need to take a trip to the hardware store to get all the right parts and tools. You can get all of these parts for between 35 and 40 dollars depending on where you live. Here's what you'll need to make your own hidden blade:









Hidden blade parts:

A 14-inch standard drawer slide. Get a flat drawer slide meant to be fitted to the middle of a drawer. This will become the case for the hidden blade.2 extension springs, 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) by 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm), 8.46 pound work weight. The springs should look thick and fat.A pack of flathead Phillips screws size #8-32 thread, 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, with nuts.
A key ring that will slip easily over your finger.
Some fishing line. Get clear line so you won't be able to see it against your hand.
A 14-inch piece of aluminum metal sheeting.
A 14-inch piece of cardboard.
Industrial strength velcro.
An old belt or piece of leather.


Tools you'll need:

A pair of pliers.
A dremel.
A drill.
Scissors.
A metal file.
Some WD-40.

;
, The drawer slide will consist of three separate tiers. Start by pushing the black latch under the top tier and removing the top tier from the slide, then bend the metal tab located at the end of the large bottom tier and slide out the middle tier, the one with the ball bearing track inside it. 








You can put the top and bottom tiers away, since you won't need them for the rest of the project.
You'll also have extra ball bearings. Save these in case you lose parts as you go along; you might need replacements.

, Do this by popping off the tab or cap at the end of the tier, making sure to save it. Slide out the ball bearing track and make sure to keep all of the ball bearings.








, Hold your arm in front of you with your elbow bent and your palm facing up. Lay the tier against your forearm, with the end of the tier resting at your wrist. Decide how much length you'll need to take off to have the tier rest comfortably against your arm; it should end a few inches from your elbow crease. Use the dremel to cut the appropriate length from the end of the tier that does not have a cap.









Do not cut off the end of the tier where you popped off the tab or cap to take out the ball bearing track. You'll need to be able to replace that piece later.
Use the metal file to file down any sharp edges after you make the cut.
Take safety precautions when you're cutting the metal. Wear safety goggles and work in an appropriate workspace.

, Use the pliers to bend in the two end edges of the tier on the side that does not have a cap. This will prevent the ball bearing track from falling out when you slide it back in.








, Cut out a rectangular piece of metal from the center of the tier with the dremel. Make sure you don't cut out the area where the cap will be reattached at one end of the tier, and leave an inch of metal at the pinched end of the tier as well. Discard the rectangular piece you cut out, and file the sharp edges on the tier.








, It should have five openings, and you'll need to cut it so that it you've got a row of just three. Use the dremel to make a straight cut to shorten the ball bearing track.









The shortened track should hold 6 ball bearings on each side.
If your tier is on the longer side and you can fit a longer track inside it, you can cut the ball bearing track down to four openings instead. Don't cut it shorter than 3, though, since it needs to have at least 3 openings to work properly.

, Use the drill to create two holes in the track between the openings. Ensure the holes are big enough for the screws to fit.








, Take the plastic tab you removed from the middle tier. Drill a hole the same size as the holes on the ball bearing track. You'll need to be able to fasten it to the track when it's time to put the contraption together.

Turn the tomato cage upside-down.,
Cut a length of wire about 15 inches (38.1 cm) long.

,
By looping and twisting the wire, bind the staking spikes together.,
Begin attaching the vine at the bottom (round opening) of the tomato cage and with the cut/loose end of the vine.,
Using a length of wire about 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) long, fasten the end of the vine to the bottom of the cage, starting at a position where a frame wire of the cage meets the rounded base.,
Repeat this step until you have gone completely around the base.

,
Move on to the next ""row"" by bringing the vine up a few inches and anchoring it firmly to a frame wire.,
Continue around the circumference of the tomato cage, raising the the vine a few inches with each round; you are creating a spiral effect with each row.,
When you reach the top peak, sever the vine with a pruning shears, leaving a few extra inches to extend above the area where you bound the staking spines together.,
Examine your finished project.",How to Make a Grape Vine Tree," (The 3 or 4 staking spines of the cage will be at the top.);
,, (See ""warnings"".) Use the needle-nosed pliers to tug the wire tightly as you go. When this step is completed, your tomato cage will look like a skeleton frame of a tepee made of wire.

, (If you are using vine that came from a disassembled wreath form, remove the tied vines that hold the wreath together and drop the whole ""wreath"" over the cage.) Support the vine out of your way by attaching clothes pins or spring-loaded clamps or open-ended ""S"" hooks to the upper cage wires.

, Loop your length of wire to connect the vine, the base, and the frame wire together. Pull your cut length of wire tightly with the needle nosed pliers, and snip off any excess wire.

,, (How ""open"" you want your finished tree to be will depend upon how closely you space each row.)

, Whenever you meet a crosswire of the frame, take advantage of the extra support you will achieve by anchoring there.

, This helps to camouflage the top-notch.

, Using the pruning shears, trim off any unwanted vine tendrils. Look for wires that require snipping, tucking, or tightening.

Create a tester blade.,
Cut the metal blade.,
Cut down the screws.,
Fasten the blade to the ball bearing track.,
Put the ball bearing track back into the middle tier.,
Add a spring and replace the black cap.,
Attach fishing line.",How to Make a Hidden Blade2," Cut a length of cardboard so that it's the size and shape of a blade that will fit within the ball bearing track. The end of the ""blade"" should align with the end of the track. Make two holes in the cardboard that align with the holes you drilled in the ball bearing track.








, Trace the cardboard blade cutout onto a piece of sheet metal, including the two holes in the middle. Cut the blade shape from the metal and drill two holes in the middle.








, The screws will be too long, so you'll need to cut them down by about half using the dremel.








, Place the ball bearing track upside down on your table, so that the ridge parts are facing down and the flat side is up. Lay the blade on top of the ball bearing track so that the screw holes are aligned. Thread screws through the holes and keep them in place with the nuts.








, Insert it so that the blade is pointing toward the pinched end of the tier. The ball bearing track should slide in easily; make sure all the ball bearings are in their correct place.








, Place the spring over the second screw on the blade. Now replace the black cap and screw it on tight, holding it in place with a nut. This will hold the whole contraption together.








, Lay the tier against your forearm and cut a length of fishing line that extends from the second screw on the blade to your middle finger. Make sure it's long enough to wrap around your finger while your hand is in a fist, and add a little extra to make sure you can tie it around a key ring. Tie one end of the line over the second screw, making sure to slip it over the nut so it will stay in place, and tie the other end around a key ring.









Make sure the fishing line is cut to the right length. It shouldn't be too taut, but if it's too loose it won't work. When the ring is around your middle finger and your fist is closed, the line should be snug. When you open your hand, it should pull the blade out.
Move the line back and forth to test whether the blade moves easily along the track.

Attach velcro strips to the underside of the tier.,
Make belt straps.,
Attach the straps to the hidden blade.,
Put the blade on.,
Discharge the blade.",How to Make a Hidden Blade3," Cut two one-inch pieces of velcro. Attach one piece to the underside of the front of the track, and another piece to the underside of the other end of the track. Make sure you don't attach the velcro to the plastic tab piece.








, Cut the belt into two strips: one to wrap around your forearm, the other to wrap around your wrist. Attach velcro pieces to the insides of the straps so that they fasten snugly around your forearm and wrist.








, Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces on the tier and attach the tier to the two belt straps. Remember to position it so that the blade point should be directed toward your hand, away from your body.








, Strap the blade to the underside of your forearm by attaching the belt at your upper forearm and wrist. Arrange the keyring around your middle finger and make a fist with your hand.









Hide the blade under a loose long-sleeved shirt.
Make sure it's positioned so that it won't cut your hand or clothes.

, Point your arm away from your body and open your hand. The keyring will pull the fishing line, which will trip the blade and send it springing forward. When you let go of the keyring, the blade will retract.

Create a mock centerpiece.,
Determine what type of steel bucket or container you’d like to use.",How to Make a Holiday Centerpiece Using a Metal Bucket1," Do you want an offbeat, funky centerpiece or are you looking for something more traditional and refined? Having an idea of style will help you best determine what supplies you’ll need.;
, Perhaps where you live you have no access to certain items like pinecones or birch tree limbs. Especially if you want to work with native or found items, you may need to consider what you have easy access to and can be intuitively integrated into your motif.

, In many cases you’ll never know if the centerpiece will really work unless you produce a “pretend” or mock centerpiece. Even if you don’t have the supplies, either sketch or assemble (using other items) a centerpiece that takes into consideration weight, height and girth.

, Craft stores offer an endless number of containers or adorable metal buckets in a variety of colors so once you’ve identified your style, visualize or select the centerpiece bucket.

"
"
Hunt for “found items.” Part of what makes this centerpiece unique is that you can integrate items found in nature or within your home.,
Hit the craft or home store for items like ribbon, decorative flourishes (such as faux flowers, ornaments etc.).,
Select the right bucket or container to hold your centerpiece.",How to Make a Holiday Centerpiece Using a Metal Bucket2," Take a nature walk and pick out rocks, minerals or vegetation that won’t wither or wilt quickly.

Disassemble 2 dual-action (extension and contraction) switchblades.,
Cut the end off of 1 switchblade casing.,
Remove the notch at the blade tip end of the switchblade casing you did not cut.,
Weld the 2 switchblade casings together to create 1 long hidden blade casing.,
Alter the 2 switchblade casing faces to coincide with the switchblade casings.,
Make your blade.,
Modify 1 of the switchblade mechanisms.,
Replace the inner parts of the casing.,
Create the trigger rod for your hidden blade.,
Connect the trigger rod to the hidden blade casing using self-tapping screws.

",How to Make a Hidden Blade with Household Materials,"


Unscrew all of the casing screws. Set the screws in a safe place for later use.
Take off the casing face to reveal the inside parts of the switchblades.
Remove the trigger (the part used to engage the extension and contraction actions), spring (be careful not to bend or stretch it), mechanism, blade rivet and blade from the casing.
Use needle-nose pliers to pull the doors and the small springs from the narrow holes of the side chambers.
Set all parts aside for later use. You will need them to create your real hidden blade.;
,


Hold the casing horizontally and locate the side spring chamber hole closest to where the blade base mounts.
Use a permanent marker to draw a line that vertically bisects the casing at the outer (nearest the casing end) edge of the hole.
Saw the end (where the blade base mounts) off at the line you marked, using either an angle grinder or a hacksaw.
Insert a file into the blade chamber and file away any metal shards. The real hidden blade will need to move freely inside the chamber.

, Use the angle grinder to cut off the notch, resulting in a continuous straight edge for the lower blade chamber wall. Scrape any remaining metal shards out of the blade chamber using a file.

,


Arrange the cut and uncut switchblade casings length to length, so that a blade can be inserted into 1 end of the cut casing and reach the stop end of the uncut casing. The cut end of the cut switchblade casing should meet with the blade exit end of the uncut casing.
Cut the thick aluminum bar to the length of the combined switchblade casings, plus enough extra space at each end to attach wristbands, if you want to create an Assassins Creed wrist blade.
Spread a cold weld compound on the entire length of the cut aluminum bar.
Set the end-to-end switchblade casings on the aluminum bar.
Test for proper casing alignment by inserting a blade into the casing and sliding it all the way to the end.
Allow the cold weld compound to set according to manufacturer's instructions.

,


Cut the end off of 1 casing face at the same place you cut its corresponding casing. Hold the face next to the casing to mark the cutting line with a permanent marker before cutting.
Use the angle grinder to cut out the metal stopper at the end of the blade chamber on the other, longer casing face. The result should be a blade chamber that runs the entire length of the casing face in a uniform width.

,


Clamp the end of a switchblade blade to the end of the other piece of aluminum flat bar. You will be using the switchblade blade as a template for your real hidden blade. The blade and the aluminum flat bar should be the same width and thickness.
Choose a drill bit that is exactly the size of the rivet hole in the switchblade blade, and drill through the blade hole that is clamped to the aluminum flat bar to make a corresponding hole in the aluminum bar.
Trace the blade end onto the opposite end of the aluminum bar, then use an angle grinder to cut the aluminum bar into the shape of the blade.

,


Locate the ramp-shaped protrusion on 1 of the long sides of the mechanism. There will be another irregular, stair-like protrusion on the opposite side and end of the mechanism, which you will leave alone.
Cut off the ramp-shaped protrusion so that the entire corresponding side edge is a smooth, straight line.
Set the uncut mechanism into its appropriate position in the modified casing, then lay the cut mechanism in its place at the other end of the casing and mark the place on the end of the cut mechanism where it overlaps with the uncut piece.
Cut off the end section of the cut mechanism that overlaps the uncut mechanism so that both mechanism pieces fit snugly, end to end, inside the hidden blade casing.

,


Use either your fingers or needle-nose pliers to insert the doors and small springs back into the side chamber holes in the same positioning as they were before you removed them. Only put them in the holes closest to both ends, and make sure the door notches are facing the outside edges of the casing.
Insert the real hidden blade into its chamber. Place the blade rivet in its hole once the blade is midway down the casing shaft and leave the blade in that position.
Set the mechanisms in place.
Place the long spring in the casing where it belongs. Attach its hook at the base end of the casing.
Insert the switch in its place.
Fit the casing face that covers the spring hook in place. The loose end of the spring should be exposed. Screw the casing face to the casing.
Stretch the other end of the spring, holding only the spring hook, to the other end of the hidden blade casing and attach in place.
Cover the exposed casing with the other casing face and screw the 2 parts together.

,


Drill a hole through 1 end of the aluminum rod, wide enough for the key ring.
Hold the aluminum rod so that the end opposite of the key ring end is aligned with the switchblade trigger that is farthest from the blade opening.
Mark where both triggers line up on the aluminum rod.
Bend the aluminum rod where the switchblade ends, so that the rod comes up to meet your hand, where the key ring will be around your finger.
Drill holes into both triggers, from the top outside to the inside (side facing the casing).
Align the aluminum rod with the switchblade casing, where it will be attached to the triggers. Drill holes through the aluminum rod at both trigger marks, from top to bottom (leading into trigger holes).

Cut one inch off the stems at an angle.,
Place the cut stems in fresh, lukewarm water.,
Remove any leaves below the water line.,
Keep the flowers in a cool, dark spot.,
Replace the flower water every three days.",How to Perk Up Wilting Flowers1," Cut flowers may look great in a vase in your kitchen but inevitably, bacteria in the water and on the surface of the flowers will clog up the stems. You will need to re-cut the stems to remove the clogged portions of the stem and prevent the flowers from wilting and dying. Use garden shears, pruners, or a sharp knife to make a clean cut at a 45 degree angle. This will ensure the cuts are clean and smooth.Cut about 1 inch of the stems, making sure that are the flowers are relatively even in length, as this will ensure they all perk up at the same time.;
, Do this as soon as the stems have been cut to prevent air bubbles from becoming trapped in the stems. The air bubbles can block the flow of water up the stems and lead to wilted, dying flowers.Though some florists advocate for the use of cold water or warm water, lukewarm water will help to revive the flowers just as well. Warm water can bring moisture to the flowers faster, but may shock the flowers and lead to wilting.
The exceptions to this rule are bulbs like tulips and hyacinths. These flowers prefer cold water.

, Leaves that sit in the water or fall into the water can foul up the water as they rot and deteriorate. Only remove leaves that sit below the water line in the vase of water as higher leaves can help to pump water to the stems.You should also remove any other debris that is sitting in the water, such as fallen petals or bugs. This debris can introduce bacteria into the water that can cause the flowers to wilt.

, The cooler and darker the environment around your flowers, the longer they will live. Avoid placing them in direct sunlight. Look for a spot in your home that is cool in temperature and does not get a lot of light.The exception to this rule is sunflowers, which often need more light than other cut flowers.
You should also keep the flowers away from ripening fruit, such as bananas. Ripening fruit give off a gas called ethylene, which can significantly shorten the lifespan of your flowers., Keep your flowers looking fresh by replacing the flower water with fresh water every three days. The rule is, if you wouldn’t drink the vase water yourself, it probably isn’t clean enough for your flowers.If there seems to be a lot of gunk and debris in the flower vase, you may want to quickly rinse out the flower vase before replacing the water and putting the flowers back in the vase. A clean vase will prevent bacteria from infecting your flowers."

Put floral preservative in the water.,
Add three teaspoons of sugar to the water.,
Make a citrus based soda and bleach mixture.,
Add diluted vodka to the water.,
Try adding crushed Aspirin to the water.,
Put a copper penny in the water.",How to Perk Up Wilting Flowers2," Most cut flower bouquets come with a pack of floral preservative that you can mix into the flower water. You should always add this into the water to keep the flowers perky and fresh.Follow the directions on the package to make sure you are using the correct amount of floral solution per the amount of water in the vase. Too much water can result in a diluted solution and too little water can result in a solution that is too strong for the flowers.
Floral preservatives are effective because they provide food for the flowers in the form of sugar, they contain ingredients that kill bacteria and fungi, and they acidify the water.

, Sugar can help to feed the flowers and perk them up. You can use baking white sugar and stir it into the vase water so it combines well.You can also add one to two teaspoons of white vinegar to the water in addition to the sugar. Vinegar can help to get rid of bacteria in the water that could weaken the flowers., A citrus based soda like 7-UP can provide acidity and sugar for the flowers, which can help them to stay fresh. To combat the bacteria growth in the flower water, you can also add a small amount of bleach. This mixture can help to prolong the lifespan of the flowers and prevent bacteria growth in the flower water.To create a citrus based soda and bleach mixture, you can combine two cups of soda (not diet) with two cups water. Add one teaspoon household chlorine bleach. Mix well and place the freshly cut flowers into the mixture.You can also use two tablespoons lemon juice and one tablespoon sugar instead of two cups soda if you do not have access to soda.

, Vodka can help to prevent the production of ethylene gas, which can cause wilting. You will need to dilute the vodka to avoid poisoning the flowers.Add 1 tablespoon vodka to one to two cups of water.

, Aspirin contains nitric oxide, which can help to slow down the dying process in plants. To try this method, crush 1 mg or two tablets of Aspirin and let it dissolve into the water.Viagra will also work the same way as it contains nitric oxide.
In one test of the Aspirin method, the flower heads stayed perky until day 5 of the trial and the stems of the flowers turned gray., The copper in the penny can act as an antibacterial agent and prevent the growth of bacteria that could weaken the flowers. Make sure the copper penny is clean before putting it into the flower water."

Give the potted flowers more water if the top soil is dry.,
Trim and remove any deadheads.,
Add slow-release fertilizer to the soil.,
Move the flowers to a new pot.",How to Perk Up Wilting Flowers3," Outdoor flowers and plants often wilt due to a lack of moisture and a lack of water. This is especially common if it has been hot and dry outside, as the plant may need to use more water in its soil to stay hydrated. Check if the top soil is dry by sticking your forefinger into the soil so it is a few inches into the soil. If the soil is dry to the touch, the plant likely needs a good watering.Water the plants in the early morning as this will help them conserve water for the rest of the day. If the flowers are planted in a flower bed, make sure you put mulch around the flowers as this can help to reduce soil evaporation.Be generous with the water, as it can be difficult to overwater potted plants, particularly if the pot has good drain holes at the bottom. You should check the potted plants daily in the morning to ensure the top soil is not too dry and water the flowers again if the soil is still dry.
If the soil appears to have moved away from the sides of the pot and is very dry, you may need to poke small holes into the soil with a pen to ensure the water reaches the plant's roots. If you do not do this, the water could simply flood the sides of the pot and not reach the roots at all., Deadheads are flower heads that have died or shrivelled up on the stem. You should trim off deadheads with gardening shears to signal to the plant that it is time to release fresh buds. Cut just below the deadheads but avoid trimming off too much of the stem on the plant.You should also remove any brown leaves and brown petals to give your flowers a chance to refresh itself.

, You can buy a potting soil mix that contains slow-release fertilizer or you can add slow-release fertilizer to the soil after the flowers have already been potted. Slow-release fertilizer can help the flowers stay healthy, but you may also need to fertilize the plant weekly to keep it looking perky.Use water-soluble fertilizer that has a formula of 15-30-15 or 20-10-20. Another option is to alternate with a ""bloom booster"" formula that is high in phosphorus (10-52-10). This will help to stimulate the growth of new flowers.

, If the flowers are really wilting and looking sad, you may want to consider replanting the flowers in a new pot. Use potting soil that contains slow-release fertilizer in your new pot and take the time to water and fertilize the flowers in their new pot. This could give your potted flowers the extra boost they need to stay healthy and vibrant.Make sure the pot has good drainage holes so the water can be soaked up by the soil when you water the flowers.

, A dirty vase can severely shorten the lifespan of your cut flowers.Using a mild soap and hot water, be sure you rinse and scrub free any grime or dust from your flower container. Once you are satisfied, use a clean towel to wipe it dry.

, Put a quart of warm water into your flower container, or in a separate container if yours does not have enough space for a full quart of liquid. In the warm water, add two tablespoons of lemon juice, one tablespoon of sugar, and ¼ teaspoon of bleach to your water.Stir the solution until it appears the ingredients have blended together.

, If your container was too small for you to mix your vase preservative in, after it is blended, add it to your clean, empty container until it is ½ to ¾ full. If you were able to prepare your preservative in-vase, simply add your flowers.

, Plants are easily harmed by the bacteria that can build up in your vase.By adding a ¼ teaspoon of bleach to your solution every four days, you will help protect your flowers while keeping the water from becoming cloudy.You can also protect against bacteria buildup by changing the water in your container every three to four days., If you don't have lemon juice on hand, you may find it a little more convenient to create a vase preservative with lemon-lime soda. Be sure you do not use any brands that are diet or have cola as an ingredient; these can harm your flowers.Simply:


Mix one part lemon-lime soda with three parts water and add ¼ teaspoon of household bleach. For example, you might use one cup lemon-lime soda mixed with three cups of water and ¼ teaspoon of bleach.

, You should cut the stems at an angle while submerged in either a basin of water or running water.Exposing the cut end of your flower to open air can be damaging, especially since this is one of the points when flower tissue is most hungry for water.Additionally, you should try to cut your flowers in the early morning or late evening, as these are the best times to cut flowers., If you notice that your flowers, when cut, exude a milky liquid, you can prolong the life of these with a quick boil in water. Soak the bottom two inches of your cut stems in boiling water for ten seconds before putting into a vase.Two common flowers that can benefit from boiling are poinsettias and poppies.

, If your flowers have leaves all the way down the stem, these can rot in your water and cause mold to grow.Remove all leaves on your stems that will be below the waterline.

, You can determine whether your water is hard or not by noting mineral deposits on facets and kettles. These will often look like a white, scaly film when dry. If this is the case at your home, your plants will fare better with demineralized water, to which you can add vase preservative.Demineralized water is sold at most supermarkets and should be used in your vase solutions as well if you have hard water.

, Your homemade plant preservative will likely work even more effectively than commercial recipes, but these are an easy to use and inexpensive substitute if you lack the ingredients for the DIY recipe. Many times, a commercial preservative requires only a clean vase and warm water, though you should always follow the directions on the packet., If you plan on using florist foam to give your arrangement a little more stability, allow it to soak in water until it sinks on its own accord. Forcing your foam to the bottom of your container can trap air bubbles in it, which can lead to wilting and flower death.Never reuse foam; holes from a previous arrangement may harmfully expose the cut end of your stems to air.
Do not pull up on a flower inserted into your foam. This could cause an air pocket to form beneath the foam, which can cause wilting or flower death.

, You'll want your flowers to be kept cool and out of the sun. Avoid placing your flowers on top of or near televisions, heaters, or fireplaces. Heat will leach moisture from your flowers, causing wilting to occur more quickly., A cool place out of the sunlight will prevent your flowers from drying out due to heat.Light from the sun will trigger a maturation response in your flowers that will cause early decay., Some claim that these work to help prolong the life of cut flowers, however, many experts insist that aspirin and vinegar rarely increase the longevity of flower life.You are much better off making your own flower preservative or using a commercial one.

, Cut flowers can drink a surprising amount of water in a short period of time; make sure you are adding a little fresh water to your container every day. If you have hard water, you'll want to top off your vase with demineralized water. On every second or third day, you should change your water entirely and replenish your preservative at that time as well."

Understand why copper coins don't work.",How to Keep Flowers Fresh," Different flowers last for different lengths of time, and should be cut in different stages of development. Flowers with multiple buds on each stem, such as delphinia and lilacs, should have at least one bud starting to open and showing internal color.Plants that have one flower per stem, such as marigolds and sunflowers, will do best when they are allowed to fully open before they are cut., Flowers lose less water in cool weather, and especially during the cool portions of the day/night cycle. Cut fresh flowers in the early morning whenever possible, so they will retain more water and stay fresh longer.The late evening is also an option, although the flowers will not have the benefit of night dew at the time.

, Always use a clean container, to reduce the risk of bacteria and other microorganisms infecting your flowers. Choose a container with a neck wide enough to easily fit the flower stems.


Keep flowers with different lengths of stems in separate containers, so that all flowers are clearly visible.

, Immediately after cutting the flowers, put the stems in 110ºF (43.5ºC) water, and keep the container in a cool location for an hour or two. The hot water molecules move more quickly up the stem, while the flowers lose less water to cool air. The combination of these effects can provide the flowers with a huge increase in the amount of water it consumes, increasing the flower's lifespan.This process is called ""hardening.""

, The ends of cut flower stems should always have access to water. Lukewarm water may be easier for flowers to absorb, so add room temperature water to the container if you are not using the hot water method described above.Flowers still attached to bulbs do better in cold water., Leaves kept under the water level can rot and provide food for bacteria, which in turn can infect and damage the rest of the plant.Cut off any leaves touching the water, whenever you notice them.

, Replace the water every day to keep your flowers fresh. Make sure all debris is removed from the container before adding fresh water, to reduce the risk of infection.Water is necessary even if the flowers come with floral foam to hold them in place. Let the foam sink into the water at its own pace, since forcing it down may trap harmful air bubbles in the stems.

, You may trim the stems every time you change the water, or at least every few days. Use sharp scissors, shears, or a knife to cut the stems at a slant of 45º angle. An angled cut increases the surface area the flower can use to absorb water.Trim the stems of store-bought flowers immediately before placing them in water.
Roses are especially susceptible to getting air bubbles trapped in the stem, which can prevent water uptake. Prevent this by cutting roses underwater., Flower preservatives or ""flower food"" for cut flowers are available from florists, gardening supply stores, and supermarkets. These should have all the ingredients flowers need to thrive, including sugar for energy, acid to stabilize the color and the water pH, and a biocide to kill bacteria and fungi.Use this according to the packaging instructions.


If you don't want to purchase a commercial preservative, or if the commercial product is not effective, see the section on home flower preservatives for easy homemade alternatives.

, Keep cut flowers away from direct sun, heaters, the top of television sets, and other sources of heat. Avoid placing them in the same room as fruit, which releases ethylene gas that can cause wilting.Drafts and breezes, even cool ones, increase water loss and therefore reduce the flowers' lifespan. Avoid keeping flowers directly under a running ceiling fan.

, Cut off all wilting flowers whenever you notice them, or the ethylene gas they release may cause a chain reaction in your other flowers. Compost them, dry them for decoration, or throw them away in a separate room.

, Sprite, 7 Up, or another clear soda can provide the sugar and acid necessary to keep flowers fresh. Use one part soda to three parts water, then add a few drops of bleach to kill harmful microorganisms.This mixture may even be more effective than some commercial preservatives.


Do not use diet sodas, as these do not contain sugar the plant can use for energy.
Do not use colas and other dark sodas, as these may be too acidic for the plant to handle., Try using a small amount of lemon juice instead, about two tablespoons (30 milliliter) in one quart (or liter) of water. Add a tablespoon (15 mL) of sugar to the mix to provide flower food.As with the recipe above, a few drops of bleach can help control bacteria and fungi.


For smaller containers, just add a few drops of lemon juice and a couple pinches of sugar.If you have harder water with a significant mineral content, you may wish to add a tiny bit more lemon juice to balance this out. Be cautious, however, as too much acid can be harmful to the plant.
Daisies, sunflowers, and their relatives in the Asteraceae family may release gluey material from their stems. Acid is especially important if you are keeping other flowers in the same container as these plants, as it can help prevent stems of other flowers from closing., A few drops of vodka may inhibit the flower's production of ethylene, a gas that causes wilting and ripening.This can be useful, but it is not a replacement for bleach or other substances for killing microorganisms.

, Bleach is sometimes used as a preservative in higher concentrations than a few drops per container. This is risky, as the effects on preservation are highly inconsistent, and may even cause the stems and flowers to lose their color., Ground up aspirin or white vinegar are alternative sources of acid, but tend to be less effective than lemon juice or citrus soda.If aspirin is overused, it may even wither flowers faster or turn the stems grey., Copper can kill fungus, but the copper present in pennies and other copper-coated coins is not soluble in water.Dropping a penny in your water will not increase your flowers' lifespan.

Place flowers in warm water as soon as possible.,
Fill a plastic bucket, one-third to one-half full, with warm water.,
Take the bucket of water into the garden with you.,
Avoid overcrowding flowers.,
Allow flowers to have a good drink for four to five hours, preferably overnight before arranging.,
Use a flower preservative to destroy bacteria in the water.",How to Make Fresh Flowers Last Longer1," Once the stems of flowers have been cut, you have removed their life support system.


Remove the wrapping paper, as paper can bruise the flowers and cellophane can cause them to sweat.
When cut flowers have been left out of water for any length of time, cells start to form over the cut ends of the stems, which will prevent the stems taking up water readily. To remove this sealed portion, snip off about 2.5cm (1"") from the stem ends and then place in water preferably with preservative added, and allow the flowers to have a long drink before arranging.;
, Warm water should be used as flowers take up warm water more readily than cold.


Flowers only drink through the ends of the stems and not through the sides of the stems, and for this reason buckets should not be filled right up to the top with water, as foliage left on stems below the water line will rot and pollute the water. This will feed bacteria and the flowers will die more quickly.
The foliage of Marigolds, Chrysanthemums, Stock and Daisies send off a particularly strong odor when left standing under water over a period of time.

, Use a sharp pair of secateurs and cut the flower stems on an angle - a slanted cut allows a better intake of water. Remove all foliage from the lower portion of the stems which would stand under the water line. Place the flowers immediately in the water.

, Allow enough air to circulate between each flower. Too many flowers crowded together in a bucket may cause the petals to become squashed and bruised. Place the bucket in a cool dark place and allow the flowers to have a long drink before being arranged. When picking short-stemmed flowers, use a smaller container.

, This step is called conditioning. It allows the stems to fill up with water and the flowers will become crisp. These flowers will last twice as long as those that have not been conditioned properly.

, Flower preservatives are available in garden centers or supermarkets. Another alternative is to use a cap-full of household bleach in the water. If a preservative is not used, the water needs to be changed and the stems cut on an angle daily. If a preservative is used, the stems do not require re-cutting and water needs changing only about twice a week. Flowers, like Freesias, Spray Carnations and Liliums, have lots of buds. By using a preservative in the water, it helps develop the buds to open.

Make homemade plant food.,
Trim the flower stems.,
Remove leaves.,
Place the trimmed flowers into the homemade plant food.",How to Make Fresh Flowers Last Longer3," Flowers need food, water, and a clean environment. As such, their water should have a little food, like sugar, and some bleach to slow fungi and bacteria growth. Here's a basic home recipe:


Mix together 1 quart water + 2 tablespoons lemon juice + 1 tablespoon sugar + 1/2 teaspoon bleach. Pour into the vase.

, This is to open the stems up to the water. Cut off the dried bottoms at an angle, the angle allowing them to take up as much water as possible.


Trim the ends, which tend to get gummy and closed, every three or four days to keep them fresh longer.

, Leaves left on the stems below the water level will quickly deteriorate and promote mold. Remove all leaves from the stems below the waterline.

, Top up with water as needed.

Cut your flowers in the morning.,
Place freshly cut flowers in your refrigerator for six hours.,
Recut the stems on your flowers every three days.",How to Preserve Cut Flowers1," Cutting your flowers earlier in the day when it's cool will ensure that the flower has stored carbohydrates, which are required to keep them alive.Keep a bucket of water with you and make sure to transfer them immediately after cutting them. Flowers need a constant stream of food to flourish, and being left out of the water causes them to dry up.


Flowers should be cut at varying maturity levels depending on the type of flower.
Daffodils, roses, irises and gladiolas should be cut in the bud stage, while delphiniums, marigolds, dianthus flowers should be open before cutting.Use a plastic bucket or pail. Metal can throw the flower's pH balance and reduce its lifespan.;
, Refrigeration at 35°F (1.5°C) can triple the lifespan of freshly cut flowers in your house.Doing this before you transfer them to a vase with water slows down water loss, respiration, and development.Your flowers will require less water and die slower if you put them in the fridge.


Slowing down the flower's development will allow it to remain in the flowering stage for a longer period of time before wilting and dying.
You can also pop your flowers in the refrigerator when you are going to sleep to help preserve them for a longer time., Trim one inch from the bottom of the stem at a 45-degree angle using durable gardening tools like shears or clippers. Water bubbles can get trapped on the end of a flower's stem which will prevent it from absorbing water.Keeping your flowers recut will ensure that their water absorption levels remain steady.


Flowers like the sunflower develop sap on the end of their stems after some time. You can remedy this by pouring boiling water on the end of the stems for 20 seconds.Do not crush the stem, as this can damage the flower internally and inhibit water absorption."

Remove bruised leaves and any leaves that are under the water line.,
Use lukewarm water to water your flowers.,
Change the water every two days and clean the vase.,
Keep flowers away from air drafts and direct sunlight.,
Purchase commercial grade floral preservatives.",How to Preserve Cut Flowers2," Use sharp gardening scissors to cut all of the flowers that fall under the water line because it can promote decay in your flowers.Remove any leaves or flower petals that look bruised. If you have roses, do not remove the thorns as this has been shown to reduce the lifetime of the flowers.


Failing to remove damaged leaves or leaves that are under the water line can promote bacterial growth in your vase., Most flowers thrive with lukewarm water because the warm water molecules move faster than cold water molecules and make it easier for the stem to absorb water. As a rule of thumb, keep your water at 100°F to 110°F (37.7°C to 43.3°C).While this applies to most flowers, there are exceptions to this rule. Bulb flowers like hyacinths and tulips need cold water to survive., Bacterial growth and microorganisms thrive inside of a vase. Replace the water in your vase every two to three days to prevent this from happening. Scrub down the sides with a soft dish soap and remember to rinse it thoroughly before placing your flowers back into the vase. Other than promoting decay in your plant, certain bacteria are capable of entering a flower's stem and stopping water absorption as well.If you are using a chemical floral preservative, make sure to replace the nutrients as well as the water.
Use a bottle brush for a vase with a thin neck.
If you are having trouble getting to the crevices of your vessel, mix up a solution containing one part household bleach with ten parts water and allow the vase to soak overnight. Air dry your vase before refilling it with water.

, Hot and cold drafts can promote water loss in your plant and exposure to direct sunlight can cause it to use up all of its stored food.Set them in a cool place in your house that isn't near things like a radiator, television sets, or hot ovens., Commercial grade floral preservatives are available at most home and gardening, hardware, and florist shops. They contain a biocide which prevents bacterial growth, an acidifier which promotes water absorption, and sugar that acts as the plant's food.Replace the flower preservatives when you change the water in your vase.


Use recommended measurements when using floral preservatives.
Homemade flower preservatives usually have mixed results and should be avoided."

Put aspirin and a penny in your vase.,
Mix lemon-lime soda, bleach, and water together.,
Add mouthwash and water to your vase.",How to Preserve Cut Flowers3," Crush up two over-the-counter aspirin with a spoon in a bowl. Once they are crushed, put the dust in the water that your flowers are in, then add a penny to the water. While it has shown varying results, adding a penny should work as a fungicide which should collect bacteria. The aspirin works to increase the water's acidity, which helps water absorption.Asprin has been shown to increase the life of freshly cut carnations., While unproven, the sugar in the soda should provide the energy your flowers need while the bleach should control bacteria. Add one cup of lemon-lime soda, such as 7Up, one cup of water, and a 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of household bleach to the vase that is housing your flowers.You should still replace the water every couple of days when using homemade remedies.

, Add two ounces (59.14 mL) of mouthwash per gallon of water to your flower vase. Mouthwash like Listerine contains sucrose which can act like food and also contains a bactericide which should eliminate bacteria that forms in your vase.


Another benefit of mouthwash is that it acts as an acidic which helps your flowers with water absorption."

, If you leave them, they'll start to foul the water and your flowers will die sooner.

, This will increase in the amount of water your flowers consume, increasing the flower's lifespan.

, Flowers are alive and they need to breathe. If your vase is too crowded, either use a larger vase or move some of the flowers to a different vase.

, Replace the water every day to keep your flowers fresh. Make sure any debris or wet leaves are removed from the vase before adding fresh water.


Be sure the ends on all stems and in the water. Pay attention to the flowers with shorter stems.

, Trim the stems every every couple of days when you're changing the water. Use something sharp to cut the stems at a 45º angle. An angled cut increases the surface area the flower can use to absorb water.

, A florist may use floral foam to hold your flowers in place. Simply pour water on the foam (never the flowers) or let the foam soak in a basin of water.

, This will insure your flowers have all what they need to thrive.

, While esthetics matter, you need to keep your flowers in the best possible environment to keep them longer.


Keep cut flowers away from direct sun and other sources of heat.
Avoid placing them near fruit, which releases ethylene gas that will speed up the maturation process and cause wilting.
Drafts and breezes, even cool ones, can reduce the flowers' lifespan by encouraging evaporation from the petals and leaves.

, Cut off all wilting flowers whenever you notice them so they don't shorten the life of your flowers. Wilting flowers release ethylene gas which will encourage your fresh flowers to speed up their life cycle and wilt prematurely.

Hydrated flowers will last much longer than ones that are cut when they are dehydrated.
Cut the flowers early in the morning before the day heats up to prevent them from drying early.
Use a clean sharp knife to remove flowers at the base of the stem.;
, If you have purchased or been gifted callas, unwrap them as soon as possible. Immediately after unwrapping, get them into water quickly.


If you are unable to do this, put them in a cool, dimly-lit place such as a basement until you can attend to them.
Make sure that they remain cool so they do not wilt.

, Calla lilies are very fragile flowers. The less you can handle them, the better.


Especially avoid handling the flower heads.
If these have been supplied with a protective wrapping, carefully remove it.

, You’ll need a deep vase for tall callas. Use a very clean vase; some florists clean vases using a combination of dish soap and a little bleach.


Rinse very carefully afterwards to remove cleaning product residue.
Any remaining product residue can kill your flowers quickly because it is toxic.

, Measure your calla lilies against your selected vase to determine where best to cut them. Cut them to make sure that they can protrude from the top of the vase while at the same time making sure their stems will remain in the water.


Use a sharp clean knife to cut the stem at a 45 degree angle.
Cutting the stems at an angle maximizes the amount of cut cell in contact with the vase water, which will help the plant take up more water.
Cut them underwater so the cut surface isn’t exposed to the air.
Avoid using a dull knife, or a pair of scissors, as these tend to crush as they cut.
This cell damage stops the plant from being able to absorb water.
Lilies won’t appreciate being crowded in a vase so avoid putting too many into one container.

, Add flower feed to the vase water or, if you have none, a teaspoon of sugar and a drop or two of bleach for every two liters of water.


Some people advise using a dash of Sprite or 7-up instead.
Regular calla lilies will need a vase filled about 2/3 full of water.
Mini callas will want much less than this, as only the lower part of the stem should stand in the water.
This prevents the stem from going soggy on a mini calla.

Avoid putting them near a TV or computer, as these areas can get warm with extended use.
Keep them out of drafts.
Keep them away from fruit bowls, as ripening fruit emits gases that will encourage the flower to mature, shortening its lifespan in the vase.

, Aim to replace the water every day or two and keep it topped up. A steady supply of water is essential to the health of your lilies, and should never be neglected.


Mini callas will probably need additional water more often as they should be sitting in less water than regular ones.

, Some people like to keep their vase in the fridge overnight to preserve the life of their flowers – but be warned you need a big fridge for this!


It’s a bad idea to expose calla lilies to a gas called ethylene, which is produced by some foods, so only store your lilies in an empty fridge.
It’s probably best not to put them in a domestic fridge.

, The water in your vase will need a complete changing every day or two. This is to prevent any bacteria in the water from building up and attacking your lilies.


It also stops the water from smelling.
Callas will absorb a lot of water, so keep it topped up.

, Every second or third day, trim another half inch off the bottom of the stems. This is because the cells at the end of the stem will die.


Refreshing the cut helps exposes fresh cells and helps them absorb water.
Replace the water in your vase when you do this.
Remember to replace the flower feed or whatever additive you were putting into the water.

Finished.

",How to Keep Cut Calla Lilies Fresh3," If you are using calla lilies as part of a wedding bouquet, let them sit in a vase in a cool place until 30 minutes before you need them. Remove them from the water 30 minutes before using them to avoid water dripping onto clothing.


It may be a good idea to dip the cut ends in melted wax to help seal them.
Alternately, try putting a cotton ball at the end of the stem and wrapping it with cloth underneath ribbon.
This will help seal the end to stop it brushing against clothing and leaving a stain.

, Calla lily pollen will stain clothing. You can remove the ‘spadix’ – that’s the yellow finger-shaped thing inside the flowerhead – but this ruins the appearance of the flower.


The best option to avoid staining is to just be careful when you are handling the flowers.

, If your callas are being transported some distance to their final destination, after arrival they need to ‘condition’ in a cool dark room for about 6 hours before you arrange them in a bouquet.


Cut the ends and let them sit in a bucket of lukewarm water in a cool dark place such as a basement
This helps them rehydrate after transport to preserve their lifespan and look their best.
If any are still looking limp after this time, recut the ends and repeat the conditioning.
If any pollen is visible on the flower petal, avoid using the flower.
This is a sign the flower head is more mature and won’t last as long as other flower heads that don’t have visible pollen stains.
Callas last well in a bouquet so long as they are fully hydrated before they are arranged.

Rinse your item in the distilled water.,
Coat your item with the plating solution.,
Rinse your plated piece once more in the distilled water.",How to Gold Plate," This can be a piece of jewelry, a clock part, decorative hardware, a car emblem, etc. The item you want to plate will determine the type of kit you should purchase. Some items such as large pieces may require a 'Brush Plating Kit', whereas other small items such as jewelry should be done with an ""Immersion Plating Kit"". An internet search of those terms will lead you to high quality equipment manufacturers.


Most gold plated jewelry is made with a silver base, but other metals, such as copper or aluminum, can be gold plated as well.
Silver and gold tend to diffuse into each other, which can cause a plated piece to become dull or tarnished looking as the gold plating wears. Layering the silver with copper first can create longer-lasting luster because it's not as reactive to gold.;
, Now that you know what you want to plate, you can choose the correct kit for the job. If you’re still not sure, try contacting a gold plating service or kit manufacturer about which kit is right for you to use.The average gold plating kit will include a liquid gold solution, an electrical supply, and a plating wand or brush that links to the power supply and directs where the gold is bonded. An all-inclusive kit is ideal; due to the nature of gold plating, you may need other solutions or accessories depending on what metal or item you are working on.
Gold plating solutions regularly come in 14-karat, 18-karat, or 24-karat gold. The color of the finished product may vary depending on the karat levels.
Colour may also vary when metal alloys, such as copper or silver, are added to the plating solution.

, While your plating kit will come with most of the necessary materials, it might not come with everything. Some plating solutions need to reach a certain temperature for the best results, for instance, so a hot plate and heat-resistant beakers may be needed.You will additionally need an electrical current. If your kit does not come with one, then a twelve-amp rectifier with variable amp and voltage controls will do.Finally, you will also need distilled water.

, In addition to the actual plating solution, your kit will come with an activating solution.These solutions do not go into the same beaker. Instead, set them up next to one another, so you can easily move the item to be plated from the activating solution to the distilled water to the plating solution when the time comes without the risk of introducing contaminants.

, The solutions will not need constant heat, but they will need to be at a certain temperature when you actually plate the item, so start heating them early in the process. The exact temperatures to which you heat your solutions will depend upon the specifics of the kit you purchased, such as the karat count. Follow the directions closely.

, Whether you have your own or your kit came with one, set up your current source to the guidelines specified in your specific kit.


Purchasing a start-up kit designed for gold plating is optimal. However, If your kit did not come with a source for the electrical current, do not worry because you can still set up your own. The process requires a DC power source, so you may need to purchase a rectifier in order to change an AC power source (such as a home outlet) to DC.
The easiest solution is to purchase a variable power supply. For small home projects such as gold plating a coin or a pen, you can purchase an inexpensive variable power supply, which makes setting up your power source as easy as plugging it in, clipping your kit's plating brush to the positive output, and setting the voltage dial to your kit's specifications.
For most kits, the current is going to be somewhere around three volts, though some may go as high as twelve volts., For the best results, the item to be plated needs a deep cleaning before you begin the bonding process. Do not simply rinse the object. Any traces of oils or grease must also be removed from the object. Failure to properly clean the item will prevent deposition onto your item.Wear cotton gloves to avoid leaving skin oils or other deposit on the item.

, Some kits include a cleaning solution. Depending on your kit, this solution can be anything from a polish to a full on acidic solution. Handle the solutions with care and always use gloves.


If your kit does not come with a cleaning solution, you can use a household degreaser and buff the item yourself. Rinse it thoroughly in clean water after.
Be sure to remove all fingerprints, smears or any other residue.
The surface of your item should be completely smooth.

, Study how the liquid leaves the surface as you remove it from the water. If the water slides smoothly from the piece without beading or forming small droplets, it is clean.

, With the brush in your kit connected to the current source, coat your clean item with the activating solution. The tip of the brush is actually wrapped around the anode, which both coats and ionizes your item in preparation for the actual plating solution.


Alternatively, you can dip your item into the beaker with the activating solution and fully submerge it to coat it. However, the brush must also be in the activating solution with the item since the brush is also the anode helping to charge the surface of the item.

, The plating solution will work better on your item if any excess activating solution has been rinsed from your item. A quick dunk is sufficient.

, Just as with the activating solution, you can either use the separate plating brush to coat your item, or you can submerge the item in the plating solution. The electrical current will bond the oppositely charged gold particles to the item.


Your kit will recommend several passes with the wand.
If submerging the item, the amount of time will vary by object, but you will likely need to leave it in the solution for ten-to-twenty seconds. You will also want to rotate the item halfway through to give each side equal time directly facing the anode for even and equal deposition., This will remove any excess plating solution, and there is minimal drying time.


The plated gold will be hard and dry almost instantly.

Feel the underside of the petals.,
Study at the flowers.,
Look for seeds or loose pollen inside the blooms, which indicate that the flowers were past their prime when they were cut.

,
Choose flowers with buds that are just starting to open over those that are already fully open.,
Inspect the stems of cut flowers.,
Select cut flowers with healthy-looking leaves.,
Make sure the calyx and sepals are green and healthy.,
Check the water in which the cut flowers are sitting at the store.,
Reject flowers that have insects or other pests visible on them.

",How to Choose Cut Flowers,"


Slide your fingers gently from the stem to the petal ends. The petals of fresh flowers should feel firm.
Listen for a faint rustling when you move your fingers across the undersides of the petals. This sound is a sign of freshness in flowers.
Reject the flowers if the petals feel flaccid, cool, or moist.;
, Don't buy cut flowers with faded colors, transparent petals, petals that are turning brown, or wilting petals.

,, Flower buds will continue to open if kept in a vase with water.


Buy cut tulips that are fully closed. The tulip's color should be visible at the tip of the bud, yet the tulip should be green at the bottom.

, Choose those with clean, strong stems.


Reject flowers with soft, discolored stems. This discoloration indicates that bacteria has entered the stems, and will move upward to contaminate the leaves and flowers as the bacteria multiply.
Refuse flowers with slime on the stems or broken stems.

, The leaves should appear fresh, firm, and green.


Reject flowers with leaves that are sagging, yellow, brown or speckled. Speckling indicates the presence of bacteria in the leaves.
Refuse flowers that have leaves with holes in them, because this indicates that the plant was infested with insects before cutting.

, These are the small leaves that cup a flower head at the bottom between the stem and petals.

, Don't buy flowers if the water smells stagnant or appears murky or slimy.

Another good option is L6 steel, which has a little nickel added into the composition. It is nearly as easy to heat treat but is slightly less durable.
Additional steel types commonly used for knives and daggers include 01 steel, W2 steel, and D2 steel.;
, The ""guard"" is the strip of material separating the blade from the handle. Brass is the best material to use.


Look for a brass bar measuring around 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide and 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) thick. The length you'll need will vary depending on the size of your dagger, but you generally won't need more than 6 inches (14.24 cm) or so.

, While modern knives usually have plastic-based handles, you should stick with natural materials like hardwood when creating a dagger for the sake of design and authenticity. Hardwoods will also be easier to work with as a beginner.


One good option is Purpleheart wood. You could also try osage orange, yew, iron bark eucalyptus, and manzanita.

, Wooden handles can shrink when exposed to heat and moisture, causing them to crack. One of the best ways to prevent this from happening is to thoroughly dry the wood out before you use it.


During the summer, you could leave the wood in a hot car for a week or two.
Alternatively, set your oven to the lowest possible temperature and let the wood bake inside for a few hours. Monitor it carefully and remove it if the wood starts smoking or scorching.

, When designing a dagger for the first time, you should consider a length between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10 cm).


You can sketch out the blade first and measure your sketch to determine the exact dimensions, or you could decide on the dimensions before sketching out the dagger. Either option is acceptable.
Also consider the width. Ideally, the width of the blade should be between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm).

, Handle length should be decided upon based on the size of your blade and the size of your hand.


Take your hand size into consideration first. The handle should be a little longer than the width of your hand so that your hand can comfortably grab and control the handle.
Measure this against the size of the blade, next. The handle should be no longer than the length of the blade but no shorter than half that same length. The handle should also be the same width as the blade at its widest point.

, Take the time to actually draw out your dagger design and mark all of the dimensions on your drawing.


You can draw it by hand on paper or cardboard, or you could create the design on your computer and sketch it out. Work with whatever tools you feel most comfortable with.

, Use a hacksaw to cut of a length of steel equal to the total combined length of the blade and handle.Clamp the steel down using a vice while you cut it.

, Cut out the dagger pattern you sketched out previously and lay it out onto your length of steel. Carefully trace the shape of the blade and handle using black marker.


Alternatively, you could temporarily glue the template onto the steel using water-soluble adhesive.

, Use your hacksaw to cut around the pattern, removing as much excess metal as possible.


The idea is to get the rough shape down, but you do not need to achieve the exact shape of the blade during this step.
Continue holding the metal down using a vice.
Alternatively, you could use a power jigsaw during this step. Set the jigsaw on its highest speed and pause the process frequently to lubricate the blade with paraffin wax. If you do not lubricate the blade, it could overheat.
Note that the portion of the metal that will lie beneath the handle needs to be less wide than both the blade and the anticipated size of the wooden handle.

, Finish shaping the exact outline of the dagger using a metal file. You do not need to sharpen the blade at this point, but you do need to trim the blade to its actual shape.


If you need more power than a metal file can achieve, you could also try using a belt sander or jewelers saw.

, Mount the blade to the edge of a table using your vice and file in both side edges so that they slope evenly down toward the center. The edges should slope in on both the top and bottom sides.


Use a metal file to bevel the edges. Always file in the forward direction and never file back and forth.
Use both hands and apply as much pressure as possible.
Keep the blade clamped at waist height. Doing so will make it easier for you to put your body weight into the process, which will make it easier for you to finish the beveling without straining your muscles.
The ideal bevel angle is about 30 degrees. Keep this angle as consistent as possible around the entire edge of the blade.

, The simplest way to do this is with a charcoal grill or fire pit.


If using a grill, light a medium size pile of briquettes on fire and fan them until they start to glow.
If using a fire pit, light a medium size pile of wood mixed with charcoal briquettes on fire and fan the flame until it becomes strong yet controllable.

, Grab the handle portion of the metal with tongs, then insert the blade portion of the steel directly into the fire. Hold it there, rotating it occasionally, until the steel becomes medium red.


The steel needs to reach a temperature of about 1475 degrees Fahrenheit (802 degrees Celsius).
You can check for the right conditions using a magnet. Once the metal is hot enough, a magnet should no longer be able to stick to it.
At this point, the steel will be very brittle.

, Immerse the blade into a heat-resistant container of oil. Let it sit in the oil for several minutes.


Keep the blade vertical as it sits in the oil.
Nearly any type of oil should work. Motor oil works well, but so does transmission fluid and vegetable oil.

, Place the blade in a kitchen oven preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Leave it there for about 20 minutes.


The quenching process cools the metal down, but the blade needs to be at a temperature between 350 and 550 degrees Fahrenheit (175 and 290 degrees Celsius) for it to temper correctly.

, Once you see the blade turn a wheat color, the metal has tempered correctly. Allow it to cool down to room temperature in a safe location.

, Use a drill press to drill two holes in the metal that will slip between your handle pieces.


The holes should be along the horizontal center of the blade. Keep at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space in between them.
Each hole should be 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) in diameter.

, Lay your pattern sketch on top of your wood and trace the outline of your handle onto the wood with pencil. Do this two times to make two separate pieces. Use a saw to cut out both pieces.


When you cut them out, the two pieces should be a little longer and a little wider than your desired handle.

, Hold the brass bar against the dagger metal, positioning it in between the blade and the lower portion (which will eventually be covered by the handle). Determine how long you want the guard to be, then cut it down to size.


You do not need to shape the guard after cutting it down.
Use a hacksaw or power jigsaw to cut the brass. Keep it clamped down using a vice as you make the actual cut.

, You need to drill and file a lengthwise slit in the guard metal that is just large enough to slide the blade through.


Using a drill press or power drill, drill five small holes side by side along the center of the guard. The series of holes should only be as long as the blade is wide.
Use a metal file to file away the metal in between these holes. The resulting slot should only be as large as the blade is thick.
Make sure that the slot is only large enough to slip over the handle portion of the dagger but not so large that it will slip over the entire blade.

, Slide the brass guard in place on your dagger, then clamp one wooden handle piece in its proper place along the handle portion of the metal. Use a power drill to drill through the holes of the metal and into the wood.


Make sure that the handle and blade are perfectly aligned. If they are not lined up precisely, the holes of your handle will fall out in the wrong place.

, Place the second wooden handle piece in place on the opposite side of the metal and clamp everything down. Drill two holes in this handle piece, working through the holes of the second piece and the holes of the metal.

, The pins should be 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) wide and long enough to fit through the series of holes keeping your dagger handle together.


It's better to make the pins too long than to make them too short. If they seem too long, simply file them down to size so that they'll lie flush against both sides of the handle.

, Mix heavy-duty epoxy and apply it liberally to both inner halves of your wooden handle pieces. Place the pieces back on the dagger in their correct places.


Do not let the epoxy dry yet.

, Place one pin in each hole, then gently tap them into the handle using a hammer.


Once the pins are in place, wipe off any excess glue with mineral spirits.
Clamp down the handle and let the epoxy set. Do not clamp down on the pins, though, since this could cause them to warp as the epoxy dries.

, Use emery paper to polish the blade until it becomes shiny.


You may need to clamp the dagger down as you polish the blade.
Work your way through a variety of Emory paper grits. Start at 200, then gradually move through the different sizes until you reach 1200.
This step completes the entire process.

Don't style tulips with flowers in the Narcissus family.",How to Care for Fresh Cut Tulips," When you're at the flower shop, you might be tempted to buy the tulips with fully-opened, vibrantly colored petals. This would be a fine choice if your tulips were meant to ""wow"" for a one-night occasion, but if you want them to last a long time, choose tulips that are still tightly closed, with some green buds that aren't fully colored yet. The flowers will open over the course of a few days, giving you more time to enjoy them.


If you're cutting your own tulips and you want them to last as long as possible in a vase, cut them before they're fully opened. Cut as close as possible to the ground.;
, When you bring the tulips home from the shop, keep them wrapped in paper towels or a washcloth soaked in fresh water. This will ensure that the tulips don't start prematurely drying out on the way home. Do this even if the distance from the flower shop to your house isn't very far. Any time out of water will cause the tulips to age faster.

, This will help them readily soak up water from the vase.

, If the stems have any leaves that would be submerged in water when you put them in the vase, remove them. The leaves could start rotting and cause the flowers to go limp before their time.

, Pick a vase that will rise up to cover at least half the height of the tulips you've brought home. They'll be able to lean against the vase without bending over. If you use a shorter vase, the flowers will eventually bend forward. This is an effect some people like, but it may cause the flowers to die more quickly.

, Make sure it doesn't have sediment leftover from your last bouquet. Use soap and warm water to wash it thoroughly, then dry it completely with a towel. This way your fresh tulips won't pick up bacteria that could case them to start rotting more quickly.

, Cold water will keep the stems fresh and crisp, while warm or hot water would cause them to become weak and soggy.

, Arrange the tulips so that they each have a little space in the vase, rather than leaning them all on top of one another. Giving them each a little room will prevent them from crushing one another, which will lead to premature petal drop-page and shorten the lifespan of your flowers.

, Tulips drink up a lot of water. Make sure it never completely runs out, or they'll begin to wilt very quickly.

, The addition of flower food, or flower preservative, which is available at flower shops, will greatly lengthen your flowers' lifespan. Read the directions and sprinkle in some food when you add water. It'll keep your tulips standing tall and looking perky for as long as possible.


You can try putting lemon juice, pennies, and other such materials in the vase with the flowers. Some say these tricks work, but research shows that flower food is much more effective., Place it in an area that doesn't get too hot and sunny. Otherwise, the tulips will wilt in the heat.

, Daffodils and other flowers in this family exude a substance that causes flowers to fade faster. Tulips work best in a vase all by themselves."

Clean away the surface contaminants.,
Pickle away the rust.,
Put the metal in flux.,
Immerse the steel in molten zinc.,
Take the galvanized steel out of the zinc bath slowly.,
Cool the galvanized steel.,
Inspect the galvanized steel.",How to Galvanize Steel1," Before any other steps can be taken, the steel surface must be cleaned thoroughly. How this is done depends on what has to be cleaned away.


Dirt, grease, oil, or paint markings require the use of a mild acid, a hot alkali, or a biological cleaning agent.
Asphalt, epoxy, vinyl, or the slag from welding need to be cleaned by sandblasting or with other abrasives.;
, Pickling is done with hydrochloric acid or hot sulfuric acid; it removes both rust and mill scale.


In some cases, abrasive cleaning may be enough to remove the rust, or it may be necessary to use both a pickling solution and abrasives. In some cases, larger abrasives such as buckshot are air-blasted onto the steel.

, In this case, “flux” is a solution of zinc ammonium chloride that removes any remaining rust and scale and protects the steel from rusting until it is actually galvanized.

, The bath of molten zinc should be at least 98 percent zinc and maintained at a temperature range of 815 to 850 degrees F (435 to 455 degrees C).


While the steel is immersed in the zinc bath, its iron reacts with the zinc to form a series of alloy layers and an outer layer of pure zinc.

, Most of the excess zinc will drain off; what doesn’t drain off can be vibrated off or spun off in a centrifuge.

, Cooling the metal stops the galvanization reaction, which continues as long as the steel is the same temperature it was while immersed in the zinc bath. Cooling can be done in one of several ways:Immerse the steel in a passivation solution such as potassium hydroxide.Immerse the steel in water.
Let the steel cool in the open air.

, Once the galvanized steel is cooled, check it to make sure the zinc coating looks good, sticks to the steel, and is thick enough. There are a number of tests that can be performed to ensure the galvanization was successful.


Standards for hot-dip galvanizing and inspecting its results have been established by such organizations as the American Society for Testing and Materials (now called ASTM International),the International Standards Organization (ISO), the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). :"

Hammer out the flat side to make the bevels.,
Try to keep the blade from mushrooming or bending over itself, as this will cause inclusions weakening the blade.

,, Leave about two inches or more on one end.








, Work on both sides of the blade to prevent it from distorting.








, Note that doing so will cause the blade to bend back on the spine.








,, After the third heating, let it cool in the fire overnight. Cooling it very slowly will make it softer, easier to file.








,, Dipping only the cutting edge will provide a hard durable cutting edge but leave the back flexible, thereby increasing the overall durability of the blade. Only dip the metal vertically, any other angle besides being a few degrees off will create bubbles around the metal, causing warping and you to have to reforge.








, You can also leave it in a hot covered spot with a few coals, such as a makeshift brick box.








,, Finally use a leather strop impregnated with polishing paste to remove any burr and leave a razor sharp edge.

Prepare the steel as for hot-dip galvanizing.,
Prepare a zinc electrolyte solution.,
Immerse the steel in the electrolyte.",How to Galvanize Steel2," The steel must be cleaned and de-rusted before the electrogalvanization can occur.

, Either zinc sulfate or zinc cyanide is normally used for the electrolyte.

, The solution will react with the steel to cause the zinc to precipitate onto the steel, coating it. The longer the steel is left in the electrolyte, the thicker the coating that will be produced.


While this method offers greater control over how thick the zinc coating is than does hot-dip galvanizing, it usually does not allow for layers to become as thick."

For best results, empty the bottle and then clean soda with hot soapy water. Allow enough time to dry so you aren’t working with a wet bottle.


Provide one bottle per artist or per color if you plan to use multiple colors.;
, You will be dipping the bottom of the soda bottle in paint and then transferring it to the paper. This means the bottom of the bottle will be coated in paint and will dry with a bit of a three-dimensional design (which requires a heavier paper to hold the additional paint).

, Tempera paint works well with this project because of its consistency and the non-toxic aspect. Choose several colors to design multi-colored cherry blossoms or stick with the traditional pale pink.


Pick up a bottle of black and/or brown paint and a paint brush to create the cherry blossom tree branches and trunk.

, You will spread the newspaper on a table to create a workspace for your artist. A simple paper plate can hold your paint, but make sure you have enough plates per artist and color.


Consider finding old shirts to use as smocks in order to protect clothing, especially if you are doing this craft with children.

, You can use any type of colorful paper you want, such as: catalogues, construction paper, magazines, scrapbooking paper, and origami paper. The strips need to be ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) wide and a little longer than your bracelet's width.

, You can use a glue stick, but liquid glue or decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) will work better. You can apply the liquid glue with a paintbrush or a foam brush., Lay the strip down across the width of the bracelet. Wrap the overhanging edges of the paper around the edges of the bracelet. Smooth out any wrinkles with your fingers., Start at one end and work your way towards the other. Try to overlap each strip slightly so that no cardboard shows.

, You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add detail to your bracelet, especially if you used paper that's blank or has a simple pattern. Cut your image out, then glue it onto your bracelet.Use images with shapes that are easy to cut out, such as flowers or birds.

, You can also use a brush-on or spray-on acrylic sealer instead.

, Use hot glue or tacky glue to attach items such as beads, buttons, sequins, or rhinestones to the bracelet.You can also draw designs using glitter glue. Let the bracelet dry before moving on.

, If the bracelet doesn't fit right, punch a hole into each end. Thread a short pipe cleaner through each hole. Hook the ends of the pipe cleaner over to keep it in place.

Purchase a white laundry sack that is large enough to hold two rolled up sleeping bags.,
Cover a large table with newspaper.,
Put on some latex gloves and fill a bucket with dipping solution.,
Section the sack by wrapping rubber bands around it.,
Squirt dye onto the sack, using a different color for each section.,
Allow the sack to dry overnight with the rubber bands on.,
Cut two slits at the top of the sack, where the sack opens.,
Thread thick yarn or thin rope through a safety pin or paper clip and tie.,
Insert the ""threading needle"" into one of the slits and work it around with your fingers.,
When the rope comes out the other slit, remove the ""needle"" and tie the two loose ends together with a square knot.,
Spread the sack out on a table and lay flat newspaper inside it.,
Using permanent markers, write and draw on the sack to your heart's content.

",How to Make a Tie Dye Stuff Sack," For the tie dye to work, this sack should be 100% cotton. This will be your stuff sack. It looks pretty boring now, but just wait!;
, This is where you will tie dye your stuff sack. Fill squirt bottles with the colors of dye you wish to use and make sure plenty of rubber bands are available.

, Pick up the sack and dunk it in the bucket. Wring it out a few times until it is mostly dry. Then, lay it out on the table.

, You can roll it up and place several rubber bands along it, almost like stripes on a caterpillar. This will create colorful stripes. You can also twist it up from the middle and wrap rubber bands around the twisted wad, or you can invent your own design. Make sure the rubber bands are good and tight.

, Keep in mind that you don't need to cover the whole section with solid color. In fact, the blotchier, the better.

, Once it is dry, wash it in the washing machine by itself to ensure that the dye is more or less permanent. Make sure the sack is thoroughly dry before you continue.

, The slits should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) tall.

, This is your ""threading needle"".

, Make sure the thread doesn't come untied!

, Voila! Your sack has a drawstring!

, When you use permanent markers, this will prevent the ink from leaking through.

Cover an area of the floor or table.,
Adhere the newspaper strips to the balloon.Dip one strip of newspaper at a time into the paper mache paste and then lay it flat across the surface of the balloon.,
Let dry.Set the paper mache structure aside in a dry, draft free area.,
Remove the balloon.,
Cut the paper mâché structure into the shape of a helmet.,
Paint the helmet.,
Wear your new space helmet.",How to Make a Space Helmet2," Tie the end of the balloon into a tight knot.

, Take five large sheets of newspaper and tear them into 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.6 cm) wide strips., If you have not done so already, prepare the paper mâché paste.


Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of corn flour with 1 qt (1 L) of boiling water, and stir until a paste forms.

, Before you begin placing the newspaper in the paste, and onto the balloon, you should create a space where you can work. Paper mâché can get messy, so simply lay down a plastic table cloth or some old newspaper on the floor or on the table, so that any excess will drip onto the plastic or paper instead of on the table or carpet., Repeat with your other strips, laying them onto the balloon both vertically and horizontally until it is completely covered in newspaper.


When done, the balloon should be covered by roughly five coats of newspaper.






Cover the entire balloon except for a small patch near the knotted end. You will need this space to remain open so that you can get the balloon out of the structure later.

, Allow it to dry undisturbed for about 24 hours, or until the surface is still and completely dry to the touch.


The paste needs to be completely dry before you continue past this step.
Your climate will change the rate at which the paste dries. If you live in dry conditions, the paste will dry quicker. If you live in notably humid conditions, the paste might need more than 24 hours to dry.

, Use a pin to pop the balloon through the gap you left at the base of the paper mâché. After popping the balloon, carefully pull it out through the hole., Use scissors to cut off the bottom of the structure, then cut away a circular section for your face to show through.


Work from the bottom or open end of the structure. Cut off enough of the bottom for your neck and head to fit through.






Still working from the bottom end, cut a rectangle in the front of the structure. This rectangle should be as wide as the distance between the outer corners of your eyes. It should be about as long as the distance between the bottom of your forehead and your chin.

, Use paint and a paintbrush to decorate the helmet however you desire. You could also decorate the helmet with foil shapes or space-themed stickers.Note that you can also attach antennae. Poke two small holes in the top of your helmet—one near the left side and the other near the right side. Slide a pipe cleaner into each hole, and tape the end of the pipe cleaner into the inside of the helmet to secure it. You can twist a bead to the top of each pipe cleaner to complete the antenna look.

, Once the helmet has been decorated to your liking, it should be ready to wear."

Create two rectangular foam helmet braces.,
Attach the foam to the bucket.,
Wrap a dish towel around your head.,
Attach this towel to the inside of the helmet.,
Wear the space helmet.",How to Make a Space Helmet3," The oval should be at least 7 inches (17.8 cm) wide by 5 inches (12.7 cm) tall, or large enough for your face to show through from the inside. Sketch it out using a pencil.Make sure that the hole will be able to line up with your face when you put the bucket on. To gauge where the hole needs to be, hold the bucket upside-down in front of you, with the bottom of the bucket even to the top of your head. Quickly mark the point that is even with your eyebrows and the point even with your bottom lip. Draw your oval based on those marks.

, Position the tip of a nail somewhere along the oval outline you just created. Use a hammer to strike the nail into the bucket just far enough to create a hole.Remove the nail once the hole has been created.

, Wedge a pair of sharp wire cutters into the pilot hole created by the nail. Carefully cut around the entire oval outline.Remove and discard the plastic oval you cut out.






If the edge seems too jagged and potentially dangerous, cover it with strips of white duct tape.

, Use a ruler and a pencil to measure out two 2 inch by 9 inch (5.1 cm by 22.9 cm) rectangular pieces from a larger sheet of white foam board. Cut these rectangles out using a craft knife.Use the craft knife to carefully round off the lower corners of both rectangles.

, Use white duct tape to adhere the top of each foam rectangle to the inside of the helmet.The two rectangles both be positioned toward the back of the helmet. When you slip the helmet on, these rectangles should slide just behind your shoulders and onto your upper back. Their purpose is to serve as braces that can help keep the helmet straight on your head.

, Take a standard dish towel and roll it up crosswise (widthwise). Wrap this cloth around your forehead, creating a ring, and tape the ends of the ring together with duct tape.The ring should be loose enough to slide on and off your head without difficulty.







, Use more duct tape to attach the towel ring to the inside top of the bucket. The center of the ring should match up with the center of the bucket., Slide the helmet bucket onto your head with the opening in front of your face. The towel ring should rest on your head, and the foam braces should land behind your shoulders. If everything feels right and the helmet feels stable, it's ready to wear.

Attach the antenna structure to a large plastic container.,
Wrap gold ribbon around the bottom.,
Trim a piece of tubing down to size.Measure out a piece of flex tubing that is long enough to fit around the mouth of the container.,
Attach the tubing.,
Wear your new space helmet.",How to Make a Space Helmet4," The antenna consists of a short wooden dowel, three metal washers, and a single wooden ball. Use hot glue to attach the wooden ball to the top of the dowel. Slide the three washers onto the dowel from the bottom, positioning them so that they start 2 inches (5 cm) below the wooden ball and end in the middle of the dowel.


The wooden dowel should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. Trim the dowel so that it is about 8 inches (20.3 cm) long






The center gap of your washers should also be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. The washers need to have a snug fit on the dowel. If necessary, however, you can hold them in place on the dowel by applying a small dot of glue to the underside of each washer.






The diameter of the wooden ball should be about 3/4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm).







, Use the dome-shaped plastic lid from a milkshake or other frozen drink.Find a small wooden circle that is large enough to fit over the top opening of the lid. Apply a ring of hot glue to the top opening of the lid, then press the wooden circle on top of that glue.

, Once the antenna and its base are both dry, apply hot glue to the bottom of the antenna rod. Stick this glue spot in the direct center of the wooden circle on top of your base.


Let the entire structure dry completely before moving onto the next step.







, Find gold or copper metallic spray paint.Coat the outside of the antenna structure, including both the base and the antenna itself.


You should spray paint the structure in a well-ventilated area. It's also a good idea to spread out plastic sheeting or newspaper below the structure to prevent spray paint from staining your work surface.






You do not need to paint the inside of the base.
Let the paint dry completely. This could take 12 to 24 hours, depending on the paint you use and the climate you are working in.

, Find a clear plastic container large enough to safely put over your head.Turn the container upside-down. Center the bottom of the antenna base over the center of the container and glue it in place.


A recycled container that once contained cheese puffs or cheese balls is usually a good choice. Regardless of the container type, however, you need to make sure that your head can fit inside and that the opening is very large. If the opening is too small, the helmet might get stuck on your head or may restrict your air too severely.

, Cut a length of metallic gold ribbon large enough to wrap around the container. Use a thin line of hot glue to adhere the ribbon to the container.


Place the ribbon 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less from the container's opening.

, Use sharp scissors or a knife to cut the tubing to this size.


Use black flex tubing with a diameter of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so.

, Apply a generous line of hot glue around the mouth of the container. Press the tubing into this glue, winding the tubing around the mouth until the two ends meet.


Trim off any excess tubing.

, Once everything dries, the helmet should be ready to wear.

Make a notch or stem (optional).",How to Flintknap," The easiest materials to start with include chert, flint (a subtype of chert), and obsidian. These all leave smooth surfaces behind when fractured, require comparatively little force to chip, and usually have a uniform, fine grain. Once you've made a few small objects with these, you can experiment with materials that are a bit more difficult to work with, including basalt, lab-manufactured quartz, glass from the bottom of a wine bottle, and some types of porcelain.


Tap the material with a hard object. Generally speaking, the higher the pitch you hear, the better it is for knapping.You can find many of these on eBay, or you can look for the right stones in nature if you have a geological guide to your local area. However, do not disturb piles of stone or stone surrounded by flakes and fragments. These are part of the archaeological record and should be left undisturbed.;
, Select a stone that has few, if any, large cracks, fissures, bubbles, significant grain, noticeable inclusions (traces of other minerals), or other irregularities which would likely cause it to break or flake off in ways contrary to the shape you are trying to achieve. When it comes to size and shape, you have two options:


A flake is ready to be turned into an arrowhead or other tool. These are slightly convex, and relatively small.
A core is a large stone, which you can break to create flakes. If you're hunting on your own, you'll likely have to start with one of these.
Note that the term ""preform"" can refer to either of the above stages. The term means a material that has not yet been formed into a tool.

, If you are working with a ready-made flake, all you need is a pressure flaker, typically an antler tine or copper nail set in a wooden handle. If you have a core, you'll also need a more powerful striking tool, either a cylindrical ""billet"" or simply a dense, round stone that fits your hand (a hammerstone). A piece of limestone or other stone softer than your material, or an old grinding wheel, is also required if you are starting with a core.


See the Tips section below for more information on choosing billets and pressure flakers.
A pressure flaker tool at least 1 ft (0.3 m) long will give you more control and reduce the risk of ""tennis elbow"" from repeated use. A smaller one may be easier to use for your first attempt, however.

, You'll be handling sharp, broken stone, and sending fragments of it flying. Goggles and thick, long pants are essential. Wear long sleeves and gloves as well, or expect to receive cuts and scrapes. A piece of leather to drape over your leg, and a smaller one to hold your materials with, are recommended.

, Always work outdoors in an open area, away from structure, or in a ventilated area with a high-powered fan constantly blowing away from your face. Stone dust is extremely sharp and can damage lungs and eyes over time, especially in an area of still air where it creates clouds of dust.


Work over a tarp or cloth, so you can gather up and discard the fragments once you are done. Fragments left on the ground can cut feet., You can knap on a table or bench, of course, but traditionally knapping is done sitting cross-legged, with the stone in one hand in one's lap. This method can be difficult for beginners. Experiment to find out which sitting position gives you the most control, especially with pressure flaking.


If you have a core, continue on to the next step, ""create a flat platform,"" or to ""use direct percussion"" below that if you already have a flat side on your core.
If you have a flake, continue on to ""abrade the edge"" below, or directly to the section on pressure flaking if you bought a ready-made flake with a thick, dull edge.
Large, heavy stones may require a table or a large, flat stone – but better yet, pick something smaller for your first project.

, If your core is round or has an irregular surface, you'll need to strike it with a hammerstone to create a relatively flat ""platform"" to start with. The stone will fracture at roughly a 50º angle from the direction of impact, so for a round rock you'll want to tilt the core to about 40º and strike straight downward.The platform must be next to a side that narrows inward. You won't be able to use any side that bulges outward from the platform, or goes straight down at a 90º angle.

, If you are using a core, once you have a flat platform, use your hammerstone or billet to strike off flakes, or thin, relatively flat pieces you can turn into tools. Always remember that the stone fractures at a 50º from the point of impact. To use this to your advantage, tilt the core so the platform is at a 40º angle from the vertical.Strike the lower end of the platform with the tool, hitting it with a glancing blow that carries on past the point. You may need to repeat this several times around the platform, until you get a piece that is mostly flat, and a fair amount larger than the tool you want to make.


If the material splits into three pieces, or the platform crumbles around the blow, the angle is probably too small (the blow is too direct).
If you're only getting tiny chips, the angle is probably too large (the blow is too glancing).

, Unless you were lucky enough to get a perfect triangular or rectangular flake, you'll probably need to break it further. Do this using the same direct percussion technique, until you have a piece a bit larger than what you want to end up with, and with no concave ""bites"" taken out of the edge.

, Abrading is one of the most important processes in flint knapping. A newly struck flake typically has thin, fragile areas around the edge, which need to be ground down to a dull, thicker edge so it can withstand the impact of the tool. To accomplish this, grind the edge of your flake in a sawing motion against another flattish sort of stone of slightly lesser hardness. Old grinding wheels work well for this, or any smooth hunk of limestone. If grooves appear in the tool you are grinding with, this is a good sign, since it means the tool is softer than the flake. Once the fragile edges have chipped off or been ground down, you'll have a dependable platform able to take the extreme rigors of lithic engineering.

, After your flake is reduced so that it is about seven or eight times wider than it is thick (for a larger project), it's time to begin pressure flaking. Pressure flaking is achieved by placing your work into a fold of thick leather. Hold this in your hand, place a pointed tool (the pressure flaker) on the edge of the stone, and apply an inward pressure to the tool, focusing energy toward the inner area of the flake, usually at a more severe angle of about 45º. You don't want to drive the tool directly toward the center, or it could shatter. The goal is to apply pressure until the tool removes a small, thin piece from the stone, leaving a shallow scalloped shape behind.


Remember, you are working from the edge inward. This is the opposite direction of the force you used in direct percussion.
Never push down on a concave portion of the edge, or the piece could break.You may need to skip some areas or guide the pressure flaker around it from both directions in order to shape that section to a more usable area.

, If your pressure flaker is long enough, rest it against your hip for more leverage. Let your other hand, holding the flake, rest against the inside of your leg. Try not to flex the elbow of the hand holding the flake; rather, use the inside of the leg for stability, with a little extra strength from the wrist. Hold the pressure flaker just above center, and the wood will flex and push down into the flake for you. Apply pressure to the lower side of the flake, not the upper.


The slower and longer you apply pressure, the longer your flakes will be.
Do not bend either wrist while knapping., Now that you're down to the main flake or ""preform,"" take off additional, smaller flakes using the pressure flaking method. Make a flake, flip the preform over, then make another flake along the same edge, but on the opposite face. This lets you inspect each flake after you make it, and make adjustments for irregularities or mistakes. The end result should be a ""bifacial edge"" with a row of scalloped marks on each side.For this first pass, remove short flakes with relatively fast pressure. Most beginners find it easier to make short flakes than long, so this shouldn't be an issue.
This is the longest, most difficult part of a flint knapping project. Take it slow, and accept that you may break a few flakes while learning.

, Never make two flakes in the same place without abrading in between, just as described in the abrasion step above. The closer you get to the finished product, the less heavily you will have to abrade, as you are working towards the final product of a delicate, razor sharp edge and point.

, The copper or antler tip will wear down quickly, so sharpen it several times during the creation of a single tool, using a knife or a stone to scrape the edge. Many knappers pound the copper tip flat to a thin chisel shape to sharpen it and change the behavior of the tool slightly.You can try it at this point to see if you prefer the chisel to the point tip.

, After abrading, repeat the same pressure flaking process. On the next few circles, try to use slower, more prolonged pressure to create longer flakes, in order to thin the tool right up to the raised convex center.Remember to abrade after each full circle. Once the final shape is complete, which may require some focused attention on certain areas, do a final run of pressure flaking. For most tools, you do not abrade the edge after you finish, leaving it sharp for use as a cutting or piercing tool.


Most commonly, you would use longer flakes near one end to taper it gradually to an arrow or spear point, while the other end is shaped through smaller flakes into the wider base.
Experienced knappers can make long flakes quite quickly, but it takes a lot of practice to get to that point. One of them recommends pointing the pressure flaker at the opposite edge (away from your hand), quickly building up to maximum pressure, then rotating the hand holding the preform slightly until the flake pops off., You may put the finishing touches on a point by notching the base or forming a stem at the base. This is a difficult skill to learn, and many beginners break their first tool or severely alter the shape. Still, if you plan on tying the tool to an arrowhead or handle, this is a necessary step. Hold your finished tool flat and press the tool at a steep angle and high pressure through the entire tool. Flip the tool over and repeat to extend the notch, then use gentler pressure to trim it flat.While you can use your pressure flaker, a flattened steel nail in a wooden handle makes a better notching tool, as the harder metal focuses the energy to a smaller area.
Grind the inner edge of the notch before tying it onto anything, to prevent it cutting the string.

Grind the acorns into powder.,
Combine the acorn powder with water.,
Prepare an iron salt solution.,
Soak the bone in the acorn dye overnight.,
Remove the bone.,
Soak the bone in the iron salt solution.,
Let the bone dry.,
Wash the bone.,
Dry completely.",How to Dye Bone1," Pop the caps off 15 acorns and toss the nuts into a powerful electric blender. Blend on high to pulverize the acorns into powder.You could use two large oak galls instead of acorns if desired.
Instead of a blender, you could also grind the nuts into powder using a stone mortar and pestle.;
, Place the powdered nuts in a small to medium non-reactive bowl. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of room temperature water to the powder. Mix to combine using a plastic spoon.


Note that the level of the water will need to be high enough to cover the bone you plan to dye. If you need to create more dye, you will need to add six more powdered acorns or one more powdered oak gall for each 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water.

, Place one steel wool pad in a separate non-reactive bowl and add 1 cup (250 ml) of lemon juice or vinegar.


Note that 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of powdered rust could be used instead of a steel wool pad if desired.
You may want to choose a container with a lid since this solution will sit out overnight without being used. It must be prepared now, however, and not immediately before use.

, Place the bone in the bowl holding the acorn solution. Set the container aside and allow the bone to soak overnight, or 8 to 12 hours.


Make sure that the bone is completely submerged in the acorn dye.
A longer soak time will lead to a darker dye. If you only want a light brownish-gray color, you can cut this amount of time down by about half.

, When the bone has had enough time to soak, remove it from the acorn dye. Hold the bone over the container for a minute so that any excess solution can drip off.


Do not worry if the dye is not quite the right color when you remove it from the acorn dye. The chemical reaction that the dye undergoes when immersed in the iron salt solution will alter the color and set the dye.
You may want to wear rubber or plastic gloves when removing the bone to prevent your fingers from getting dyed, as well.

, Place the bone in the iron salt solution and allow it to soak overnight, or for 8 to 12 hours.


The bone must be completely submerged this time, as well.
As before, a longer soak time will produce a deeper tone.

, Remove the bone when it has soaked long enough in the iron salt solution. Allow any excess to drip off, then set it aside for several hours until it feels dry to the touch.


Wear rubber or plastic gloves when removing the bone.
Note that the final color will be slightly lighter than the current color.
Lay the bone out on a piece of wax paper as it dries. Keep paper towels handy to clean up any stray dye.

, When the bone feels dry to the touch, wash it using cool water and a mild soap.


Washing the bone will help remove the pungent vinegar or lemon juice odor.
When you rinse the bone, continue rinsing it until no more dye can be washed away and the water is clear., Place the bone in a sunny spot and allow it to dry completely before you use it.


The completion of this step completes the process.

Soak the bone.,
Fill a small saucepan with water.,
Stir in the dye powder.,
Add the bone.,
Raise the temperature of the dye bath.,
Mix in a little vinegar.,
Dye the bone for 30 minutes.,
Wash in warm water.,
Let dry.",How to Dye Bone2," Place the bone in a small to medium bowl and cover it with room temperature water. Allow the bone to soak for an hour or two.


As with fabric fibers, the bone fibers pick up dye more readily when wet.
You only need enough water to keep the bone submerged.

, When you're ready to start dyeing the bone, fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of warm to hot water. Set it on your stove and switch on the heat to medium.


You only need enough water to keep the bone submerged.
Use a saucepan that will not react to the dye. One made of stainless steel or enamel works best.

, Sprinkle in 1/2 oz (14 g) of acid dye powder in any color. Mix with a non-reactive spoon until the powder is dissolved.You need to add between 1/3 and 2/3 oz (9.5 and 19 g) dye powder for every 1 lb (450 g) of bone you plan to dye.
On average, 1/2 oz (14 g) should work well for small batches of bone. Keep in mind that more dye powder will produce a darker color, while less will produce a lighter color.
You may want to wear rubber gloves or plastic gloves to prevent your hands from accidentally coming into contact with the dye.

, Remove the bone from its soak and transfer it to the dye bath.


Do not dry the bone at all before adding it to the dye bath.

, Increase the heat to medium-high or high. Continue heating the dye bath until it reaches a temperature between 185 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (85 and 93 degrees Celsius).


Stir the dye bath frequently as it heats up.
Use a cooking thermometer to monitor the temperature of the dye bath.

, Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of vinegar into the dye bath. Stir to combine.


Acid dyes work best when combined with an acid, like vinegar.
Note that you will need 1/4 cup (60 ml) vinegar per 1 lb (450 g) of bone.
You could substitute the vinegar for 1 Tbsp (15 ml) citric acid per 1 lb (450 g) of bone if desired.
Try to avoid pouring the vinegar directly on top of the bone as you add it.

, Keep the bone in the dye bath for an additional 30 minutes. The dye bath must remain at the same approximate temperature during this time.


You may need to adjust the heat settings on your stove to maintain this temperature.
Stir the dye bath frequently during this half hour.
If you want a stronger color, you can leave the bone in the dye bath for a longer period of time.

, Remove the bone from the dye bath. Wash the bone with warm water and a mild liquid soap.


Continue rinsing the bone under running water after removing the soap. Do not stop rinsing until the water runs clear and all excess dye has been washed away.

, Place the dyed bone in a sunny location and allow it to dry completely.


Once the bone is dry, the process is complete.

Mix the dye.,
Prepare a soda ash solution.,
Soak the bone in the soda ash solution.,
Transfer the bone to the dye bath.,
Wash and rinse the bone.,
Dry the dyed bone.",How to Dye Bone3," Dissolve 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of fiber reactive dye powder in 1 cup (250 ml) of lukewarm or cool water, mixing well with a plastic spoon.Combine the dye in a small to medium bowl made from non-reactive material, like glass, plastic, or stainless steel.
You will need enough dye to keep the bone submerged. If you need to add more water, you should also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of dye powder for every 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water.
Note that black fiber reactive dyes or turquoise fiber reactive dyes containing MX-G require two to four times as much dye powder to produce a bright color.

, Combine 1/4 cup (60 ml) of soda ash to 1 qt (1 L) of room temperature water. Stir well until the soda ash is dissolved.


Note that you should check the dye you're using before creating the soda ash solution. Some dyes may already contain soda ash, in which case, you do not need to prepare a separate solution.Wear gloves as you handle the soda ash since it is slightly caustic. Wash your skin immediately if any of the solution splashes onto it.

, Place the bone in the soda ash solution and allow it to soak for 15 to 60 minutes.


This process prepares the bone fibers to pick up the dye particles. A longer soak can lead to a stronger color, but try not to exceed one hour.

, Remove the bone from the soda ash solution and transfer it to the dye bath. Position the bone so that it is completely submerged, then allow it to dye overnight.


The bone must stay submerged in the dye bath for a minimum of two hours. Keeping it submerged for 8 to 24 hours is ideal, though, and will produce a stronger color.
Let the dye bath sit out in a warm room. The temperature of the water should remain at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) or higher. If you need to keep the dye bath warmer and more humid, you may wish to cover the container with a sheet of plastic wrap as the bone sits.

, Once the bone has finished soaking in the dye bath, remove it and clean it with warm to cool water and a mild liquid soap.


Continue rinsing the bone even after the soap has been washed away. Don't stop until the water comes out clear, signifying that all excess dye has been rinsed off.

, Place the bone in a sunny area and allow it to dry completely before handling it.


As soon as the dyed bone is dry, the process is complete.

Collect sand.,
Sift the sand.,
Divide the sand into separate containers.,
Add water to the sand.,
Pour dye onto sand.,
Mix the dye and sand together thoroughly.,
Allow your sand to dry.,
Package the dry sand.,
Make a sand drawing.,
Craft a colored sand vase.,
Create a sand candle.",How to Dye Sand," Either purchase sand at your local craft or hardware store, or gather some from a nearby beach.


If collecting sand from a beach, be wary of hazardous materials and waste. Though you will later sift the sand, try to pick out noticeable things like paper or large pebbles.
Be very careful when collecting sand from a beach. Use rubber gloves as there may be broken glass or other hazardous materials.
Store gathered sand in tightly sealed plastic bags. Hold the bags upside down and see if any sand leaks out. This will help you reduce unwanted sand in your car and house.;
, Store-bought sand will be smooth and even, but beach sand often has rocks that need to be separated from the sand grains.


Place a bucket on the ground and put a sifter over top. This sifter could be an old sifter from the kitchen or fine netting, like a window screen, that is secured over the bucket using duct tape. If you are using a metal sifter from the kitchen, do not use it again for food related preparation.Pour the collected sand onto the mesh of the sifter or screen. Shake the screen lightly so the sand will filter through into the bucket. You may need to occasionally clear the mesh of any stones, shells, or other debris. Continue this process until all the sand has been sifted.

, You can use plastic containers with lids or plastic storage bags.


Storage bags are best because they will require less clean up and will reduce any additional mess caused during the stirring process.
Baking dishes and bowls are also acceptable containers. Be sure to thoroughly scrub any kitchen ware afterwards, especially if dying gathered sand. You want to avoid leaving behind any sand or potentially hazardous materials in the sand.

, This will help evenly distribute the dye when you apply it later.


Aim for a damp consistency and avoid soaking or submerging the sand completely. Don't worry if you add too much water; this will simply making the drying process longer.

, Any kind of dye will work for this project, but fabric dye seems to produce the most vibrant dyed sand.


Food coloring is also acceptable for dying sand.
You may need to add dye several times until it gets to the desired shade you like. The sand will dry lighter so do not worry if the dye is very dark.
Dry tempera paint powder is a nice additive that helps create bright colors. Tempera powder can be purchased in most arts and crafts stores.
Be cautious while handling dye as it can stain skin, clothing, and furniture.

, This process will vary depending on what container you have used to separate sand.


If you are using a container with a lid, you will need a plastic spoon that you can throw away after you finish the project. Scrape the sides of the container to make sure you color everything. Seal the container and set the wet sand to the side to soak up the dye for at least an hour.
For a storage bag, simply seal the bag tightly and massage the sand until the color is consistent throughout. Set the bag aside for at least an hour so the sand can soak up the dye.

, Pour out any excess water first, then spread your damp sand on a plate or flat surface.


Leave the sand to dry, preferably in a sunny place, for a few hours. You may wish to put paper towels over the plate before putting the sand down to help soak up any excess dye.
You can also bake the sand to help speed up the drying process and further infuse the colors. Simply place the sand in a baking pan and bake on 200 °F (93 °C) for 15 minutes. Make sure you pull the sand out of the oven while it is still damp and let it dry naturally overnight; sand that has been baked completely dry can have faded and less vibrant colors.

, Once your dyed sand has completely dried, store it in dry plastic containers with easily sealed lids.


For safety purposes, store sealed sand outside of the kitchen. You don't want to accidentally mistake it for a spice or cooking powder.
Make sure you reseal the lids tightly after each sand art project. This will keep unwanted materials from ruining the color as well as prevent accidental spills inside the house.

, Use the colored sand you have just made to add some glitter and pizzazz to hand-drawn pictures.


Simply use a pencil to draw a design on plain white paper (a flower, for example). Once finished, place the paper on a try to contain the sand you will pour on later. Use a cotton swab to apply Elmer's glue to the areas you will be coloring in with sand. Carefully pour the different colors of sand onto the glued areas. Let the sand settle, then hold it over a plate to collect loose sand.For the greatest effect, draw something with many colors and with contrasting colors (for example, a rainbow). This will allow you to utilize a lot of your sand colors and will produce a vibrant, lively picture.

, Either decorate the outside of a flower vase with colored sand or showcase the sand itself in its own vase.


To spice up a flower vase, imitate the way you created a sand drawing. Set the vase on some newspaper. Pour 1/4 cup of tacky glue into a plastic cup and dilute it with a teaspoon of water. Use a paintbrush to apply the glue to the outside of the vase. Sprinkle spoonfuls of colored sand over the glued surface, rotating the vase to spread the sand evenly. Let the vase dry for a few hours, then place flowers inside.Layering sand in its own vase is also a nice house decoration. This is very easy: just pour one color of sand into a vase or clear jar and form a layer. Don't worry about whether this layer is even or straight; making it wavy and uneven adds personality to the vase and gives it a more natural look.Pour a different color of sand and form another layer. For the best contrast, avoid layering colors that look similar to each other, like purple and red. Continue this process until you reach the top of the vase. To give your vase a beach-like vibe, add some rocks and shells to the layers of sand.

, This is a nice twist on the layered sand vase and is great for adding uniqueness to plain white candles.


Layer the colored sand one layer and color at a time, similar to how you would create a layered vase. Instead of filling the vase to the top with sand, stop a little past half-way. Place a candle into the middle of the jar and burrow it into the sand slightly so that it is nicely supported. Now when you light the candle, its light will reflect off the sand and create a warm, inviting glow."

First, take a dried rose, making sure that it is completely dry.,
Fill a pot with water and bring it to boil.,
Add the dye to the pot after the water has come to a boil.,
Add a little bit of salt to the water.,
Insert the roses petals into the mixture.,
Hang the flowers to dry from a wire rack or other safe location.

,
Finished.

",How to Dye Dried Roses1," White roses work especially well for this exercise: Like blank canvasses, they're easier to transfer colors onto than other colored roses.;
, Have enough water in the pot so that you can fully submerge your rose petals after it has come to a boil. How much water you put in will therefore depend on the type of pot you use.

, Many people prefer to use Rit dye, although other dyes or food colorings can easily be used. Depending on the amount of water in the pot, add anywhere from 8 to 15 drops. More drops will help achieve a deeper color.

, Make sure that you have dissolved the salt in the dye. Salt helps the color adhere to the flowers. 1 teaspoon should be sufficient for a medium-sized pot of water.

, The hotter the water is when you submerge the rose petals, the deeper the color will be. The cooler the water when you submerge the rose petals, the lighter the color will be.


You can actually get a pretty cool, ""airy"" effect with your dye by submerging the petals into cooler water for less time. Many people prefer this type of color to the uniform, deep color of hot water dyes.

Trim each rose you're using down to size.,
Cut each rose stem in half or in fourths.,
Find a useful dye basin for your dyes.,
Place different color dyes in each dye basin.,
Position your rose stems in your dye basin and leave them there until they soak up all the dye.,
Remove the roses from the dye basin.",How to Dye Dried Roses2," You're going to be cutting the stem in half or in fourths and putting each half or quarter into a separate dye basin. Many rose stems need to be fairly short in order to do this, although not all need to be, especially if you can find a tall glass for your dye basin.

, If you want a truly mind-blowing tie-dye experience, cut the rose in fourths. Otherwise, just cut the stem in half. Creating two semi-stems should give you more than enough flower power — don't you worry.


You don't have to cut the stem of the roses all the way up to the bottom of the flower. In most cases, cutting the stem up about halfway will be sufficient for the dyeing process.

, Popsicle molds make ideal receptacles for dyes, giving you the opportunity to dye several flowers at once. If you can't find a popsicle mold, consider using two glasses or two vases for each rose.

, Only a little amount is necessary, as long as it submerges the bottom of the rose stem.


Try getting colors that match or interact well together. Red and pink work well, as do green and yellow; blue and purple; yellow and orange; green and blue.

, After about 8 hours, you'll begin to see some very nice coloring in your rose petals. After 24 hours, your rose petals should be almost a completely different color.

, Your roses are ready to present or dry out for posterity!

Use your acorns for crafts.",How to Dry Acorns for Crafts," They may be green, tan or brown. The more time they are on the ground, the higher the possibility will be that they may be attacked by insects.


Acorns are a large portion of a squirrel's diet. They are quick to harvest the best acorns, and you will see them actively hunting when the acorns are ripe.;
, Brush them gently with a nylon brush to remove dirt, insect larvae and leaves.

, Throw away any nuts that are already molding or decaying. These nuts will not retain the look of healthy nuts in your craft projects.


If you find any acorns with tiny holes in them, this is a sign that insects have been inside them. Drying them for crafts will kill the insects so it is up to your discretion whether you want to save these acorns.

, Lay your acorns in a single layer on a cookie sheet with a lip on it. Place your acorns in the preheated oven.

, This will allow the moisture to escape from the acorn kernels as they dry.

, Leave the acorns in for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, to ensure they dry completely. Remove them from the oven when they have dried.

, Remove any acorns that may have burned in the process of drying. Allow your acorns to cool on a wire rack for an hour before attempting to use them.

, You can attach them using glue or hot glue. Look for acorn craft ideas in magazines, blogs or crafting books.

",How to Dry Moss," Rocks and trees offer the easiest access to live moss. Place the scraper under one corner of the moss and slowly work forward, lifting the moss from the rock, tree or surface as you go. Dislodge the moss in the largest pieces possible.


Use a rake if you are having difficulty getting the moss to come off its surface cleanly.
Use a plastic scraper for particularly stubborn pieces of moss.;
,, Pick out all twigs, leaves, pine needles or other stray materials stuck in the moss and discard outside.

, Place it on a paper towel or other absorbent surface. Press your palm against the moss into the absorbent surface. (When squeezing the moss, don't ball the moss up in your hands. When moss dries, it can become brittle and difficult to work with. Unfolding the moss can cause it to break into small pieces.) Spread all partially dry pieces of moss onto a flat surface.


The surface should receive generous ventilation (open windows, outside breeze, fans or other air source).

, This prevents the moss from blowing away or becoming folded or twisted while drying.

,,

Remove twigs as for drying.






Place moss in a cooking pot.






Add 1 part glycerin to 3 parts water.






Add fabric dye as desired.






Bring the contents almost to a boil.

Freeze the animal until you're ready to prepare it.,
Prepare the form.,
Remove the skin.,
If you're preserving a fish, bird, or a lizard, leave the head alone.",How to Do Taxidermy1," You'll want to remove the skin as soon as is possible, but it's important to keep the animal from spoiling before you commit to preserving it and caring for the skin. To be safe, freeze the animal so you can acquire the necessary materials for performing basic taxidermy in the meantime:


Sharp knife
Sewing needle
Thread
Stuffing or plaster cast of animal
Borax, alcohol, or your preferred preserving agent;
, Depending upon your animal, you can prepare a plaster cast of the body at this point, or purchase a premade form (as is usually done with deer busts). You can also create your own form out of recycled materials, a particularly useful process for smaller animals. Use sticks to create a wood frame the size of the skinned body, and wrap the frame in twine or old plastic bags.To prepare a cast, purchase a commercial molding agent like ""Smooth On"" to create a shape mold of the animal to fill with plaster. Mix a small batch of plaster with water and pour quickly into your mold. Remove the mold and smooth the cast form with sandpaper or a small pocketknife. Don't worry too much about the details, you really just want the basic form and shape to fit the skin.
If you make your own form, it helps to have a workable example to compare it to. Take a picture of the animal before you remove the skin and use materials that can be manipulated easily once you've started putting the form together. Mammal legs are particularly difficult to get right. Consider purchasing a premade mold for your first go around to use as a model for subsequent projects.

, Whether you're going to preserve an iguana or a bobcat, the process starts by removing the skin and preserving it. The particulars of the preservation process will vary depending on whether or not you have a mammal or a reptile, fish, or bird, so read on for more specific instructions regarding the preservation of the skin.


Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a seam up the belly, being particularly careful not to puncture any of the organs or body cavity, which can ruin the skin. Work your knife evenly along the inside to loosen the skin, while peeling it back with your other hand. Think of it as taking off the animal's jacket and trousers. Remove as much of the flesh and fat as possible, using care to not tear or rip the skin.

, Remove the skin from a mammal's head as you would the rest of the body, but for lizards, fish, and birds, you'll need to remove the brain, eyes, and tongue and leave the shape of the head intact for preservation. The physiology of the bird makes it such that you can't (and wouldn't want to) remove the beak, so you'll have to remove the parts of the bird that would spoil and smell bad.


Smaller animals are much more difficult to taxidermy than larger mammals. It helps to have small dentistry tools or an X-Acto knife for this part of the process, and you must be careful to remove as much of the flesh as possible. Small debris can be removed during the preservation process, but you'll want to make sure you get most of the big bits of flesh removed from the head before moving on. It takes patience and a strong stomach.

"
"
Tan the skin of mammals.,
Use an alcohol mixture to preserve reptile skin.,
For bird and fish preservation, rub borax on the inside of the skin.",How to Do Taxidermy2," Rub non-iodized salt onto the flesh-side of the hide, roughly an inch thick, and let sit for 24 hours. Remove the old salt and repeat the process with new salt. In a cool dark place, let the hide dry. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't get too hard to mold, however.When it's toughened up, hydrate the skin using cool water, a small capful of Lysol disinfectant, and table salt. Soak the skin in this mixture overnight and rinse several times until the salt mixture is removed. Hang skin up to drain, and towel dry when its stopped dripping. You can consider using pickling agent at this point to treat the hide farther, but make sure you take care to remove any more bits of flesh or fat that are clinging to the hide before you move on to tanning it.
Treat the hide with tanning oil. Heat up the oil a bit in the microwave and rub it into the skin with your hands. Let the skin sit for several hours and roll the skin up in a plastic bag, keeping it in the refrigerator until you're ready to mount it on the form.

, Soak the skin in a 50/50 mix of glycerin and alcohol for up to two weeks.Keep in a cool and dark place. When you remove the skin, pat it dry and remove any glycerin from the inside.

, Place the skin flesh-side down on a generous coating of borax inside a shoebox. Sprinkle about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) more borax on top of the feathers. Leave in a cool, dark, and dry location for about 4 days. The flesh will be quite stiff after you remove from the borax. Brush off the excess and your bird or fish skin will be preserved nicely.

"
"
Dress your form.,
Sew it up.,
Display your project.,
Care for your taxidermy.",How to Do Taxidermy3," If you've made an accurate form, stuffing your hide should be as easy as dressing a doll. Fix your preserved skin onto the form, being careful to smooth out any unnatural looking lumps or irregularities. You'll want to fix any structural problems now before you sew it up.


Keep some twine on hand to stuff into spots that need some adjustment. Cut small bits of string or newspaper to fill out a muscle striation or other body part.

, Using an appropriate color of thread, stitch together the seam that you originally cut with as tight and invisible a stitch as possible. Adorn your taxidermy with false eyes and original teeth by gluing them in place.

, Use your imagination. If you're displaying a pet, keep them immortalized in a peaceful position, possibly curled up in a nap. Or, if you're celebrating a successful hunt, bare the animal's fierce-looking teeth. More complicated mounts are available commercially, but make up your own. Arrange a tableau of branches or rocks on your wall to position your taxidermy among.

, After the work of preserving your animal, make sure you don't let that work go to waste by ignoring it. Keep your mounts away from sunlight, in a climate controlled area of your home. Dampness can result in mildew, while excessive dryness can cause hides to crack or split. If the form settles in an unnatural way, consider splitting it open and resewing. Dust them periodically to keep them clean and realistic looking.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the embroidery hoop for hanging.,
Prepare the seashells for hanging.,
Hang the seashells from the embroidery loop.,
Display your new seashell wind chimes.",How to Create Seashell Wind Chimes," For this project, you will need 24 shells of relatively uniform size, some string or fishing line, the inner wood hoop from an embroidery hoop, a drill with a small drill bit (1/32 inch or smaller), and a pair of scissors.


This guide will present only 1 possible design for seashell wind chimes. You can adjust and augment these plans as desired to create wind chimes that are bigger, smaller, or have a different appearance.
If your seashells were gathered from a beach, it is best to clean them before using. Stray sand, grime, and bacteria can be removed using a mild dish soap and water.;
, The wooden hoop will be the piece from which all of the seashells hang. You will need to begin by drilling holes into it for passing the string through.


Place the hoop on a flat surface and use a pencil to mark out 24 evenly spaced points around its circumference. Do this by marking 4 points at the top, bottom, leftmost, and rightmost areas of the hoop. Then add 4 more points at the midpoints between the first 4. Finally, fill each remaining space in with 2 equally spaced points.






Fit your drill with a small drill bit and create 24 holes in the hoop where you marked the points. The holes should be large enough to pass your string or fishing line through.







, Each seashell will also need a hole drilled in it so that the string can be tied around it. The hole can be placed anywhere on the shell, keeping in mind that the position in which the shell hangs will be dictated by the hole's location.


Drill a small hole through each shell using the same size drill bit as before. To help prevent the shell from cracking, you can cover the hole's location with a strip of masking tape before drilling. Remove the tape after making the hole.






Cut your string into 24 separate pieces that are about 12 inches (30 cm) long. Tie one end of each piece of string through the hole in each seashell. Cut off any excess string to neaten the appearance.







, Once all of the shells have been attached to pieces of string, they are ready to hang onto the wooden loop.


Begin by tying the first seashell to a hole in the wooden loop using the full 12 inches (30 cm) of string. Tie the adjacent shell to the loop, this time positioning the knot so that the new shell hangs just higher than its neighbor. Repeat this process for all 24 shells, hanging each one slightly higher than the last. This will create a pleasant cascading appearance.






Once all of the strings are tied to the loop, you can cut off the excess string using your scissors.







, Once all of the seashells are hanging from the embroidery loop, the wind chimes are ready to hang. You can use the same string or fishing line to hang the wooden hoop from a hook. The string can be looped through the same holes used to hang the shells if the holes are wide enough. If not, you can drill 4 new equally spaced holes to suspend the hoop from 4 pieces of string.

Paint the fish with the paint, being certain to paint in the direction of the scales, not against the grain of the fish.,
Highlight the belly of the fish with a light color (white or yellow) and paint the fins a little bit darker than you paint the body.,
Beginning in the center, press the rice paper down on the fish, and try your best to press the rest of the paper outward from the center, trying not to get creases in it.,
Remove the paper once you are done pressing the entire fish, and lay your print flat.

,
Using a small paint brush, paint the eye onto your fish, and enhance the fins if necessary.

,
Be sure to sign your creation!,
Hang your print it to dry in your previously chosen, and hopefully per-setup location.

,
Using soap and water, wash the foam board you used to pin your fish to when you began the project.,
Once your print is dry, attach it along the top edge of the foam board using a glue-stick, or some other water based paint.,
Go back and thoroughly clean your work area, and put away your supplies.,
Frame your creation!",How to Do Gyotaku    Fish Rubbing," You must use good common sense when working with straight pins; you must have something (a cup works well) to hold them while working; for safety's sake, be certain to account for all of your pins while working, and if you drop one, stop working until it is located and return it to the container. Use good common sense when working with paint and glue. It is a good idea to wear an apron to cover your clothes, or wear old clothes when working with paint! The suggested paint will easily wash off, but the food color in the paint could create permanent stains. You may wish to wear rubber or painters gloves to protect your hands from the dye in the paint!;
, For your project, you will need 1. a washable work table (you could cover the floor beneath the work area for safety sake! 2. some artists foam board which is slightly larger than your subject (your fish!) 3. Several sheets of artists rice paper (large size) 4. water and vegetable dye based thick tempura paint 5. a good number of regular straight pins (like those used in sewing), and several inexpensive paint brushes, or foam paint ""brushes."" You must locate an area (best indoors) to hang your completed print to dry; a clothes hanger and several hinge type clothes pins, hung over a shower rack or door frame away from high traffic areas, will allow your painting to dry evenly.

, Catch or purchase a good sized fish. Fish with big scales make great rubbings. I prefer to use a fish which I would enjoy eating after my project is completed. I do this to honor the fish; I like to use as much of the fish as possible.

, Do not cut the fish in half, if you do, you risk removing the pectoral, coital, and dorsal fins of the fish, which add beauty to your art.

,,, Pin the fish securely onto a large artists foam board, being sure to pin open the fins; pinning the fins open will add beauty to your art.

, Make sure to completely cover the fish with paint, eye, fins and all!

, You want enough paint on the fish to assure a good print, but not so much that all you get is an unrecognizable print, and your goal is to create a print of your fish! Pause and look your fish over before the next step and be sure you like what you see! At this point you can rinse your fish off, and try again! Be certain to remove any gobs of excess paint.

, Be sure to press the rice paper all over the fish without smearing the paint if possible. Try your best to not press in any folds or creases; small creases will not hurt anything, and may actually add beauty to your print. If you wish, you can use a cloth in between your hands and the rice paper when you do the pressing to ensure even pressure on your subject, or you may use your hands directly on the rice paper for a more rustic appearance.

,,, The print can also be decorated with Asian inspired poetry or you can label your fish with it's species. Artists usually choose to sign in the far right or left hand corners of their work.

,, Set your foam board aside to dry, being sure to stand it on edge in location where it will not curl or be damaged.

, Attach the top edge only, because this will give your over all creation more contrast.

, If we clean up after we work, our next project will gain quicker support from others who must share our work area.

, You can make a home made frame, or purchase one that is just right at a hobby store. Be proud of your work, and show it off to others!


Please Note: You can do the painting and rubbing (pressing) over and over until you are happy with the results; just be certain to use a new sheet of rice paper each time.

Try wrapping individual flowers.",How to Wrap Flowers," You can use almost any type of paper to wrap flowers. If you want a simple classic look, choose plain brown craft paper. For a dressier look, choose wrapping paper or decorated wrapping sheets. For a unique look, think about using:Newspaper
Pages from old books (if you're wrapping small flowers)
Sheets of music
Colored tissue paper;
, Secure the middle of your flower stems with a rubber band. This will make them easier to wrap and keep them from coming loose in your paper. Set the flowers on your paper so that the rubber band lines up with the folded edge of the paper.








A small portion of the stems will be wrapped. However, the flowers should cover a lot of the paper while plenty of stems are exposed.

, Lay your paper on a table so the printed or colored side is face down. Bring the side closest to you up and over so you can fold it about halfway. Fold the paper at an angle so some of the plain side is exposed.








If you're not using colored paper, you should still fold the paper over at an angle. This will create decorative folds in the wrapped bouquet.

, Fold one side of the paper up and over the flowers so that it reaches the other side. You can then roll the bouquet so that all the paper is wrapped up, or you can fold the other side across the flowers.








This method will make a bit of a cone-shape and can be good for wrapping a bouquet with varying sizes of flowers.

, Take a few pieces of clear double-sided tape and place them on the folds of paper that overlap. Press the taped pieces together so that the wrapped bouquet doesn't come apart when you move your hands away. If you don't have tape, you could use twine or string. You'll just need to wrap the string or twine tightly so the paper doesn't unwrap.








You can finish your bouquet by wrapping a bow at the base of the paper, where it meets the stems.

, To support a delicate bouquet, you may want to use brown craft paper or a thick wrapping paper. If your flowers have strong stems and blooms, you can use a more delicate paper, like tissue paper or newsprint.


Choose a color that will look good with your flowers, not compete with it. For example, if you have an orange flower, think about using red and yellow tissue paper which will bring out the orange color.

, Trim the stems of your bouquet so they're the same length. Tie a rubber band around the stems so the stems don't come loose. The rubber band will be hidden when you wrap the flowers in paper. Wrap a paper towel around the end of the stems to prevent water from leaking out of the flowers and onto the paper.








To keep your flowers fresh for longer, consider soaking the paper towel in water. Then wrap the wet paper towel around the stems. Cover the wet paper towel with plastic wrap to prevent the water from soaking into the paper.

, Lay a square of your paper at a diagonal (so it looks like a diamond) in front of you. If you want the colorful part of the paper on the outside, lay the paper so the plain side is facing you. If you want just a little color to show, place the plain side down so the color faces you. Lay the flowers on the paper so the blooms are above the top square of the paper. Most of the stems should be going straight down the middle of the paper.








For an average bouquet, you'll probably want a square of paper that measures 2-feet by 2-feet.

, Hold the right corner that's closest to you and the bottom corner that's nearest to you. Fold this side over toward the flowers. The fold should be an inch or two thick. If your bouquet is small, you may want to do another fold or two so the fold ends up close to the stems of your bouquet.








A large bouquet with long stems might only need one fold.

, Take the left corner of the paper and fold it up and over the flowers. The paper should almost reach the side of the paper that you just folded.








If you want to really secure the wrapped flowers, you can use clear-sided tape to tape these folds.

, Carefully hold your fold in place over the flowers and take the long thick fold near the bottom with your other hand. Continue folding or rolling this side up towards the middle of the flowers.








It's important to fold the corners in this order so the bottom fold makes a kind of base or bottom for your flower stems.

, Once the left and bottom sides of the paper are covering the flowers and stems, finish rolling or folding the paper on the right side. You should now be able to hold the flowers in wrapped paper.








If you want a tightly wrapped bouquet, finish rolling the paper tightly so you create a lot of tension. For a looser bouquet, just gently fold the remaining paper over.

, Use ribbon, twine, or string to wrap around the paper. Wrap around the paper several times so that the paper doesn't come undone. If your paper is very thick, you may want to use clear double-sided tape to tape the folds together.









You may want to place a large decorative ribbon on the outside of your wrapped flowers. This can give the bouquet a professional look.

, Hold all of the flowers with one hand so your palm is enclosing the stems. Take a rubber band and wrap it around the stems at the point where you're holding them.








The rubber band will be covered up. It will ensure that individual flowers don't fall out of the bouquet.

, Take your string or ribbon and make a loop on one end. Slip the loop onto just one flower stem and slide the loop up so that it's near the rubber band.








The looped stem gives your string or ribbon a starting point for wrapping the bouquet. This will also make sure that the string or ribbon doesn't unravel from the bouquet.

, Evenly wrap the string or ribbon around your grouped stems. Keep wrapping until you've covered as much of the stems as you want.








If you have wide ribbon, you probably won't need to wrap around the stems very many times. Keep in mind that wrapping several layers of string or ribbon will strengthen and support the bouquet.

, Once the flowers are secure and wrapped as much as you like, bring the string or ribbon back to the front of the bouquet. Cut the string or ribbon and weave it into the wrapped stems.









You can also tie a ribbon or string bow to the front of the wrapped stems to hide the end of the wrapping.

, If you want to give a single bloom, make it really stand out by wrapping it. Roll the stem in a small piece of brown craft paper and roll twine around it to tighten and secure it. You could also use a small cloth square to wrap around the stem. Wrap ribbon around it to secure it.








If the flower is very small, you could twist one end of the paper into a cone. Place the small flower into the cone so it sits in the narrow end of the cone.

Keep winding all the way down the length of the wire.,
Keep going until you reach the end.,
Finished.

",How to Wrap Wire with Tape," The less bulk, the better the final look. You can use parafilm, a stretchable, self-clinging tape that should appear barely discernible rather than ""wrapped"" when attached.;
, Hold the parafilm in the other hand. If wrapping on a stem of an artificial flower, begin just under the base of the flower, where the wire has been inserted.


Wind the tape first around the wire or the flower base, to create the first clinging spot.
Wind once again around the same spot for firmness.







, Twist the wire with your holding fingers, to help turn the wire and aid the addition of the parafilm.


Use a ""stretch and pull down"" action with the tape hand. Wind around once, slightly overlapping the last wind each time. You'll get the feel for it after a few tries.







, At the end, wrap around twice and beneath the end, then snip off. To finish, run your fingers down the length to smooth out the tape. Done!

Notice that the stems and leaves will also turn colors over time, but that the flowers are usually the first to show the streaks, as they are in the fastest growing area.

",How to Tint Flowers," Some species work better than others, but a general rule of thumb is to choose white (or very light) colored flowers with very porous stems. Daisies, Allium (onion family) and Carnations work best, but you can get some decent results from chrysanthemums as well. Flowers on woody stems ""can"" work, but they take much longer for the coloring to percolate up the stem and into the flower.;
, Avoid the creamy/thick coloring used for cake icing. You want the drops that will diffuse quickly in water.

, Avoid ""bruising"" or ""crushing"" the stem as you cut. Shorter stems will allow for quicker coloring.

, You should see some color changes by morning.

Dehydrate petals with silica gel.,
Dry out petals with borax and sand.,
Preserve petals using cat litter.,
Place the petals in borax and white corn meal.",How to Preserve Rose Petals1," Silica gel, which can be purchased at most craft stores, can easily be used to preserve rose petals. You'll need a large package of silica gel and an airtight, sealable container.


Place an inch of silica gel at the bottom of an airtight container. Then, add the rose petals.Add about another half inch of silica gel, completely covering the flowers. Place the lid on the container and set aside in a safe place away from pets or children.It can take anywhere from two to seven days for flowers to dry completely. At this point, they can be removed and used in crafts. Wetter, larger petals will take longer to dry than smaller, dryer ones.;
, Borax and sand can also be used to preserve rose petals. As silica gel can be a hazard to pets and children, you may feel safer with this method. You'll need to buy fine sand and borax powder at a local craft store. Once again, you'll also need a container. However, you'll be leaving the container uncovered so it does not need to be sealable or airtight.


Sift the borax first, making sure to remove all the lumps. Then, mix the borax and sand. You should use a mixture of 2 parts borax, 1 part fine sand.Line one inch of the borax/sand mixture on the bottom of your container. Add the rose petals. Then, cover them completely with borax and sand. You'll need about half an inch.This method takes slightly longer to work than the silica gel method. You'll have to set your open container aside for 14 to 17 days before the petals dry completely., A plain, dust-free cat litter can also help preserve rose petals. You would use the same layering process as you used with silica gel. Line the bottom of an airtight, sealable container with an inch of cat litter. Then, add the rose petals. Then, add another half inch of cat litter. Seal the container and set aside for two to seven days.If you have cats, make sure to place the container out of their reach. If they see a container full of litter, they may assume it's for them and try to get into it.

, Borax can also be mixed with white corn meal to preserve flowers. Mix the borax and corn meal with a 50/50 ratio. Then, line an inch of the mixture on the bottom of a container. Add the rose petals. Cover with another half inch. Set the container aside, uncovered, for 14 to 17 days."

Dry the roses in the oven.,
Iron the petals.,
Heat a flower press in the microwave.",How to Preserve Rose Petals2," You can also use an oven to dry out petals. This method is quicker than air drying, but may cause more discoloration. To start, heat your oven to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.Arrange the petals in a layer on a cookie sheet. Make sure the petals are not touching.Place the cookie sheet in the oven. Heat the roses for at least 3 hours, keeping the oven door open the entire time.Remove the tray and set it aside in a safe place where it's unlikely to be disturbed. Leave overnight. There should be no more moisture on the flowers by morning., An iron can also help dry out flowers for preservation. However, this flattens the petals significantly. If you don't want to distort the shape, you may want to try another method.


To start, heat your iron to its lowest setting. Do not add water to the iron. If there is any water in the iron, empty it.Place the flowers between two sheets of absorbent paper. Use a book to flatten them slightly. Then, press the iron on top of the absorbent sheets for 10 to 15 seconds. Do not make any gliding motions. Simply press the iron down., A microwave can also help dry out flower petals for preservation. This process is very quick, which is its main advantage. However, pressing flowers under a microwave can cause them to brown.


You should buy a professional microwave flower press, which you can buy online or at a local craft store, for the best results. However, if you don't have a professional flower press you can make one by placing the petals between two ceramic tiles. From there, you can tie the tiles together with non-flammable string or twine.Place the press in the microwave. Heat it for 30 to 60 seconds at a time. Allow the press to cool off completely between sessions.Check the flowers periodically. Once they appear completely dry, you can remove them and use them for craft purposes."

Air dry the roses.,
Press the petals between books.,
Purchase and use a dehydrator.,
Consider professional freeze drying.",How to Preserve Rose Petals3," You can use natural heat to dry rose petals. This method can take slightly longer than others, but may require less work on your part.


To preserve petals, you need to set them on a surface that allows air circulation. You can use a wire cookie rack or a window screen, for example.Set the petals across the surface, making sure they're not touching each other. Then, find a warm and dark place to set the petals aside. Choose a place out of reach of children and animals. You do not want the petals to get disturbed during the drying process.It will take 10 to 20 days for the petals to dry completely. If you're drying more petals, it will take longer., If you don't mind investing some extra time, you can press flowers between a book and set aside for a few weeks. To start, place the petals between two pieces of absorbent paper. Make sure they are not touching. Then, place the paper and petals between the pages of a heavy book. A phone book works well.Place a brick or other heavy item on top of the book to weigh it down.Once a week, replace the absorbent papers. It will take the petals a few weeks to completely dry., A quality dehydrator, while expensive, is one of the best means to preserve petals without harming their appearance. You can purchase a dehydrator online or at a local craft shop. Set the dehydrator to its lowest heat setting and then place the petals inside. Allow the dehydrator to dry them and then remove., Professional freeze drying can be expensive. However, the rose's color and scent will remain preserved if you use this method. If the rose petals are particularly important to you, you may want to put your money towards professional freeze drying."

They're also fragile where the petal may come off by itself if the flower is not properly taken care of., This is the number one rule of picking flowers. Plumerias that have fallen off from the tree may be an invitation to bugs and other creatures that are attracted to the individual flower., Wilt is when the flower, usually happens faster with white ones, starts to turn brown. The edges will shrivel up first, then the coloring happens., During ""May Day"" and graduation ceremonies, people flock in yards to gather flowers. The flowers that rarely get touched are the ones at the very top or out of a person's arm reach. Grabbing and pulling down branches may help you get good flowers. Be careful not to snap the branch, since they are delicate and fragile themselves."

Cut flowers early in the morning.,
Cut in the evening.,
Avoid cutting flowers when it's the middle of the day.,
Choose flowers that are just coming into full bloom for picking.",How to Pick Flowers1," This is the best time of day because the flowers are fresh from the night's rest and haven't been exposed to a day of warmth.;
, If you're not able to cut flowers in the morning, the evening is the next best choice, as the flowers won't be wilting under the heat of the sun.

, At this time of the day the flowers will have very little moisture and will not last long when placed in a vase or bouquet.

, If you pick the flowers before this, there is a risk that they will be too immature to open their buds. And if they're picked well into bloom or towards the end of blooming, they'll fade fast on display in just water. Older blooms will drop petals and pollen everywhere, creating a mess in your house.


Blooms that are dusted with pollen are past their prime.
Exceptions to this rule include daffodils and tree blossom; these should be picked when still in bud. The warmth of your house will cause them to open quickly.

"
"
Although it's common to refer to ""picking"" flowers, choose to cut most flowers instead, using a sharp pair of scissors or garden snips.,
Note the exceptions.,
Always ensure that the cutting instrument (scissors, snips, knife, etc.)",How to Pick Flowers2," You will find that flowers that have been cut will last longer than those picked and this also minimizes damage to the plant.

, Flowers such as the Iris stylosa and cyclamens need to be pulled out completely, rather than cut. Learn about the specific needs of the flowers in your garden to see which ones fare better being completely removed.

, is sharp and clean. Avoid transferring disease to the flower plant by having dirty snips.

"
"
Cut flower stems at an angle.,
If cutting a lot of flowers, carry a small pail or bucket of water with you to place the flowers straight into it.",How to Pick Flowers3," The reason for this is that you create more surface area for the flower to drink up water.

,


Use room temperature water, not cold tap water.

"
"
Know which flowers are best picked when.",How to Pick Flowers4," Here are some common garden varieties and their best picking times:


Daffodils – while in tight bud
Daisies, dahlias, marguerites - when coming into full bloom; if dusted with pollen, they're not good to pick anymore
Long flowers such as lupins, foxgloves, delphiniums – when the lower flowers are fully open with some of the upper level buds yet to open
Poppies – when the buds have just burst open
Peonies - when the petals begin to unfurl
Chrysanthemums - when the flowers are fully open.

"
Make the focal flowers the center of the arrangement.,
Group flowers by color.,
Separate the flowers by size.,
Add in one element at a time.,
Think in groups of three.",How to Rearrange a Store Bought Bouquet1," There are three basic types of flowers you can place into your arrangements. When you are putting together an arrangement, the focal flowers should be the ones that are showcased, while the accent and filler flowers help make strengthen the arrangement.


Focal flowers are the larger flowers that are the focus of your arrangement. These can be anything, but are often lilies, roses, peonies, dahlias, and Gerber daisies. In a store bought bouquet, there are usually less focal flowers than others because they are larger and rarer.
Accent flowers are the other flowers that finish out your bouquet. There are more of these flowers in the bouquet, and they are generally smaller than the focal flowers. Commonly, they have multiple blooms on them. They may include limoniums, zinnias, and astilbe.
Filler flowers are small wisps of flowers with tiny blossoms. They act as accents. An example of a filler flower is baby's breath.;
, Try arranging your flowers by separating them by color. When you place them in the vase, put the flowers of the same color together. This means you may have yellow on one side of the bouquet and red on the other side.This creates clusters of color that pop and gives your eye something to focus on.

, When you get home, remove the wrapping from around your store bought flowers. Separate the flowers by size. Place all large flowers together, and then the medium. Set small flowers, greenery, and accents to the side.Place all the large flowers in your hand. Arrange them in a pleasing way for you.
Take whatever fillers and small flowers you like and place them in any gaps or thin areas in your bouquet.
Place it in an appropriately sized container. Make sure to trim the stems to fit the container.

, If you have a bouquet that has greenery, a large flower, and smaller cluster flowers, you can arrange the bouquet by adding one part of the bouquet at first. Start with the greenery. Cut the stems so the greenery starts right at the vase line. Cut the greenery so it doesn’t extend too far above the other flowers. Place around four pieces of greenery in the vase.Place a large flower in the center of the vase. Then, place four more large flowers on each edge of the vase. If you have additional large flowers, increase the number of large flowers in each of the five places.
Take the smaller flowers and place them in any holes or gaps. Trim the stems so they are the same height as the large flowers.

, Arranging flowers when thinking in groups of three can help give your arrangement a uniform and cohesive look. Start with three layers. This will include the large, focal flowers, accent flowers, and filler flowers or greenery.You can also group your accent flowers in groups of three. Consider grouping three accent flowers together to place in a gap.

"
"
Create bouquets with one base color.,
Use just the flowers.,
Place a single flower in a small container.",How to Rearrange a Store Bought Bouquet2," Instead of mixing colors, place flowers of the same color together. Buy a bouquet with multiple colors, or buy multiple bouquets with similar colors to make multiple arrangements. Separate the flowers into different colors. It’s okay if they are different shades of the same color.For example, if you buy a bouquet with purple, yellow, and pink flowers, separate them by color. Place all the purple flowers into a small vase, then the yellow ones in a small jar, and the pink flowers in a vase.
You can place them in the same room or throughout your house.

, If you want a simple arrangement, or you’re not sure how to use each part, just focus on the blooms. Instead of trying focal flowers and accent flowers, just separate the flowers. Remove all greenery and fillers you don’t like or don’t know how to place in the arrangement.Cut the stems the same length. You can just place them in a vase, or arrange them by color. You may also decide to spread out the different types of flowers as evenly as possible.

, For a creative way to display your flowers, think about them separately instead of together. If you have a lot of small bottles, vases, or jars, place one flower in each bottle. Arrange the bottles on a table to create a unique flower display.This works really well if you have bottles of different heights. Place a taller bottle next to a short one.
Make sure to cut the stems accordingly to fit the containers.

"
"
Pick the correct container.,
Consider the size.,
Use tape over the mouth of the vase to keep them in place.",How to Rearrange a Store Bought Bouquet3," What you place the flowers in is just as important as how you arrange them. Decide what you want to place your flowers in. You may choose a vase, a bucket, a mason jar, or anything else you believe would look pretty with flowers inside., The size of the container influences how you arrange the bouquet. The size of the bouquet also determines the type of container you need. If you have already bought a bouquet, look at the amount of flowers and the size of the stems. Decide if you need a larger container or a smaller one.


If you don’t have a large container, you can spread the flowers among multiple smaller containers.
If you only have large containers, make sure to buy enough flowers to fill the container so it doesn’t look sparse.
Tiny vases can’t hold a lot of flowers. Short and wide vases may need stems that are cut shorter.

, If you have trouble with your flower arrangement staying in place when you place it in the vase, use scotch tape. Place four pieces of tape over the mouth of your vase in a grid pattern. Two pieces should go horizontally, and two should go vertically.When you place the flowers into the vase, separate them into sections and place them in the holes in the tape. This will help keep the flowers from shifting or falling over.

"
"
Prepare your stems.,
Decide on the right height.,
Throw away wilted flowers.",How to Rearrange a Store Bought Bouquet4," Before you arrange the flowers, you have to make the stems ready. To do this, start by cutting the stems approximately one and a half times the height of your container. This makes sure you don’t have greenery or flowers of different heights. It also helps make sure your flowers aren’t too tall or too short.After cutting your stems, make sure to cut away all leaves that will be below the mouth of the vase.

, There are a few ways you can arrange the height of your flowers. They can all be the same basic height. You can also make a uniform cluster of flowers that create an orb-shaped dome.To create a dome, start by placing four flowers together in a square shape at the same height. This is the center of the done. Add one flower at a time out from the center to create the tight cluster.If you want to get a bit more creative, try varying the height of the stems. Place some taller flowers in the center or back of the arrangement with shorter ones in the front.

, Before you arrange your flowers, make sure to get rid of any flowers that are not in the best shape. These flowers might be wilted, damaged, broken, or messed up in some other way. Only place the prettiest flowers into the vase.You also should look at the greenery. Toss any wilted or damaged greenery.
If there are damaged leaves on good flowers, just clip the leaves.

Choose your colors.,
Find decorative ribbons.,
Pick out personalized embellishments to decorate your mum.",How to Make Homecoming Mums1," Use your school colors as a guide to help you pick out the colors of the ribbons and flowers


Incorporate neutral colors and lighter shades of your school colors to compliment your two main colors.






High school seniors usually use silver, gold, and white ribbon in their mums to signify their status as seniors.





;
, Most art and crafts stores have a huge selection of decorative ribbon. Pick varied styles that compliment each other like ribbons with ruffles, lacy ribbons, and patterned ribbons.

, A few ideas would be to use bells, stick-on letters, football-related accessories, charms, tassels, feathers, and glitter.


Be creative! Almost any little trinket or decoration you can find will add some flair to your mum.

Cut some 4-inch lengths from #3 and #5 ribbon until you have enough to create cones around the entire edge of one cardboard backer.,
Overlap the pieces and twist both ends in the same direction to form a cone shape.,
Once you've completed enough cone-shaped ribbons, staple them to the back edges of the cardboard backer.,
Fill in the spaces between the cones with a second row of cones using the second color of ribbon.,
Remove the stem from the mum flower.,
Take the backer of the pointed ribbons and glue the mum to the front middle of the backer using a hot glue gun.,
Pick up #5 and #9 ribbon in the color of your choice and cut several 48-inch-long strips.,
Take your 48-inch pieces and fold them in half to create 24-inch streamers.

,
Overlap the folded ends of the 24-inch streamers on the bottom of your second backer.,
Once your backer looks full of ribbons, embellish the lengths of the ribbons with any sort of decorations you desire.,
Make a military braid from your ribbons if desired.,
Tie on bells using curling ribbon if desired.,
Take two 5-inch pieces of #5 and #9 ribbon and overlap them several times to form a loop.,
When you are satisfied with your embellishments, glue the third backer with the safety pin loop onto the back of middle backer to cover staple edges and protect clothing from staple snags.

,
Glue the middle backer containing the ribbons to the to the back of front backer containing the mum and the points.

,
Lastly, glue any central charms on the mum and add any final touches to the piece.,
When you are ready to wear your mum, take your large safety pin and thread it through the loop you created on the back backer with the two 5-inch pieces of ribbon.,
Finished!

",How to Make Homecoming Mums2," Start with about 5 cuts of each color and cut more as needed.

, Make sure that every cone has the shiny side of the ribbon facing outward. Staple the ribbon on it's fold to hold the cone shape.

, Position the cones so that the points are pointing away from the backer and staple base of the cone. For the first layer, use the same color cones and leave about a quarter to a half inch of space between each cone.


Continue to staple the cones until the entire edge of the backer is filled with cones. It should look like a drawing of a sun or a flower.







, Remember to staple the base of the cone on the backside of the backer.

, The flower can be either real or fake, but most used are generally fake to prevent from wilting.

, Set the mum aside and allow the glue to dry for several minutes.


If you want to make a double mum, simply use a double backer with two holes instead of one and attach two flowers using a glue gun.

, Again, start with about 5 strips of each and then cut as many as needed to create a full-looking mum.

,, Staple them together, making sure to alternate the colors and ribbon width/style as desired.

, Some ideas includes the writing of words out in glitter glue, fastening beads, rhinestones, or small plush figurines, and even putting photographs on the ribbons. Be sure to use a hot glue gun to fasten charms and other heavier objects to the ribbons., To make a military braid, begin by stapling the ends of two different colored ribbons together at a right angle.


Next, fold a colored ribbon towards you, forming a loop as long as the ribbon is wide and staple the ribbons together where they intersect.
Take a loop of your second ribbon and bring it through the original loop of the first ribbon.
Continue to bring a loop of the first ribbon through the second ribbon and pull the second ribbon tight around the first ribbon. Remember to alternate ribbon colors as you continue to do this until you reach the end of the ribbons.

, You will use your middle backer with the streamers for this step.


Cut several pieces of curling ribbon each 36 inches (91.4 cm) long and tie a small bell to the end of each piece.
Attach to the middle backer using hot glue.

, Staple the loop to the top center of the third, unused backer. This will serve as the base for your safety pin.

,,, Allow the glue to dry., Then simply attach the pin to your clothing.

Thread the seed beads onto the plastic thread.,
Make another ball end to stop the beads from sliding off.",How to Make a Reminder Ring from a Plastic Tag Thread," These are often applied to goods for sale that aren't able to take a sticky price tag. If you don't want to spend much, look for an item in a dollar store.

Try to keep a supply of these tag threads in a small container inside your craft box. That way, you can make as many of these as you like in the future.;
, When removing it from the item, cut it carefully. The aim is to cut the thread as close to the little fastener bump as you can, to make as much thread available for the project as possible.
, Hold one end of the plastic thread in the naked flame of a candle to create a ball.

Place the plastic in the area indicated in the image, the lower end of the flame closest to the candle. This is the area of highest temperature and will result in a lot less smoke than if you were to place the plastic thread higher up the flame.
Place a bowl of water near you in case you need to quickly extinguish any burning plastic (see Warnings below).

,, The first bead will rest on the ball end you've just created, allowing you to keep threading on the rest of the seed beads.

About halfway, cross the plastic thread over and through a larger bead to keep the crossing in place (see the image for instruction).






Continue threading on the remaining beads until you get to the end of the plastic thread. (If you've used plastic instead of glass seed beads, the final bead should be made of glass, to prevent burning when melting the final ball.)
Hold the last beads in place by pinching with your fingers or using a pair of metallic tweezers.

, Use the method as described above for the first ball. Try to align the final length of this piece evenly, so that it fairly matches the other length. Done; it's now ready to place on your finger whenever you need to remember something!

Fan out the accordion folds.",How to Make Mexican Paper Flowers," Lay out a sheet of green tissue paper. Pick up one corner and roll it into a tight cylinder. Continue rolling, pressing down the paper to keep it as tight as possible. Now you have the stem for your flower.


;
, Wrap a small piece of tape around the final corner of the paper ""stem.""




, This looks best with paper in two or three bright colors. Cut the paper to 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 in) for a medium–large flower, or try out other sizes.




, Starting from a short side, fold the stack of paper over about 2.5 cm (1 inch). Crease the paper, flip the stack over, and fold it again in the other direction. Keep folding in alternate directions, as though you were making a paper fan. Continue until the entire stack forms an accordion fold.





Optionally, trim the ends into a point, rounded end, or V-shaped notch. These effects create a flower with distinct petals, instead of a fluffy carnation. You can even make a second layer in green paper, cutting it into sharp points to form leaves.
If you are using paper much smaller or larger than the size mentioned above, adjust the size of the fold to match.

, Keep the paper in a 1-inch wide stack. Fold it in half so the two ends meet. Crease it to mark the center, then unfold it again.

Wear clothing to protect your eyes and skin.,
Start with 10mL of the solvent Diethyl Phthalate (DP).,
Add 3 mg of your chosen fluorescent dye to add color.,
Add 50 mg of TCPO to the dyed mixture.,
Add 100 mg of sodium acetate to the mixture.,
Finally, add 3 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide to the mixture.,
Add larger quantities of TCPO and Sodium Acetate to make the reaction go on for longer.",How to Make a Glowstick1," Some of the chemicals are carcinogenic and incredibly dangerous when used improperly. It should also be noted that these are expensive and often difficult to obtain chemicals, best bought in bulk. They are not conducive to only making one or two glow sticks. At the very least, you should have:


Latex gloves
Ventilated goggles (lab goggles)
Long sleeves
Face mask
A clean, tidy work station
Clean glass tubes or containers with matching lids.;
, This is your base and makes up the majority of the liquid in your glow sticks. It will hold the chemicals that actually glow and amplify them. Start with 10mL of DP, but know that you can double or half this for bigger or smaller sticks. This looks like water, but the chemical reaction necessary for glowing won't work in water


You may have to dig around a bit online to find these chemicals. Chemistry giants Alfa Aesarand Sigma Aldrichare two great resources.
If you double the solvent, then you should double the rest of the ingredients below.

, You cannot use normal or additive dyes; make sure you're using fluorescent dyes. These dyes will not be the same color un-mixed as they are when they glow, so trust the guide given below to make your colors. There are a variety of different dyes you can use, depending on the color you want:


9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene for green

Rubrene for yellow

9,10-diphenylanthracene for blue

Rhodamine B for red (note: rhodamine decays quickly, meaning reds tend to fade fast).

Mix half yellow, half blue to create white.


, TCPO stands for bis (2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate, which you may need to know to purchase it. It's quite expensive to buy, but you can make it fairly cheaply if, again, you're experienced and competent around chemicals. Otherwise, making it is not advised.The TCPO is used instead of luminol in this method -- it's the component that makes the mixture glow and it lasts for hours.
TCPO is incredibly carcinogenic, and should be handled with care. Never inhale TCPO.

, If you don't have sodium acetate, an even mixture of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and sodium salicylic can effectively be used instead. When added, put the lid on and shake the bottle well.

, It's important to do this step last, as it creates the chemical reaction. Put the lid back on, shake it up well, and turn off the lights. You should have a quite impressive stick/tube/container glowing ferociously in front of you.


The hydrogen peroxide is an activator, not part of the reaction, so you won't need much.
When you buy glow sticks, the ""crack"" noise to activate them is breaking a little glass vial of hydrogen peroxide.

, If you so desire, mess around with the recipe to see what warrants the best results. This reaction works because TCPO and Sodium Acetate release energy when combined, as they start to decay. This energy is picked up by the florescent dyes, which can convert energy into light. More of each leads to more energy and a longer reaction.

Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly.,
Set the correct lid next to each container.,
Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles.,
Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow.",How to Make a Glowstick2," In addition, wear gloves to protect your skin. It's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best. Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected. Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children!


Listen up, kids: You'll be working with a solution that's near a 12 on the pH scale. That basically means don't swallow it, don't put it in your eyes, don't bathe in it, and don't really expose yourself to it directly at all. Got it? Moving on.

, A ceramic bowl will work best, but plastic works too. Use funnels, measuring tubes, and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you.


Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol's nitrogen atoms with oxygen. When that happens, all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results? The glow.

, It is important not to touch the luminol. Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy. Unfortunately, these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests.


Yep, unless you're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy/criminologist you probably don't have this stuff lying around the house (hopefully not...). If you're dead set on starting your own glowstick business (worse ideas exist), try websites like Alfa Aesaror Sigma Aldrichfor supplies.
Mix everything well. Don't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort.

, It's important to use sanitary, clean tubes for your glowsticks. The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you're depending on to make the substances glow.

, This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling. It's not like the glow will get up and run away from you, but still.

, Shake them up once the lids are on tightly. Then turn off the lights!


If it's not already glowing, something went wrong. Do over!

, Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them! But act quickly...the glow won't last very long. Expectations crushed? Method two to the rescue!


The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates doesn't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes. For something that lasts hours, go to the next method (which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory, but it's still worth mentioning).

Obtain two colors of gimp lacing from a craft store.,
Cut two pieces of gimp from two different colors.,
Make a twist.,
Weave the second piece.,
Pull tight.,
Repeat.,
Finish when desired.",How to Make a Box Styled Gimp1," You can do this with two strands of one color, but it's easiest to keep track of what you're doing with two colors, especially if you're just starting. Choose any colors you like.;
, Place one on top of the other to make a cross. Make sure the pieces lay flat. 








When cutting the material, cut an equal length. The lacing isn't very expensive, and it's much easier to trim a bit at the end than to add more later.
Make sure you use a flat surface to start, after you started it, don't use a flat surface- pick up the strands to work with them.

, Hold one of the strands. Twist it around the other strand twice, making two loops over the straight piece.








, Take the other piece and weave it above the first one. Do the same to the other side of the strand. Move to the second color. Weave the second color over and under the two loops. Go straight across. Weave the other strand, repeating the stitch with the second color.









If using a flat material, avoid twisting the strands as you loop them over and pull them through.

, Make a gentle, slow pull to avoid twisting. Try to pull each stitch to a consistent tightness so that they will come out even. An easy way is to hold the center of the stitch and pull one strand at a time. Leave some extra length. You'll want to have about three inches at the end for attaching as a bracelet or to tie to an object.








, Use this stitch to make additional stitches, adding to the length of your bracelet or lanyard. Make two loops of one color, straight across the stitch you just made. Leave some extra length. You'll want to have about three inches at the end for attaching as a bracelet or to tie to an object.








, A box styled gimp can be as long or as short as you wish. No knotting or tying off is necessary on the ends; simply be sure the last stitch is tight, and it should hold the whole length of stitches in. "

This technique is more advanced; it is trickier, but quicker once you're used to it. The red arrow shows what you will do in the current step. Your result should match the next image at the beginning of this step.The four parts of the cross are now Strands A, B, C, and D.

, Leave a loop. Hold it with one finger while you prepare to make the next fold. Take your time making the folds and loops, and make sure they’re nice and even.








, Fold Strand B (the one on the same side as Strand A) over Strand A. Hold it down with one finger.

Make a bracelet.,
Make a keychain.,
Make a lanyard.",How to Make a Box Styled Gimp3," One of the most common uses is for friendship bracelets. From young kids to teenagers to adults, friendship bracelets are worn around the world, and they are commonly made form the simple box gimp stitch.


Make the gimp as long as it needs to be (use a measuring tape on your wrist and add an inch). Super glue or melt the ends together and then slip it around your wrist. You could also use metal clasps.
If you don't have super glue you can tie the ends together, or you can also use a match to melt the ends together.

, Add a keyring to one end of your gimp and you've got a keychain! Having a nicely stitched gimp as your keychain holder is a nice look, and since gimp lacing and the stitch itself are highly durable, it’s ideal for applications such as keeping your keys in place.


Add the key ring first, as you begin the stitch if your intent is to make a keychain.
You can make a keychain out of a gimp you’ve already woven- simply use a match to melt the ends of the two strands together around your keyring for a permanent connection. , A box gimp is ideal for making a long, sturdy lanyard. The gimp lacing can withstand being pummeled about on a lifeguard’s neck as he or she jumps in and out of the water. You'll need two extra long strands of gimp.
Attach the two pieces by tying, using superglue, or melting together to form the attachment to hang around your neck.
Attach whistle or other item in a similar fashion as a keyring to the other two ends.

Look for a recycling symbol.,
Learn how to glue plastics marked 6.,
Select a specialized glue for plastic marked 2, 4, or 5.,
Make the right choice for plastics marked 7 or 9.,
Try to identify the plastic type in other ways.,
Do further research if gluing plastic to another substance.",How to Glue Plastic1," Different varieties of plastic require different glues. The easiest way to identify the type is to search for a recycling symbol on the plastic itself, the label, or the packaging the object came in. This symbol is a triangle formed by three arrows, and contains a number, letter or both inside or below the triangle., A recycling symbol containing a 6 or PS signifies the plastic type ""polystyrene"". This is best glued with a poly cement (also called plastic cement), or a specialized plastic glue such as Loctite Epoxy Plastic Binder or Super Glue Plastic Fusion.Other adhesives that will work include a cyanoacrylate (also called ""instant glue"" or ""cyano""), or an epoxy., If your material is labeled 2, 4, 5, HDPE, LDPE, PP, or UMHW, you have a type of ""polyethylene"" or ""polypropylene"". These plastics are much more difficult to glue, and you'll need to look for a specific product that names these types on its label, such as Loctite Plastics Bonding System or Scotch Weld DP 8010.

, The miscellany category marked 7 or the ABS type marked 9 can indicate a variety of plastic resins, with many possible letters indicating subtypes. Your best bet for gluing it is an epoxy or cyanoacrylate.

, If there is no recyclable system, you may have to guess at which type of plastic it is before you can select a glue. Here's a guide to help you accomplish this task:Lego bricks are made from a type of plastic called ""ABS"", and are best glued using epoxy cement. ABS solvent cement will also work, but may alter the shape of the material's surface.
Imitation glass, cheap toys, CD cases, and similar brittle, often clear plastic is usually ""polystyrene"" and can be glued using a number of adhesives. For best results, use a poly cement or a glue advertised for plastic bonding.
Glue tough, hard plastic found in bottles, buckets, crates, and food containers using a product that specifically advertises the ability to bond ""polyethylene"" and ""polypropylene"". These are impossible to glue by most normal methods, so don't assume a product labeled ""for plastic"" will work unless it specifically mentions ""polyethylene"" or ""polypropylene"".

, If you are gluing plastic to wood, metal, glass, or even a different type of plastic, you'll need to commit to further research. If you can't find an answer online or by asking an experienced handyman, go to the hardware store and look at each brand of adhesive you've determined you could use following the above steps. The packaging should tell you what substances it can glue onto plastic.


Visit This to That for extensive advice on which glue to use for each combination of materials. This advice will be most helpful for common types of plastic, especially polystyrene.
If you are unsure which to use, try testing an adhesive with scrap material of the same types, or in an unobtrusive corner of your object in need of gluing.

Separate and cut out each cup from a plastic egg carton.,
Make a hole in the center of the egg carton piece by a pressing a pin through it from the inside.,
Ensure that you're in a well-ventilated area for this step.,

Cover the stem in masking tape.,

Color each flower.,

Use another toothpick to remove the tape off each stem after the paint has dried.
,
Create the center of the flower using three dimensional paint.,
Finish up.",How to Make a Flower from a Plastic Egg Carton," Decide which flower you're going to make, either the daisy or the poppy:







Daisy: Cut each cup into ""equal eighths"" to make the petals. Cut the end of each petal with shears to make an edge.

Poppy: Don't cut. Simply cutting away the plastic egg holder from the egg carton will allow this piece to open up enough to appear like the flower already.;
, Once you've made the hole, push the toothpick through the pinhole. This forms both the stem of the flower and provides the holding piece for when shaping the petals with heat., Also remove anything that is flammable away from the workspace area, then light the candle. Working carefully over the candle, start to shape the form of each flower that you're creating, using the candle heat to melt the petals into an appropriate form. Don't actually touch the flame or the plastic will burn – just aim the flower close enough for the heat to melt it. The following photos show a range of petal possibilities created just by moving the flower piece carefully over the candle flame:






























, This tape is to prevent the stem from being spray-painted in the next step.







The finished stem covers.

, Using the spray paint in the color of your choice, gently spray each flower all over. Again, ensure that this is done in a well-ventilated space and be sure to cover the workspace adequately to prevent possible staining.,, Dab a small amount of paint into the center of the flower and the results should look as follows:

Remove grease from the plastic.,
Sand the surface to be glued.,
Mix the two glue components together if required.,
Apply glue to both surfaces.,
Press the pieces lightly together.,
Keep the pieces firmly in place.",How to Glue Plastic2," Wash with soap, use a specialized plastic cleaner, or soak the plastic in isopropyl alcohol to clean.Dry thoroughly.


Avoid touching the piece with your bare hands afterward, to minimize oil residue.

, Briefly sand the plastic with 120-200 grit sandpaper to create a rough surface for the glue to bond to. Steel wool or emery cloth will also work, but remember it only needs to be rubbed briefly.

, Two-part ""epoxies"" require two ingredients to be mixed together to activate the adhesive. Read the instructions on the container carefully, as there are many types of epoxy and each requires a certain ratio of the two ingredients. Some of them can be used for several hours after mixing, while others require application within a few minutes.


See Selecting a Glue to learn which type of glue to use. You can skip this step if you are not using a two-part adhesive.

, Use a small brush to apply an even layer of adhesive to both surfaces where they will be attached. For tiny pieces, such as a broken piece on a plastic model, you can use the tip of a needle instead.


If you are using a solvent cement (not a poly cement or plastic cement), you should clamp the pieces together first, then use an applicator bottle to put a thin line of solvent cement along the edge between the pieces, where it will be drawn between them.If you are using it on plastic pipes, see Gluing Plastic Pipes instead.

, Press them together to get them in place and remove air bubbles. Don't push so hard that the adhesive oozes out of the joint. If it does, wipe away the excess unless you are using an acrylic cement, which should be left to evaporate.

, Use a clamp, vise, masking tape, or rubber bands to hold them firmly together. Read the instructions on your adhesive container to know how long to leave them in place. Depending on the type and brand of adhesive, the bond could take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours to develop.


Many plastic adhesives continue to ""cure"", or develop a stronger bond, for days or even weeks after application. Avoid applying stress and heat to the glued piece for at least 24 hours after application, even if the bond seems strong.

The easiest way to identify them is to look for the worldwide recycling symbol, a triangle formed from three arrows with a number or letters to identify the type of plastic. Learn how to use this and other identification methods before selecting a glue.PVC pipe is common in residential plumbing, although it should not be used for distribution lines or other high-temperature applications. It is usually white, or grey if used for electrical or industrial purposes. Its recycling symbol is 6 or PVC.
CPVC pipe is PVC pipe treated to withstand higher temperatures. It has an identical recycling symbol (6 or PVC) but is usually tan or cream colored.
ABS is an older and more flexible type of plastic piping, usually black in color. It is not suitable for drinking water purposes and in some regions may not be legal for any plumbing uses. Its recycling symbol is 9, ABS, or 7 (other).
PEX pipe is the newest type of plastic piping, available in many colors. It is not recyclable. It cannot be glued, and must be attached using mechanical fitting tools.

, The material that bonds plastic piping together is called solvent cement. Find the specific solvent cement you need after you've identified the type of plastic.ABS solvent cement will join two ABS pipes together. PVC solvent cement and CPVC solvent cement similarly join two pipes of that type.
Transition solvent cement is used to join an ABS pipe to a PVC pipe. Its distinctive green color makes it easy to identify.
If you can't find a more specialized product, universal solvent cement will do an okay job for any combination of PVC, CPVC, and ABS. You should still identify your pipe beforehand to rule out PEX pipe, which must be fitted instead of glued.
Read the label of the solvent cement to make sure it will work on the size of pipe you're using.
To attach a plastic pipe to a metal one, you may need a specific adhesive for that specific plastic and specific metal combination, or a mechanical fitting method. Contact a plumber or hardware store employee for advice.

, Primer and solvent cement release dangerous vapors when used. Either work in an area with excellent ventilation (large open windows, outdoors, etc.) or wear a respirator that blocks organic vapor.

, Roll 80-grit sandpaper into a tube and sand the inside and outside of the pipe where it will be attached. The goal is to remove uneven pieces and ""burrs"" created from sawing, which can otherwise catch debris and cause clogs.Flatten the sandpaper roll against the tube to match its shape before rubbing.
If you don't have sandpaper, use a file or remove the obvious burrs with a pocketknife.

, You won't have much time to arrange the pipes once you've applied the solvent cement, so first fit the pieces together dry. Turn them to the alignment you need and use a permanent marker to draw a line across them.

, Of the three types of plastic pipe, PVC is the only material that requires priming, but CPVC may attach better after priming as well.Wipe PVC primer or CPVC primer as appropriate onto the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting, where they will be attached. Let dry 10 seconds before continuing.

, Wearing gloves, use a brush or cotton ball to wipe an even layer of solvent cement on the outside of the pipe segment and the inside of the pipe fitting. Only apply a thin, even layer to the fitting socket or excess may be pushed into the water piping and create blockage., Directly following the application of solvent cement, attach the pipes a quarter turn from the alignment marks you made, then twist them until the marks line up. If you didn't have to make any alignment marks, simply attach and give a quarter turn twist. Hold in place for about fifteen seconds to give the cement time to grab., The attachment may shrink slightly when the solvent cement dries. If your final piece is too short, saw it apart and lengthen it by gluing a new fitting onto it. If it is too long, remove a section of the pipe entirely by sawing and join the two remaining ends together with a new fitting.

Use this method for easy, relatively minor adjustments.,
Hard boil two or more eggs.,
Mash the eggs to pieces.,
Place the copper and eggs inside a container.,
Seal the container.,
Check back regularly.,
Polish off excess tarnish if necessary.",How to Darken Copper1," The yolks of hard boiled eggs can produce sulfur and related chemicals that react with the copper to change the color to a darker brown or black. While this method will take longer and may not produce as dramatic results as using liver of sulfur, you do not need any equipment other than hard boiled eggs and a sealed container.;
, Use two or three eggs for copper jewelry, or more if you have larger or multiple items. Place the eggs in a pot of boiling water and let them sit for at least ten minutes. The over-boiled sulfurous smell and greenish ring around the yolk are good indicators that the eggs will darken your copper.

, Use a spoon or other utensil to break the eggs into pieces. If the container you will be using is a bag, it may be tidier to place the eggs inside it first.

, Try not to have the eggs touch the copper if you want to avoid colored spots on your copper.Instead, place the copper objects on a small dish or on the other side of the container.

, Fasten the lid or seal the plastic bag. The container must be airtight in order for the gases produced by the egg to become concentrated enough to affect the copper.

, Depending on the freshness of the eggs and the quantity of eggs used, you could start to see results within twenty minutes or several hours. Check back every half hour to an hour, or if you want your copper to become much darker, leave it overnight.

, Use a clean cloth to wipe off excess color if the copper became too dark, or if you want to create a more variable, less even effect.

Use tongs to dip the copper into the liver of sulfur solution for a second or two.,
Repeat until the desired color is reached.,
Clean the copper with baking soda to stop the color change.,
Treat your copper with a wax or lacquer to preserve the color.",How to Darken Copper2," Liver of sulfur, composed of potassium sulfide and related chemicals, reacts with copper to create different colors. While this material is more expensive and potentially more dangerous than the substances used in other methods, this method has the best chance to create a much darker patina.

, Wash the copper clean with warm, soapy water. Relatively clean copper items, with no oily sheen or stuck-on dirt, may instead by wiped with a clean cloth or treated with a clear household cleaner.

, Liver of sulfur can be purchased in several forms. Liquid liver of sulfur is pre-diluted, but may have a shelf life of only a few weeks. The gel form and dry form must be mixed with water before use, but if stored properly, they can last much longer.Note that the dry form, also sold as ""lump"" or ""nugget' liver of sulfur, may release dust that can cause harm when inhaled.

, Put on latex or rubber gloves before handling the liver of sulfur, as it can irritate skin. Work outside or in an area with good air flow, especially if you are working with dry liver of sulfur. Liver of sulfur has a strong, unpleasant smell, which the ventilation will also reduce. If you have safety goggles, wear them.


If liver of sulfur gets on your skin remove clothing to expose the affected area and rinse in running water for fifteen minutes.If this substance gets on your eyes, rinse in running water for fifteen minutes, occasionally moving your lower and upper eyelids apart to expose more of your eye to the water. Seek medical attention.If you swallow liver of sulfur, induce vomiting immediately and seek medical attention., Dry liver of sulfur should be gently tapped until you break off a pea-sized nugget; the darker material from the interior of the lump will be more effective.Mix this pea sized nugget with approximately 1 cup (240 mL) of water. Gel or liquid solution should be diluted according to the instructions, as different brands may contain different concentrations of liver of sulfur or already be pre-diluted to the correct strength.


Cold water and more dilute solutions should work fine when treating copper, and allow more control over the exact color.Using warm water or hot water may darken your copper faster, but never mix liver of sulfur with boiling water, as this produces harmful gas., Baking soda will neutralize the liver of sulfur, preventing it from darkening your copper more than you desire. Prepare a mixture of baking soda and water in advance so you can stop the color change as soon as you desire. In a separate container than the liver of sulfur, stir together approximately one part baking soda with sixteen parts water.Use a container large enough to soak your copper object in.

, Using gloves and tongs, or tweezers for small items, hold the copper under the surface of the liver of sulfur and water solution for a short time.


If your copper object is too large to dip into the solution, use a brush to apply the solution, or transfer the solution to a wider, shallower container.

, Remove the copper from the solution and examine it for color changes, taking care not to hold it near or above unprotected eyes. Depending on the concentration of the solution, and the temperature of your copper, you may see any color from pink to black. Dipping it into the solution additional times should produce darker colors, ending in a black or grey patina.


If the color changes are minor, try heating the copper in a pan of hot, but not boiling, water. Higher temperature should produce a more dramatic color change.
If the color is not dark enough, try mixing in 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) pure ammonia into the solution. Adding additional ammonia may result in a reddish color, rather than black., Once you've reached the desired color, let your copper item soak in the baking soda bath for a few minutes.Remove and wash in warm, soapy water.If the color change has progressed too far, or if you would like to create a more uneven, antique look, gently scrub the patina with steel wool or a paste made from baking soda and a few drops of water.
Baking soda may also be added to the liver of sulfur solution after you're done. This will neutralize the liver of sulfur and allow you to safely dispose of it down the sink., Any wax or lacquer intended for metals can be applied over the new patina according to the product's instructions. This will prevent or slow down further color change as long as the wax or lacquer is kept clean and not rubbed off.

"
Mix your own solutions to achieve specific colors.,
Clean your copper.,
Follow safety procedures if working with ammonia.,
Use ammonia for a green patina solution.,
Mix a brown patina solution instead.,

Keep in a humid area for one to eight hours.,
Reapply the solution if the patina fades.",How to Darken Copper3," The natural green copper patina can be mimicked with an ammonia solution, while the slightly darker color of an American penny can be created with baking soda and water. Because the application of these solutions are so similar, they are both described in this section.

, Wipe the item clean with a dry cloth. Grimy copper items should be washed in warm, soapy water instead, then dried thoroughly.

, If you are trying to create a green patina, you'll need to use ammonia. Work outside or in an area with a powerful ventilation system or fan. Ammonia fumes can be toxic, so ammonia should never be handled in an enclosed space. Rubber gloves and safety glasses are recommended.


If creating a brown patina with baking soda and water, no safety precautions are required.

, Stir together 2 cups (or 500 mL) white vinegar, 0.5 cups (or 125 mL) non-iodized salt, and 1.5 cups (or 375 mL) clear ammonia.Ammonia can be found at some grocery stores and drug stores, but take care not to purchase the weaker ""detergent"" variety.


The more salt you add, the greener the patina will be.

, This solution will turn your copper a darker brown, roughly the color of an American penny. Simply shake baking soda in a bottle of hot water one spoonful at a time, until additional baking soda does not dissolve., Use a spray bottle to apply the patina onto the surface of the copper. Spray more heavily if you want a more even result rather than streaks or patterns.

, This patina may take a few hours to develop, but keeping it in moist air will speed this process up. If the copper is kept in a dry environment, use a plastic bag or plastic sheeting to cover the copper without touching its surface. This will help retain moisture.

, Depending on the environment the copper is kept in, and how often it is handled, the patina may wear off or fade before it sets permanently. If this occurs, reapply as before, either to the entire surface or to the area wear the patina has rubbed off.


The green patina tends to be more powdery and easier to rub off than the brown one."

Gather your materials.,
Learn about what you will be doing.,
Make the medium.,
Attach a wire to both the item you want to plate, and the energy source.

,
Find the object you want to electroplate in (a half of a gallon jug of milk that is rinsed works well) and add about half of a liter of the acid (preferably vinegar) to it.

Disconnect the wires at the battery, and remove your objects you just have electroplated.

,
Let the items sit on a towel or paper towel for about fifteen minutes, then use your fingers to remove the excess metal from the object you plated.

",How to Electroplate Metallic Items," (see things you need.) It is best to also have some tape, paper or regular towels, and a spill proof surface (i.e. a table, floor, or desk, not carpet).;
, Everything in this deals with the idea that an electrical current will carry electrically-conductive particulates along the current in a fluid (air or water) medium. This property is used in many aspects of daily life, such as gold-plated steel wires (used in false necklaces), gold-plated micro circuitry (for protection), and other things. With this in mind, we must now go to properties of electrically-conductive materials. Certain requirements must be met chemically in order for something to be electrically conductive. One such property is that the object must have a less than 8 electrons in the upper energy level. This allows the material to share electrons with surrounding substances, including electrons. This means that water would be non conductive since it has all the electrons necessary to satisfy the energy levels of the two hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atom. WHAT!? you might say, but this is true. The only reason you hear about people being electrocuted through water is because it has impurities in it, which allow electrical currents to pass through it.

, Use vinegar and table salt. Each on its own is electrically conductive, allowing for OH- on part of the acid and H+ with the salt. So why mix the two? Well, this allows certain properties to combine to form a better substance. In this case, the salt allows for conductivity that is amplified in the presence of an acid. How about the electrical source? What's up with the high-amperage low-voltage source? This explanation requires you to have a little bit of knowledge about electricity itself.



Voltage is the relative speed that the current flows through the substance.

Amperage is the overall energy that the current has.
High energy in this is critical to have larger atoms cross the space between the anode, the negative terminal (which is the plated), and the cathode, the positive terminal (the plater). We also want low relative speed in this or else the atoms can't stay in the current and we end up with a stinky mess (which nobody wants that, right?).

,,,,, Plater on the positive terminal, plated on the negative.

, After you do this step, you should see bubbles forming and fizzing out. These are hydrogen and oxygen bubbles

Continue to hold the bent nose pliers in your hand while wrapping the end of the wire around the stem for two more turns using your hand.,
Now that you have completed your wire wrap, cut the excess wire using the wire cutters.",How to Create Jewelry Through Wire Wrapping," Be sure the wire you cut is mostly straight before you move on to the next step. If it isn't you can straighten it by running it between your fingers. Try using a piece of soft leather to protect your skin.;
, Use the round nose pliers to secure the wire while bending one end of the wire over the pliers. (Make this bend as sharp as you can).

, The back of the wire should be flush with the pliers.

, The tail will be hanging down.

, Bend the wire most of the way around the pliers, but not completely. It should not touch the other end of the wire.

, You now should see a loop, resembling a half circle with two straightened ends.

, Be sure the wire loop you have created is tight against the pliers.

, This step allows you to complete the loop. Remove the pliers; you should now have a full circle made of wire.

, Hold as softly as possible while still keeping a grip on your wire to prevent plier marks. Using your finger, wrap the end of the wire around the stem of your loop. This will create the first loop around the stem of the wire; keep it tight against the loop.

, You should now have a completed loop, with three circles around the stem, created from the end of the wire.

, Use caution here: Place your finger over the excess wire while cutting to prevent it from flying away. You may want to use your needle nose pliers to tighten the last tiny bit of wire so you do not have a sharp edge.

Identify which supplies could be housed inside small plastic jars.,
Pick up materials needed to create your space saver.",How to Create a Magnetic Office Supplies Holder1," Generally smaller supplies like paper clips, thumbtacks, rubber bands, staples and binder clips are ideal for this project.
, You’ll need one jar per supply group (i.e. one for paper clips, one for thumbtacks, etc.). Additionally, pick up a magnetic knife or tool holder strip (typically found in the kitchen section of the bath and home store) and charge your electric screwdriver (to help you mount the strip underneath your cabinet). You should also obtain a clamp (or an assistant) to hold the magnetic strip in place during the mounting process.


Consider how many jars you will need, the jar sizes and the amount of space you have when purchasing the magnetic strip. If you have several supplies you may need to find a few spots underneath shelves and pick up more than one magnetic strip.
Purchase a few fender washers if your plastic jars do not have a metal lid. You’ll have to glue one washer to the top of each lid so the jar holds onto the magnetic strip.

Choose an overhead cabinet or shelf that is located near your desk or work area.,
Clamp the magnetic strip underneath the chosen cabinet.,
Drill pilot holes into the shelf (by lining the holes in the magnetic strip up first) and then mount the strip.",How to Create a Magnetic Office Supplies Holder2," The last thing you want to do is constantly have to get up from your desk to retrieve supplies, so look for a shelf or area that is near your work space.

, You may want to just clamp the strip first and see how it looks or how you will use it before adding screws and making it a permanent fixture.

, The magnetic strip package will most likely include screws and instructions on the best way mount it.

Add supplies to the jars (dividing one supply type per jar).,
Glue the washer to the top of the lid if your jars do not have a metal lid.,
Tighten lids on top of jars and stick jars to the magnetic strip.,
Finished.

",How to Create a Magnetic Office Supplies Holder3," Avoid overfilling jars so that you don’t crowd supplies and can easily add the lid. Also, in some cases if supplies become too heavy the jars could drop off the magnetic strip.

, Center the washer on the lid and add glue around the bottom perimeter. Allow the glue to dry for several hours before using.

, Arrange jars along the magnetic strip--ready for use!

Use an old rag or cloth.,
Choose a lemon or vinegar to clean your zinc.,
Choose toothpaste or a baking soda paste.,
Use an old toothbrush.,
Place the item on a cloth or a paper towel.,
Rub the zinc object with your cleaning agent of choice.,
Use a toothbrush to clean small areas.,
Pat dry with a paper towel or cloth.,
Use a polishing cloth.,
Use a metal wadding polish.,
Use a clean cloth.",How to Clean Zinc," To clean your zinc objects, use an old rag or cloth. You do not want to use a new cloth or one you currently use because it could get ruined. If you don’t have a used rag or cloth, you can make one by cutting up on old t-shirt or piece of clothing.;
, If you aren't worried about removing the patina from your zinc objects, use lemon juice or vinegar to clean your objects. If you choose lemon juice, you will need one or two lemons cut in half.


If you choose to use vinegar, use plain, white vinegar.

, If you want to keep the patina intact, use solutions that are less acidic, like toothpaste or baking soda. If you choose to use toothpaste, any kind of toothpaste, i.e., Arm & Hammer, Colgate, or Aquafresh, will work.


If you choose to make a baking soda paste, depending on how large the object is, use a teaspoon (for smaller objects like jewelry) to a tablespoon (for larger objects like tabletops or pots) of baking soda. Then gradually mix in water until a paste forms. Gradually mix in the water by alternating mixing with water. For example, add a few drops of water, mix, and then gradually add more water until a paste forms.

, When cleaning small or hard to reach areas, use a toothbrush that you can discard. This can be an old toothbrush that you do not use or one that you are willing to replace. After using the toothbrush, instead of throwing it away, store it with your cleaning supplies so you can reuse it again.

, Depending on how big the item is, place it on a paper towel or a used cloth or rag. If the item is small, like a piece of jewelry, place it on a paper towel. If the item is larger, like a pot, place it on a larger cloth or rag., Moisten a paper towel or cloth with your cleaning agent of choice. Then, rub your cloth over the entire object. Some areas of the object might be dirtier than others. Focus on these dirtier areas by rubbing more of the cleaning agent on them.If you are using a lemon as your cleaning agent, rub the lemon wedge over your zinc object while holding the rind.

, If there are small areas on the object, like corners or crevices, use a toothbrush dipped in your cleaning solution to clean these areas. The bristles on the toothbrush will be able to reach the smaller areas., Once you have removed all the dirt and spots from the object, clean the object with a paper towel or cloth. Soak a cloth or paper towel in water and rub the surface area. Make sure to rub off all of the cleaning solution. Try not to use too much water. Once the cleaning solution is removed, pat dry immediately.

, Use a specially made cloth for polishing metals such as, zinc, steel, bronze, or silver, to polish your zinc objects. These polishing cloths can be purchased from your local crafts store like Michaels or Walmart.


A polishing cloth is usually used for smaller zinc objects like jewelry and coins.

, Your zinc objects that have small areas of corrosion, uneven patination, or fingerprint marks can be polished using a metal wadding polish. Working in a circular motion, rub the object with the wadding polish. After polishing, let the object patinate naturally in air, and avoid handling it.You can buy a metal wadding polish online, at your local hardware store, or at a crafts store, like Michael’s.
Be sure to check the effect of the metal wadding polish on an unobtrusive area before polishing the whole object.

, Use a clean cloth for outdoor objects with a whitish patina. These objects only need light cleaning and polishing. Rinse these objects with water, gently rub them with a light brush, i.e., a toothbrush, and thoroughly dry with a clean cloth."

Remove dirt and old shoe polish from the shoes.,
Rub the shoes with denatured alcohol.,
Allow the shoes to dry.,
Make a hole in the sole of each shoe.,
String wire through the hole.,
Arrange the shoes.,
Prepare the liquid bronze in a bowl.,
Apply a coat of liquid bronze to each shoe.,
Hang the shoes to dry.,
Apply additional coats as needed.",How to Bronze Shoes," Before bronzing a pair of shoes, you will need to remove any dirt or polish that is on the surface of the shoes. Wet a soft cloth with water. Then take the damp cloth and carefully clean the shoes., Once you have removed as much dirt as possible with the damp rag, rub the shoes with denatured alcohol. This will remove any remaining wax or polish from the shoes. Take a dry, clean cloth and saturate it with alcohol. Then gently rub the entire surface of each shoe., Once you are done rubbing the shoes with denatured alcohol, let them dry completely. Allow the shoes to air dry. Do not attempt to bronze shoes that are still damp from the cleaning process., You will be stringing a piece of wire through each shoe, and using the wire to hang the shoes to dry in between coats of bronze. Try using a box cutter, knife, or drill to make the hole. Make sure you exercise caution while cutting the hole, and avoid accidentally cutting yourself., Begin by creating a wire loop for each shoe. Take some sturdy, yet flexible wire and string it through the hole in the sole of the shoe. Then twist the wire to create a closed loop that is large enough to use for hanging the shoe. Repeat the process for both shoes., Position the shoes so the laces and tongues are arranged precisely how you want them to be for bronzing. Make sure you tie the shoelaces. Finally, adjust the tongue of each shoe so that it is touching both sides of the shoe.Try using a little bit of rubber cement or super glue to lock the laces and/or tongue into the desired position.

, Mix bronze powder with a quick-drying spar varnish according to the package directions in a plastic or glass bowl. Stir the liquid bronze thoroughly to prevent particles from settling in the bottom of the bowl.You can purchase liquid bronze at a hardware store or print supply company.

, Hold the shoe by the wire loop with your non-dominant hand. Then use your dominant hand to apply a thin coat of liquid bronze to each shoe with a camel hair brush. Start on the top of each shoe and work your way down the sides toward the sole. Make sure you paint all of the shoe’s surface area, including any part of the shoe’s inside that is visible., After applying liquid bronze to the shoes, allow them to dry. Hold the shoe by the wire loop you inserted, and then hang the wire loop on a hook or nail. You should let them dry for at least ten minutes, or longer, in between coats., Once the shoes dry from the initial coat of liquid bronze, look to see if there are dull spots on the shoes. This is an indication that the bronze has soaked through the shoes and you will need to apply at least one more coat of bronze.

You will likely need to apply several coats of liquid bronze to each shoe until both shoes are shiny and completely covered in bronze.

Choose your project.,
Choose what material you want to use.,
Choose the size of wire you want to use for your project.",How to Choose Wire for Jewelry," Different jewelry projects require different wire, so choose wire anew each time you begin a new type of wire jewelry creation.;
, Wire comes in aluminum, iron, copper wire, craft, colored, French wire, gold-filled, memory wire, sterling silver wire, silver plated and tiger tail. The price largely depends upon the material used to make the wire.

Tiger tail wire is a very common wire in jewelry making. It is a braided stainless steel wire that is coated in nylon. It is very strong and comes in a number of colors. It cannot be used for wire wrapping, but it can be used to give the look of an ""invisible"" setting, where the beads look like they are floating.






Other standard, inexpensive choices for skilled jewelry making are copper, aluminum and niobium. Copper wire comes in gold and silver colors and it is coated with enamel. Color coated aluminum wire comes in many colors and gauges and often has the color inside the wire, so you don't have to be as careful when working with tools. Niobium is light, comes in many colors and is not delicate.






French wire is a coiled wire that is great for accenting jewelry. It comes in copper, gold-plated, silver-plated, sterling silver and vermeil. The smaller the coil, the more precious the metal, and the more expensive.






Gold filled wire has 100 times more gold in it than gold-plated wire. It comes in dead soft, half-hard and full-hard, which is a scale from very delicate to extremely tough. This is an expensive wire, so it should probably be saved for special projects.






Memory wire is made from carbon steel or stainless steel. It is great for bangles or other loops because it returns to the loop it was made into in the factory. It cannot be used for any projects that require wrapping.






Sterling silver also comes in the strength scale of dead soft, half-hard and full-hard,






Gold and silver-plated wires are great for creating a fancy look, but they can be easily ruined by tools.







,

Use 30-gauge or 28-gauge (0.25 to 0.32 mm) wire for delicate jewelry making. It is great for wire weaving, rings, bead work and making small chains. Use fine jewelry making tools for this gauge.






Use 26-gauge (0.40 mm) to wrap beads and make smaller chain loops. This is the beginning of the finer gauges of wire. Also use fine tools with this gauge.






Use 24-gauge (0.51 mm) wire for most beading projects. The gauge fits through most beads but isn't too bulky. It has a tendency to get kinks so you may need to buy a wire-straightening tool.






Use 22-gauge (0.64 mm) wire for stone settings, earrings and pendants. It is a medium-gauge wire, which is commonly found in a number of materials and colors.






Use 20 to 18-gauge (0.81 to 1 mm) wire for average clasps, jump rings and pins. This medium gauge wire can also be used for thicker chains or for stringing glass beads.






Use 16 to 14-gauge (1.3 to 1.6 mm) wire, best used for large, heavy jewelry construction. If you use heavy beads or you are experimenting, this thick wire will make a statement. You can also use it for napkin rings or lampshade forms.

Give your chest a lock.,
Add personal touches for flair.,
Experiment with different boxes.,
Make a pirate map.,
Fill your chest with gold coins.,
Add realistic looking precious stones.,
Include other pirate items.",How to Make a Pirate Treasure Chest," All pirate craftsmen know the value of keeping a ship (and your home) ship-shape! You'll be painting a shoe box black to make it look like a more realistic treasure chest, so you might want to lay down some newspaper, a plastic sheet, or a disposable table cloth to prevent a mess that'll make you want to jump ship!;
, This will make your treasure chest that looks wooden, but you could also paint it black for a more sinister appearance. Now that your workshop is in order, take a paintbrush and your paint and cover all surfaces, inside and out, of your shoe box. Then allow your shoe box time to dry.Depending on your purposes, you might find it easier to apply a quick layer of spray paint to the outside and inside of your shoe box. However, keep in mind that some spray paint leaves behind a scent that might be unpleasant if you plan on carrying your chest around.
Some spray paints can be rather harsh. If you plan on using spray paint, have another shoe box on hand in case you notice your paint causes your box to fall apart.

, You'll have some time to kill while your box dries, and a true pirate doesn't wait for time or tide! While waiting, take a pencil, paper, and scissors, and use these to draw and cut out a skull and crossbones. Then, using your scissors, cut out two long strips of your embossing foil and plenty of small circles. Your metal strips will vary in size depending on the size of your shoe box, but you might want to consider making these 1"" (2.5 cm) thick and your circles about ½"" (1.27 cm) to give each a more prominent appearance.You'll glue the strips of embossing foil around your treasure chest make it look like bands of metal are going around it. The small circles will be used around the edges to give the appearance of metal studs.
You may want to use a thicker kind of paper, like card stock, for your skull and crossbones. Glue can bleed through or discolor thinner paper, which will make your treasure chest look less realistic., Now that the paint on your treasure chest is dry, you can add your designs. Use your glue to attach your skull and crossbones to the top of the lid or wherever you think best. Then you can glue your strips of embossing foil to either side of your skull and crossbones. Last but not least come your foil circles. Line the outside edges of your chest with these to make it look like metal studs are holding it together., With a piece of paper and some markers, you can draw a simple keyhole on a piece of paper and then glue that to your chest. In some cases, it might be easier to take your drawing tools and draw a lock right on your chest.


You could also use a real lock to give your chest some three dimensional pop. Take a hole punch or some other tool to make a hole in the lip of the top of your box where it closes, then attach your lock.
If you plan on using a real lock, you'll probably want to stick with smaller varieties. Large, heavy locks might cause your box to warp or could end up tearing the cardboard.
You can put the keys to a real lock on a large key ring and then make these part of your pirate costume. Then attach your keys to a part of your costume, like a belt loop., If you are a fashionable pirate, you might want all landlubbers to know at a glance that your treasure chest is special. Rhinestones, glitter, or sequins fastened to your chest with glue can make even the outside of your chest appear like a work of art!


You may find, especially for larger accents like rhinestones and fake gems, that hot glue works best for fastening these to your chest. You don't want to lose rhinestones while showing off your treasure chest to your friends., You never know what kind of box will serve you best as a treasure chest. You might even be able to create a more realistic looking chest with a few modifications! For example, you might be able to cut arching/rounded outer pieces for your box which you can then put together with glue or tape.


Thinner cardboard, like the kind used in cereal boxes, is ideal for a chest with a rounded top. Stiff or thick cardboard might not bend easily, but you can create a bowed shape for the top of your chest with thin cardboard., Pirates are notorious for having mysterious maps that lead the way to buried treasure. X marks the spot! First, take your paper and draw a simple map. You may want to include local features or even a dotted line marking the path one should take to arrive at the hiding spot marked with an X. When you're finished drawing, distress your paper so that it looks old and weathered.

, Chocolate doubloons covered in gold foil work well, and these can be given out to your friends, too! This can be a good way of breaking the ice if you're a shy pirate. You might even add some variety to your horde of coins with some silver foiled chocolate doubloons.If you worry your appetite for chocolate coins will diminish your treasure stash before your pirate event is through, you can make or buy some inedible coins to ensure you have loot that lasts. Cut out circles from card stock and paint them gold and silver, or use shiny plastic coins from the dollar store.

, Paste jewelry from the dollar store is an affordable way of making you look like a profitable pirate.What's more, you can make up creative stories about the gems and jewels found in your chest. For example, you might say...


""Aye, me mateys, I took these gems from the crown of queen Elizabeth herself. She sent her commandant with them to hide away on a desert isle, but now they're mine!""

, To give your pirate chest even more character, you can add other odds and ends. Aquarium accessories, like a miniature skull and crossbones, or doll accessories, like a tiny crown, can make your chest look bountiful. The seas are open and the skies are fair -- let the winds of your imagination help you stock your chest!


Play jewelry, like rings and necklaces, can also give the impression that your career as a pirate has been successful. Pearls and sea themed items are likely items a pirate would have in his chest.
Unwanted silverware, like an old fashioned goblet, would fit right in with your treasure. You might even be able to find one of these at an affordable cost at a flea market or dollar store.
Be careful you don't load your treasure chest up with too many heavy items! Remember that your pirate chest is only made of cardboard and if it breaks, your loot will be lost on the high seas."

Treat any mildew.,
Remove any rust.,
Clean the metal object with mineral spirits.,
Apply a coat of primer.,
Apply an even coat of paint.,
Apply a second coat of paint.",How to Color Metal1," Start by soaking the metal in bleach to kill the mildew and remove discoloration. Make a solution of water and bleach in a 3:1 ratio. Let the metal soak in the solution for approximately 20 minutes. Rinse your metal with plain water after you've finished. If the metal is new or free from any mildew, you can proceed without soaking the object in bleach., Rough up the surface with a wire brush. You can also use an electric sander with coarse sandpaper, a power drill, or a rotary tool to remove all debris. Choose a grit between 36 and 100 to remove rust and smooth flaws.Wear eye protection and a dust mask to avoid getting metal fragments in your eyes or lungs. Use a pair of work gloves to avoid injuries.
For large objects, you can remove rust, debris, and old paint with a liquid commercial rust remover.

, Mineral spirits are a type of turpentine-free paint thinner. Wipe the metal down with a rag dampened with mineral spirits. Remove any dust and debris that may be left behind from sanding. Make sure the surface is completely clean and dry so that the primer will stick to the object.


Keep in mind that mineral spirits will strip any existing fresh paint.
Also remember that mineral spirits will only strip away paint that is still fresh. If you want to remove existing paint that won't come off with mineral spirits, try cleaning your metal with turpentine instead., Spray the primer on the surface in a smooth, even layer. You should coat the metal with primer as soon as the surface has been prepared to avoid dirt or rust accumulating on the surface again.Choose a primer specifically recommended for the type of metal you are painting.


Choose a spray primer in the same color as the finish when possible.
Try to purchase a primer in the same brand as the paint you will buy, as colors are more likely to be better matched and chemically compatible.
Purchase primer that is rust resistant.
Priming with a paint brush is very difficult to do without leaving streaks. Use a spray primer for best results.
Read the directions on the product to determine the necessary time for the primer to dry.

, Be sure to shake the can first. Hold down the nozzle and coat the desired areas. Use masking tape or painter's tape to cover any areas you want to avoid painting. Hold the can approximately a foot away from the object. Start spraying off to the side of the object and move the can with a continuous motion across the metal object without pausing. Allow paint to dry.


Control your environment. If you are painting a smaller object, you can place it in a cardboard box and apply your paint.
If you pause while spraying, you may notice a splotch appear. Use a cloth to wipe away the wet paint immediately before it can dry. Allow the remaining paint to dry before starting again.
Galvanized metals have a thin layer of zinc chromate. The biggest reason for paint chipping or not adhering to galvanized metal is that the paint bonds to the zinc coating, or the residue collected on the surface, rather than the metal itself.If you have a piece of galvanized metal, look for a paint that doesn't contain any alkyds,as these oil-based binders can react with the zinc coating.

, Once the first coat of paint has dried, you will want to apply a second coat of paint to the surface. Adding a second coat of paint will increase the life of your paint job. Allow the paint to dry.


To get the best results, always wait 24 hours between applying coats of paint."

Understand the anodizing process.,
Gather your materials.,
Prepare a neutralizing solution.,
Prepare the metal.,
Prepare the sulfuric acid solution.,
Set up the power source with positive and negative poles.,
Remove the metal piece and rinse thoroughly with water.,
Prepare the dye.,
Place the metal object into dye bath for up to 20 minutes.,
Boil the object in water for 30 minutes to seal the color.,
Allow the object to cool.,
Clean all tools and containers with baking soda neutralizing solution.",How to Color Metal2," Anodizing converts the surface of a metal object into its oxide form. Anodized aluminum oxide is incredibly tough and resistant to corrosion. It is also porous compared to unoxidized aluminum, allowing it to absorb a variety of metal dyes.


The conversion process uses an electric current and a strong acid bath. The metal being anodized is connected to a circuit and placed in the acid bath where it acts as an anode (positive electrode). Negative hydroxide ions within the bath are attracted to the positive anode where they react with aluminum to form aluminum oxide.A scrap of aluminum is also placed in the bath, connected to the other wire. This serves as the cathode (negative electrode), completing the circuit.
Aluminum is the typical metal of choice for this method, but other non-ferrous (non-iron) metals like magnesium and titanium can also be anodized., You will want to start by finding a space that you can work without causing any potential damage. You can gather these items individually, or you can purchase a commercial anodizing kit that should include everything you need.


Select your metal. Any aluminum or aluminum alloy can be anodized. Other types of metal, like steel, won't work.
You will need three plastic tubs. Each tub should be large enough to hold your metal object. One will be used for the cleaning process, one for the acid, and one for the dye bath. Large, plastic paint buckets will work well for most jobs.
Get a plastic jug to hold your neutralizing solution.
For reagents, you will need sulfuric acid, baking soda, lye, metal fiber dye, and distilled water.
Find an adequate power source. You will want a power supply that is capable of producing a consistent flow of electricity up to a minimum of 20 volts. A car battery is ideal.
Get two power cables to connect the car battery to the acid solution. They should be strong enough to use to grip and lift the metal object in and out of the solutions.
You will also want a spare piece of aluminum to act as the cathode in the solution.
Have a large pot and stove to boil the metal object.
Always wear a pair of large rubber gloves. Since you are handling strong chemicals you will need to handle your materials safely to avoid contact with your skin at all times.

, The neutralizing solution uses a baking soda base as an alkaline to neutralize the pH of the sulfuric acid. You should keep a neutralizing solution handy to neutralize sulfuric acid in an emergency and to clean equipment. If your skin should come in contact with the acid, always use the solution to neutralize the burn instead of making it worse with water.


Add 2 cups (0.83 pt.) of baking soda to 1 gallon (3.79L) of distilled water.

, You can use any piece of aluminum alloy to anodize using this process. Put on a pair of rubber gloves before cleaning. Anything, even fingerprints, left on the surface can impact your results.


Clean the parts with water and dishwashing detergent.
Immerse the parts in a bath of water and lye. Add 3 tablespoons of lye for each gallon of water. Using your rubber gloves, lower the metal object into the solution for about 3 minutes.Rinse the object in distilled water. If the water does not bead, the aluminum is clean.

, Add sulfuric acid to distilled water in a plastic container at a ratio of 5 parts water to 1 part acid.Do not use a container that is breakable like glass.
Always add acid to water so the solution doesn't fizz. Adding water to acid can cause it to splash up out of the container.

, With the power supply off, connect one cable to the positive output and the other cable to the negative.


Connect the other end of the negative cable to the metal object and submerge it in a container of sulfuric acid solution.
Connect the other end of the positive cable to a scrap piece of aluminum and submerge it into solution without touching the metal object.
Turn on the power. The voltage you use will depend on the surface area of the metal you are using. Check the power supply. Start with a low voltage of about 2 amps, then increase the voltage up to 10-12 amps after a few minutes.
Anodize aluminum for 60 minutes. Negatively charged aluminum will attract positively charged sulfuric acid. You will notice a lot of bubbles around the piece of scrap metal, but very little bubbling around the metal you are anodizing.

, Be careful not to let any acid drip off the piece. You may want to the hold the container containing your neutralizing solution beneath the metal as you move it to the sink. Hold the metal beneath the water for several minutes while rotating to clean each side thoroughly.

, Prepare a solution of fiber dye and distilled water in portions to reach the color you want in a separate container. Follow any manufacturer instructions for the particular dye you have purchased.

, Depending on the desired color, you may only need to leave the metal in the bath for a minute or two. You can also gently heat the dye bath to help speed up the process. At first, you may have difficulty getting the precise color, so plan on trying out the process on a few practice pieces made of the same material first.


The dye can be reused several times, so if you want you can store the dye in a plastic container after you've finished this dyeing session.

, Heat the water in a pot. Then immerse the object into the boiling water. The process will seal the dyes, but it will also cause them to fade slightly.This is another reason why it's a good idea to do at least one test piece first.

, Remove the object from the hot water. Set it on a towel to cool for several minutes. Once the object is completely cool, the metal will be at its permanent new color.

, Rinse everything and be sure that none of the acid remains on anything that was in contact with it throughout the process.

Create a patina mixture.,
Fill a container with your patina mixture.,
Soak the piece in the mixture.,
Remove the metal.,
Let the metal dry completely.,
Coat the metal with a varnish.",How to Color Metal3," There are many different recipes to create different patinas. Patinas change the color by creating a chemical reaction with the metal to create a colored film over the surface. You can use a patina on any copper or bronze metal to give the surface an aged color and appearance similar to the green coloring of the Statue of Liberty. Depending on the material, you can search for a patina recipe to create the color you are looking for or purchase one over the counter.


For a green verdigris patina, add three parts apple cider vinegar to one part salt.
For a black patina, add sulfur of liver (sulfurated potash) to warm water.Some patina recipes will require the metal to be heated before applying the patina, so you may need to purchase a torch to heat the metal.

, You can use a regular paint bucket for cold mixtures, but you may want to use a large metal pot if the patina mixture needs to be heated. The bucket should be large enough to immerse your object in the solution. Patina mixtures may need to be heated or cooled, so use a container that will work for the temperature of your recipe.


Some chemicals can give off hazardous fumes. Always use a workspace that is well-ventilated.
If you are coloring an object that is too large to put in a container, you can put a patina solution into a spray bottle and spray it all over the metal. You can also wet a rag with the solution and rub it on the metal, or use a paint brush to apply it to the surface. Just be sure to wear rubber gloves when using harsh chemicals to avoid contact.

, Put on a pair of rubber gloves and place the metal object in the container filled with a patina mixture. Depending on your patina recipe, you may need to let the piece sit for anywhere from a few minutes up to several hours. Set a timer and wait.

, Check on your piece after the allotted time. If you want a more intense color, let the metal soak longer. Put on a pair of rubber gloves and remove the metal once your metal has taken on its desired appearance.

, The patina will continue to change while the piece dries, so be patient. If you want to color the piece further, place it back into the mixture and repeat the process.

, Use a spray-on acrylic clear coat varnish to help protect the surface and coloration.

Clean the metal.,
Turn on a heat source.,
Expose the metal to the flame.,
Allow the metal to cool.,
Coat the metal with a varnish or wax.",How to Color Metal4," Remove all dust, dirt and fingerprints from the metal before beginning. Wash the metal with soap and water. Let the metal soak in a degreaser. Place it on a clean surface to dry.


Do not handle the metal with your hands after cleaning. Even the grease from your fingers can impact the formation of the colors.
Heat adds color to metals in a fairly unpredictable way that varies based on temperature, humidity, time, and the composition of the metal., You can use this method on any metals containing copper or iron, such as steel. A smaller, focused flame, such as a Bunsen burner or torch, will provide a more dramatic variation of colors. An open flame will create more of a subtle variation. Depending on the temperature that the metal reaches you can create a color from pale yellow to blue.Use some tongs or a wrench or similar tool to grip the metal to avoid contacting the heated metal after exposing it to the flame.
If you have an oven you can also heat the metal that way to provide a more even coloration.

, There is not much you can do to control the pattern or formation of the coloration. You can only somewhat control the color by how long you heat the metal. You will notice that the piece doesn't remain the same color as it cools from the heat. For example, reds may cool to bluish purples.


Be sure to heat metal only in a well-ventilated area.
Use caution not to burn yourself. Wear some work gloves.
If your flame is fine and your metal piece large enough, you can trace patterns onto your metal.

, Turn off the torch or heat source. Set the metal down somewhere safe, like a concrete floor, to cool. You may want to have a bucket of cold water on hand to dip the hot metal in and cool it quickly.

, If you are working a piece of jewelry or art, you may want to apply a sealant to protect and give the metal a glossy finish. After the metal cools, apply a coat of beeswax or an acrylic clear coat to protect the colors and the surface.Allow the finish to dry.

Make a paperclip stand for your snitch.,
Paint your snitch.,
Make the outer shell of the snitch.,
Make wings.,
Attach everything together.",How to Make a Golden Snitch1," First, take a ping pong ball, and make a small hole. This can be done with anything sharp and small. Unfold the large paper clip and form it to make an appropriate stand. Stick the paper clip into the hole in the ball., Put down some newspaper beneath the ping-pong ball so that the paint doesn't stain your workstation. Use a metallic gold spray paint cover your ball with at least two coats. Let it dry., Take the other ping pong ball, and cut it in half, using either an exacto knife, a kitchen knife, or scissors. Draw a swirl pattern on each half of the ball that mirror each other. With a small pair of scissors, carefully cut out the swirl patterns. Paint the swirl patterns and the ping-pong halves, and let them dry. Use plain white craft glue to stick the cut-out swirls back to the ping-pong halves, somewhere where the cut-outs don't overlap with the holes in the ping-pong halves., Cut out the plain paper into two identical wing shapes. The easiest way to do this is to fold the paper in half and cut both wings out at once.


You can do the wings as you like, but an idea is to cut out 2 appropriately-sizes half circles, and then cut ""flaps"" out of the straight sides, to make feathers., Glue the cut-out half-ping pong balls to the actual ball on the stand. Put some glue on the end of each wing, and tuck it in the swirls. Hold it together for a few seconds so that they stays on. Let the glue dry before you remove your finished snitch from its stand."

, As an alternative to using paint, you can use glitter or sequins. If you want to use glitter to decorate your snitch, just spray the ball with adhesive, and sprinkle glitter over it. Brush off excess glitter and reapply until you are happy with the result. If you want to use gold sequins, stick small pins into the sequins, and then stick them into the styrofoam ball, until the ball is evenly covered with sequins., Take two gold, yellow, or white feathers, coat the ends with glue, and stick onto the ball.


Make sure the wings are perfectly opposite one another on the ball.
If the stems of the feathers are strong enough, they can be stuck directly into the styrofoam, without the need for glue."

Prepare the wings.,
Finish the wings.,
Attach the wings.",How to Make a Golden Snitch3," On a plain sheet of paper, draw the wing shape you want for your snitch. A simpler shape will make the wire easier to form. Form two lengths of wire into the shape of the wings.


Cut about four inches of wire for each wing using wire cutters.
Bend the wire using wire cutters into the shape you've drawn for your wings.
Twist the two ends of the wire together into a tight coil.

, Fold the paper with the wing shape drawn on it in half so that you can cut out two identical copies of the wings. Cut the wings out. Using plain craft glue, coat the length of the wire wings. Place the paper wings on the wire, and let dry. Spray adhesive on each side of the wings and sprinkle glitter on them. Shake off the excess glitter.


Alternatively, you can use tissue paper. Push a sheet of tissue paper onto the glue-coated wire, and then cut it down to size.

, Apply a liberal amount of super glue to each wing coil. Hold the coils onto the ball for thirty seconds, or until the connection is stable.


Make sure the wings are on opposite sides of the ball.
If your ornament is made of glass and not plastic, you might need to use something other than super glue, like fabric glue.

Add several buildings inside the courtyard.,
Add vegetation.,
Add people and animals.,
Add minor building features.,
Add extra defensive features.",How to Make a Motte and Bailey Castle1," Historically, motte and bailey castles were usually either built next to a small hill or the hill was created artificially.For our model, we'll use the ""artificial"" approach. Start by grabbing a flat, square piece of material at least a foot or so on each side. Ideally, this material should be something that glue will stick to. It should also be green to replicate the grassy European countryside. Ideas include:


Green construction paper
Butcher paper painted or drawn green
Green felt
Green cloth
Styrofoam squares (e.g., cooler lid) painted or drawn green
Plywood painted green;
, The construction plans for motte and bailey castles almost always always involved two large circles — one for the outer courtyard wall and one for the raised mound that the keep is built on. The two circles should overlap slightly in the middle as if you were drawing a snowman. The circle for the mound should be smaller than the one for the courtyard.


A good way to do this is to find two bowls of different sizes, lay them face-down on your base one at a time, and trace a circle around each with a pencil or marker. If you can, use a paper bowl for your smaller circle so that you can use it for the motte itself as well.
If you can, try to leave at least an inch or so around the edges of your circles so that you have room to add details outside the wall later.

, Take the bowl that you used to trace your motte (the smaller one) and secure it inside the circle you traced to create your motte.


If you don't have a bowl handy to use for your motte, you can use any round or cone-shaped object that's the right size. Some ideas include:
Traffic/safety cones (with top two-thirds cut off)
Paper or plastic cups (with top one-third cut off)
Rounded styrofoam pieces.
Flower pots

Papier Mâché (you'll need to form it into a hill-like shape and allow it to dry before proceeding)

, Historically, mottes were made from built-up dirt that grass and plants would eventually grow on over time. Thus, if you're shooting for a realistic-looking castle, you'll probably want to make your motte one of these colors. There are several things you may want to use for this — pick the one that's most convenient for you (keeping in mind that paint, ink, etc. is permanent):


Paint
Markers
Painted newspaper
Construction paper
Cellophane
Felt/fabric

, Most motte and bailey castles had a circular wall made from sturdy tree trunks called a palisade. The easiest way to replicate this is to stick together rows of small wooden sticks (like popsicle sticks, coffee stirrers, or even dry twigs from outdoors). Tape or glue each piece of the wall in place carefully. When finished, the wall should extend around the edge of the large circle, up the sides of the motte, and around the back of the flat upper part of the motte so that no invaders can get in easily.


Popsicle sticks can usually be bought in bulk at craft stores for quite cheap. The best thing about using actual wood pieces like popsicle sticks is that you don't need to color them — they already look like wood. If you want to go the extra mile, you can stain your wood to give it a more realistic feel.
Another good detail to add for realism is to put a single horizontal ring of sticks stretching around the entire inside portion of the wall. Real-life palisade walls were often reinforced this way. Here is a good picture of this., One of the distinguishing features of the motte and bailey castle is the keep — the small defensive structure (sort of like a mini-castle) at the top of the motte that served as the stronghold for defenders. In real life, the keep could be made out of wood or stone, so there are many different ways you can make your model keep. Below are just a few ideas:


Models
Building toys (i.e., Legos, etc.)
Small cardboard boxes
Cardboard milk cartons
Popsicle sticks (just like the wall)
Whichever method you choose, it's a good idea to add realism by drawing or cutting small, thin windows in the sides of the keep. You can also put a square zig-zag pattern at the top of the keep to give it a ""castle"" look.

, The keep wasn't usually the only building in a motte and bailey fortification. Inside the lower bailey, there were almost always buildings to support the soldiers who defended the castle — barracks for them to live in, stables for their horses, storehouses where they kept their gear, places for them to eat, and so on.You can use any of the building methods recommended above for the keep to make these buildings, but if you're going for realism, keep the following points in mind:


These buildings typically weren't as sturdy as the keep, since they weren't where the soldiers would be during an invasion. Thus, they were usually made from wood or a wood-and-plaster construction.
These buildings usually used a simple square construction with pointed roofs — again, they were meant to be functional, not fancy.
One good way to imitate this is to glue popsicle sticks together to make a box, then use white paper for the walls.

, Now that you have the basics of your motte and bailey model in place, it's up to you to truly make your castle unique! There's no ""right way"" to do this, but we've recommended some things that you may want to add (and given ideas for how to add them in parentheses.) One thing that's easy to add to your castle is plant life — see below for ideas:


Bushes (painted or dyed cotton balls, moss, lichen, etc.)
Trees (toys/models, painted cotton swabs, leafy twigs, etc.)
Creeping vines on walls and buildings (painted directly on, green string, plant stems, etc.)
Gardens (brown paint for dirt; small green paper shapes for crops)

, Living things truly make your motte and bailey come to life. The easiest way to add people and animals to your castle is to use small toys (like Lego figurines, Warhammer models, army men, etc.).


Defending soldiers — see here for a guide to Norman weapons and gear.Invaders — see here for a guide to Viking warfare (Vikings were common invaders at the time of motte and bailey castles.)Horses/livestock — war horses, mules, cattle, pigs, chickens and so on are all appropriate.
A lord or lady of the castle and their family — see here for a guide to medieval nobles' clothing (for reference, motte and bailey castles were common in the 1000s and 1100s.)

, Give your structures extra flavor with these aesthetic touches:


Flags/banners (dowel or toothpick for pole, fabric strip for flag — Norman flags were often red with a yellow cross or lion.)Wells (small circle of popsicle stick tips, blue paint for water)
Chimneys (small square of popsicle sticks)
Plaster walls (white paint or paper for walls with crisscrossing brown support beams made from popsicle sticks)
Paths leading to buildings/keep (paint)

, Make your castle strike terror into the heart of any invader with these fearsome defensive fortifications:


A walled-in path or staircase leading up the hill to the keep (popsicle sticks for the walls, paint for the path)
Small defensive posts around the walls
Defensive ditches (the easiest way to make these is to put the entire model on top of a square piece of styrofoam, then cut a narrow indentation in a circle around the outside of the bailey and at the bottom of the motte. Paint the indented portion brown (or blue if you want a moat.)
Sharpened stakes around the outer ditches (toothpicks)
Gate and drawbridge at the front of the courtyard (popsicle stick, strings for chains)

Alternatively, make the hill from green jello.,
Place the hill on a serving platter.,

Use a cupcake for the keep.,
Make a keep from a ""cake"" ice cream cone.,
Make a stone keep from sugar cubes.,
Make a palisade wall from wafer cookies.,
Add gingerbread/graham cracker buildings inside the walls.,
Use candy for plants and vegetation.,
Add inedible pieces with caution.",How to Make a Motte and Bailey Castle2," To start making your edible motte and bailey, you'll need to find something roughly mound-shaped and edible for your cake. There's no ""right"" food to use, but one easy and delicious way to do this is to bake a small cake in the shape of a half-sphere. This isn't difficult even if you don't have a half-sphere baking mold, as you can use most metal bowls for this purpose. One good guide to making a half-sphere cake is available here.If you're going for realism, you may want to bake a chocolate cake to replicate the brown color of dirt. However, your hill will eventually be covered with frosting, so it doesn't matter much which type of cake you choose.
Make sure to butter and flower the inside of the bowl or mold you use. This will make it easier to remove the finished product once it cools — the last thing you want is a hill with a big chunk taken out of it.

, Another easy way to make your hill is to simply make a jello mold in a round-sided bowl. Carefully turn the bowl upside-down once the jello has completely set to form the hill. If you're having a hard time getting the jello out, it can help to tap the top of the bowl while it's upside-down.


To learn how to make jello, consult the instructions on the back of the packet or read our jello article.

, To make room for the bailey (the lower courtyard portion of the castle), put the hill you've just created at one end of a large, clean serving platter. Once again, there's no ""right"" platter to use — if you happen to have a flat, rectangular platter that's suitable, feel free to use it. However, if you don't, you can improvise one from one of the following materials:


Cardboard
Plastic lunch/dinner tray
Metal baking sheet
Whatever you're using, it's a good idea to lay down a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper on top of your platter to keep your edible ingredients clean.

, Now that you have a hill and a surface to work on, you'll want create a grassy landscape for your castle. One easy way to do this is to simply cover the hill and the area around it with green frosting. You can buy frosting from the store or make your own (simply add green food coloring to a white frosting recipe.) You may also want to use brown frosting for dirt paths, ditches, and so on.


See our frosting article for several different frosting recipes that can work well for this project. Fondant is a little harder to make and has a different taste than frosting, but it can still work well. See our fondant article for recipes.
If you're working with a jello hill, you may want to simply make a flat, shallow mold of the same green jello you used for your hill instead and transfer your hill to this to make your landscape — the alternative, using frosting on jello, is a little gross.

, The most important structure in a motte and bailey is the keep (the mini-castle at the top of the hill.) An easy way to represent the keep is to put a cupcake (storebought or homemade) on top of your edible ""hill."" You can either leave the cupcake as-is or decorate it to make it look a little more like an actual keep — it's up to you.


One easy way to make the cupcake ""keep"" a little more realistic is to leave the muffin wrapper on the bottom, then carefully paint it with brown or grey frosting to give it a ""wood"" or ""stone"" finish.

, Another way to make a keep is to stick an ice cream cone on top of the hill. For this method, you'll specifically want a cake-style cone — these are the short, round ones, not the long, pointed ones made from a wrapped waffle. If you like, you can frost the outside with brown or grey frosting or, alternatively, decorate it with edible markers.

, You can also build a keep by sticking sugar cubes together. This will give the cube a boxy appearance — perfect for stone keeps. Once again, frosting or edible markers can be used to decorate the outside.


Getting sugar cubes to stick together can be a little tricky. One good trick is to use a substance called sugar glue which is made from confectioner's sugar and egg whites or meringue powder — a good recipe is available here., To make the wall, stick wafer cookies in a large circular pattern extending outward from the hill, then up the sides of the hill and around the back of the keep. To keep the cookies in place, either plant them firmly in the frosting/fondant landscape, use toothpicks, or stick them down with the sugar glue mentioned above. Any flavor of cookie will do, but if you're going for a realistic wooden wall, chocolate cookies are often preferable for their brown color.


Other good options include rolled wafers (e.g., pirouettes, piroulines, etc.), ladyfingers, or wafer candies like Kit Kats.

, There are many different ways to make edible versions of the barracks, armories, and other structures in the lower bailey courtyard. For example, mini gingerbread houses look great. If you don't want to go to the trouble of making gingerbread, you can use graham crackers in more or less the same way.


See our gingerbread house article and our graham cracker house article on this subject for more information.

, Adding edible trees and bushes is easy if you have the right sorts of candy handy. For trees, you can use small lollipops (preferably green ones), painting each one's stick with brown frosting or edible marker if desired. In addition, tufts of green cotton candy make great bushes.


Other types of candy can make creative additions as well. For example, scattered Nerd candies or rock candy fragments can serve as rocks or pebbles.

, Certain parts of the model castle described in the section above, like tiny soldiers, weapons, animals, and so on, are tricky to make from edible ingredients. If you want to populate your castle with these sorts of things, you can certainly consider using inedible pieces (e.g., Lego figures, etc.) However, if you plan on eating your castle, make sure that these pieces are clearly visible so that they aren't accidentally swallowed. It's also a good idea to have a bowl or another receptacle handy so that people eating the castle can put the pieces there.


If you plan on serving your edible castle somewhere that young children are likely to be, do not include any non-edible pieces.

Peel off putty type sealers.,

Pull out rubber mold plugs.,
Wait until the mold cools completely.,
Tap on the bottom of the mold.,
Tug the wick lightly.,
Refrigerate the mold.,
Put the mold in the freezer for five minutes.,
Use boiling water to remove completely stuck candles.",How to Remove a Candle from a Mold," Putty sealers typically get molded around the base of the mold to seal the hole. They’re usually pressed into a disk and stuck to the bottom of the mold. Removing this kind of sealer is as simple as peeling it off, much like sticky tack., Magnetic mold sealers are simple metal sheets that are magnetically charged. They snap onto the bottom of a mold to prevent wax from leaking out. Removing these is as simple as pulling them off.

If you’re using plastic or aluminium molds, you’re likely not using a magnetic mold sealer., Rubber mold plugs are shaped somewhat like a spinning top; they have a large base and a tapered tip. Usually they just squeeze into the hole at the bottom of a candle mold. That means removing them is as simple as grabbing the base and pulling them out.

With rubber molds, the wick may be wrapped around a wick bar at the bottom of the mold. If so, you’ll need to unwrap the wick before you can remove the candle., If you try to remove the candle before the wax has set completely, the surface of the candle might tear and crumble. Leave the mold on a flat surface that won’t be damaged while the mold is still warm. It may take some time for the mold to cool; be patient., Flip the mold upside down, so the opening faces downwards. Use your fingers to lightly tap on the bottom of the mold, which will shake the candle loose. Tap slowly and progressively, or the candle might slip out too quickly.

Don’t bang the mold against a counter or other hard surface, since this could damage the candle., If tapping on the mold isn’t enough to dislodge the candle, you can gently tug on the couple of inches of wick poking out the top of the candle. Don’t use too much strength when pulling on the wick; you might break the string or cause it to slip out of the candle., Placing the mold in the refrigerator will speed up the cooling process, helping the wax set and separate from the mold. Flip the mold every 30 minutes; this will make sure the mold and wax cool evenly. Check the mold periodically; you’ll want to remove it from the fridge as soon as it’s cold to the touch.

Make sure you wait until the mold has cooled to room temperature before placing it in the fridge. If the temperature change is too drastic, the candle could crack., If the candle’s especially difficult to dislodge, you can try putting the mold in the freezer. Take it out after five minutes and try to remove the candle. If it still won’t budge, leave it in the freezer for an additional five minutes. You don’t want to leave the mold in any longer than 10 minutes, since this will definitely cause the candle to crack., Finally, if you’ve tried all of the above and can’t remove the candle, you might have to cut your losses. Place the mold in a metal dish filled with boiling water and wait for the candle to soften. After a few minutes, you should be able to retrieve the candle; use a pair of tongs or a wooden spoon to avoid burning yourself.

This process won’t save your candle, but you can at least melt down the wax for use in your next attempt."

Thread string through the straw pieces in each finger.,
Test your strings!",How to Make a Fake Hand1," Use a paper plate or thick paper that is sturdy enough to support the materials you will be adding. A paper plate works best because they are designed to hold food and be supportive, like a hand! , Place the paper plate on a flat surface, facing up as if you were about to put some food on it. Put your hand in the center of the plate, palm facing down and fingers spread out. Trace your whole hand with a pencil.


Make sure you hold your hand steady. Stand up and put pressure on your hand so it is less likely to scoot around on the table. Tape your plate to the table to keep it in place.
Make sure your fingers are spaced out 1/2 an inch to 1 inch so you have space to trace them and so they can wiggle once you cut out your hand.
Use a pencil so you can erase mistakes and any visible lines that are left once you cut the hand from your plate.

, Follow your outline the best you can. Start at the bottom of your fake hand and work your way up towards the thumb, over the fingers, and then back down along the pinkie side of your hand.

, For each hand, cut 19 pieces at a length of 1-2 inches. These will help your hand bend and come to life.Cut the ends at a slight angle or straight across, according to your preference.

, Hold the straw between your thumb and index finger. Use your scissors to cut a tiny ""v"" halfway through the middle so they can bend., Use a pencil to mark on each finger of the plate where a joint should be. Study your own hand to judge where to mark. Also mark a line extending about an inch above where your the bottom of your thumb connects with your palm to roughly an inch below where your pinkie connects.

, Place three straw pieces on each finger: two between each joint and one between the last joint and your fingertip. Place two on the thumb: one between the two joints and another between the last joint and the thumb's tip. Place five more along the line across the palm.


Keep the straw pieces separated from each other in the fingers and thumb. If you don't have enough room to do the same with the straw pieces in the palm, allow them to touch end to end.

, Allow the glue to dry. Let it sit for about thirty minutes.

, Secure the string at the tip of each finger with a piece of tape. Thread it through the straws to the wrist. Go about four inches past the wrist before cutting the string to make sure you have enough., Pull gently on each one to make sure each finger works. If they do, pull them all at the same time for full effect!Put a latex glove on it and stuff it with tissues to make a more life-like hand.

Then flatten the clay slightly, using your fingers or a rolling pin. Smooth the clay until it’s the desired thickness for your fake hand., Picture your clay as a hand facing you with its palm up and all of its fingers straight and pressed together, including the thumb. Gently pull enough clay from one side to indicate a thumb without detaching it from the rest of the clay. Next, form the wrist. Indent the clay below the ball of its thumb, along the bottom of its palm., Use your fingers or a small cylindrical object (pencil, paintbrush handle, etc.) to indent the clay along its thumb. Lay your tool lengthwise along the top of the clay, angled toward the wrist, with the tip of your tool roughly centered in the middle of the palm. Gently roll or worm it to form an impression.Imagine your clay is a clock and your tool as the hour hand. If you’re making a left hand, the hour should read 10:30. If you’re making a right hand, it should read 1:30.

, Pull more clay from the rest of the hand and then detach the thumb, leaving its base attached, just like a real thumb spreading out from its hand. Round it into the shape of a thumb., This time, lay your tool across the palm where the base of the fingers will join. Also indent along the thumb and wrist as before to redefine the impressions., Use a scalpel to cut between each finger, leaving the base of each attached to the palm. Trim the top of each finger to taper them. Remember: the middle finger is longest, the pinkie is shortest, and the ring and index fingers are roughly the same size., Pass a needle up and down each cut between the fingers to spread them further apart. Go slowly and gently; this step is delicate.Depending on how large your sculpture is, switch to a larger tool once there’s enough room for it to fit between the fingers.

, Gently roll each between your own fingers to round them. Pay attention to the thickness of each so that no one finger is too thin or too thick. If needed, stretch them out to lengthen them. Then trim the excess and round the fingertips.Use a thin cylindrical tool (like a needle or the tip of paintbrush handle, depending on the size of your sculpture) to sculpt between the base of the fingers if your own fingers are too big to get in there., Use a small, thin cylindrical object to form a very light impression for each joint in the fingers. Be careful not to make too sharp of an indent; the smaller your sculpture, the more likely your finger will break here if the indent is too sharp., Flip your fake hand over to work on its back. Add small balls of clay to the base of each finger. Smooth them into place until they’re seamless., Continue the indent for the wrist along the back of the hand to mirror the front. Then slice a thin layer of clay from the back of the hand just above the wrist to create a more contoured effect., Trim and smooth the clay where needed. If too much has been trimmed or smoothed, apply a dab of clay to repair the area., Refer to your own hand to study the lines in your palm. Use a needle to lightly trace them in the palm of your sculpture. Flip the hand over and do the same for fingernails., Flex your own hand to see how your fingers and thumb work together in different poses. Gently bend your sculpture’s fingers to replicate., Follow the directions and recommendations listed on the clay’s packaging. Different types and/or brands of clay may have special instructions."

Choose a container that’s also large enough so that your hand does not come into contact with the container itself.Be sure that the brand of rubber mold you use is non-toxic and safe for human contact.

, Hold your thumb and fingers in the pose you wish to replicate. Then dip your entire hand into the mold, keeping it well away from the sides and bottom. Leave at least a half-inch of mold between your hand and the container., Keep your hand posed within the mold for however long your mold’s directions say it needs to set. Then, if needed, wiggle your thumb, fingers, and hand very gently to loosen them. Pull your hand out slowly. Avoid any quick, jerky movements that might disturb the cast you’ve just made., Prepare enough to fill the entire mold. Then pour a small amount (not all) of your plaster into the mold. Manipulate the container so that the plaster coats the insides of the finger- and thumb-holes in your mold. Allow the plaster to settle a bit to avoid the formation of air pockets., Fill the entire mold. Then bang the table a few times to release any air pockets. Quit once you no longer see any bubbles bursting on the surface., Wait for the time indicated by the directions to your plaster. Then upend the container and empty it onto the table. Make cuts into the rubber mold with a plastic knife and peel it from the plaster cast, piece by piece., Look for any imperfections where empty space in the rubber mold may have allowed room for extra plaster. Remove gently with sand paper or a small knife or file. Then either leave your finished cast as is or paint it as you desire."

This doesn't exactly mean that you must be in the same room as the candle, but make sure you can see it wherever you go.;
, Don't leave candles on a plastic or otherwise flammable tray or on an end table that can be easily knocked over. Rule of thumb: If anyone, or a pet, can knock over the table, it's unsafe for the candle.

, Be sure that your cat can't jump onto the table. If a candle is on a countertop, make sure it is as far back as it can go while staying four inches from the wall and other things. This way, a child can't reach over and grab it.

, Nothing can ignite if it's not close enough, right?

, Candles can get bumped over easily in high-traffic rooms. It's safer to leave them in sitting areas or bathrooms than a living room or hallway.

, A sudden draft could easily blow those curtains into the flame. If your windows are open, avoid burning candles altogether.

, If a wick is too short, the holder will extinguish the flame. But, if you just have a candle sitting on a counter, you run the risk of burning the surface.

, These little silver plates go over the top of a candle to keep the flame burning in one direction and eliminate smoke.

, Votive candles should be placed in a tightly fitted cup as they are meant to pool. If you put a votive candle on a plate, it would pool in two hours and run everywhere. If you put the votive in a tightly fitting votive cup, the candle will burn for around fifteen hours. Also be sure to use properly fitted holders for taper candles.

, The wick is too low and is unsafe for burning.

Dress and paint your dummy.",How to Make a Dummy2," Your friend will have to wear a long sleeve shirt and pants because the duct tape is painful to remove if it's applied directly to their skin. Wear form fitting clothing, because the bulkier your clothes are, the more bulky and unrealistic the duct tape dummy will look.Tell your friend to wear clothing that they don't care about because it will be destroyed in the end.

, Tightly wrap the duct tape around the waist and backside of the model before working on the legs. Go over the entire lower half of the model and cover them with duct tape so that it fits their body. This may take two to three layers to cover up any gaps in the tape., Start from the left hip of the model and pull the duct tape up over their right shoulder and onto their back. Do the same technique on the other side of the model so that an X forms on the front of the model. Continue to layer duct tape over the person until the entire torso is covered. Then, start working on each arm of the person, wrapping the duct tape around it.You can stop duct taping around the collar of the neck and wrists of the model.

, Draw a straight vertical line on the back of the model. Draw two lines along the sides of each pant leg on the lower half of the dummy. Use these lines to help guide your scissors when you cut the duct tape off of the model or person., Insert scissors into the pant leg of your friend and carefully cut up into each pant leg. Be very careful not to cut the person who is wearing the duct tape. Cut the back of the torso piece and peel it off the model.Do not use pointed scissors or you may cut your model or friend.

, Place a shirt over your head and loop the duct tape around your forehead, over your head, and under your chin. This will work as a soft template that you can use to finish off the dummy's head. Once you've created the loops, you can remove the shirt from your head and fill it with newspaper to fill it out., Tape the torso and legs back together along the cut lines that you made. To add weight and form to your dummy, fill in the top and bottom parts of the body with newspaper or cotton filling. You can also take the shirt that you created for the head and fill it out., Tape the bottom half of the torso with the top half and attach the filled up head to the neck portion of the dummy. Attach thick gloves to the arms of the dummy to create hands. You may have to fill the gloves up with newspaper or filling to make them look realistic. Attach shoes to the dummy by lining the inside of them with duct tape, then attaching them to each leg that you created., Fit clothing over the duct tape dummy that you created. For the head, you can either spray paint the shirt a flesh tone, or you can draw on a face however you want. Conceal the look of the gloves on the hands by painting them a flesh tone.

Don't collect living sand dollars.,
Collect the dried-out exoskeletons that wash up on the beach.",How to Clean Sand Dollars1," It's considered inhumane to kill sand dollars for the express purpose of drying them out and using them as decoration. If everyone did this, the population could suffer dramatically, and eventually no one would be able to collect sand dollar shells at all.


Don't collect sand dollars straight from the ocean. Sand dollars, which are related to starfish and sea urchins, burrow beneath the sand of the seafloor to protect themselves from predators and debris. If you dig up a sand dollar underwater, there's a good chance that it's alive.
Turn the sand dollar over and look for tiny, centipede-like feet or hairs on its bottom side. Gently brush the feet with your finger. If they move, the sand dollar is alive, and you should gently place it back into the water. If not, then feel free to take the sand dollar home.
If a sand dollar is moist or solid in your hand, there's a good chance that it's alive or recently deceased, even if you found it washed up on the beach. Exercise your best judgement, and consider returning a sand dollar to the sea if you aren't sure.;
, The relative rarity of washed-up sand dollars can make their discovery even more meaningful--and you will know that you aren't capturing and killing a live animal.


In many states, it's illegal to collect living sand dollars, and you may face a fine if you're caught in the act.If you're not sure about the law--or if you care about preserving fragile littoral ecosystems--don't take sand dollars directly from the ocean.
Many beaches and coastal authorities restrict the number of sand dollars that you can harvest in one go. Research local beach-combing rules and restrictions before you set out for the day.

Prepare your supplies.,
Start the hunt.,
Search in a place that matches the description of a habitat for your chosen species.,
Collect the quills.",How to Collect Porcupine Quills1," You'll need a few things before you begin.


Cushion or thick blanket
Some kind of body padding or armor (protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Safety goggles (for protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Thick gloves (for protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Plastic snack container big enough for quills;
, What species of porcupine lives where you are looking? Search online to find out, and then find out where it lives, what it eats, where it rests, how its feces look like--basically, anything you can find that will help you track one down.

, Search silently and carefully to avoid alerting any porcupines. Look closely everywhere.

, Once you have found a suitable porcupine, you should collect the quills.


Don't worry--this will not harm the animal. The quills are designed to stick into things and stay there, and as soon as the porcupine knows they are stuck in something, it will eject them from its skin and run away. Also, they cannot shoot quills--only let them go from their skin once they have stuck into something.
First, sneak up on the porcupine until you're right behind it and it doesn't notice you. (Or get within accurate cushion-throwing distance, but be careful, you only have one shot per animal.)
Then, slowly pull back your arms and suddenly throw the cushion or blanket down onto the unsuspecting porcupine. Making sure you are wearing gloves, pick up the soft object (after you are sure the quills were released) and observe the stuck quills! Pick these out and safely put them into a plastic box in your backpack. Be careful-- they are sharp!

Be gentle when cleaning sand dollars.,
Remove decaying tissue.,
Rinse the sand dollar.,
Remove tar from sand dollars.",How to Clean Sand Dollars2," These brittle, fragile exoskeletons can easily break apart if they're handled too roughly.


Don't scrub sand dollars too vigorously. If you do scrub a sand dollar, make sure that you don't push too hard on the shell.
Don't soak sand dollars in chemical solvents--such as bleach or acids--for too long. The solvent can contribute to the decay of the already-fragile object. Get it clean, but don't dissolve it.

, If the sand dollar has recently washed ashore, you may encounter the soft tissue of the deceased animal. You can let the shell dry naturally in the sun, you can bury it in the ground to let the bugs eat the tissue, or you can remove the tissue by hand.


If there is an odor--salty and musky, like decaying seaweed--about the shell, there may be decaying tissue within.Leave the sand dollar outside in the sun for a few weeks, and the remaining tissue will naturally decay and disappear. The exoskeleton will begin to bleach, lightly, and harden in the sun. When the sand dollar looks like a shell--relatively smooth, free of tissue--it is ready to use.
Consider burying the sand dollar in the earth of your yard or garden. Anything more than a few inches deep will do. Within a week or two, worms and other detritivores in the soil will consume the dead tissue and leave your sand dollar picked clean. Be sure to mark the burial site with a distinctive stone or a stake so that you don't forget. Be careful not to crush the sand dollar when you're burying it or digging it up.
You can remove the tissue with a sharp penknife. Be aware that the tissue has grown into the exoskeleton, and it may be difficult to remove every last bit. If you use a knife, be careful not to cut yourself or scar the surface of the sand dollar. Even if you remove the tissue by hand, you may want to allow the exoskeleton a few days to dry.

, Soak the shell thoroughly in clean, fresh water to remove any sand or debris that is stuck to them.


Fill a bowl or bucket with fresh water. Soak the sand dollar until the water becomes brown and murky. Replace the water in the bowl with fresh, clear water, and continue to soak the sand dollar until the water is murky again. Repeat this process until the water remains clear.
If the exoskeleton is particularly gunky, you can mix the water with a few squirts of dish soap for a slightly stronger cleaning agent. If you're pressed for time, you can continually and carefully flush the sand dollars with water until they're clear of sand.
Consider using a stiff, bristled brush to remove any clinging sand from shell fissures, cracks, and crevices. Be very gentle--sand dollars are fragile, and they may not stand up to a vigorous brushing.
When your sand dollars are clear of sand, place them in the sun for a few hours to dry.

, Some beaches are known for the sticky black tar that washes ashore, coating the rocks and the sand and the feet of anyone who treads there. If your sand dollar is coated with tar, it may not come clean with a water rinse.


Chip off any significant tar coating with a sharp piece of metal--a paint scraper will do, or a knife. Be careful not to cut yourself, and be careful not to scratch or break the sand dollar.It is best to avoid using force with sand dollars, given their fragility.
Use baby oil. Squirt a dollop of baby oil onto the sand dollar and rub it carefully into the tar. If you don't want to get tar on your fingers, use a tissue or the corner of an old dish towel. Gently rub the tar until the baby oil begins to dissolve it. Within a few minutes, you should be able to remove most of the tar from the sand dollar.
Consider using any of the following tar softeners: Eucalyptus oil, lard, margarine, mineral oil, olive oil, peanut butter, petroleum jelly, suntan lotion, or vegetable oil. Consider adding these softeners to the bowl of water when you soak your sand dollars, and consider soaking the tar-covered shells in a bowl of pure tar softener."

Soak the sand dollars in a bleach solution.,
Rinse after bleaching.Move the sand dollars from the bleach solution into a bowl or tray of fresh water.,
Consider hardening the sand dollar with glue.",How to Clean Sand Dollars3," If you'd like your sand dollars to be whiter, or you're having trouble cleaning them with water alone, you may consider using bleach. Mix equal amounts of bleach and water. and gently place your sand dollars into the solution.


If you're cleaning a number of sand dollars, fill a baking tray with the bleach-and-water solution. This will allow you to spread a number of sand dollars evenly over a broad surface. Make sure that there's enough solution in the tray to cover the entire sand dollar.You can also use a bowl, a bucket, or a Tupperware container.
If you're only cleaning one sand dollar, find a small bowl, lid, or other container. You won't need much bleach to get the intended effect.
Be careful not to soak the sand dollars in bleach for too long: the shell will begin to soften and disintegrate if it's left in too strong of a solution. If you want to soak the shells for a longer period, reduce the bleach concentration.
Be careful when handling bleach. Don't get bleach in your eyes, and don't swallow the solution. Wash your hands with soap after any contact with bleach.

,


The bleach may continue to disintegrate the shell even after you've removed the sand dollar from the solution. Rinse the bleached shell thoroughly in fresh water to neutralize the bleach solution and remove any remaining dirt.
When you're sure that the sand dollar is clean, leave it out to dry. Within a few hours it should be ready to decorate, display, or store as a keepsake. Sand dollars will harden over time, but you should continue to handle them carefully.

, This may come in handy if you plan to use if for craft projects, or if you want to display it without worrying about breaking it.


Mix together equal portions of water and white craft glue. Use a sponge brush or a paintbrush to completely cover the sand dollar with the mixture. Let the shell dry, and the glue solution will harden like a glaze.
Sand dollars will harden naturally, over time, the drier they become. Bear in mind that thicker glue mixtures may conceal some of the natural texture of the shell.
Once your sand dollar is hardened and dried, it's ready to use or display. You can paint or decorate your sand dollars, give them as gifts, or display them as they are.

, If it smells, don't use it. The smell gets into the quills, rendering them horrible for any use. But if it's fresh roadkill, for instance (you hit it or you just saw it hit, or it's clearly not smelly or attracting flies), go for it.

, You can do this on site or at home.


Act like you're petting the porcupine from head to tail. Nothing should try to stick you if you rub it right. Then, while petting it, grasp a group of quills between your fingers and pull at the same angle you were petting. They will pop out. Get all the quills from the animal, and store them away somewhere in your backpack.
If you want to collect the quills at home, just worry about skinning the porcupine on site. Put the skin, quills and all, in a shopping bag. Put that in a second bag and that in a third bag. Tie it all up. Dispose of the rest of the carcass as described below, carry the skin home, and use the methods in the first option to get the quills at home.

, Dig a hole and bury the porcupine near some plants, or if it was roadkill, toss it off the roadside into the forest for scavengers to eat. This returns its nutrients to the environment.


If you're interested in eating the porcupine (not a common food, but it is edible), skin the animal and bag up the skin. Dress the animal and place the meat in the remaining two bags--like with the skin but only two. Discard the leftovers into the woods for scavengers. Take the quills out of the skin at home as described above, and put the meat in the freezer while you do this--and only do it before you cook the meat; the skin will spoil so you must do it now.

Rub mineral oil over each shell to give it a deep gleam.,
Spray the shells.",How to Clean and Polish Seashells," This may be a local beach, or one you visit when on vacation. Shells can also be purchased from craft stores and from online sources.;
, Be considerate of nature and leave seashells with live creatures in them alone. You can tell a shell is still alive if you turn it over and there is a creature inside it.


Check with your country's laws to ensure you don't collect illegal seashells. For example, in U.S. waters, Queen Conches are illegal to take. They are a protected species due it being vulnerable to overfishing.

, In shelling, a live seashell is a shell with animal tissue still attached to it. This is different from a seashell that is alive since the animal tissue in a live shell is dead. A dead shell is a shell with no animal tissue inside it.


Understanding whether a shell is live or dead will affect the way you will choose to clean your shell. For example, live shells will require you to remove the animal tissue inside.

, Boiling or cooking a live seashell will loosen up any animal tissues inside the shell and make it easier to remove. You will need a pot and tweezers or some tool like a dental instrument to remove the animal tissue. To clean live shells by boiling:


Place the seashells in a large pot of room temperature water. Cover the shells with about 2 inches (5 cm) of extra water. It's important to use room temperature water and to put the shells in the pot before heating them up because any sudden heat could crack the shells.
Bring the water to a boil. Let the water roll for about 5 minutes. If you are boiling more than one shell, add extra boiling time. As well, larger shells might require more boiling time.
Take out the shells with tongs and place them gently on a soft surface like a hot towel.
Carefully, with your tweezers or any other tool, pull out any animal tissue from inside the shells and dispose of it., This method of cleaning out a live shell can take the longest, but many choose to use this method to prevent the shell from being damaged. Boiling and freezing, as well as pulling out animal tissue by hand, can cause a shell to crack. Burying a live shell, provided you bury it in a safe place, protects it from damage and is a natural way to clean out animal tissues. Ants, bugs, and other insects will feed on the shell and clean it out. To clean live shells by burying them:


Dig a hole in the ground. Make sure the hole is large enough to fit all your shells and also provide plenty of space between each shell. The hole should also be around 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) deep to prevent unwanted animals from digging up your seashells or people from stepping on top and crushing your shells.
Place your shells evenly with space between them in the hole.
Cover the shells with dirt.
Wait a few months for insects, larvae, worms, and bacteria to remove the tissue inside the shell. The longer you wait, the better the results.Dig up the shells again and check to see if all signs of animal tissue are gone.

, Freezing kills any remaining animal tissue inside the shell and makes it easier to remove. To clean a live seashell by freezing:


Place your shells in a Ziplock bag. You may need to use several bags if you have many shells.
Add water to the bag until all the shells are covered.
Place the bag in the freezer.
Let it freeze solid for a few days.
Remove it from the freezer and let it thaw completely.
Take out the shells and pull out the animal tissue from inside the shells.

, The water will dissolve any dirt on your seashells and give you shells that are shiny and clean by the end of the week.Change the water every day or so. Adding fresh water to your seashell soak can result in even cleaner seashells.
You can also choose to boil your dead seashells after the week is over to ensure all particles or animal tissue is completely gone from the shells.

, Bleach will definitely remove any dirt, impurities, and animal tissue from your seashells. However, some seashell collectors warn that using bleach can destroy the colour of your shells and make them smell like bleach forever. To clean a shell using bleach:


Fill a pot with equal parts water and bleach. It should be full enough to cover all shells.
Soak the shells in the solution. You might notice a flaky, leathery covering coming off the shells. This is the periostracum or the organic coating or ""skin"" of the shell.
Once this coating is gone, you can remove the shells from the solution. Additionally, you can use a toothbrush to remove particles from the shells.
Rinse your shells thoroughly and allow to dry completely.
Rub baby oil or mineral oil on the shells to restore shine.

, Toothpaste is a less strong alternative to bleaching your seashells. To clean a dead shell by using toothpaste:


Smear a light coat of toothpaste over one side of the shell at a time.
Let the toothpaste-covered shell sit for at least 5 hours, so the toothpaste has time to soak right in. It is fine to leave it overnight to make sure that the toothpaste does its job.
Once it has gone tacky and/or hard, depending on the thickness of the layer of toothpaste you applied, get an old toothbrush and a glass of warm water and scrub the shells thoroughly. Make sure you get into all the little cracks and hard-to-see gaps.
Make sure that all of the toothpaste has been removed, even if this means rinsing the shells under running water once scrubbed. This will remove the grit and other parts in the toothpaste, remove anything rough or sharp, leaving the surface very smooth with very few flaws.

, If you see that barnacles are attached to your shells, use a dental tool, soft toothbrush, or wire brush to remove the barnacles.


This is most effective if the shells have been cleaned previously, either from being soaked in water or bleached.

, Allow the shells to dry for at least one full day and then rub oil on the shell.


Mineral oil not only restores the shine of the shell, but helps to preserve the shell.
Similarly, you can use WD-40. However, when using this material, be sure to use gloves to handle the shells.

, You can use satin-finish polyurethane or coat with clear nail polish. This type of finish preserves the shell's organic look while giving it an extra glossy shine.


Do one side of the shell each day. Allow the shell to dry completely before starting on the other side. Each side can take about a day to dry.

Let the shells air dry.,
Cover your shell in oil.,
Examine your shells before taking them from the beach.,
Do not leave shells out in the sun too long.,
Be careful not to crack the shell when removing barnacles.",How to Clean Conch Shells," When working with bleach, it's vital to wear protective gear for your safety. Put on thick gloves and goggles before mixing your solution. Also, be sure to mix bleach in a well ventilated area such as outdoors or in a garage., To soak a conch, mix a solution using half bleach and half water. The precise amounts you need of each depends on how many conches you're soaking. You need enough bleach and water to fully submerge your conches., Once you've mixed the bleach and water, add your conches to the solution. In about 24 hours, you can remove them from the solution. Some of the dirt will have come off, and any stuck on barnacles will be easier to remove.Make sure to wear gloves when putting your conches in the solution, as well as when you remove them.

, A dental tool, flathead screw driver, or strong pick is used to pick off barnacles. Wedge the pick or tool under the barnacle and gently pry it off. This should be fairly easy, as the bleach should have loosened the barnacles.If barnacles are being stubborn, chisel them off using a hammer and screwdriver. Angle the screwdriver under the barnacle and gently tap on the end with the hammer. This should dislodge the barnacle.

, After removing barnacles, take a scrub brush and wipe down your conches. Use light, scrubbing motions to remove any remaining dirt and debris form the shell.If some dirt or stains are not coming off, use your thumbnail to gently scratch them out of the shell.

, It's important that your conch shells air dry. Set them in a dry place where they will not be disturbed, such as a cupboard or cabinet. Do not attempt to polish your shells until they are completely dry to the touch.It can sometimes take conch shells awhile to completely dry, especially if you live in a cooler region. It is not unusual for shells to take a couple of days to dry completely.

, Once your shells are dry, they may look a little dull from the cleaning process. To brighten them up, dab some mineral oil onto a cotton pad or cotton ball. Rub the cotton on the shell and cover it completely with oil. If the shells is not as shiny as you want after one layer, add another.If you do multiple coats, let the shell dry for 12 hours between each coat.

, Make sure the shells you take from the beach do not house aquatic life. Tap the shell gently after picking it up to make sure it is empty. If you hear any scuttling, or see an animal in the shell, put it back where you found it., To dry your shells faster, you can place them out in the sun. However, do not leave them in the sun for more than a few hours. If shells are left in the sun for too long, they will start to lose color., Be extra cautious when removing barnacles. Only use the chiseling method if it's absolutely necessary. You do not want to crack or damage your shell while removing barnacles."

Fill a tub with lukewarm water.,
Test your bamboo.,
Draw your desired shape.,
Nail the design.,
Shape your bamboo.",How to Bend Bamboo1," Place your bamboo poles in the tub and allow them to soak overnight.


As with wood, bamboo requires moisture to bend. The moisture softens the lining and hemicellulose in the bamboo cells and allows them to flex. Without heat and moisture, these molecules crystallize making them virtually immovable.
Depending on the size and thickness of the bamboo, soaking time may be longer.;
, Pull the bamboo out of the water and slowly bend the bamboo, attempting to coax it into the shape you need. If you hear a crackling sound, the bamboo has not been soaked long enough, and needs to be placed back in the water.

, Take a large sheet of paper and sketch out the shape you want you bamboo to take. Place this paper on top of your large piece of plywood.

, Using the sketch as your guide, hammer nails into the plywood, following the sketched shape. Each nail should be approximately an inch apart.


Hammer in a second row of nails. This row should run parallel to the shape you just nailed and the distance between the two rows should be slightly larger than the diameter of the bamboo.

, Once your bamboo has been adequately soaked and is pliable, remove it from the water and place it on the plywood between the nails. Allow the bamboo to dry 1-3 days.


You can test whether your shape has been set by picking the bamboo off the board. If the bamboo retains the desired shape, it has finished drying into shape.

Cut your bamboo.,
Make multiple node cuts in the same cane to create a circular shape.,
Bend your bamboo into shape.",How to Bend Bamboo2," Make a V-shaped cut right beneath one of the bamboo nodes. A node is one of the joints in the bamboo pole that looks like a knee and divides the cane into segments.


Make your cut narrow if the bend you desire is slight. Make your cut wider if the bend you need is more dramatic.
The cut can be as deep as two-thirds the diameter of the pole. Cuts can be shallower for less dramatic bends.

, Cutting near a node makes this alteration less visible.

, Secure it either by lashing it, or using an adhesive to set your bamboo in place."

Hollow out your bamboo poles.,
Drill some vapor holes.,
Heat your bamboo.,
Check the bamboo for flexibility.,
Plug one end of your bamboo and fill it with fine sand.,
Prepare to bend the bamboo pole.,
Enjoy your newly-bent, heat-colored bamboo pole!",How to Bend Bamboo3," Use a piece of rebar (a steel bar commonly used as a tension device to reinforce concrete) to break the bamboo's internal nodes. This is done by shoving the rebar in and out of the bamboo pole on one end, then the other. You should end up with a hollow tube.

, Vapor builds up during the application of heat to the bamboo pole. In order to let the vapor escape, it is recommended that you drill a few holes at the nodes.

, Take your torch and begin applying heat to the pole with the flame, continually moving from the widest part of the bamboo, to the thinnest. The heat should be above boiling temperature. This achieves two things:


The heat coloring of the bamboo. Application of the heat acts as a stain on the bamboo and gives it a warm, coffee color.
The lignin and pectin in the bamboo becomes soft and pliable allowing you to more easily mold the bamboo.

, Using a wet rag, sweep down the bamboo pole, wiping moisture over surface. Test the flexibility of the bamboo by bending the pole slightly. It should give fairly easily.

, Hit the bamboo with the side of your hand or the side of the small shovel to move the sand all the way to the bottom of the pole. The sand stabilizes the bamboo so the walls do not buckle when you bend it.

, Dig a hole in firm earth that is 6""-8"" deep and slightly larger than the circumference of the pole. Holding it firmly for leverage, you are now ready to shape the pole.


Begin by torching the pole again. Concentrate on the area you wish to bend, and keep the flame moving.
Periodically wipe the pole with a wet rag. The water prevents the bamboo from drying out and becoming brittle. Dried bamboo can break or split easily.
As you work the pole with the torch, begin to bend the bamboo pole into your desired shape.
Repeat torching, bending, and dampening until you finesse the bamboo into the desired shape. This may take time. It is at this point that bamboo often splits, due to all of the stress it is under. The more time you take shaping the bamboo gradually, the less chance you have of splitting your pole., These larger poles are used primarily for furniture, but can also be made into a variety of crafts.

Penetrate the top of the egg with your stick pin. Gently tap the top of the egg with the pin until you’ve broken through the shell. Make sure the shell has not cracked around the pinhole and then remove the pin.



 


Repeat this process on the other side of the egg. Consider making a smaller hole on the opposite side of the egg if possible.






Blow (gently) on one side of the egg, while holding the egg over the bowl. Avoid sucking the raw egg into your mouth as you blow. Just gently blow the yolk and whites into the bowl.





;
, Because you will be inserting a message inside the egg you want to make sure it is completely dry. Speed up the process by using a hair dryer on the coolest setting and blowing the air directly into the hole.


Give the egg a day or two to completely dry.

, Get creative with your design or add a hint on the outside. Such as painting, “Will You…” on the outside (and the message could be “Marry Me?”).


Provide ample dry time before adding your message (otherwise your design and message could be compromised).

, Using a very thin strip of paper, write your message. The paper width should be approximately 2”, with the length being only slightly longer.


Use a fountain pen or a special pen to write your message. Go for a handwritten instead of typed message as well.
If you use a fountain pen, make sure the ink is completely dry before you insert your message inside the egg.

, You will need to tightly roll the message up, being sure you create the tightest roll possible as you will be squeezing that message through the hole you created on top of the egg.

, You may need to widen the hole by gently twisting the tops of a small pair scissors into the hole. Do this before adding your message or try to insert your message and if it doesn’t fit, use the scissors.


Make sure the entire sheet of paper fits completely inside the egg. You don’t want any part exposed or sticking out of the hole.







, Line the inside of the gift box with paper grass and then lay the egg in the middle of the box.

Store bought pinecones already come cleaned and ready to use.;
, This includes things like seeds, moss, and pine needles. You can do this with a pair of tweezers or a brush. Don't worry about being too precise here, however; the next step will help clean the pinecones further., Fill a sink, tub, or bucket with two parts water and one part white vinegar. How much water and vinegar you end up using depends on the size of your container and how many pinecones you are going to soak.You can also use a solution of 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water and 1 teaspoon of mild dish soap., You need the pinecones to remain submerged during this step. If they don't stay down, you can weigh them down with a wet, heavy towel, a pot lid, or even a dinner plate.The pinecones may close up during this step. Don't worry, they will open back up again., Be sure to leave them in a well-ventilated area, as this will help increase airflow.

Prepare your workspace and decide on a finishing method.,
Spray the pinecones if you want something quick and easy.,
Use a marine varnish if you want something more durable.,
Dip the pinecones in paint or varnish if you want a thicker coating.,
Dip the pinecones in beeswax as an alternative to varnish or paint.",How to Preserve Pinecones3," Whether you are spraying your pinecone or dipping it in paint, you'll want to cover your counter or table with newspaper. If you are using a spray sealer, it would be even better to step outside. Once you have your space set up, choose a sealing method from the list below., Choose a non-yellowing spray varnish. Lay the pinecones on their sides, then spray them using an even coat. Wait for the pinecones to dry, then rotate them and spray the other side. Let the sealer dry before applying another coat.


Spray sealers come in many different finishes: matte, satin, and glossy. Choose one that you like the best.
If you don't have any spray varnish, you can try using hairspray instead., Purchase a marine varnish from a hardware or home improvement store. Put on a pair of disposable gloves and hold the pinecone by the tip. Use a cheap, disposable brush with stiff bristles to apply the varnish to the pinecone, except for the bottom. Let the varnish dry, then hold it by its sides, and coat the bottom and tip. Let the pinecone dry on its side.


You can apply more than one coat of marine varnish, but you have to let the previous coat dry fully.
Alternatively, you can tie some thread to the top of the pinecone, then dip it into the varnish. Lift it out, and let any excess varnish drip off, then tie the string somewhere so that the pinecone can hang dry.

, Wrap some string or thin wire around the top of a pinecone. Dip the pinecone into a can of paint or varnish. Lift the pinecone out, and hold it about the can for about 1 minute to let the excess paint/varnish drip back. Use the string or wire to hang the pinecone some place so that it can dry.Keep a newspaper or tray under the pinecone to catch any drips of paint or varnish.
Keep in mind that this method may cause the pinecones to close up again.If the paint or varnish is too thick, thin it with water. Use 4 parts paint or varnish to 1 part water., Melt enough solid beeswax in a crockpot to fully submerge the pinecone. Tie string around the tip of the pinecone, then use it to dip the pinecone into the melted wax. Lift the pinecone out, then dip it into a bucket of cold water.You may have to repeat this step a few times to get an even coverage.The more you dip the pinecone into wax, the more visible the wax will become. Your pinecone may end up yellow or white.

Flat mushrooms create the best prints.;

, Cover the mushroom with glass or bowl. Although it doesn't need to be clear, a clear glass covering allows you to help determine when the print is done.

, When you think it's ready, remove the bowl and view your print.


The print is actually made by the many microscopic spores falling from the mushroom, leaving a near-photographic impression.

, Use the print for hanging artwork, gift wrapping, adding to another craft project or to create more art from.


To protect the dusty print, spray with spray fixative, such as hairspray. Several coats should be adequate. Be careful though, as the pressure from the spray can easily disturb the spore print and change its shape.

The size of the hoop is really dependent on how big you want your dreamcatcher to be. However, if this is your first time making a dreamcatcher, try a 5 to 8 inch (13 to 20 cm) hoop; these hoops are neither too big nor too small for beginners.You can find these hoops at your local crafts store in the yarn and crocheting aisle.;
, Choose leather or buckskin suede lace. The width of the lace should be no larger than the width of a shoelace. The length of the lace should be eight times greater than the diameter of the hoop you are using.For example, if you are using a 5-inch (13 cm) hoop, then 2 yards of lacing should be enough.
If you do not want to use suede lacing, then you can also use ribbon.

, You want to use string that is strong, but flexible. Artificial sinew, hemp cord, waxed nylon string, or silk thread all work great. The length of the string should be ten times the diameter of the hoop. Traditionally, natural-colored string is used, but you can use any color you want.For example, if you are using a 5-inch (13 cm) hoop, then you will need 50 inches or 2 yards (72 inches) of string.

, How you decorate your dreamcatcher is up to you. You can use feathers, strips of fabric, beads, gemstones, and shells to decorate your dreamcatcher. Choose materials that have personal meaning for you., Holding the end of the suede lace against the hoop, wrap it around the line of glue. When you are wrapping the suede, make sure there are no spaces between the pieces of lace, i.e., you should not be able to see the hoop. Once you have wrapped the glued section, use a small binder clip to hold the lace in place until the glue dries, about five minutes.Use regular, craft glue.
If you are using regular ribbon, then tie a double or triple knot at the starting point instead of using glue to secure the ribbon.

, Continue wrapping the lace around the hoop. At strategic spots, place more glue on the hoop before you wrap the lace around it. This will ensure that the lace stays in place.








Make sure to use the small binder clips to hold the lace in place where the glue is.
The lace should be tightly wrapped around the hoop and touching the adjacent loop of lace, but they should not overlap.

, Wrap the lace all the way around the hoop, i.e., back to the starting point. Before you get to the end, place a final line of glue on the hoop. Finish wrapping the lace and secure it with a small binder clip., Place the hoop aside for 15 to 20 minutes to let the glue finish drying. After 15 minutes, take off the clips. Cut off any extra pieces of lace., Cut 2 yards of string. Start by tying a knot at the top of the hoop. Tie a double or triple knot to ensure that the string is secure., Working clockwise, stretch the string to a spot about two inches over on the hoop. Loop the string around the hoop and back over itself to create a hitch. Make sure to pull the string tight to secure it before moving on to the next loop.








Pulling too hard on the string may warp the shape of the dreamcatcher.

, Loop the string around the entire frame until you reach the top of the hoop where you started. As you do this, go slowly to make sure the loops are evenly spaced. Once you reach the top, loop the string around the hoop next to the starting knot.There should be an odd number of loops.

, Loop the string around the midpoint of the first line of thread. Using the same technique, loop it around the string and over itself to create a hitch. Continue weaving the thread this way until you reach the top of the hoop., As you weave the web, the circle in the middle will get smaller and smaller. Weave the string until only a small circle is left in the middle of the dreamcatcher. Make sure to pull the string tight to secure the web., Once the circle is small, about the size of a penny or dime, tie a knot around the next string instead of hitching it. Tie a double or triple not to make sure the string is secure and will not come undone. Then trim off any extra string with scissors., Cut a 5-inch (13 cm) piece of suede lace. Tie the loose ends into a knot to make a circle. Secure the lace around the top of the hoop by pushing the knot through the loop. Then pull tight to create the hanging loop., You will need to do this as you make the web. Place a bead on the string before you loop and hitch it to the next string. You can either space them out randomly, or create a pattern by placing a bead on every other string.







, Purchase different colors or patterns of fabric. Cut the fabric into strips. Fold the strips in half to create a loop. Place the loop underneath the bottom rim of the dreamcatcher. Thread the ends of the fabric through the loop and pull tight to secure it.You can also do this technique with suede lace, strips of leather, or any other type of string to create a dreamy hanging effect.

, Thread a bead onto your strip of fabric or string. Position the bead to where you want it on the string. Tie a small knot underneath the bead. The knot will hold the bead in place., Group four to five feathers together. Use a small binder clip to hold them together while you tie and knot a string around the tops of the feathers to secure them. Then tie and knot the string along the bottom of the dream catcher.You can also thread various beads onto the strings as well before you attach them to the dreamcatcher.

For a bold look, go with just one bright color, like an all-crimson bouquet.
Mix it up with green foliage for a natural effect.
Think of yourself as a painter when you're deciding which colors accent each other. Consider referencing a color wheel to help you make your decision.
You can't go wrong choosing your favorite hues. If they make you happy, you'll be happy with your flower arrangement, so don't feel constrained by traditional choices.;
, Use a pencil, paper and some colored pencils to achieve a rough sketch before you visit a florist or craft store. You don't have to draw a perfect representation of what you want, but sketching it out will help you figure out what type of look you're going for.


Are you looking for a natural, hand-picked effect? You'll want a variety of colors, shapes and textures.For a more formal arrangement, you could stick with one type of flower in classic shape.
If you're decorating for a holiday, you may also want to add seasonal items such as cornucopias around Thanksgiving or snowmen cut outs that can be placed in a vase.
Decide whether you will have a vertical or horizontal arrangement when you conceptualize your floral design. A vertical design often features a taller vase with flowers extending higher in the center and lower around the edges. A vertical design has a shallower vase and looks to place flowers slightly higher in the center and drape them out toward the ends.

, The container can make as much of a statement as the flower arrangement. Determine what size and shape you'd like the container to be. Here are a few options:


Traditional glass vases highlight the beauty of the flowers without standing out too much.
Vases or boxes made of ceramic, wood, aluminum, and other materials also do quite nicely for a floral craft arrangement.
Consider using a mason jar, an old ceramic jug, or another item you already have on hand to add a personal touch to your arrangement.

, Now that you have your plan in order, it's time to gather your supplies. Depending on what type of arrangement you're making, you'll need some or all of the following items:


Several types of flowers
Greenery, such as ferns and moss
A foam block or florists' frog that fits into your container
Other accent pieces, such as buttons, ribbons and/or seasonal décor.
Florist's tape in green, white or clear

, A frog at the bottom of your container will anchor the stems of your flowers to keep them in place.


If the frog is a bit too small, you can cut a piece of floral foam to achieve the same effect. Soak the foam for a few minutes to soften it.Trace the bottom of your container onto the foam, then use a utility knife to cut out the shape. Place it at the bottom of your container.
You can skip this step for fake flower arrangements, since they tend to stay in place without help.
If you don't have a utility knife, you should be able to cut through the frog with a scissors.

, If you are using a large, decorative bowl as a container for your flowers, having a tape grid over the opening will also keep the flowers and other elements from moving. Place half a dozen tape pieces going horizontally across the opening, and half a dozen running vertically. This will allow you to secure the flowers in an orderly design.

, Clip off leaves near the bottoms of the stem with scissors, to remove bulk and help them stay fresh longer. Use a diagonal cut to trim the flowers to the desired length. The shallower your container is, the more you will have to clip.


Consider cutting the stems of different flowers to different lengths. This will add tiers to the floral design.
If you're unsure how much to trim, do a practice run and hold the flowers up next to your container in a bunch to estimate how tall each one should be.

, Be sure the tips are wedged into the flower frog. Place the tallest, boldest blooms in the container first, then fill in the gaps with the other complementary flowers and you have chosen. Continue filling out the container until the arrangement looks balanced and complete.

, You will want to check its appearance from each side to make sure it is consistent. Fix any gaps with other flowers or remove flowers if it is too full.

, Ivy, ferns or baby's breath accent the flowers while adding rich green hues to your design. Depending upon your design, you may want your greenery to surround your flowers at the bottom, drape down over the vase itself in a few places or sit up higher among the flowers.


You may place moss around the frog in places where you can see these items. For example, you can use moss around a frog in a see through vase or at the top of a basket arrangement.
Instead of using moss, you can fill the area around the frog with other objects. Consider buttons, glass pebbles, corks or shells.

, Don't forget this final touch! You want your arrangement to last as long as possible.

, Use orange, brown, yellow, and red flowers as well as Thanksgiving-themed decorative items to create a beautiful arrangement for your Thanksgiving table.

, Pretty pastels and soft spring hues are the stars in this arrangement. Buy decorative eggs, bunnies, chicks, and other Easter decorations to accent your flowers.

, Take advantage of the year's most colorful and bountiful flowers by crafting your own summer arrangement. This is the time of year to use lots of colors and big, bold shapes.

, Use the bride's chosen colors and add wedding bells, lovebirds, or another sweet accent to make a beautiful wedding centerpiece.

You don't have to make a wreath of a single color. You can use multiple colors, such as various shades of blue, or colors that compliment each other. For example, go for shades like yellow and blue.;
, You can buy silk tulips at a craft store. Some shops may sell silk plants. You need at least nine bunches to make your wreath. Pick out nine bunches of silk tulips that fit with your color scheme., You need to separate each individual tulip so you can place them in the right design on your wreath. Hold the bunches together, pressing the grass blades close together. Use a pair of wire cutters to remove the stem uniting the bunches. Keep the stems long."

Wrap a ribbon around the Styrofoam wreath frame.,
Secure the stems to the wreath with floral pins.,
Add another layer.,
Fill in any holes.,
Hot glue loose buds.,
Hang your wreath.",How to Make a Tulip Wreath2," Get a ribbon in a color that compliments your tulips' colors. Secure the end of your wreath to your Styrofoam using a floral pin. Wrap it around the Styrofoam wreath frame so that all the white is colored. Then, use a floral pin to secure the other end of the ribbon to the wreath.Wrap your ribbon snugly and overlap each layer a little bit. This will most effectively cover your wreath.

, Take your tulips and use floral pins to pin their stems onto your wreath. Overlap new stems with previous stems as you go. This will cover up the appearance of stems, leaving the focus on the flowers instead. To start, make one layer covering the outer portion of your wreath., Once the outer portion of the wreath is covered, cover the inner portion of the wreath. Repeat the same pattern. Pin tulips down by the stems. Then, add new stems to overlap with the old ones. This will put the focus on the flowers., After covering the inner and outer layers of the wreath, evaluate it. If you notice any holes where you can see the ribbon poking through, cover these with another tulip.It's not always necessary to fill in holes. If your wreath does not have any obvious holes, or if you simply prefer the look of the ribbon poking through, you can skip this step.

, Some buds usually break away from the stem while you're making your wreath. Use hot glue to reattach these tulips to the wreath.Make sure to add the glue to the tulips near the base of the flowers. You do not want glue to show up on your wreath.

, Cut out a piece of ribbon to use as the hanger. The size is up to you depending on how big you want your hanger to be. Then, use floral pins to attach either end of the ribbon to the back of your wreath.When you're done, you should have a thick tulip wreath with a hanger in place that you can hang up on your wall.

Make one layer of tulips surrounding the front of your wicker base., When you're done with the first layer, add another. This will allow you to fill in any obvious gaps and add more color variation if you want.The second layer comes down to personal preference. If you prefer a thicker wreath, add more tulips to gaps. If you want to add color variation, add different colored tulips to various portions of the wreath.

, Some buds may detach from the stems while you're making your wreath. Use hot glue to glue these buds back in place. Make sure to add the glue to the back of the tulip flower. You do not want it to show up on your wreath., Cut out a piece of ribbon as big as you want your hanger. Tie each end to the back of the wreath. You can then hang your wreath somewhere in your home or on your front door."

Select the basket for your arrangement.,
Select the flowers.,
Arrange the fresh flowers in the glass vials or test tubes.,
Arrange the silk flowers in the basket.,
Finish up the basket.,
Add a tag for the recipient.",How to Make a Silk Flower Basket Arrangement," The basket should be large or small enough to accommodate the amount of flowers you'll be using. Consider what the end use will be for the floral arrangement in a basket -- for example, if it is for a patient in a hospital, use a small basket so as to be considerate of space. If for someone's home, you can be more generous with the basket size. The basket can be decorated. For example, you could spray paint it a desired color and glue on beads, shells, lace, etc., to make the basket prettier.

If also using fresh flowers, select the glass vials or test tubes. These can be clear glass or colored glass, according to your preference.;
, Choose your desired type or types of silk flowers, which can be purchased from a florist or a craft shop. These silk flowers can form the bulk of the arrangement and can be accompanied by fresh flowers in glass vials or test tubes, also available from florists or craft stores. Adding fresh flowers can make this extra special, and the silk flowers are a nice reminder once the fresh flowers cease being fresh.

If using fresh flowers, thin down the foliage and cut the stem at a diagonal angle. Let the flowers soak in a solution of lukewarm water to which you've added some watered down tea, baby bio and 1/2 a tablet of crushed paracetamol. The fresh flowers will drink this up and it helps them to last longer. Cut the stems short.

, Add a little water. When filled, put aside standing upright, ready for use., Place a foam oasis block in the base, and glue in place to prevent it from sliding or moving. Then stick the stems into this. Fan them out to fill up the basket. Once this is done, you can arrange the glass vials with fresh flowers across the front of the basket, inserting them into the oasis, in front of the silk flower arrangement.

If you would rather put the glass vials/test tubes in a different arrangement in the basket, that is fine. They could be placed in different areas of the basket, at different angles, etc., provided they show the fresh flowers at their best. You can build up the theme in any way you'd like.

, Use ribbon or lace to beautify the basket. You can also use any novelty items to decorate the basket, as desired. For example, if it is the holiday season, you could add some holly and tinsel, wrapping the tinsel around the basket's handle., The basket is now ready to give. Or, just place it on display without a tag."

",How to Make Artificial Flowers2," You can make fun, whimsical flowers using ribbons with patterns and polka dots, or take a more realistic approach by picking out ribbon in a hue reminiscent of petals. Here's what you'll need to make flowers from ribbon:









A 12-inch length of ribbon
A needle with thread that matches the ribbon

, This stitch weaves through the ribbon, allowing you to create the shape of a flower when you're finished.









Thread the needle. Tie a knot at the end of the thread. This will hold it in place.
Push the needle, from front to back, into the ribbon, along the edge. Pull the thread through until it is stopped by the knot. Push the needle, from back to front, and pull the thread through. Repeat this to complete the running stitch.

, This should cause the ribbon to bunch before you finish the running stitch. This step will create the basic form of your ribbon flower: the petals.








, Otherwise known as backstitching, this will secure the form of your ribbon flower.








, The tails of the ribbon should hang down from your hand as you hold the flower.








, Stitch first up, then down. Secure the thread with a knot (or 2 if necessary).








, By cutting as close as possible to the stitch line, your flower will hold its circular shape.

You could go down the local petrol station and pick up some sad, exhaust-scented carnations…OR, you could invest your time better and talk to an expert. You'll get a lot more for your buck, and you might even make a new friend. Tell your florist how much you would like to spend -- they will be happy to work around your budget.;
, If you can't afford someone's favourite flowers, then you can go for their favourite colours instead. Your florist will be able to suggest a range of varieties to make up your bouquet.

, Ask what flowers are in season -- in high spring daffodils are a fraction of their usual price, as are zinnias in summer.

, One such approach is to employ blooms with big-heads such as hydrangea, sunflowers and dahlias- this means fewer stems and consequently a smaller price. Know that you can have expensive flowers- just a very small number of them. The rest of your bouquet will be bulked up with much less costly foliage and accessories such as tissue paper, ribbons, raffia, feathers, butterflies and diamante. This bouquet is made up of a couple of Gran Prix roses, bouvardia, oriental lilies and leucadendron. With a little knowledge, and imagination, you can have a bouquet presented with panache on a shoestring.

",How to Make a Onesie Bouquet," You could make a onesie bouquet from a random assortment of onesies in different colors and patterns, but if you want to make your gift or centerpiece look more impressive, you should choose a color scheme and build the bouquet around that.


The most common color schemes revolve around the gender of the baby: blue for boy, pink for girl.
If you do not know the gender or if you otherwise want a gender neutral option, consider colors like yellow, green, orange, red, or white.
You could also pick a color scheme based on the baby's parents rather than on the baby. For instance, if the parents are both big fans of a certain sports team, you could arrange a onesie bouquet using that team's colors.;
, Bouquets come in different shapes and arrangements. Some onesie bouquets would make great gifts to an expecting parent but may not make great decorations for a baby shower. Ask yourself how you plan to present the onesie bouquet and choose a design or arrangement pattern based on that.


This article contains basic instructions on three different bouquet designs: the bundle of joy, traditional bouquet, and vase or basket bouquet. The bundle of joy and traditional bouquets are great to use when presenting the bouquet as a gift, while the vase or basket bouquet is better served as a decoration.

, The number of onesie flowers you need will determine how full or large your final bouquet is. A small bouquet will look adequately full with as few as three onesie flowers, while a larger bouquet may need a dozen onesie flowers.

, Spread the onesie out onto your working surface. Use your hands to smooth out any wrinkles.


The onesie can be in any size, but understand that larger onesies will produce larger flowers.

, Fold the sides of the onesie in toward the center, bringing the sleeves together. Then, fold the onesie in half lengthwise, creating a narrow strip of cloth.

, Start from the bottom end and carefully roll the cloth around itself, moving toward the neck.Note that one side will likely look better than the other. The neat side is the top, while the lumpy side should be the bottom.

, Use a rubber band, small piece of yarn, or small length of string. Tie it around the newly created flower bud to prevent the cloth from unrolling.


For a cute, baby-themed twist, pin the buds closed using a large diaper pin. Just make sure that the pins you use are in good shape and that any colored portions of the pin coordinate with the color scheme of your overall bouquet.







, Take a short dowel rod or popsicle stick and carefully insert it into the rolled up center of the onesie flower bud.


Slide the stick to the approximate halfway point of the inside flower bud. The exact stopping point does not matter, but the stick should be far enough into the roll to keep it in place but not so far that you can see it sticking out through the top of the roll.

, Use this same technique to roll up as many onesie flowers as you need for your bouquet.


If desired, you can mix and match onesie sizes to create various sizes of flowers. For a more uniform bouquet, though, stick to one size for all your flowers.

, Lay a square receiving blanket upside-down on a flat surface. Fold it diagonally in half, bringing one corner up to meet the opposite corner.


Note that the right side of the blanket should face out once you make the fold.
If the blanket is not a perfect square, you will not be able to create a perfect triangle. Should this happen, simply fold in the excess strip of material left behind after you make your triangle fold. Do not fold it back and behind the blanket. Folding it in toward you is best because doing so will make it easier to eventually wrap and hide the excess material beneath the onesie flowers.
Turn the blanket after you fold it. Rotate the triangle so that the long folded edge is now on the bottom. The open point of the triangle should be at the top.

, Use a rubber band to tie the onesie flowers into a secure bundle. They should be about even in height at this point.


You could also opt for a piece of ribbon, yard, twine, or thick thread.

, Place the onesie bundle on top of the receiving blanket so that the bottom of the stems stop just short of the bottom fold of the blanket. Bring the two side corners up and over the stems, tightly tucking them beneath the stems on the opposite sides.


Essentially, you are wrapping the two bottom corners of the blanket triangle around the stems, similar to the way you might tuck the corners of a blanket around a newborn baby.
This hides the stems and creates a cute wrapping around the bouquet, like the paper wrappings around a bouquet of real flowers.

, If some of the back flowers are hidden behind some of the front, carefully wiggle the back flowers up a little higher so that they are easier to spot from the front of the bouquet.


Never push any of the flowers further down, however, since doing so might cause the stems to poke out from the bottom of the bouquet.

, Use a coordinating satin ribbon and tie it around the blanket wrapping once. Finish the whole thing off by tying a bow with the same piece of ribbon.

, With the flowers neatly arranged into your desired pattern, tie the stems together with a rubber band or thick yarn.


You may also try using hot glue or tape to hold the stems together if the ties are not sufficient.






Usually, five to eight onesie flowers should be enough.

, Find or make small ribbon flowers. Look for empty spaces in between your onesie flowers, and carefully insert these ribbon flowers into the majority of those spaces.


If the ribbon flowers threaten to fall out, dot the bottom tip of the stems with hot glue before inserting the flowers back into the bouquet. Make sure that the stems of the ribbon flowers touch the stems of the onesie flowers so that the glue actually has something to stick to.

, Use large fake leaves that are at least as tall as the onesie flowers, if not larger. Arrange them around the flower portion of the bouquet so that they frame the onesie flowers and mask the sides of the bouquet.


Glue the leaves to the flower stems. Avoid gluing them to the onesies since removing the glue from the onesies later can prove difficult.

, Select a pretty satin ribbon that matches the color scheme of your bouquet. Apply a dab of hot glue to one end and stick this end to the bottom of your bouquet stems. Gradually wind the length of the ribbon around the bouquet handle, completely cover the stems in the process. Secure the ribbon with another dot of hot glue just below the bottom of the onesie flowers.


For an even better final result, use the same ribbon and tie a bow around the top of the handle after you finish wrapping it.

, Fold one to four. These will line your vase, hiding the flower ""stems"" and giving those stems something to stick into. The exact number you need will vary depending on how large your vase is.


A standard bouquet vase will need about two blankets. A short basket or box may only need one blanket. A large vase might need three to four.
To fold each blanket:

Lay the blanket face down on your working surface.
Fold the blanket in half, bringing the bottom to the top. Note that the right side of the blanket should now be facing you.
Fold the blanket in half in the same manner to create a thick strip, then once more to create a skinnier strip.
Fold the blanket in half from side to side.



, Use one folded receiving blanket to line the sides of the vase. If there is excess material, bring it into the inside of the container and either continue wrapping it around the perimeter or bunch it up in the center.


After lining the vase with your first blanket, step back and take a look. If both the sides and bottom are covered, you can stop here.
On the other hand, if the sides are covered but the bottom is not, take a second folded blanket and arrange it in the bottom of the basket. You can wind the blanket around or fold it accordion-style to create ridges along the bottom of the vase. Either way, you should have enough bunched up fabric to help hold the flower ""stems"" in place.
If you vase is somewhat tall, you might need to stack a second receiving blanket on top of the first so that the sides are completely covered.

, Place the baby onesie flowers in the vase. Stick the wooden stems into the layered blanket folds at the bottom of the container, wedging them in to prevent them from falling or moving around.


Note that your first few flowers will likely feel a little loose, even if they are secure inside the blanket layer. As you fill your bouquet with more onesie flowers and additional accents, though, they should start to feel steadier.

, The bouquet can consist of nothing but onesie flowers, but if you want to give your creation a little more pizazz, slide a few fake flowers and fake greenery in between the onesies. Arrange them according to your own sense of taste.


You could also consider tying a ribbon around the base of the vase or the handle of the basket.

Tie four strands of twine to a wire floral wreath.,
Take apart your plants.,
Start securing the fern fronds to the wire wreath.,
Continue securing the ferns to the wire wreath.,
Fill in the gaps with the largest flowers.,
Add in some small and medium sized flowers.,
Clean it up.",How to Make a Hanging Flower Chandelier1," Cut four equal strands of twine, about 33 inches (83.82 centimeters) long. Tie them together into a secure, double-knot, then tie the remaining ends to top, curved part of wreath.It's best to tie the string to the horizontal bars. This way, they won't slide around as much.
You can also use fishing line instead.;
, Pull the leaves off of a silk fern so that you have individual branches. Next, get some silk flowers in a variety of sizes, and pull the blooms off of the stems. Consider pulling the green leaves off of the stems as well; you can use these to fill in any gaps.

If you can't pull the leaves or blooms off, you can cut them using wire cutters or a sharp pair of scissors.
Ranunculus and zinnias are great choices!You can also use eucalyptus instead of ferns. Pull apart the branches, but keep the leaves attached., Place your first fern frond on top of the wire wreath.Bend it so that it follows the curve of the wreath. Secure it to the wreath with 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) pieces of green floral wire., Place the next front just behind it, so that the tip overlaps the base of the first one. Secure the second frond with more wire. Keep securing fronds to your wire frame until the entire frame is covered. Don't worry if there are gaps.

Be sure to cover the bottom of the wreath as well. You don't have to go full-out--just enough to hide the wires., Take some of your largest blooms, and secure them to the wreath using hot glue. Try to glue them directly to the wire wreath so that they are nestled between the fern fronds., Alternate using different types, colors, and sizes.Try to group your flowers together in odd numbers. This will create a more balanced and aesthetically-pleasing look., Carefully go over your wreath. Fill in any remaining gaps with silk leaves, greenery, and tiny ""filler"" plants, such as baby's breath. Pull or snip off any threads or whiskers left behind by the hot glue."

Try to use satin ribbon, if you can.Sheer ribbon will give you a nice, delicate look, however., Gather the two ribbons together. Fold them in half and make sure that the ends match up. Slip the folded part through a D ring. Pull all four loose ends of the ribbon up through the loop. Gently tug down on the loose ends to tighten the knot., Make a mark using a pen, marker, or a sewing pin. You only need to mark one side of each ribbon. These marks will tell you where to glue the embroidery hoop., Discard the outer ring and save the inner ring. Divide the inner ring into quarters. Mark off each quarter with a pen. These marks will tell you where to put the ribbon.Make the marks on the inside of the ring.

, Take a hot glue gun, and draw a line of hot glue along one of the marks on the embroidery hoop. Quickly press one of the ribbons into the glue. Make sure that the mark on the ribbon lines up with the top edge of the hoop.Repeat this step for the other ribbons. Wok one ribbon at a time, or the glue will set too fast.

, Pull one of the ribbon ends over the bottom edge of the hoop. Bring it to the right side of the right side of the ribbon. Pull it down, them wrap it under the bottom edge of the hoop. This time, pull it to the left side of the ribbon.Secure the ribbon with hot glue before each wrap.
Repeat this step for the other three ribbons.

, Choose some pretty real or silk flowers, and cut them down until they are a few inches long. Use clean gardening shears for real flowers, and wire cutters for silk ones.

Choose flowers with thicker stems, such as roses, ranunculus, and zinnias.
If your flowers have leaves on them, it might be a good idea to trim them off.

, Wrap the end of each ribbon around each flower stem, and tie it into a tight knot. Try to tie the ribbon just above a ""knob"" or ""knot"" on the flower stem, so that when the flowers hang upside down, they won't slide off., Cut several more pieces of ribbon. They can be the same length as the ones dangling from the embroidery hoop, or different lengths. Attach them to the hoop with hot glue, then wrap them around the hoop twice for extra security. Trim down some more flowers, and tie them to the ribbons.The ribbons can all be the same, or they can be different.
It might be a good idea to hang the chandelier up while you are working. This way, if one side is too heavy, you will be able to fix it.

, Hang the chandelier up. It's okay if the flowers and ribbons are different lengths, but the embroidery hoop should be level. If it is hanging crooked, one side is too heavy. Switch out the flower for a lighter/heavier or, or trim down the stem to make it lighter., Measure around the embroidery hoop and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Cut a piece of lace trim according to that measurement. Glue it around the outer edge of the hoop. Overlap the ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and secure them with more hot glue.Hot glue sets fast, so work only 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time.
White or ivory lace would work well for this.

Choose/prepare your clay pot.,
Select your tile.,
Create your mosaic tile.,
Prepare the mortar in order to adhere the tile to the flower pot.,
Create your mosaic design by spreading a thin layer of mortar on the back of each tile piece and affixing the piece to the flower pot.,
Make the grout once the mortar is completely set.,
Allow 2 hours to completely dry before flower pot can be use.

",How to Make a Mosaic Flower Pot," Identify the pot you’d like to use and make sure its cleaned and ready to receive the glass tiles.


Wash the inside and outside of the pot using warm water and soap. Use a clean washrag to scrub the pot (even if you purchase a new pot) and then rinse with warm water.






Allow the pot to dry in the sun before adding tiles. You’ll want to make sure all the moisture is gone so that your tiles adhere to the pot.





;
, Tile selection is extremely important as it will create the look and feel of your mosaic clay pot.


Choose tile that is sturdy but can be broken down into smaller pieces. You may want to browse a variety of tile at the local hardware or tile store for the best selection.






Consider accent pieces for your project. Don’t go with just one or two colored tiles but instead look for a variety of colors and textures to add interest to your piece. Consider adding a bright splash of color or sparkle (such as purchasing a glittery bronzed tile) in the middle of your pot for that extra “pop.”
Ask if tile can be broken down when in doubt. If you are unsure if you can break tile down into smaller pieces ask an employee if anyone has used that particular tile to create mosaic artwork. Not all tile works well in a mosaic so ask an expert if you are unsure.
Visualize how the particular tile will work on the pot. You may want to draw a map or design sketch before you break the tile so you know how you’d like the flower pot to look in the end.

, You will need work gloves, protective eyewear, a small hammer, a clear workspace and a heavy cloth or towel.


Lay tile on a flat surface and place towel or heavy cloth over the tile. This way you will have something to keep tile in one area when you break it.
Gently tap the tile with your hammer until you feel pieces breaking. Don’t smash the tile as it may disintegrate.
Remove tile to reveal what you’ve broken. Use a nipper to re-shape pieces if necessary or to complete the breaking process (for tile that may not have broken all the way).

, You’ll want to pick up polymer-fortified, thin-set mortar for best results.


Add water to mortar powder until it becomes the same consistency as peanut butter. Mix constantly so that the powder is fully integrated into the mixture.
Use mortar immediately so that it does not dry or change consistency over time. Only prepare the mortar when you are ready to create your mosaic design.

, Refer to your map or sketch if you created one before you started the project.


Press the piece of tile firmly against the flower pot and hold for several seconds or until you know it has adhered to the pot.
Leave ¼ inch space between pieces of tile to make room for the grout. Go back and re-size tile if pieces are too large or are not fitting properly.
Add any other design elements such as stones or beads to generate additional interest. You don’t have to add other elements but if do, now is the time to integrate them into your design.
Complete the design and then allow the pot to set and dry overnight. The mortar will need up to 24 hours to fully set and dry so leave the pot in a cool, dry area until its fully set.

, If you’d like to add interest to the grey grout, mix with acrylic paint to create colored grout. You’ll need your work gloves for this project as you’ll be placing the grout on your pot with your hands.


Combine water to the grout to create a mixture of peanut butter consistency. You’ll want the general same type of consistency you achieved with the mortar.
Scoop a handful of grout and slather it all over the pot. Be sure you take care to fill in every section between the tiles.
Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe excess grout from the pot, taking extra care to remove grout that was smoothed over tile/stones.
Take a thin wire brush and brush over the entire pot when you’ve finished grouting to ensure all excess grout falls off the tiles. Go over the pot with a clean cloth to remove brush marks.

Maintain the flowers.",How to Make a Mixed Flowers Bouquet," Before you get started, have a plan for your bouquet that suits how you intend to use it. If you're making bouquets for an event, make sure they match the event's mood, and the expected season or color scheme for holiday celebrations.


Also know where the bouquet will be placed, so you know which perspective people will see it from. A banquet centerpiece needs to be beautiful from all angles. A bouquet standing on a tall column needs to draw attention from below.;
, There are two main approaches to a color scheme. For a blended look, use flower colors next to each other on the color wheel, such as lavender and purple dahlia. For a bolder bouquet, choose complementary colors or flowers with a major contrast, such as dark red Barcelona roses and white baby's breath.


Consider how vivid the colors are as well. A bright, vivid flower will drown out pastels, so it's best not to mix them together.

, Unless you're making a bouquet of very small flowers, aim for a variety of heights and flower sizes. A small bouquet can use one large flower with three smaller ones. Expand this to a similar ratio for a larger bouquet, or divide it into three layers with large, medium, and smaller flowers.

, Working with odd numbers of flowers tends to be more visually appealing. Pick an odd number of flowers for each variety in your bouquet.

, This can help you get an idea for what you want to achieve before you start cutting flowers and discover you change your mind. If you need more guidance, the instructions below include additional advice on putting together a pleasing bouquet.

, Clip these off before assembling the bouquet. If the flower stem has thorns, strip them off with a knife.

, Some species of flower will get air bubbles in the stem if cut above water, which prevents them from drawing up nutrients. Cut your stems underwater and at an angle, using a clean knife. Remember to cut your stems at different heights, giving longer stems to the flowers that will be at the peak of the bouquet.

, Generally, a mixed flower bouquet has a pyramidal shape. Place one large flower at the top, then space them out evenly in two or three layers below. Fill in the gaps between with your other flowers in the same way, so the mix of flowers are distributed throughout the bouquet.


Make the overall shape symmetrical, and avoid glaring imbalances of color.

, These are usually sprays of small flowers, such as baby's breath, but you can use small ferns, ivy, hosta foliage, or any other small plant. Use these if you'd like to add a little green throughout your bouquet and soften the presentation. If you like, leave a few sprays hanging down over the edge of the bouquet.


For more dramatic effect, you can add large, protruding ferns or other foliage at the back of the bouquet.
As a rule of thumb, have about 30% of your arrangement by leaves or greenery. This includes the leaves of the main flowers.

, Floral foil or florist tape is the easiest way to do this. If you like, add a decorative ribbon as well.

, The arrangement should take up about ⅔ the space in the vase. To help the flowers last longer, pour a little colorless soda into the water, or use flower food sold at florists for this purpose.


The choice of vase can complement the arrangement. You could use ginger jars for a high society function, or antique milk bottles to decorate a rustic home.

, Change the water every couple days to keep it fresh. If a flower starts to droop, trim the stem again under the water surface to give them a fresh opening to drink from.

Prepare the flowers.,



 

Cut the flowers.,





Arrange the flowers.",How to Make a Floral Centrepiece," There are no right or wrongs in the flowers you choose to use. Be sure that the stems are clean, pliable, fresh, and smooth. You may want to just go out and buy or pick the flowers directly before beginning to construct the centerpiece.
, From the end of the stem to the tip of the flower, measure it at 70 centimeters (27.6 in). Snip the extra stem off at an angle. This is to ensure the flower gets the maximum water absorption. You may also wish to mix some plant food (available at stores where you buy flowers) in with the water, when you do put the flowers in it. You don't have to cut the stems all equally. Take your time to decide how you want them to look. Then decide from that what length(s) you would like to cut your stems., Gently bend the flowers into the fish bowl with the stem at the bottom. Curve the stem around the fish bowl while being very careful not to break the stem. Ensure that there are no big gaps. Continue until all ten blooms are in and arrange them in a sweeping fashion. The effect will be a beautiful centerpiece: vine-like curves with flowers interwoven. You do not have to use a fish bowl to make the centerpiece. A simple vase will do. Just put the flowers into the vase, and start arranging them in different ways until you get the look that you want."

Buy fresh flowers.,
Obtain floral wire.,
Make the base of the wreath.,
Make bundles of flowers.,
Place the bundles around the wreath.,
Attach the bundles.,
Add extra embellishments.",How to Make a Flower Wreath1," You will need to buy flowers right before you plan on making a wreath. If you buy flowers too long before making a wreath, there is a chance they will wither and die. You can buy flowers from your local supermarket or florist. Some flowers you can choose from are roses, poppies, carnations, chrysanthemums, lilies, and orchids.You can combine several flowers to make a more visually interesting wreath. Choose flowers with colors that complement each other. For example, yellow tulips pair well with verbena or lavender. You can also choose flowers of different sizes and shapes, like bundles of baby’s-breath with roses.;
, You can buy floral wire at a craft store, like Michaels or Hobby Lobby. The wire will hold more flowers the thicker it is. A 18-gauge is the minimum you should buy. It will support heavy buds, like roses. 22-26-Gauge is an all purpose wire that will support whatever type of flowers you are using.Thinner wire is more malleable and a better choice for an intricate setting.
You can choose between green stub, paper covered, and enameled wire.

, Double a length of floral wire. Wrap the ends around what you want to be the top of your wreath form, twining the ends back around the wire to secure it. It should create a circular shape. Twine the ends to form a loop. You'll use the loop at the top for hanging the wreath.Size your wreath to take up about half the width of the door or wall you intend to hang it on.
Make sure the hanging loop sticks up from the back of the wreath where it'll be less visible, instead of the front.

, Create small bundles of flowers by wrapping the stems with flexible wire attached to a floral pick (a small wooden stake). You can also bundle flower stems together with floral wire. The upper limit for your bundle size is the width of the wreath form. How small you make your bundles, and how you shape them, depends to a large degree on your wreath size and the textures and size of your materials.Group together several types of flowers in a bundle to create variety in the wreath.

, Lay your floral bundles out on the wreath form so you get a general idea of the proper positioning. Do not use any glue or form of attachment yet. Now is the time to make any major design changes or tweaks. Leave a few flowers or bundles out just in case you want to go back and fill in space.It’s okay if you don’t remember exactly where the bundles went or they move slightly. You just want to get a general idea of how you want to design the wreath.

, Attach your floral bundles to the homemade flower wreath using hot or white glue. Apply glue to the foam wreath form, then press the floral bundles into place. Work ""backwards"" around the wreath, laying each new bundle of flowers over the exposed stems of the previous bunch, with each bunch overlapping by about half.If you're creating a wide wreath work from the outside in, filling in the entire width of the wreath from outside to center before you move further around the ring.
You must leave the wreath flat until the glue is completely dry.

, If you would like to add extra embellishment to the wreath, add decoration embellishments using the same techniques using glue, pins, or floral picks. You can add berries, leaves, fern, and bows. Consider the type of wreath you are making when adding decorations.Pastel bows work well with an Easter wreath.
Red berries look great with Christmas wreaths.
Only use glue to attach the flowers/stems/greenery directly to the wreath form. If none of your wreath form still shows and you still want to add embellishments, you'll need to use floral picks or pins.

"
"
Buy a foam base.,
Soak the foam in water.,
Attach the flowers.,
Fill in the wreath.",How to Make a Flower Wreath2," Keep fresh flower wreaths fresher longer by using a foam base and soaking it in water. You can buy a foam base from a craft store, like Hobby Lobby, depending on your location. Choose a foam base that is about the size you would like your wreath to be.Keep in mind that the wreath will appear larger once the flowers are on it.

, Fill a basin, like your kitchen sink, with water. The basin should be at least the same thickness as the foam base you are using. About a gallon of water should be enough. Place the base in the water. The base will start to sink as it fills with water. Allow it to sit in the water for one or two minutes. Then, take the foam base out of the water, allow the excess water to fall off, and pat it gently with a towel. If using the kitchen sink as your basis, make sure to clean it thoroughly with soap and water first.

, Put the stems into the foam base while it is still wet. You will need to stick the stems of the flowers into the foam base so they will soak up water. You can either stick the individual flowers directly in the foam, or wire them first. Wiring them first will make for a tighter hold. To wire them, wrap floral wire around a bundle of stems. Then, put the stems into the foam.It may take some effort to insert the flowers into the foam. Don’t use too much force, or you could break the foam.

, Continue attaching flowers until the wreath is mostly filled. There is no correct design. Fill it in however pleases the eye. You can plan it beforehand before you attach them if you have a specific idea. Tuck in extra flowers, leaves, or other embellishments to complete the wreath.You can use pins or glue to secure flowers if you are having trouble making them stay in position.
Spritz with water daily to keep the flowers alive longer, or allow them to dry naturally.

Buy artificial flowers.,
Buy a foam base.,
Wire the flowers if necessary.,
Arrange the flowers.,
Attach the flowers.,
Attach a hanger.",How to Make a Flower Wreath3," Artificial flower wreaths last much longer than fresh flower leaves. You can keep artificial wreaths for several years if you take care of them properly. Artificial flowers can be bought at most craft stores. There are several types of artificial flowers to choose form. You can buy silk, fabric, wax, latex, and foam flowers.If you don’t want to use artificial flowers, you can also buy preserved flowers. They can last as long as artificial flowers if taken care of properly.

, You can purchase a ready-to-use foam base from a craft store. Choose one that looks close to the size you desire the wreathe to be. Remember, that is will appear a bit larger once the wreath is completed.Measure the base or look for the dimensions on the price sticker while still in the store to make sure it is the size you are looking for.

, If you are using artificial flowers without stems, you can make stems with floral tape and wire. Add a piece of flower wire to the bottom of the flower and attach it with tape. Tape the entire length of the wire to create a stem.You can multiply how many flowers you have by taking apart an artificial bouquet and creating stems for each flower.
It is easier to buy artificial flowers that already have stems attached.

, Place single flower heads or bundles of flowers around the wreath to form the design. Check that you find it pleasing before attaching the flowers permanently. You can remove the design completely before attaching, or keep the design in place as you begin attaching them to the base.If attaching single flowers, go through one type of flower at a time. For example, attach all of the roses first. Then, move on to the lilies.

, You can insert the flower stems directly into the foam base. Or, you can glue the flowers to the base. Use hot or white glue to attach the flowers all the way around the wreath. Floral pins can also help to keep flowers in place. Hot glue works better than white glue for a longer lasting attachment. , You can make your own hanger by cutting off the top of a wire clothes hanger, gluing it on the back of the wreath, and hanging it on a nail. You can also purchase wreath hangers from a florist or craft store. Hang the wreath on the door, wall, or wherever it will appear decorative for the occasion.You can buy hangers in plastic, wire, and as suction cups."

The foam should fit tightly in the container. If there is too much water, you may empty a small amount out., You are now ready to add the greens you intend to arrange. You can decide how long or how short but it's nice to green a container with the edging longer. You do not have to cover all the foam, just enough that when flowers are in place you will not see the foam after., Make it tall, about 1 1/2 inches in length taller than your container. When working with flowers, always work in odd numbers, so that your center flower is one. Then choose odd amounts of the same flower. Usually do five for this flower., That gives you four. (Cut flowers to length you want piece to hang over.) The fifth flower should be cut a bit shorter than center one, then place in foam next to it., Fill in using space one; do not worry about leaving gaps. You can always fill those in later. You want the flowers to have spaces. Work your way around piece all sides. Do not worry about the piece being all the same all around.

Place flowers at angles. Use bright small flowers for filler.

, Here are a few options:

Add small pieces of gypsophila (babies' breath ) and fill in sections.
Or, make loops out of ribbon (floral wire the ribbon loops to a wood pic). Place those in between.
Some florists use greens (tree fern). Whatever you choose is alright. However, putting in too much of everything is odd.

, If not, you may add more water to the container. Check the container every few days to see if it needs more water. Some flowers, like hydrangeas, require a lot of water. Keep checking your arrangement––as long as the flowers are alive, they need water."

Glaze the object.",How to Apply Gold Leaf," If you don’t want to gild your entire object, use painter’s tape to cover the parts you want ungilded. This will keep the sizer and gold leaf in the areas where you want them. Because the tape adhesive isn’t very strong, you can remove the tape easily without damaging anything.;
, Use a piece of sand paper to go over the areas that don’t have any painter’s tape. Continue sanding until the surface is smooth. Use a tack cloth to remove the dust you created by sanding.

, Use a primer that's formulated especially for gilding. Gilder’s primer works with gilding sizer to form a tacky surface that will permanently hold gold leaf. It’s also pigmented to hide any flaws that might remain visible after the leaf is applied. If you use regular primer, you will have to apply a base layer of pigmented paint called a bole before applying the primer.

, Wait at least 30 minutes until the sizer has dried to a clear finish.At this point, the sizer will still feel tacky (fairly dry but sticky to the touch). It will then remain tacky for several more hours, giving you time to apply the gold leaf.


An alternative way of testing for tackiness is to glide your knuckle down the surface of the object. If you can hear a squeak, it’s ready for the gold leaf.
While the sizer is drying, clean the gilding cushion.

, A gilding cushion is used in the process of cutting the gold leaf. It consists of leather stretched over a wooden block. The leather provides a smooth surface that won’t tear the leaf.

, Scoop out a small amount with the gilding knife. This should be enough to cover about the first inch (25.4mm) of the blade. Slowly bring the knife to the gilding cushion.

, Spread the powder over the surface of the cushion using the long edge of the blade. Lightly distribute the powder across the surface of the cushion by moving the blade back and forth. Continue doing this until the powder covers the entire surface. This will absorb any remaining grease that would make the leaf stick to the cushion.

, Using the flat side of the blade, scrape the remaining powder on to the cushion. Gently brush away and leftover powder from the cushion. Thoroughly wipe the blade with a cloth to remove any lingering pumice particles., This will make it easier to apply. Lay the leaf flat on the gilding cushion. The matte side with the backing should be face-up. Gently apply pressure with the blade of the knife to begin cutting. You should do this while you’re waiting for the sizer to dry.

, Do this while the leaf is still laying flat on the cushion. A common way to do this is to carefully insert the knife between the leaf and the backing. Keep the tissue paper backing for burnishing the leaf in the application process. Alternatively, you can:


Lay the leaf and backing on the surface of the object. The backing side should face you.
Burnish the leaf with a brush or your fingers.
Carefully pull the paper backing away.
Blow on the gold leaf. This will encourage it to lay flat enough to work with.

, It will only stick to the tacky areas of the surface. If your sheets of leaf don’t cover the entire width of the surface, you can arrange the pieces in a simple grid pattern.Don’t worry if areas seem to overlap. You can remove those later.

, Lay the tissue paper backing on top of the leaf. Use your index finger to gently burnish the leaf and remove any air pockets. Keep the paper still to avoid tearing or scratching the leaf.

, Use a soft gilder's brush to make the leaf adhere to the object completely and smoothly. Move in a gentle back-and forth motion. The movement of the brush will remove the excess pieces of leaf. The object should look as if it’s made of gold rather than covered in gold leaf.

, This includes holes or other places where the gold leaf didn't adhere. Apply small bits of leaf to cover them. Smooth and brush the new bits before moving to the final step.

, Apply an acrylic topcoat. The topcoat will protect the leaf from damage due to handling, dust, water and ultraviolet light. Allow the seal to dry for five hours.The top coat isn’t necessary if you’re gilding perishable items like food., This optional step will give the surface an antique look. Using a dry paintbrush, apply the glaze. Move in straight lines, going back and forth as you progress across the surface. Wipe off excess glaze with a soft dust cloth.

Wear the appropriate safety gear.,
Fill a container with warm, moist coffee grounds.,
Heat the steel using a lighter.,
Bury the steel in the coffee grounds.,
Repeat as needed.,
Polish as desired.",How to Antique Stainless Steel1," At minimum, you should wear safety goggles and heat-resistant, fire-resistant gloves.


Also note that you will need to handle the stainless steel object with another device, like tongs or a vice. Everything you use should be both fire-resistant and heat-resistant to prevent accidental burns.;
, You'll need to prepare enough coffee grounds to cover all sides of the stainless steel object you wish to antique.


If you've recently made a pot of coffee, you can use the spent grounds from that. Otherwise, pour enough warm to hot water over a fresh batch of grounds and give the grounds a few minutes to absorb the moisture
For small, narrow objects like screws, you can fill a small cup with your prepared grounds. For larger objects, coat the bottom of a shallow tray with the grounds, instead.

, Hold the metal object with tongs or a vice, then pass the flame of a lighter over the entire length of the object, heating it thoroughly.


Continue rotating and passing the flame over the stainless steel object until the metal begins to darken in color.
For larger objects or a more controlled flame, consider using a propane tank with a lighter attachment instead of a handheld lighter.
The stainless steel will reach temperatures just beneath 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), so you need to work very carefully to prevent accidental burns.

, As soon as the steel object darkens, quickly dip the heated portion into the prepared coffee grounds. Hold it in the grounds for 15 to 30 seconds.


The water in the coffee grounds should quickly cool off the metal. Theoretically, the steel should be safe to touch once you remove it from the grounds, but you should still proceed with caution.
In addition to cooling off the metal, the coffee should dye the stainless steel, giving it the appearance of antiqued metal.

, If you want to dye the steel even darker, reheat it and submerge it into the coffee grounds again.


You should be able repeat the process several times without damaging the metal.
If you only want to dye one side or area darker, focus the heat on that area and only apply the coffee grounds to that spot.

, When you're satisfied with the results, you can quickly polish the steel object by vigorously rubbing it with a soft cloth.


Wait until the object is cool enough to touch before polishing it.
Polishing the piece should buff away coffee granules and some of the dark dye. It should also make the steel a little shinier.
After you dye and polish the piece to your liking, the project is complete. The results should last indefinitely.

Wait for the coat of paint to dry.,
Sand the edges.",How to Age Metal1," Most often you will find galvanized metal, which has a steel coating over it to protect it from rust. This process is ideal for props or furniture, where you want to create an artistic antique finish.;
, Use a sanding pad or sander for larger pieces of metal. Sanding will remove the shine on a finish. Rub the metal object until the surface loses the shine and slickness. Wipe away any dust left behind from the sanding.


Wipe down the metal with mineral spirits or vinegar to clean the surface. Having a clean surface will assure the paint can stick to the surface and last longer., Dip your sponge brush in water to soften the bristles.


Be sure to paint only in a well-ventilated area.

, Begin with the cracks and crevices of the object, and then continue all around it. Black should cover the piece, but have some variation to mimic the aging process.

, You will need to allow the paint to dry completely before applying the next layer. Find an out of the way area to store your metal overnight. Wash your brush while the paint is still wet to remove it more easily.

, If you want a galvanized look, buy a matte gunmetal grey and burnt umber paint color. If you want a bronzed look, buy matte acrylic burnt and raw umber paints.


Don't feel like you have to layer your paints. You can try sponging some gunmetal grey to create and aged galvanized metal look. Then decide how much, if any, umber to add.If you want a bronzed look, you will mix your raw and burnt umbers to create a warm bronze color.

, Pour your selected paint color onto your palette. Your paint color will vary depending upon the finish you want to achieve.

, You want to create the look of an uneven patina. For instance, you could make it grayer or bronze around the edges or divots.


If you are aiming for a galvanized look, you can an additional light layer of umber paint.

, Leave the metal in a well-ventilated, out of the way location for the next 24 hours.

, Take a look at your aged metal and decide if it needs a few finishing touches. If you want to create further aging or variations, go over the desire areas with the sandpaper one last time. Wipe the dust away and your aged metal piece is ready to display.

Spray the object with window cleaner.,
Cover the object with the patina mixture.,
Cover the object.,
Reapply the aging compound.,
Continue reapplying as desired.,
Clean the object with a clean cloth.",How to Age Copper," For the aging process to be effective, the copper must be free of oils and other surface contaminants, meaning that you'll need to take a little bit of time to clean up the object before you attempt to age it. Be sure to clean the entire surface, including small crevices for the best effect.;
, To quickly oxidize your copper, the best mixture involves one cup (.24 liter) of plain white vinegar, 3/4 cup (.18 liter) of household ammonia, and 1/4 cup (.19 liter) of table salt. Mix the ingredients into a spray bottle for easy application, and shake it up to mix the ingredients thoroughly.


For the best effects, non-iodized table salt would be more desirable. Whatever kind of salt you use, try to dissolve it as much as possible to avoid scratching up your copper.
Some aging compound recipes also like to add a 1/4 cup (.19 liter) of lemon juice to the mixture. If you have lemon juice, use equal parts of all the ingredients listed above., After dusting the object thoroughly, clean it up with some commercial window cleaner, preferably one with an ammonia base. After giving it a light coat, wipe it down with the same cloth, buffing out as much of the dust and grime as possible.


Spray the copper lightly with the window cleaner again, but do not wipe it off this time. This serves to break the invisible surface tension so that the aging compound makes solid contact with the metal itself.

, Once you've cleaned up your copper piece and sprayed it with the window cleaner, apply the aging compound, covering the object completed. Make sure to get into even the smallest spaces, creating an even coat.


Don't over-do it. It's not necessary to soak the piece, so it's dripping all over the place. Just use enough to wet it in an even coat.

, To create humidity, it's usually recommended that you place the copper object into a plastic bag, or tent it under a piece of plastic to create an artificial environment while the aging compound works. Allow the piece to sit undisturbed for about an hour.


If you live in an area with high humidity, or if you apply the mixture during a rainstorm, you do not need the plastic's artificial environment. In general, it's an advantage to try to age copper at the wettest or most humid point in the year, to give yourself the best natural benefit in the environment.

, Remove the item from the plastic and apply the patina mix again, once more making certain that you have covered the entire metallic surface. Return it to the humidifying bag or tent, and allow it to rest overnight.

, The amount of coloring you want on your copper piece will be up to you. Remove the piece from the bag each morning and examine it thoroughly, then add more aging compound if necessary and repeat the process if you want to get more color on the piece.


In general, you probably won't want to age a piece using this method for too long, especially if you live in a humid climate. Remember that the copper will age naturally with time, as well, so you don't have to do too much to get the effect you want on an object you'll have for a long time.

, After you've achieved the age coloring you like, spritz a clean cloth with a small amount of window cleaner and wipe it down to get any of the remnants of the aging compound off, and return the copper to it's place.

Clean the steel a second time with isopropyl alcohol.








",How to Acid Etch Steel1," You can etch stainless steel, mild steel, or high-carbon steel. Which type of steel you etch will determine the best acid or chemical to use to etch it with.






;
, File away any burrs on the side of the steel you plan to etch with acid. You can leave the burrs on the other side if you're etching a steel plate.








, Use a chlorine cleanser on an abrasive sponge, a wire brush, fine steel wool, wet number 600 emery paper, or corundum paper, scrubbing in a circular motion. You want to leave the surface just gritty enough to grip the resist material, but not so scratched that you end up etching extra lines that aren't part of your design.








, The water should sheet off the steel surface.

"
Scuff the steel.,
Place the piece in a larger container.,
Cover with vinegar.,
Allow it to sit overnight.,
Repeat as desired.",How to Antique Stainless Steel2," Use sandpaper or steel wool to scuff the sides of the stainless steel object.


Scuffing the steel will create a more age-worn appearance. It also removes some of the protective coating, allowing more of the vinegar to penetrate and work its way through the metal.
Steel wool pads will usually create deeper scratches, so if you want to create more subtle wear, use sandpaper instead. Choose a medium to heavy grit sandpaper for best results.

, Place the prepared steel item in a plastic bucket or in another similar container made of non-reactive material.


All sides you wish to antique should be exposed. If one side is covered or hidden against the side of the container, the vinegar may not work as effectively there.

, Pour vinegar into the container, covering all sides of the stainless steel piece.


You may want to wear safety goggles and safety gloves when handling vinegar. Even though vinegar is a mild acid, it could sting if it splashes into your eyes. Vinegar can also be a mild irritant if you have sensitive skin or if your skin is submerged for prolonged periods.
Every side touching the vinegar will be affected. Any type of vinegar should work for this project, but white distilled vinegar is recommended since it is fairly cheap and easy to come by.
If the steel piece starts to float, hold it down by placing stones or dry beans on top of it. Make sure that the vinegar still has access to the piece, however.

, Keep the steel piece submerged in the vinegar for at least eight hours.


The piece should look subtly aged and worn as soon as you remove it.
When you remove the piece, rinse the vinegar away with clean water and dry it with clean towels.

, If the antiqued appearance isn't as notable as you would prefer, soak the stainless steel for a longer period of time.


Stainless steel comes in different grades, so this may not be effective on all steel pieces. High-grade stainless steel is more likely to resist corrosion than low-grade stainless steel.
If the vinegar doesn't produce results, you could try using a more corrosive chemical. Toilet bowl cleaner generally works well.Bleach, denture cleaner, and silver dip may also yield results.When using harsher chemicals, always wear safety goggles and rubber gloves.
Never mix chemicals, either, since doing so can produce dangerous fumes. Thoroughly rinse and dry the piece before attempting to use a different chemical.


Once you are satisfied with the appearance, the project is complete. These results should be permanent.

Prepare your supplies.,
Brush on the first coat.,
Sponge away some of the paint.,
Alternate as needed.,
Let dry.,
Carefully consider additional coats of paint.",How to Antique Stainless Steel3," You'll need metallic acrylic craft paint, an art paintbrush, and a wet sponge.


Look for a deep gray metallic paint. One labeled as ""gunmetal gray"" will usually be a good choice.
Depending on the look you want to create, you may also want to use a copper metallic paint. The copper paint is only optional, though.
It's also a good idea to have a supply of water ready since you may need to rinse the sponge periodically throughout the process. Consider standing next to a sink. Alternatively, keep a bucket of clean water nearby during the process.
To prevent things from getting too messy, cover your work area with plastic sheets or newspaper. You may also want to wear an artist's smock or apron to protect your clothes.

, Dip the paintbrush in gunmetal gray paint, then apply the paint to the sides of the stainless steel object using even strokes.


Pour the paint into a disposable paint dish for easy access.
Apply the paint along the grain of the steel. Cover the entire surface you wish to antique, but do not allow the paint to dry.

, Dab at the applied paint using the wet sponge. Work your way around the surface, essentially ""messing up"" the perfect coat of paint you just applied.


Using a wet sponge instead of a dry sponge should prevent the pattern of the sponge from imprinting itself into the paint.
You need to remove some of the paint, but you shouldn't wipe all of it away. Much of the paint should still remain after you complete this step.
As you dab away at the paint, you should notice some spots where the paint smears and others where the paint develops a splattered appearance. Both effects are what you need to retain.

, Work back and forth between the previous two steps. Apply paint with your paintbrush, then dab some of the paint away with your wet sponge.


As the sponge gets loaded with paint, you may need to rinse it with clean water. After rinsing the sponge, gently wring it out before returning to the steel piece. You should work with a damp sponge, not one that is dripping wet.
Continue alternating between painting and sponging until you create a naturally worn appearance.

, Set the stainless steel piece aside and allow it to dry completely before handling it further.


Examine the dry piece. Most of the natural metal should show through beneath the coat of paint. Determine whether or not you are satisfied with these results.

, If desired, you could try adding a coat of copper metallic paint on top of the gunmetal paint. Apply this second coat with the same painting and sponging technique used for the first.


This second coat is only optional. Understand that it will cover more of the natural metal, and if you don't like the results, you will need to clean off the paint and start from the beginning. It will be impossible to salvage the first layer you applied.
Avoid adding any coat beyond the second. Adding too many layers may make it more obvious that the piece has been painted instead of naturally aged.
Once you achieve the desired appearance, the project is complete. Note that the antique effect will last for a long time unless the paint is washed away.

Find a galvanized or grey metal object.,
Sand the surface of the metal with a sander or sanding block.,
Place the metal object in an open or well-ventilated area.,
Pour an acid toilet bowl cleaner on the metal.Hold the bottle with one hand and move the metal so the liquid pours over the surface of the metal until it is completely coated.,
Allow the cleaner to sit on the object in a fairly even layer for 30 minutes.,
Rinse off the metal object.",How to Age Metal2," This is an ideal process if you want to create a white, aged or mineralized look. You may even be able to create a little bit of rust in some areas.

, Choose 80-grit sandpaper. Rub away at the surface until the shininess and slickness of the finish is gone. Wipe down the piece to clear away any debris.

, You may also want to spread a plastic sheet on the ground to protect it from exposure to the chemicals.


Wear safety glasses, gloves, and a long-sleeved shirt. Toilet bowl cleaner can be pretty strong stuff. It can ruin your clothes and irritate your skin and eyes if you come in direct contact.

,


Dip a steel wool pad in the cleaner and rub it all over the metal object.Be sure to get any handles or similar areas as well. Apply cleaner as needed until the entire surface is covered.

, You will be able to actually see the metal aging before your eyes. If you aren't happy with the results, let the metal soak a bit longer.

, You can use your rubber gloves to help wipe away the cleaner as you rinse. Be sure all of the chemicals are removed and disposed of safely. Dry the metal off before using. "

Find a metal object.,
Mix a solution of three parts apple cider vinegar with one part salt.,
Place the object in the solution for 30 minutes.,
Take the metal object out.,
Spray the object with lacquer or wax.This will seal the altered color onto the metal.",How to Age Metal3," Brass or copper metals work best. This process creates the green verdigris patina. You can find recipes that use different ingredients to create a wide range of other colors by using the same methods., Make sure the salt is non-iodized, such as sea salt.


Pour the mixed solution into a bowl if your object is small.
Place the solution in a spray bottle if you plan on using this process on a large item.
You can find many other recipes to make patinas. Chlorides will create green shades, while sulfides will create brown shades., Completely submerge the metal object. Let it sit.


You can also spray the object and set it out. Reapply the solution to the surface several times over the next 30 minutes.

, Place it on a paper towel. Allow it to sit for several hours to develop. Once it has completely developed, you can decide if you want to repeat the process to change the object further.

, Once you are satisfied with the coloring of your metal object, coat the entire surface with varnish.


Be sure the metal is completely dry. If there is still moisture on the metal when you seal it, the metal will tarnish.

Choose the right steel alloy.,
Choose a comfortable length of steel bar.,
Choose a comfortable thickness.,
Choose a well rounded bar.",How to Bend Steel With Your Hands1," Most steel bars are either hot-rolled or cold-rolled; a cold rolled bar is shinier than a hot rolled bar, but is also harder to bend. Stainless steel is even harder to bend. The stronger the steel, the more the bend will approximate a ""V"", while the weaker the steel, the more the bend will look like a ""U."";
, Most strongmen who bend steel bars prefer to work with lengths of five to seven inches (12.5 to 17.5 cm). (A common strongman feat was bending a 60-penny nail, which is 6 inches long.) The shorter the bar, the harder it is to bend, as shorter lengths give less bending leverage than longer lengths; however, some prefer a six inch (15 cm) bar to a seven inch (17.5 cm) bar because of the way the stock was formed.


You can buy steel bars in the optimal length for hand-bending from some online retailers or buy longer bars either online or from your local hardware store and cut off a piece of the desired length. To cut the steel bar, use a pair of bolt cutters, preferably about 24 inches (60 cm) long. Wear safety goggles when cutting, as short pieces can travel at high speed when cut from the larger bar stock. Grind or file off the cut end to smooth it.

, Thicker bars are harder to bend than thinner bars. Doubling the diameter quadruples the amount of force required to bend the bar; it takes four times the torque to bend a 3/8-inch (9.6 mm) bar as it does a 3/16-inch (4.8 mm) bar.

, The more sides the bar has, the easier it is to bend it. A hexagonal bar is easier to bend than a square bar, while a round bar is the easiest of all to bend.

Choose the image you want to etch into the steel.,
Transfer your design onto the steel surface.,
Cover the steel's edges.,
Choose the acid you want to etch the steel with.,
Immerse the steel in a bath of the etching acid.,
Remove and clean the steel plate.",How to Acid Etch Steel2," You can either draw a freehand image or replicate an existing image onto the steel surface. Depending on which transfer method you use, you can have a fairly simple design or a complex one.









If you plan to replicate an existing design, choose something in high-contrast black and white.
If you plan to make and sell prints of your etching, choose an image in the public domain or get the permission of the copyright holder, if there is one.

, You can transfer the design in 1 of several ways, as described below. Be aware that however you transfer your design, it will print the reverse of the way you etch it into the steel. If you plan to use the etched steel plate solely as a decoration, not to print with, this won't matter to you.









The oldest method for transferring designs is to coat the steel surface with a liquid varnish or wax-like substance (like beeswax), or even enamel paint or nail polish. This coating is called a ground. You then scratch your design into the ground using needles or wider-bladed cutting tools. (This is similar to woodcutting.) The ground will serve as a resist to keep the etching acid off the steel it covers.
Another method is to cover the steel surface with permanent markers in those places where you want the acid not to etch the steel and leave the surface exposed where you want to etch the steel. You may need to experiment with several brands and colors of permanent marker to determine which make the best resists.
A third method is to create an iron-on stencil by either photocopying an image onto transfer paper or printing it onto glossy photo paper with a laser printer. Place the paper onto the steel surface, image-side down, and using a clothes iron set to ""high,"" iron with smooth, circular strokes for 2 to 5 minutes. (Press gently if using transfer paper; press hard if using photo paper.) You can then remove the paper. (Transfer paper will peel away on its own, but photo paper requires soaking in a tray of hot water to soften it for removal.) The transferred ink becomes the resist for the etching acid.

, You can tape over the edges or paint them. Either method keeps the acid from etching the edges.








, Possible acids include muriatic (hydrochloric) acid (HCL), nitric acid (HNO3), or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Certain non-acids that form acid in water, such as ferric chloride (FeCl3) or copper sulfate (CuSO4), can also be used as etching chemicals. How strong the acid is generally determines how fast the steel will be etched, or ""bitten."" You can obtain etching acids and chemicals through chemical supply stores or electronics supply shops.









Ferric chloride is normally mixed with water in equal parts to form hydrochloric acid in solution. It's more commonly used to etch copper, but it also works well to etch stainless steel. It also works with a wider range of resist materials than pure acids do; however, it can pit the surface if not attended to properly.
Copper sulfate is better suited to etching mild steels than stainless steel. It is best mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio with sodium chloride (NaCl - common table salt) to keep the copper sulfate from coating the steel with a deposit of copper that will stop the etching process. The blue solution gradually fades as the etching progresses and turns colorless when it's finished.
Nitric acid is commonly mixed in a ratio of 1 part nitric acid to 3 parts water. It can also be mixed with acetic acid (vinegar), in a 1 to 1 ratio, or with hydrochloric acid.
Sulfuric acid should be used only in concentrations from 10 to 25 percent. Generally, dilute solutions are more effective than concentrated ones. Acids generally take longer to etch steel than do chemicals that form acids in water, however.

, Usually, you'll want to place the steel plate face-down in the solution so that the exposed metal flakes downward into the solution and away from the plate. This produces cleaner lines when etching the steel. If you put the plate in face up, you can sweep away the flakes as they form with a light brush or feather; this will also remove bubbles that form. (The bubbles impede the etching process, but they can also create interesting designs if left alone.) Leave the steel plate in the etching acid until the lines are cut to the depth you want.









Whether you put the steel plate in the etching acid face-up or face down, suspend it off the bottom of the container in some fashion. (This is particularly necessary when the plate is face down.)
Tap the container holding the chemical bath periodically to keep the solution agitated.

, Wash the plate with water to remove the acid. If you used a particularly strong acid, you may also need to use baking soda to neutralize it. You then need to remove the resist; depending on the resist material, use one of the following methods:









Use turpentine to remove paint or varnish grounds. (Use acetone if you used nail polish.)
Use alcohol, methyl hydrate, or steel wool for wax-like grounds.
Use running water for water-soluble inks and alcohol for inks insoluble in water.

",How to Remake Cool Soap," Make sure you have one or two bars of colored scented soap as well. Keep in mind that you will need to have a fragrance oil that will smell good with the soap.;
, Set a bowl underneath your grater so that it will catch the shavings. Make sure not to spill.

, The size and number of the pieces doesn't matter.

, Remember to leave enough soap for later!

, Fill the bottom part of the boiler halfway up with water.

, Then, turn your stove to high.

, As you're mixing, add as much colored soap and fragrance as you desire.


The olive oil will soften your skin.

, Beware of melting it for too long! Once you see that the soap is getting clumpy, turn the stove off.

, Firmly press it down.


A little bit of the colored soap that you added earlier should be located in the bottom of the mold. You should not have melted all the colored soap.

,, This may take a few hours. Once it has hardened, gently pop it out of the mold.


If you're giving this away as a gift, place the soap in a box (a tin box is recommended) with a label announcing what it is inside the box. Wrap it nicely.

Choose a suitable wrapping material.,
Fold or cut the wrapping material into strips.,
Coat the strips with chalk.,
Wrap each end of the bar with a strip, leaving a gap between the strips.",How to Bend Steel With Your Hands2," Before attempting to bend the steel bar, you need to wrap it in material to make it easier to grip and bend, as well as to protect your hands as you bend it. Suitable wrapping materials include the following:

Leather. Leather is the toughest material you can use to wrap the steel with and is the best material for adding leverage to your grip.






Cordura. Cordura, a synthetic canvas-like fabric, is used in professionally created bending wraps. It's as puncture resistant and durable as leather, but not as good in adding leverage to your grip. Cordura is initially stiff, but becomes more supple over time as it absorbs the oils from your skin.






Heavy cloth. A heavy cloth, such as a shop cloth or rag, is the cheapest suitable wrapping material, and has been traditionally used for nail bending feats. However, it is nowhere near as durable or puncture-proof as either leather or Cordura.







, If you're using leather, cut strips twelve inches (30 cm) long by four inches (10 cm) wide. If you're using either Cordura or heavy cloth, fold the material into strips of these dimensions.

, The chalk will keep the wrap from slipping once it's wrapped around the steel.

, Wrap the strips around the bar as tightly as possible to keep them from slipping; you may wish to use a rubber band to keep the wrapping tight. Leaving a gap between the strips prevents one strip from bumping into the other as you bend the steel and preventing you from completing the bend.

"
"
Choose an effective grip.",How to Bend Steel With Your Hands3," You can grip the steel bar in one of four ways: double overhand, double underhand, palms down, and reverse. Each method has its own individual techniques.

In the double overhand grip, you hold the bar close to your body, preferably just under the chin, with your hands gripping the steel from above. This method transfers the greatest force from your arm muscles into the bend and is the best grip to use on thicker bars.






In the double underhand grip, you also hold the bar close to your body, although at about the center of the breastbone. You will bend the bar upward, using your pinkies as fulcrums, and your driving muscle strength comes from your triceps and upper back.






In the palms down grip, you grip the bar with your hands the same as in the double overhand grip, but you hold the bar away from your body, either at arm's length or with your arms bent. Because you're holding the bar further from your body, your thumbs serve as fulcrums more when bending the steel than in the double overhand grip, requiring stronger thumb muscles.






In the reverse grip, you also hold the bar away from your body, but perpendicular to your chest instead of parallel to it as in the palms down grip. The hand further from your body grips the bar in an overhand grip, while the closer hand grips the bar underhanded. The further hand provides more of the bending force, while the thumb and forefinger of the near hand serve as a fulcrum.







"
"
Grasp the bar firmly.,
Apply force to the bar.,
Sweep the bar to a 90-degree bend.,
Crush the ends of the bar together.",How to Bend Steel With Your Hands4," If you're using either the double overhand or palms down grip, your thumbs should be pushing into the nail or bar through the wrapping, while your index, middle, and ring fingers are wrapped tightly around the bar. If you're using the double underhand grip, your pinkies should grip the bar the tightest, while your index, middle, and ring fingers grip the bar slightly less tightly.

, Push your fulcrum fingers into the steel as you start bending the ends of the bar toward each other. Your wrists will channel the driving force from your arm muscles, concentrated in your index fingers with the double overhand or palms down grip, the index finger of your far hand with the reverse grip, or your upper palms with the double underhand grip. Your goal is to bend the bar to at least a 45-degree angle.

, Keep up the bending pressure from your fulcrum fingers and your driving muscles as you bend the steel further, until your fulcrum fingers start to touch.


If you're bending from the double overhand position, you can go from making the initial bend to continuing the bend in a single motion without changing your hand grip. If you're bending from the palms down or reverse position, you may have to change to the double overhand position to continue bending the steel.
Ideally, you want to make this part of the bend in a single, smooth motion. If you're not strong enough to do that, you can make multiple attempts in rapid succession, using as much force as you can muster. Don't rest too long between attempts, or the steel will cool, making it harder to bend.

, Press the ends of the bar together until you can lace your fingers together; the ends should be about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Then, use your clasped hands and upper arms like a nutcracker to finish bending the steel.


You may have to remove some of the wrapping around the steel if it gets in the way. You may also have to grasp the bent steel in one hand and clasp that hand with your other hand, squeezing both the steel and your hand.
As with the sweep, crush the bar's ends together should follow quickly after making the 90-degree bend so that the steel doesn't have time to cool.

",How to Make Cookie Cutters," Use a ruler and permanent marker to ensure that the edges are straight and uniform in size. Make the lines at least 1"" (2.5cm) apart and use as much of the surface of the bottom of the pan as possible. You can also go to your local hardware store and buy sheet aluminum (22ga if they have it) if you don't want to cut up a lasagna pan.






;
, Next, cut out the strips that were drawn on the bottom of the pan. Be careful; cutting aluminum can leave sharp edges that can cause cuts and nicks on your fingers or hands. A good precaution is to wear gloves.








, Use ideas such as tracing a child's hand, hearts, stars, etc. Keep in mind that the perimeter of your cookie cutter can be no longer than your longest strip.









It may help to cut a piece of string the length of your strips and use it to measure around the perimeter of your design. Hold the string up to the strip and see if the strip is long enough.
Since you're working with metal, allow 1""-2"" (2.5cm-5cm) of the strip for curves and to provide enough material to properly close your cookie cutters when you've finished shaping them.

,









To create curves, use pens or cups.
To create 90 degree angles, use table edges or a ruler.
To create other shapes, use anything interesting you have around the house––just be creative!

,).








, You may fold over the edges (only about 1/8 inch/3.1mm) to provide a surface that will not be sharp and will not present a cutting hazard for your hands.









Wash and dry your cutter thoroughly before cutting out your cookie dough.

For example, a good vest design consists of four pieces: one rectangle across the back, from neck to below arms, and across shoulders; a second from under arms to waist, across sides and back, and two more from collar to waist, side to center front.;
, In addition, add an inch to each measurement. These will be used for the weaving. It uses the same method as in weaving placemats. You will need around 3 vertical strips for every 2 inches (5.1 cm) horizontally, and 2 horizontal strips for every vertical inch. The strips should be about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.

, Make it so that the untaped ends face right. One should be just above the other on the board.

, The number of tabs should be 3 for every 2 inches (5.1 cm) of length. The top strip is strung through the top hole of the tab from the front. The bottom strip is strung through the bottom hole from the back. The tabs should be close to each other, but not touching.

,, The rows should be close, but not touching.

, These go under the top of the tab, over the horizontal strips and middle of the tab, then under the bottom of the tab. These should connect the two rows.

,, This is done by pinning and sewing the loose ends to a separate strip of fabric about an inch thick.

, When designing the necklace, keep in mind the size and colors of the beads, as well as whether you want to create a patterned effect or to keep it fairly plain and simple. Other things to consider include:

If you want a pendant or for the necklace to have a central focus, you'll need to start beading from the middle. Doing so will ensure that the necklace design stays symmetrical. Leave both ends open and feed the beads on from both sides.






If you're going to use a repeated pattern, simply bend one end of the wire into a loop to prevent the beads falling off.







, Keep adding beads until you're about 1cm (0.39"") from the end.


If making a symmetrical design, it's recommended that you leave 2cm (0.78"") at each side to prevent the beads from falling off when finishing the necklace.

, Use round nosed or needle nosed pliers to create loops at each end of the memory wire; this prevents the beads from falling off. Cut off any excess wire and ensure that the jewellery piece is shaped as you want it. It's now ready to wear or to give to someone as a gift.

, Each strip will be cut to be 2 ½ feet (76 cm) long. Make the cut using a pair of wire cutters. Set the wires off to the side.The wire cutters are sharp. Use caution.

, String a bead onto your first wire. Bring it down to the center of the wire. Bend the wire around the bead until the ends meet. Twist the wire tightly, moving down from the bead about ¾ inch (19 mm). You will be left with two ends on either side of the twist., Add another bead to one of the ends of your wire. Bend and twist the wire around the bead like you did in the last step. You will have about ¾ inch (19 mm) of wire below the bead. Repeat this step on the remaining end of the wire., You now have three beads on the wire in a “t” shape. Secure the beads by twisting the remaining wire together below the “t”. Twist these two wires together about ¾ inch (19 mm)., Add three beads to each of the remaining wires. You will end up with 10 “t” shaped wires with three beads on each wire., Cross two branches over each other and twist them together at the base of the beads. Do this with each of the branches so that you have five pairings., Take one pairing of branches and cross another pairing over it. Begin twisting the pairings together. Add another pairing, and another, until you have added all of the pairings. Continue twisting the pairings together. This twisting is creating the “trunk” of the tree.Create a thick, wide trunk by twisting the bases of the branches on top of each other.
Create a thin, swirling trunk by stretching the bases of the branches out as your twist them together.

, When you near the bottom of the wires, twist the wires around each other to create a ball. This ball will help to stabilize the tree within its container., Add a liberal amount of glue to the bottom of the container using a hot glue gun. Push the ball of the tree into the hot glue. Hold onto the tree while the glue dries.The container can be a small planter or decorative bowl.

, While the glue is still hot, add a layer of pebbles to the container. All of the pebbles should fit down into the glue. They should be surrounding the tree trunk. They will offer the tree more support once all of the glue is dry.Remember to continue to hold the tree while adding the pebbles. If you need to free your hands, prop the tree up with something to prevent it from falling over.
Work quickly as your glue will dry within one to two minutes.

, Add another layer of glue on top of the first layer of pebbles. Continue to add pebbles to the glue. Repeat this process several times until you have reached the top of the container., Once the glue has dried, you can adjust your tree branches.

Use a large chainsaw file to sharpen the guthook.",How to Make a Guthook Knife from an Old Saw Blade," When the pattern has been decided on, cut it out and trace it onto a stiffer paper. You can use cardboard or file folders.;
,, The light duty will work, but you might go through a half a pack of them cutting out one blade. A better option is to use the reinforced disks. They cost more but are well worth it. You can cut 4 or 5 blades with just 1 of these cutting disks.

,,, Saw blades are almost impossible to drill through so to drill the holes for pins, heat the handle red hot and let it cool down on its own.

, If the blade is thicker, you can do a vine and thorn or an arrowhead design instead. This is a design element and is optional.


Mark the blade in 1/4"" (.635cm) increments. Most designs use the same measurement.






Use the triangular file just to put in the initial notches, so the round file won't slide all over the place. Pick one side to start and notch every other one. Turn it around and do the other side. Then switch to a small chainsaw file. Try to keep it at around a 20 degree angle and file almost to the opposite edge of the knife.






Use a large chainsaw file to make the notches wider and then switch to the flat file and round off the shape edges. If the blade is only 1/16"" thick, you might be cutting it close with the files. There will be some minor uh-ohs and scratches, but some 150 grit sandpaper wrapped around the file will take care of them.







, Normally you can use a grinder but the hook on this particular type of blade prevents that. Try to leave a flat edge roughly 1/64"" wide. During the buffing part, when you use a leather buffing wheel and some buffing compound, the edge will form.
Use a small C clamp on the front of the grinder to set the angle. Then slowly pull the knife from left to right. Turn the knife facing the other way and do the same for the other side.






Lock the belt sander in a vise, upside down and just run the blade over it at about a twenty degree angle.







, Most of the blades have a Rockwell hardness of 35 so they will need to be heat treated and tempered to hold an edge. Most industrial grade blades are hard enough and do not need to be treated (but if it is too hard, it will not sharpen easily).

Run a large stove burner on high. This is not hot enough to get the blade to around 1500F, so use a MAPP gas torch and the burner together. That will take it to a non-magnetic state. Note that the temperatures needed to temper will vary based on the metal. L6 (sawblades), L7 ( large sawmill blades) and tool steel type O-1 are probably the easiest for beginners.






Once it gets hot enough for the magnet not to stick, hold the temp for a minute to make sure it will be an even heat treat. There's no picture of this being done because it is hard to hold a camera, a torch and pliers with a magnet.






Quench in vegetable oil that is about 130F for 1 minute. Do not quench in the house with metal any thicker than a saw blade. Thicker metal retains more heat and will make a large plume of smoke and possibly ignite and boil over the oil. Instead, keep it hot with your torch while you go outside to quench it.






Wipe the oil off the blade and throw it in the oven at 525F for one hour. Do yourself a favor and lay it on some aluminum foil first, that way there are no knife shapes burned into the wife's favorite cookie sheet. It will come out black and a little flaky but some 120 grit sandpaper will take care of that. If you don't wipe it down, the oil congeals on the blade and forms a very sticky mess that is a pain to get off.







, This particular example uses blood wood.
Rip off a couple pieces that are just wide enough to feel comfortable on the knife and trace the pattern for the handle onto the wood. Make sure the sides that touch the metal are perfectly flat so you get the best fit.






Run the piece of wood through the bandsaw and cut them about 1/16"" larger than the handle pattern.






Once you get them lined up with the handle, mark the holes for the handles on the wood with a sharpie marker and throw a piece of tape around the wood to hold it together while drilling the holes.






To help keep them from slipping around and getting the holes out of alignment, drill one hole and add a pin, then drill the second hole and add the second pin, and finally the third.






Switch to a sanding drum and remove the tool marks and round the edges. While you are at it, you can sand in a couple of finger grooves at the front (not shown).







,
Clean up the blade. Cover the handles with tape except for where the adhesive will be. While taping, press down where the pins will be inserted. That makes it easier to find the holes and insert the pins while everything is covered with epoxy.






Use industrial grade heavy duty epoxy. Mix it on old plastic lids. When the leftover is dry, it peels right off and the lid can be reused.






Insert pins and clamp. Even if the glue label says no clamping is needed, it will help to create a thin glue line. Wait overnight.







,, They can be ground all the way flush, but take your time. The brass gets hot really and can melt the epoxy and come loose. If you used epoxy with less than 2500 lb. per square inch holding strength, you may need to peen the pins.

, Then switch to a cloth buffer with black buffing compound to take out most of the scratches, white for the initial shine and brown to really shine it up. Put some tape around the front of the handles to keep the compound from packing into the wood.

, It brings out a razor sharp edge. Some caution should be used when you are using the leather and cloth buffing wheels, especially with a guthook. They can get caught on the blade and hook while spinning. At high speeds, there is no reaction time, the blade can fly across the room or come all the way around the wheel and hit your hand. It helps to angle the leading edge of the blade away from the wheel. There are several other options as well:


Use a belt sander with fine grit sandpaper to shine and sand the blade.






The next option is to use a cloth buffing wheel to put a mirror grade shine on the blades and use sharpening stones to apply the final edge.






The third option is to apply a hand rubbed finish. Take a piece of medium grit sandpaper and rub the blade from the guard/handle to the tip. No back and forth motion. When that grit will no longer shine the blade, switch to a finer grit and repeat. This is very time consuming. You could spend as much as eight hours working from a low 120 grit to a high 1000 grit. Stopping at 320 grit will leave a satin finish, whereas stopping at 1000 grit will leave a mirror finish. If the blade is deeply scratched, which happens sometimes, hand rubbing helps.






Another alternative is called draw filing. Clamp the blade to a flat piece of metal and lock the metal into a vise. Place a large bastard mill file flat on the blade and pull it toward you. This will slowly work the scratches out. Don't go in the opposite direction--it works, but is more dangerous. While exerting pressure on the file and blade, if your hands or the file slips, you could be impaled by the blade.







, This tutorial uses tung oil and if it dries on the blade, it is a pain to remove without scratching the blade. Apply three layers of tung oil over three days.

, If the blade is thin, only sharpen one side.

Add pens and pencils.,
Add photos.,
Show off.",How to Make a Pencil and Photo Holder Using Office Supplies," You will need 8 medium size binder clips (1 and a quarter inches wide) and 4 rubber bands. That's it.;
, Take the 8 clips and pull the metal handles back, so they rest on the black metal clip (as shown). Now on their sides, arrange them into a circle. The shape will look more like a flower, and may not be a 'perfect' circle, but get as close to it as you can.

, With your flower-looking shape laid-out and ready, take two rubber bands and stretch them out between four fingers, as shown, larger than the circumference of the clips. This will allow you to drop them down over the clips in one smooth motion, so it contacts all the clips at once - otherwise your shape will not stay intact. After applying the first pair of rubber bands, carefully flip it and apply a second pair. If you need to reshape the ""flower"", poke a finger or a sharpie in the center of the clips.

, You can keep the color the same for a sleek minimalist look or use different colors to create something more eye-catching.

, Time for the creative fun! Placing them in between the handles of silvery metal, add photos, postcards, notes -- whatever you'd like.

, Place this amazing pen and photo holder someplace where fellow coworkers can pass by and compliment you on your skills. Oh, and if anyone asks, well, the clips aren't leaving the office, are they?

Find a bedspring.,
Cut your mattress.,
Sand and clean your bedspring.,
Paint the bedspring.,
Display your vase.",How to Create a Vintage Bedspring Vase1," Bedsprings are fairly hard to come by, but the easiest way to secure one is to take apart an old mattress. The mattress can be any age or condition; the only requirement is that you're done using it as a mattress, as it will need to be completely disassembled.If you don’t have access to an old mattress, you may be able to find bedsprings online or at flea markets, garage sales or antique shops.
Ebay and Craigslist are also great resources for hunting down old bedsprings.;
, To do this, you will need first to cut through all the fabric and padding; you can achieve this by cutting around the perimeter of the mattress using a knife. When you reach the metal part of the box spring, you should be able to remove the bedsprings by cutting the connector wires with a set of pliers.Take as many springs as you think you’ll need. When you’re finished, you can dispose of the rest of your mattress.
Since bedsprings are at a premium, you can also try selling extra bedsprings online or at yard sales to make a profit.

, Start by cleaning your bedspring off with soap and water. If any grease remains from the box spring, use a degreaser to remove it. Use medium sandpaper to rough up your bedspring slightly.If you plan to incorporate your bedspring vase into your garden, you can skip this step and leave your bedspring as is.
Do not strip the outer layer of your bedspring entirely; just rough the spring up enough so that paint will be able to stick to the spring.

, Depending on the style of your bedspring and the look you’re going for, you may want to paint your bedspring. Select your color of choice, then spray paint your bedspring. Apply two coats of paint, allowing your spring to dry completely between coats.Spray paint your bedspring outside or in a well-ventilated area.
Hold your spray paint can a few feet away from your bedspring and apply even pressure as you mist your bedspring.
For a more neutral bedspring vase, paint your bedspring gold or black. For an added pop of color, paint your bedspring royal blue or hot pink.

, After your bedspring has dried, stand it upright and stick a test tube inside the cone. You can fill your test tube with water and use it to hold fresh flowers, or leave the test tube dry and use it to store fake flowers.Test tubes can be purchased online or in most craft stores.
If you don’t have a test tube, you can also use a thin vase or glass bottle to accomplish the same thing.
You can also swap your test tube out for a candle stick. Make two bedspring candlesticks and use them as centerpieces for your dining room table.

Create a vase using a potted plant.",How to Create a Vintage Bedspring Vase2," Take a piece of sheet music and roll it into the shape of a cone. Position your cone of music so it fits inside your bedspring, lining it. Fill your sheet music vase with whatever your want: pinecones and dry flowers tend to work well.To allow your sheet music vase to hold real flowers, tuck a votive filled with water into the bottom of the cone.
Try lining your bedspring with a map and filling the insides with seashells for a more nautical feel.

, To complete this project, you’ll need a bedspring, an old handkerchief, a tulip and the lid of a vintage Mason jar. Wrap your tulip in the handkerchief, then stand the flower up inside your bedspring. Fill your Mason jar lid with water and position it underneath the flower to keep the flower hydrated.Refill your Mason jar with water every three hours to keep your flower alive.
Create three or more bedspring tulip vases and line them up in the center of your dining room table to create a striking centerpiece.

, Stand your bedspring up and position a mini-potted plant in the narrowest portion of the bedspring cone. Plant your bedspring outside in your garden, or display it by a window with lots of natural light.Swap out the plant in your pot in favor of a candle and line the patio of your house with bedspring candles.
Plant succulents in your pot for a low maintenance plant that will thrive without care.

Build a bedspring bird feeder.,
Create a bedspring fry caddy.,
Use your bedspring to display holiday cards.",How to Create a Vintage Bedspring Vase3," For this project, you’ll need a bedspring, an ear of corn, wire and a wire cutter. Cut a length of wire, long enough to hang your birdfeeder from the branch of a tree. Attach your wire to the widest part of your bed spring’s cone. Slide the corn inside the bedspring and hang your birdfeeder from a tree.Before hanging your feeder, enclose the corn in the feeder by attaching a few lengths of wire over the top of bedspring cone. This will keep squirrels from coming and stealing the whole piece of corn.
Make sure to cut off all loose wire pieces, so no animals can accidentally cut themselves.

, Take your bedspring and clean and degrease it. Paint it black and allow it to dry for a day. After your bedspring has dried completely, roll some wax paper into the shape of a cone and insert it into the cone of your bedspring. Fill the wax paper with fries and use it to make a statement at your next dinner party.Spray paint is not food safe, even when dry, so always make sure the wax paper is creating a barrier between the fries and the bedspring.
For a vintage diner feel, try spray painting your bedspring fire engine red.

, Place your bedspring on its side and slide your holiday cards between the coils. You can also use your bedspring to organize your mail or display family photos.When you get sick of using your bedspring as a display case, flip it upright and use it to hold your pencils and other office supplies.
If you have more than one bedspring, consider wrapping cutlery in napkins and inserting the rolled up silverware into the bedspring for a fun place setting at dinner parties.

Knot the loose end of your bracelet.",How to Make a Candy Stripe Friendship Bracelet1," For the four string weave, you will need four pieces of embroidery thread (sometimes called embroidery floss) in two different colors. You can find these at your local craft store, or in the craft section of most major retailers, like Walmart or Target. Look for two colors that complement each other, such as blue and green or red and orange.You can also make an ombre bracelet with two shades of a color, like blue or red. Ombre bracelets use a pattern where the color changes little by little from light to dark.;
, Cut two strings of a different color so they are 65” long. Now you can fold them in half and make a ¼ inch loop. This loop will form the base of your friendship bracelet.


If you don't have 65"" of embroidery thread, you can make your bracelet without a loop. In this case, you will need to use a length of 30"" for your thread., Place your strings on a flat surface, like a table or clipboard, and tape the loop firmly to it. This will help you weave your strings more easily, as the tape will hold each in place while you knot your threads.


If you have chosen to not loop your threads and instead are using 30"" strands, simply tape your strings to your clipboard or flat surface.

, Move left to right and label each in your head as string 1, 2, 3, and 4. You should be using two colors, making sure that strings 1 and 3 are your first color, and strings 2 and 4 your second color.

, To tie a forward knot, you should loop one string twice over the string to its immediate right. You should then pull the loops tight into a knot. After you have finished your forward knot on string 2, move string 1 to string 3, repeating the process until you finish this round of forward knots on string 4.


Your strings should now be in the order: 2, 3, 4, 1.

, Tighten each knot so that it is tight and firm. After you have tied your final forward knot for string 2 on string 1, your strings should be in the order: 3, 4, 1, 2.

Record the measurements to create a custom template for your mask.


Use a tape measure to measure the distance between the front of one ear to the front of the other, wrapping the tape measure around the front of the face.
Measure the distance from the bottom of the nose to the top of the forehead.
Measure the distance between the bottom of the nose and the bottom of the eyes, as well as the dimensions of the eyes themselves.;
, This can be a bit tricky, but armed with your measurements, you can create a shape custom-fit to the wearer's face.


Draw a horizontal line that matches the width of the wearer's face.

, Find the midpoint of the line and make a mark 1 inch below the line. Use a ruler to draw a line from the right-hand end of the line to this point. Draw a second line from the left-hand end of the line to this point


Draw two downward-angled lines from the edges of the original line. The lines should meet together in a slight peak about 1 inch below the center of the original line.

, The ears will curve upward from the ends of the original horizontal line.


Draw two curved vertical lines from the edge of the original line. These lines should equal the height measurement from the nose to the forehead taken earlier plus an additional 3 inches (7.6 cm).
Draw another curved line on the end of each ""side"" line. The lines should come inward, forming curved triangles, and the base of each triangle should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. These triangles form the ears of the mask.
Draw a line connecting the two top triangles across the top of the mask.

, Sketch out two almond-shape eyes holes.


The position of the bottom of the eye holes should roughly match the distance between the wearer's nose and the bottom of the wearer's eyes.
Measure from the center of the original horizontal line to the bottom edge of the inner portion of the eye.
The eye holes themselves should be about twice the sides of the wearer's eyes.
Angle the eyes slightly so the narrow part of the almond shape points inward and downward.

, Use scissors to cut around the outline of the mask and the eye outlines.

, Use pen to transfer the shape of the mask and eyes onto craft foam.


While a black Batman mask is the most traditional choice, you can use any color you want if you plan on making these masks as favors for a children's party.

, Use scissors to carefully cut out the outline of the mask and the eyes from the foam.

, Punch the holes into each side of the mask, near the edge and aligned with the center of the eye holes.


A hole punch works well for this, but you could also use the tip of your scissors.

, Tie one end of the elastic into one hole and the other end to the other hole. The elastic should be long enough to fit around the back of the wearer's head.

Choose complementing colors or contrasting colors to give your bracelet contrast. Customize the bracelet with your personal color choices, or choose a color you think your friend might like.
Ombre patterns change color from light to dark gradually.Your six string friendship bracelet, if you choose six different shades of the same color or shades between similar colors (like blue to green), can make an excellent ombre pattern.

, Collect your strands so they are in series, one strand following the next on your clipboard or flat surface. Tape your threads together in this order on your clipboard to keep them in place while you knot it in the friendship bracelet pattern.


It helps to label the strings by number, from 1-6. So moving left to right, the strings will be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
If you have trouble remembering the numbers for your strings, write each number on a piece of tape and attach it to the end of the corresponding string.

, To tie a forward know, you should loop your string twice and then pull it tight to form a knot. You should tie a forward knot with string 1 through the rest of your strings, finishing at string 6.


When you have completed your first round of forward knots with string 1, the resulting order of your strings should be: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1.

, Tie your forward knots with string 2 through the rest of your strings until you reach the final strand, which should now be string 1.


Be sure your forward knots are pulled tight, and when you have completed this round of forward knots, the order of your strings will be: 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2.

You could also use thin cardboard instead of cardstock.
If you can't find black cardstock, brown or white will work. You will need to paint the mask when you're finished.

, You will need to draw the ears along with the upper edge of the mask.Measure the amount of space between your ears using a tape measure. Start at the front of one ear and wrap the tape measure around the front of your face until you reach the front of your other ear.
Repeat the measuring process with the back of your head. Start at the back of one ear, wrap the tape measure around the back of your head, and bring it up to the back of your other ear.
Divide the back measurement in half and add 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). On the left side of the cardstock, draw a horizontal line of this length 5 inches (13 cm) down from the top of the rectangle. Draw a matching line on the other side of the cardstock.
In between the two lines, draw a third line that roughly matches the front measurement of your face. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty space in between this line and the original two.
Draw a vertical line at each end of this inner line. The line should extend up to the top of the cardstock.
Draw a curved line from the top of these vertical lines down to the ends of your original horizontal lines.

, Create two ""3"" shapes at the bottom center of the mask. One ""3"" should face the correct way and the other should be backwards. The top points of the ""3"" shapes should connect, but the bottom should not.


Measure the distance from the bottom of your nose to your chin. This is the height of your mouth hole.
Measure the distance between the outside tip of one eye to the outside tip of the other. This is the width of the mouth hole.

, You will need to separate the mouthpiece from the rest of the bottom.

Try the mask on one last time.",How to Make a Batman Mask3," Place the bag over the top of your head making sure it does not cover your eyes mouth or nose.The plastic should cover your hair and sides of your head. The remaining excess can be trimmed away later.
This plastic acts as a protective barrier against the duct tape.

, Tear off 5-8 inch strips of duct tape and attache them to the bag. You will cover the entire bag creating a helmet made of duct tape. Be careful not to stick the duct tape to your skin or hair and only attach it to the plastic.


You may find it easiest to begin at the top of your head and work your way around to the front, sides, and back.
Tape across the plastic covering your forehead. The duct tape should come down to your eyebrows before smoothly transitioning down over your ears and around the back of your neck.
For best results, use black duct tape. Doing so will be easier than attempting to color silver duct tape later.

, Fold a 4 inch strip of duct tape in half lengthwise. Tape the strip to the center of the forehead portion of your mask extending down between your eyes and over your nose.Attach two more folded 6 inch strips of duct tape from the nose piece extending outward to your ears. This will create a ""T"" shape that goes between and under your eyes and covers your nose.
Make sure that you do not cover your mouth.
Leave spaces for eye holes.
Apply more duct tape, as necessary, to create a snug fit around your cheeks and nose.

, Look in the mirror with the mask base on. Draw a triangle around your nose, extending from the top of the bridge down to the bottom of your nostrils.

, You will need to cut out two triangular pieces of cardboard to build your nose piece. After cutting the pieces out, attach them to the mask along your nose outline using more duct tape.


You may find it easier to remove the mask temporarily for this part.
Tape the cardboard triangles to the mask to create a pointed nose piece.

, Use more plastic bag material and duct tape to cover the rest of your cheeks. Cut two circles 4 inches in diameter to cover your cheeks.


Tape additional plastic cut from another bag to the cross strip going under your eyes. Cover the plastic with duct tape to finish the cheeks of the mask.
The entire mouth and chin area should still remain open.

, Each ear should be made from three triangular strips of cardstock, joined together to make a narrow prism shape. Stuff the prisms with newspaper, and tape them together with more duct tape.


Attach the mask ears at the top of the mask so that they line up with your actual ears. Use more duct tape to attach the ears.
As you wrap the ear shapes in duct tape, you should bend them slightly inward so that they have a slightly more rounded and less rigid appearance.
There are no exact measurements for the ears, but in general, they should be fairly tall and narrow. As an estimate, make the base about 2 inches (5 cm) wide. The length should be about 6 inches (15.25 cm).

, Remove the mask from your head. Use additional layers of plastic bag material and duct tape to define the eye holes, nose, and lower edge.


Fill the mask with wadded grocery bags to prevent the mask from caving in as you work.
The mask eyes should be a defined ""almond"" shape. The holes should be about twice as large as the shape of your eyes.
Use tape to create a smooth edge along the nose and the rest of the lower edge of the mask. Trim away any visible plastic.
If desired, you could also cover the mask with another layer of tape to hide any uneven, criss-crossing tape lines and provide the mask with more support and structure.

, It should be complete at this point.


If you are still unsatisfied with the shape or look of the mask, continue sculpting it while looking at yourself wearing the mask in the mirror.

Cover the area you plan to paint on.,
Tape down your paper.,
Set up your paints and water.,
Prepare your hands.,
Pick your colors.,
Start painting.,
Let your painting dry.,
Wipe off your hands.,
Take off your apron or dirty clothes.,
Clean up your area.",How to Fingerpaint," Since finger painting can get messy, especially for children, you should cover your work area with something you can clean off or throw away. You can use anything like newspapers, plastic tablecloths, or even old magazines.


If you are still worried, try painting outside where there is less potential to get paint on things.;
, Using your fingers or hands to paint can be a bit more rigorous than using a paintbrush, so keeping your paper in place while painting may be difficult. Taping the corners of your paper down will help prevent both future messes and potentially smudging your picture if your paper moves. This is also a good idea if you plan to paint outside as the wind might blow your paper away.Try to use a tape that’s easy to remove like painter’s tape.

, You will need not only your various jars of finger paint but also a small bowl of water to clean your fingers. You can place these anywhere you want, however, it’s best to have them relatively close to your paper for easy access. If working with children, it’s best to remove the small bowl of water once they begin painting so they are less likely to knock it over.

, Make sure to wash your hands before you start painting as you don’t want to get dirt or anything else on your picture. After this, dip the tips of your fingers into your bowl of water. You want them to be slightly wet, but not dripping. This will help thin the paint out a bit, as well as make it easier to apply to your paper.

, Most finger paint sets contain the usual rainbow colors along with black, brown, and white. However, if you want a different color, you can always mix some of your paints together. For example, if you want a darker green, try mixing it with a little black or brown. After you’ve chosen your colors, dip the tips of your fingers into the jars and make sure they are relatively coated.When mixing paint, make sure to do it in a separate bowl or tin as you don’t want to ruin the original colors. You should also test out your new color on a separate paper before using it.

, There are no rules with finger painting outside of using your fingers, so feel free to paint whatever you want - a landscape, an animal or person, even something abstract. Once you’ve chosen what to paint and what colors to use, simply place your fingers or hands onto your paper and use them like you would a paint brush.


You can also use the sides of your fingers, your palm, or your knuckles to finger paint. Each part of your hand will produce a different type of shape, similar to differently sized paint brushes. So get creative and try them all!

, Due to both the water and paint on your paper, you want to make sure you let it dry out before doing anything else with it. You should place your painting somewhere it’s likely to get air or sun without being blown away or knocked over. You should also try to place it on top of something like a newspaper in case the paint runs.


The time it takes your painting to dry will vary depending on how much paint is used, however, expect to wait at least 5-10 minutes.

, All paint used for finger painting should come easily off skin with soap and water, however, a wet rag, baby wipes, or any other safe cleaning agent will work. Don’t worry too much about getting all the paint off at first as you will likely get more on your hands cleaning everything else up.

, Once you’ve removed the dirty items, place them somewhere where they can’t get anything else dirty. If you want, you can try to wipe them down with a damp cloth or baby wipes to get off excess paint before washing them. You should also wash this clothing separate from anything else.

, Put the lids back on your paints and make sure they are closed tightly. You should also wipe them down before you put them away. If you used old newspapers or magazines, you can simply throw them in the trash. However, if you used a plastic table cloth or a tarp, you can either wipe them down with a wet rag or take them outside and hose them off.

Watch embroidery tutorials online.",How to Learn Embroidery As a Kid," 100% white cotton twill is a good option as it is easy to pass a needle through. You can use fabric in another color as long as it is made of cotton. You may want to cut the fabric into 15-inch squares or 8” by 8” squares to make them smaller and easier to work with.You can get white cotton fabric at your local fabric store or online.
You should also iron the fabric before you use it for embroidery as this will ensure it lays flat.;
, This is an essential tool for embroidery. The embroidery hoop will help to keep the fabric in place as you sew and make it easier for you to make even, strong stitches. Go for a 5” to 8” wood embroidery hoop as it will be small enough to hold in one hand and can hold enough fabric for a simple design.You can buy an embroidery hoop at your local fabric store or online.

, To embroider, you will need embroidery floss or thread. You may choose floss in several different colors if you plan on making a design with multiple colors. Pearl cotton thread is also a good option as it will better cover up the template drawn on the fabric.It may be a good idea to start with one to two colors of floss. You can then add more colors as you get better at embroidery and try to do more complicated designs or stitches.

, A tapestry needle is a good option as they are easy to hold and not too sharp. Get a size 20 tapestry needle or an embroidery needle that is large in size. Using a large, easy to hold needle will ensure you do not hurt yourself or get frustrated with holding the needle as you sew.You can find needles at your local fabric store or online.
Make sure you are very careful when you are using the needle as you do not want to poke yourself. If you are afraid of needles, you may try asking an adult for help with threading the needle and holding it in your hands. You may need to try holding the needle a few times so you are comfort using it when you embroider.

, You will also need a good pair of scissors made to fit a child’s hands. Look for scissors made for children at your local craft store or online.Another thing you will need is a fabric marker that is water soluble, as you will use it to draw a design on the fabric to then embroider over.

, Start by making sure your hands are clean and dry. Having clean hands will make handling the needle and thread much easier. You can wash your hands with soap and warm water in the sink before you sit down to stitch.Another option is to use baby wipes to clean your hands before you embroider.

, Start by cutting two strands of the same thread color. Cut threads that are 18-24 inches. Group the two strands together and moisten one end of the strands by putting it between your lips. Hold the needle in your non-dominant hand with the eye of the needle facing towards you. Take the thread in your dominant hand and hold the needle and thread up to your eye level, about two inches apart.


Guide the thread through the eye hole of the needle. Keep your hands steady as you do this with a firm grip on the thread with your forefinger and thumb.
If the eye hole is very small on the needle, you may have to try putting the thread through the eye a few times until you get it.
Make a small knot at the end of the thread once you get it through the needle.
Alternatively, you can use a needle threader to help you thread the needle. Using this device will make it quick and easy to thread the needle without having to try multiple times.

, Start by separating the two parts of the hoop. There will be one hoop that has a lip around it and one hoop that has a tightening screw. Place the hoop with the lip on a solid surface, such as a table. Then, place a piece of fabric on top of the hoop. Take the other hoop and slip it over the fabric and the bottom hoop. It should fit snugly over the fabric and the bottom hoop. Tighten the top hoop with the tightening screw so the fabric is in place.You should now have a secure piece of fabric in the embroidery hoop. Make sure the tightening screw is secure by twisting the screw with your hand.

, Once you have the fabric secure in the embroidery hoop, you can try one of the most basic stitches: the running stitch. Thread the needle into the fabric from the back so the knot is in place and the thread is secure. Then, come up through the fabric and make one straight stitch. Leave a little space and then come back up through the fabric. You’ve now done a running stitch.You can try doing a running stitch straight across the fabric in a straight line. You can also try doing a running stitch around the circumference of the embroidery hoop to practice doing it in a circular shape.

, Another stitch you can try is the backstitch. Thread the needle from the back of the fabric to the front so there is a knot keeping the thread in place. Then, raise the needle and thread it back through the fabric. This should create one stitch. Come back up a stitch length away from your initial stitch. Then, go back down right next it to create the second stitch. This will form a backstitch.You may try the backstitch using two to three threads in the needle at a time so the stitch appears solid and thick on the fabric.
Try to create backstitches that are close together as this will make the outline of the design much clearer and sharper on the fabric.

, This stitch is a bit more advanced but it can be a good one to use to fill in areas in a design with a certain color. The stitch is called a “satin stitch” because it creates a shiny, raised surface on the fabric. Start by threading the needle through the fabric from the back so the knot is secure at the back. Then, come up with the thread and place it underneath the initial hole, making a vertical stitch. Go to the top again and come back up. Then, place the the next stitch below the top stitch. Continue to do this, going top to bottom with the stitch.Always go in the same direction when you do a satin stitch, such as top to bottom or bottom to top. This will keep the stitch uniform and straight.

, As a beginner, you should start with an embroidery design that is simple and easy to follow. You may decide to use your name as a design or a shape like a circle, a square, or a triangle. You can also try drawing a simple image like the sun, the moon, or a flower with big round petals.If you have shaky drawing skills, you may try using a template from another source, such as an online source or a book. Go for an image that has thick, black lines so it will be easy to trace.

, Use a fabric marker to draw the design on the fabric. Make sure the lines appear clear and thick as you want them to be easy to follow. Draw the design as large as you can on the fabric so you do not have to make stitches that are too small or difficult.For example, if you were using your name as a design, you may write your name in big block letters: “SAMSON.” Or you may draw a shape in the middle of the fabric. Keep the design simple and basic.

, It is often easiest to start with a backstitch to embroider the design. Begin by doing a backstitch over the outline of the design, following the outline you have traced on the fabric. Go for a close backstitch so the outline appears solid and smooth.If the backstitch is too difficult for you, you can start with a running stitch. Then, once you get the hang of the running stitch, you can try the same design with a backstitch.
Once you have completed the outline, you can fill in any empty areas in the design with a satin stitch.

, Once you have finished the embroidery, secure the fabric to the hoop so you can hang the embroidery. You will need scissors and glue to do this. Use the scissors to trim the fabric around the hoop, leaving just enough fabric to fold over the edge of the hoop. Then, put a line of glue around the top edge of the hoop. Press the fabric into the glue with your fingers.Flip the embroidery over and let it dry on a clean, flat surface.
If you are planning to mount the embroidery on another surface, you can remove it from the embroidery hoop by releasing the tightening screw. You can then glue it or sew it onto another surface as you see fit.

, If you are looking to improve beyond the basics, you may challenge yourself by practicing a more difficult stitch. Stitches like the french knot and the “lazy daisy” stitch are fun and challenging to practice.You can also try doing a more complicated embroidery design. Perhaps you try an embroidery design with a longer phrase or saying on it. Or you try an image with smaller details that will require you to use different stitches.

, You can also improve your skills by enrolling in an embroidery class. See if embroidery classes are offered at your local community center or at school as part of a home economics program. You could also search for a local embroidery club at a fabric store or an arts center in your area.


You may want to ask your parents or guardians to help you find an embroidery class you can take. They may be able to help you pay for the class and make sure you have transportation to the class.

, There are many embroidery tutorials that you can watch and learn from. Search “embroidery” online for videos of different stitches and designs. Watch the videos and practice on your own at home.


You could try challenging yourself to learn a new embroidery tutorial every week. Or you may try learning a new embroidery skill a month to expand your skills further.

Separate the candles by color and scent if needed. Use a flat screwdriver or butter knife to cut the wax into small pieces. Scrape wax out of jars or holders with a spoon and remove the wicks. Store the wax chunks in sealed storage bags until you are ready to recycle them.;
, Your local craft store will have the wicks, fragrance, and dyes you may wish to use. Candle holders can include jars, glasses, or even a tin can. You can also use a mold to make wick-less candle disks or decorative candles for the holidays.

, Use pans that are you do not use for general cooking or purchase old pans at discount stores or yard sales. A pan with a spout is perfect for pouring the hot wax into candle holders.

, Allow the pan to warm before adding the wax. Keep the burner on low so the wax does not heat too quickly. Stir occasionally to break up any chunks. This process can take up to 40 minutes.

, Measure the needed wick length so that the wick touches the bottom of the holder and stays straight. Tie the wick string around a pencil to help it stay in place over the center of the candle holder.

, Add fragrances or candle dye to help intensify the color of the candles. Follow manufacturer instructions on both the fragrance and coloring for best results.

, Using a strainer will help remove any remnants of dirt or burnt wick from the wax.

, If you do not have a pan with a spout, use a small ladle. Wear an oven mitt at this point to reduce the risk of being burned from splattering wax.

, Top off candles as needed as the wax settles.

You'll need to take a hands-on approach to teaching and let the child take plenty of time to learn each skill before moving onto the next.
Between the ages of 9 and 12, kids can begin learning and practicing on their own, but you should still be there to answer questions and demonstrate new techniques.
Once kids become teenagers, they can usually learn on their own and are happy to work without supervision.;
, Regardless of the age group, it will usually be easiest to learn a new technique when that technique is first performed by someone else.


If you cannot demonstrate a technique yourself, try to find a video guide or picture guide that clearly and slowly shows how the technique is performed.

, Each time you use a crochet term, you need to explain what that term means. Some kids have a hard time asking questions, so you should try to anticipate possible points of uncertainty and address them as you teach., It's easy for beginners to forget how to start after they've finished what they were trying to make. Repetition is the best way to help a kid remember.


When the child you're teaching finishes the first row, encourage his or her to unravel it and remake it from the beginning.
Alternatively, after finishing the first row, start a new piece from the beginning instead of continuing from the old one.

, Allow the child you're teaching to exercise his or her creativity and to work at his or her own pace.


Allow the child to select from a wide range of yarn colors and simple materials.
Encourage the child to think of different projects that can be made with simple chains and stitches.
Some kids will enjoy repeating the same technique over and over, while others may want to move onto a new technique as soon as possible. When kids are allowed to move at the pace they want, the activity will usually seem more fun for them.

, By praising a child's work, you help him or her feel proud of it, too. This sense of accomplishment can make kids enjoy the learning experience more.


Verbal praise is excellent, but you can further the excitement by taking pictures of the child with his or her finished pieces.

, Larger hooks are easier to hold and manipulate, so they're your best option when you're still learning basic techniques.


Look for an H, I, or J hook. If you're shopping for hooks marked according to millimeter range, these would be 5 mm, 5.5 mm, and 6 mm, respectively.
You can choose a slightly larger or slightly smaller hook, but make sure that it fits comfortably in your hand.

, Look for a chunky yarn and select any color that appeals to you.


When learning how to crochet as a kid, it's best to use a simple yarn in a solid color. Avoid patterned yarn until after you've learned the basic techniques.
Worsted weight and chunky/bulky weight yarns are easiest to work with, especially for beginners. They are also more suitable for use with larger hooks.
The yarn should also be fairly smooth. For the time being, avoid strands that are super fuzzy since they can be more difficult to grasp and work with.

, Sit down at a table in a well-lit location. Remove everything from the table except for your yarn, crochet hook, and a pair of scissors.

,


Start at the palm-side of your hand and wrap the yarn over your forefinger.
Wrap the yarn around the back of your fingers, past the middle or ring finger, and back up along the palm-side of your hand.
You should create a full, closed loop. Hold this loop closed with the thumb of your right hand.

, Use your left hand to grab the yarn just before the loop. Pull this yarn through the loop, working from the bottom (palm-side) of the loop to the top (thumb-side).


The yarn you grab should come from the side of the yarn still attached to the ball. Do not grab from the loose end.
After completing this step, you should see a second loop form. Slide the first loop of yarn off your fingers once this second loop appears.

, Slide the hooked part of your crochet hook into the second loop your created. Pull down on the loose yarn beneath your loops to tighten the yarn around the hook.


The loop of yarn should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the top of your hook.
When you pull down on the yarn, the first loop should turn into a knot and the second loop should close onto the hook.
Once the yarn is tightly attached to the hook, you're ready to begin making stitches.

, Grab the crochet hook with your right hand (if you're right-handed) or left hand (if you're left-handed). Hold it like a pencil or a knife, with the hooked portion pointing down and facing you.


To hold the hook like a pencil, turn your hand to the side and hold the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger together. Grab the hook with these fingers, letting it extend just past your fingertips.
To hold the hook like a knife, turn your hand down, with your palm pointing at the floor, and close the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger together. Slide the hook into the space between your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.

, As you unravel the yarn, hold it taut between the forefinger and thumb of your non-writing hand (the left hand if you're right-handed; the right hand if you're left-handed).


You will need to grab the yarn with the hook as you create stitches.
Do not use your fingers to manually twist the yarn around the hook.

, Use your hook to grab the yarn. As you grab the yarn, twist the hook so that the yarn wraps around it in a clockwise rotation.


If you have difficulty grabbing the yarn, hold the Slipknot in between the thumb and forefinger of your non-writing hand to create tension and try again.
Grab yarn from the side still attached to the ball, not the loose end.
The yarn needs to slide into the hooked part of your crochet hook.

, Carefully pull the yarn tucked into your hook through the Slipknot loop already on your hook.


When you do this, the Slipknot hoop should turn into your first chain stitch.
You should still be left with one loop on your hook.

, The technique you used to create your first chain stitch is the same technique you should use to create the rest of your chain stitches.Create as many chain stitches as you want until you feel comfortable with the process.


Grab the yarn in the same way each time you want to make another chain stitch.
For each chain stitch, you should pull the yarn through the loop already on your hook. A new stitch will form, and a new loop will appear on your hook.
Right now, you should try to make loose chain stitches that are easy to see. Try to make each stitch the same size, too.

, You can create plenty of different projects just by making chains of different sizes. Figure out what you want to make, the crochet a chain long enough to wrap around what it needs to wrap around.


For example, you can use a crochet chain to create a necklace, bracelet, ring, or skinny infinity scarf., Once you create a long enough chain, you'll need to close it into a loop. To close the chain, you will need to create a special stitch known as a slip stitch.


With one loop still on your hook, insert the tip of the hook through the first chain stitch you created.
Grab the yarn with your hook in the same way you grabbed it while creating chain stitches.
Pull the yarn you just grabbed through the stitch and through the yarn loop on your hook.
When done, the chain should form a connected ring and you should have one loop on your hook.

,


Cut the yarn still attached to the ball. Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) of loose yarn when you make the cut.
Grab this loose yarn with your hook in the same way you grabbed yarn for your chain stitches.
Pull the yarn you just grabbed through the loop on your hook. Continue pulling to form a tight knot. No loops should remain on your hook after this is done.
Use scissors to cut off any excess yarn.
Congratulations! You've just completed a simple crochet project.

, When you feel comfortable and confident in your ability to crochet chains, you can start learning more advanced stitches.


Each time you practice a new stitch, you'll need to create a long foundation of chain stitches first. You'll need to work these new stitches into the loops of your chain.
When learning a new stitch, try to create multiple rows using the new stitch. Continue creating rows of the same stitch until you become comfortable with the technique.
After mastering the chain stitch and the slip stitch, the next stitches you should learn (in order) are:

The single crochet stitch
The double crochet stitch
The triple or treble crochet stitch



, After you've practiced your basic stitches, you can start using them to create simple projects like blankets and scarves.


Look for crochet patterns written for children since the instructions will be easier to understand.
Check the stitches listed in the instructions before you begin. Make sure that you know how to create all of the required stitches.

Think like a child when planning the crafts.,
Buy water soluble materials.,
Make your craft station low to the ground.,
Read parenting or craft blogs for inspiration.",How to Do Crafts With Your Child1," Some art projects will be more successful than others. The only way you can ensure your child gets all the benefits of learning art at a young age, is to have a craft date at least every week.;
, The younger your children are, the lower their attention span is likely to be. Start with projects under 20 minutes and work your way up until your child is spending longer than usual developing their artistic style.

, If the instructions for a craft require detail, specific colors or a lot of focus, it may be too adult-oriented. Choose crafts that don't require children to copy or follow along exactly to achieve success.

, Watercolors and washable glue is better than tempera paint and strong glue. Your child will make a mess, so exclude anything that will bring you undue worry during the creative process.

, Small children may enjoy working on the floor better than sitting at a craft table.

, Doing a craft every week will require some inspiration. Regularly visit sites like thecraftycrow.net, busybeekidscrafts.com, kidspot.com.au, or countless other kids craft blogs that you can find on a search engine.

Make small rafts to play with in the water.,
Create a backyard waterfall.",How to Do Crafts With Your Child2," Introduce your child to the craft by watching a program about the sea or boats. Show them pictures of boats so that they get excited about making their own.


Gather used wine corks, popsicle sticks, craft glue and a skewer stick. Glue 2 sets of 3 wine corks together, for you and your child. Add another set of 3 corks for each other child or parent who is involved. Place a strip of glue onto either side of the middle cork and place it, side to side, between the other 2 corks.
Place dots of glue on the top of the corks and attach 3 popsicle sticks perpendicularly. Wait overnight for all the glue to dry, if possible. This craft is 2 days of craft fun.
Cut out a small triangle for the sail. Get out some markers or crayons and let your child decorate the sail on either side. Tape the triangle to a 4-inch portion of a barbecue skewer. Stick the pointed end into your cork.
Once the glue is dry on day 2, run a bath. Let your child get in your bath and race your cork rafts. Make waves in the bath to show them how a boat floats at sea. Set the raft to dry overnight and use it again for future bath times.

, Gather colanders, bowls, empty pots and plates from the kitchen. Place a large bowl or trough at the bottom so that you can reuse the water once it's been poured.


Construct a waterfall by creating a tower of bowls, colanders, plastic cutting boards and cups. Your child will likely need to try a few times in order to get the tower to balance. If possible, use plenty of colanders and sturdy cutting boards so that it is stable and allows water to move through.
Take a gallon of water and color it with food coloring. You can also use a few different colors in different pitchers. Pour some water into a smaller pitcher or liquid measuring cup. Let your child pour water on the top of the waterfall and watch as it pours down.
If the waterfall is unsteady it will fall apart, so you and your child can construct it again. Pour more water over the top. You can also gather water at the bottom with a cup and your child re-pour it at the top.

Save tin cans to make tin can robots.,
Save cereal boxes to make sandals.",How to Do Crafts With Your Child3," Make sure the edges are not dangerous by feeling in the inside top where the can was opened. Find cans with smooth edges and clean them thoroughly.


Search the house for other metal, plastic and paper recycling. Save anything that is in a shape and could be used to make facial features, legs, arms or hair.
Lay out all the materials, including a tin can for both you and your child. Play around with the different elements until you plan out a face, limbs and hair. Talk to your child about what they want to use.
Attach the elements in 1 of 2 ways. First, you can use silver electrical tape to affix anything onto your can. Also, you can hot glue disk magnets to shapes. If you choose to hot glue your child's favorite items, you can return to the craft later and remake your robot by changing the elements around.

, Cut out the large sides of a cereal box. Have your child stand on the back of the cereal box and trace their feet.


Cut out the shape around their feet to make your sandal bottoms. Make straps out of leftover cardboard. Cut them out and then measure them around your child's feet. You can use 1 strap or criss cross straps over the top.

Choose a different craft that corresponds with many holidays, seasons and celebrations throughout the year.,
Make pine cone Christmas trees.,
Make a spaghetti spider web.",How to Do Crafts With Your Child4," This will teach your child to decorate and associate fun experiences, rather than possessions, with the holidays.

, Go outside in the fall and gather large pine cones. These can be saved for many other craft projects.


Set up a craft station on a low table or by placing a blanket over the floor. Place 1 cup of white rice in a small plastic bag. Add 10 drops of green food coloring and 1 tsp. of water. Shake the bag. Place it on some wax paper to dry for 10 minutes.
Give your child glue and a craft stick and tell them to cover the entire pine cone with glue. They should have fun and get fairly messy. Your child will need to wash their hands before the next step.
Hold the pine cone over a paper plate. Let your child sprinkle green rice all over the surfaces while you hold it. Don't stop until every surface has been covered. Shake the pine cone off to get rid of extra rice. Let your pine cone dry for 10 minutes.
Take a snack break and return to decorate your tree. Glue on sequins for ornaments. Use silver pipe cleaners for tinsel. You can also use ribbons, buttons or candy to add extra embellishment. Let it dry and display it.

, This is an excellent craft that can be done in the kitchen with kids of any age. You will need to cook a package of spaghetti ahead of time.


Lay down a cloth or drop cloth for easy clean up. Get out black paint and paintbrushes. Paint a paper plate black. Let the paint dry while you get the spaghetti and spider ready.
Place the spaghetti in a bowl and cover it with 1/2 cup glue and 1/2 cup white paint. Mix it well. This will form your spider web. Use less glue and paint, with a ratio of 1 to 1, if you make a small batch of spaghetti.
Take black pipe cleaners and loop them until you have a spider with 8 legs. You may need to cut the pipe cleaners into smaller pieces.
Have your child pick up spaghetti strands 1 by 1 and lay them on the black paper plate. Your child can choose any design they like. When they are finished, place the spider on top of the gluey spaghetti and let it dry overnight.

Consider how you want to represent your hand art.,
Decide how you will design the art.,
Base your supplies on how you plan to approach the project.,
Purchase a different color paint for each handprint.",How to Do Mother's/Father's Day Hand Art1," While you could create the artwork on a piece of paper, you could also apply the idea to a piece of ceramics or a garment (t-shirt or tote bag).;
, You want to create a painted handprint of the parent with the tiny handprint of the child in the middle. Determine if you will use your significant other’s handprint or whether you’ll just use yours. Also, if you have more than one child, how can you position all the handprints so that the tiny hands fit inside the larger hand?

, For example, if you want to create the hand art on paper, tempura paint and heavy paper will be sufficient. However, if you are going to cover fabric or ceramic, you’ll need the appropriate object (i.e. tote bag or ceramic plate) and paint that is appropriate for the materials. For example, enamel paint works well on ceramic pieces whereas acrylic or even specified fabric paints work best on textiles.

, In order for each handprint to represent, you will need each person to choose a color for his or her hand.


Pick up enough paint brushes for each hand so you aren’t constantly cleaning them in between colors.






Procure paint thinner or any other substance that will remove paint easily. However, soap and water will most likely do the trick especially if you clean hands immediately.






Buy a paint pen in order to write the children(s) names and the date on the artwork.







"
"
Prepare an area for painting.,
Clean participant’s hand and dry well.,
Pour the adult hand color into a small dish and then paint one adult hand.,
Press the adult hand down on the object (paper, textile, ceramic, etc.),
Remove hand and then allow the print to completely dry.,
Paint child’s hand and apply it to palm area of the adult’s handprint.,
Remove hand and allow the paint to dry.,
Write a Mother’s or Father’s Day greeting using your paint pen on the artwork.,
Finished.

",How to Do Mother's/Father's Day Hand Art2," Clear a flat surface and cover with either a drop cloth or newspaper.

, You want the clearest handprint you can obtain.

, Cover the entire hand with paint--don’t be stingy!

, and hold. Don’t wiggle or move the hand once it’s pressed against the surface.

, Depending on the climate and humidity dry times vary from a few hours to overnight.

, Guide the child’s hand on the surface to avoid smudging.

, If you are only doing one child’s handprint you can move onto writing the child’s name and date on the piece. If not, allow the hand to fully dry and then apply the next child’s hand to the artwork.

,


Add the child’s name, age and date.






Consider allowing the child to write his or her name on the piece, especially if he or she is young.

",How to Make the Most from Your Old Candles," If you have a bunch of old candles lying around the house, then it'll be easier for you do this project. But don't worry if you don't. You can go to a thrift store and buy bags of candles that are very cheap. You could also talk to friends that you have and see about getting their old candles. Some churches give away old candles.






;
, It is easier if the saucepan has a pouring spout to it. You can also try to fill a pot with water and then put an old can which you will later fill with wax into it. This method will most likely not get the pot as full of wax.








,,,









Attach the end of the wick to the bottom with a drop of paraffin.
Take an old pencil or something similar that is round and long, even a straw and place it over the top of your container.
Place your wick in the middle of the container so that it drapes over the pencil.
Optionally use a piece of tape to hold the wick to the pencil.

, After the wax is completely melted, pour the melted wax into your container. Keep a little bit of the wax in the saucepan to use later. It could take from a few minutes up to a few hours for the candle wax to completely harden. Once the wax is almost completely hard, you will notice that the wax is dipped in right around the wick.








,,,,, This should help the candle let go of the container and help it slide right out.

Buy candle-making materials.,
Choose candle containers.",How to Make Soy Candles1," Soy candles are made from soy wax, which comes in meltable flakes. Craft stores and online sources carry the materials you need to make soy candles. Collect the following supplies:









2 ounces of soy wax flakes for every votive-sized candle you want to make. A 1-pound bag of soy wax chips will make 8 votive candles or 4 medium-sized candles.
Wicks with anchors, which are small metal discs that keep the wick in place in the center of the candles. You'll need one wick for each candle you want to make.
Candle dye. Your candles will naturally come out a creamy white, but you can add candle dye to make them a different color. Make sure you buy dye intended for use in candles, since other types of dye could ruin the wax.
Scented oil. Unscented candles are versatile, but if you like scented candles, look for oils made specifically for candle making. If you need inspiration for picking out a scent, think about choosing one that pairs well with the color of your candle. Consider the following pairings, or come up with your own:

White candles with vanilla or a floral scent.
Pink candles with rose or strawberry scent.
Purple candles with lavender or sugarplum scent.
Yellow candles with banana, lemon or citronella scent, which keeps mosquitoes away when used outside.

;
, As long as it is heat-safe, any type of glass or metal container works well as a container for candles. Think about how you'll be using the candles when you decide what type of container to buy.









If you want to save money, use mason jars or old glass jars you may already have. Jars with lids are particularly nice, since you can use them to prevent dust from accumulating on the candle when it isn't in use.
Votive candle containers are inexpensive and come in a lot of different shapes.
Metal containers are stylish, but keep in mind you won't be able to see the pretty color you chose for the candles unless you use glass containers.

"
"
Wash the containers.,
Anchor the wicks in the containers.,
Wrap the wicks around pencils.,
Set the containers near the stove.",How to Make Soy Candles2," If you're using old glass jars, make sure they're free of food particles and that the labels on the front of the jars are completely removed. Even if you bought brand-new containers, give them a rinse to remove dust and other particles from inside them. Dry the containers thoroughly before proceeding.








, The tiny metal discs at the ends of the wicks should have a sticky backing. Remove the paper from the backing of one of the wick anchors. Place the anchor inside a candle container and affix it to the center of the container's base. Press it down to ensure it will stay in place, and let the top of the wick drape over the lip of the container. Repeat with the remaining wicks and containers.









If your wick anchors don't have sticky backing, affix them to the containers with wax. Light a taper candle and drip a bit of wax on the bottom an anchor, then quickly press the anchor into the center of a container's base. Repeat with the remaining wicks and containers.
If your wicks didn't come with anchors, you can tie them to metal washers and use wax to affix the washers to the candle containers.

, Using one pencil for each candle wick, gently lift each wick and wrap the end around the center of a pencil until you can rest the pencil horizontally across the opening of the candle container and the wick is slightly taut. This will hold the wicks in position when you pour the wax into the containers.








, When the wax is melted, you'll need the containers to be nearby so you can pour it right away, before it gets hard. Set the containers on your counter or kitchen table over some newspaper or wax paper to avoid getting wax on the room's surfaces.








"
"
Melt the wax flakes in a double boiler.,
Add color and fragrance.,
Pour the wax.",How to Make Soy Candles3," Pour water into the bottom part of a double boiler, and pour the wax flakes into the top. Place the boiler over medium high heat and allow the wax flakes to slowly melt, stirring periodically until all the lumps are gone.









If you don't have a double boiler, make one using a large pot and a slightly smaller pot that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water and place the smaller pot inside. Pour the wax flakes into the smaller pot and heat the boiler over medium high heat to allow the wax flakes to melt.
You can also use an electric wax melter, available for sale at craft stores.

, When the wax is completely melted, add a few drops of color and fragrance. A little color and fragrance goes a long way, so use them sparingly, check the color and scent, and add a few more drops if desired.








, Remove the pot containing the wax from heat. Lift the wick-wrapped pencil above the first container, unwrapping it slightly if necessary, and pour wax into the container. Fill the container to just below the rim. Re-wrap the pencil so that the wick is taut and centered, and rest the pencil across the rim of the container. Repeat with the remaining containers.









The melted wax should look clear, and it should be easy to pour. If it starts to turn opaque, that means it's getting hard. You may need to reassemble the double boiler and reheat the wax.

"
"
Wait for the candles to set.,
Trim the wicks.,
Wait to burn the candles.,
Finished.








",How to Make Soy Candles4," The wax will begin to harden almost immediately after you pour it. You'll see the color turning from clear to opaque. Let the candles cool for about three hours before moving to the next step.








, Unravel the pencils from the wicks, and use a scissors to trim them to 1/2 an inch.








, Let the candles completely harden overnight before using them.

Choose a flat-bottomed object with smooth sides to make your mold.,
Fill a large container with damp sand.,
Press the object bottom-first into the sand.,
Pull object out very carefully, so that the sand keeps the shape of your object.,
Consider pressing some objects into the walls of your mold.Choose some glass gems, sea glass, or small shells, and press them party-way into the walls of your mold.,
Press a tabbed wick into bottom of your mold.,
Place two sticks across the opening of your mold, one to either side of the wick.,
Set up a double boiler.,
Add the candle wax into the melting pot and heat it between 260°F and 275°F (126°C and 135°C).,
Pour the melted wax slowly into the sand form, all the way to the top.,
Wait for your first pour of wax to set.,
Heat more wax for your second pour, this time between 175°F and 190°F (80°C and 88°C).Use a higher temperature if you want a thicker shell, and a lower temperature if you want a thinner shell.

,
Consider adding some color or fragrance.,
Pour the wax slowly into the mold, all the way to the top.,
Let the candle sit overnight.The wax may set up sooner than that, but you will need to wait for the sand to dry as well.,
Remove the candle from the sand carefully the next day.,
Gently brush the excess sand off using a soft-bristled brush.,
Consider carving designs into the sand to expose the candle underneath.,
Trim the wicks to about ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters), if necessary.Depending on how long or short your wick is, you may need to trim it down.,
Flatten the bottom of the candle, if necessary.,
Use your candle.",How to Make Sand Candles," It can taper downward, like a bowl, but it should not have anything that sticks out, like a handle. Objects that make great molds include:


Cans, cups, and pillar candles
Cubes and square candle votives
Bowls
Seashells (you will need to smooth the bottom out later);
, Make sure the sand is packed tightly into the container, and that the surface is smooth. You can use anything you want to hold the sand: a bucket, a plastic bin, etc. Whatever you use must be twice the height you want the final candle to be.


The sand will stick to your candle, so make sure that you are happy with the grain, color, and texture.
The sand should be damp enough so that it holds its shape when you squeeze in you hand. It should not be so wet that it is soupy.

, Press the object down until the top is level with the sand. You should only see the top of the object. For a shorter candle, press the object only part-way down into the sand.

, If you accidentally messed up any sand on the surface, smooth it down with your hand after you pull the object out.

, Don't press them all the way into the sand, or they won't stick the to candle. Make sure that the bottom of your object is the part that is sticking out, and the designed part is inside the sand.


Leave these objects in the sand. When you pull the candle out, these items will be embedded inside the candle, and peek through the sand.

, Make sure that the wick is sticking up out of the hole. If it is too short, you won't be able to use your candle. Don't worry if it is too long; you will trim it down later, after the candle sets.

, The wick should be sandwiched between the two sticks. This will hold the wick straight up while you pour the wax., Fill a large saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place it on a stove. Place a spouted melting pot inside the saucepan. You can buy spouted melting pots from the candle making section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, use a heat-safe, glass measuring cup instead.

, Use a candy or cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature. You can use wax flakes or wax cubes. How much wax you melt will depend on how big your mold is. Plan on having some extra wax handy for the second pour, however, as the wax will sink into the sand.


Don't add any color or fragrance into the wax yet. The high temperature may change the color and ruin the scent.
Never leave the melting wax unattended.
If your wax has specific melting instructions, follow those instead. Some waxes have a lower melting and ignition point.

, Don't be alarmed if the wax starts to sink into the sand. You will add more wax later.


Consider pouring the wax over the back of a spoon to prevent too much splattering.
Keep your face away from the mold and wax; there may be some splattering.

, As the wax sets, it will sink into the sand. This is normal, and is what creates that sandy shell.,, Because you are using a lower temperature, you don't have to worry about the color or scent changing.Try using some ocean or tropical-themed scents, such as:


Ocean breeze
Coconut
Orchid
Pomegranate

, Again, keep your face away from the mold and wax, in case of any splattering. Because your mold is already filled with a wax shell, this second pouring of wax won't sink into the sand as much.

, If you pull the candle out too soon, the sand may not stick properly.

, Use a spoon to loosen the sand around the candle, then carefully lift the candle out.

, This will prevent the candle from making a mess on your table when you use it. Depending on how hot your wax was, you may have a subtle sand texture, or a thick shell of sand.

, You can do this with a small spoon. Try doing some organic designs, such as swirls and loops.

, If it is too long, it will become a fire hazard.

, If th candle wobbles too much, turn the candle over and look at the bottom. If you see any lumps or bumps, you will need to smooth them out using a knife.

, Always place a candle stand under your candle to catch any drips or melted wax."
"
Consider the kind of scent you'd like to add to candles.",How to Make Scented Candles1," There is a wide variety of choices, but not all of them will align with your personal preferences. Some are commercially produced from chemicals, some come from plants, while others are based on essential oils. The origin of the scent may impact your choice to use it, especially if you're concerned about chemicals in your home environment. Typical sources of scenting candles include:


Commercial candle making scents: These are in liquid form and are available from most stores that sell candle making supplies. The strength of the scent will vary from brand to brand and whether or not you have access to a full list of ingredients will depend on the manufacturer's willingness to provide this. Expect to use about 1 ounce of liquid scent to every 2 pounds of melted wax.
Fragrance oils: These are 100% synthetic and are not specifically made for candles but usually still work for scenting them. The same issues as the commercial scents apply. Most are highly concentrated, so use of these should be sparing. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of fragrance oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Essential oils: These are produced naturally from plants such as herbs and flowers. They have specific properties, which can be found by doing an online search or using a book on essential oils. Not all essential oils will work well with wax, so you may need to do a test first. Expect to use about 10-15 drops of essential oil per 1 pound of melted wax.
Natural sources of scent: This covers such things as crushed or powdered plants, spices and herbs, finely ground zest, etc. Some work really well with melted wax, such as ground cinnamon, crushed lavender flowers or finely ground lemon zest. Others may not meld as well though, or can stop the wax from turning hard or prevent the wick from burning, so do your research first. Expect to use about 1 teaspoon of ground spice, herb or zest per 1 pound of wax.;
"
"
Light a fragrance-free candle.,
Use a pipette or dropper to add a single drop of essential into the melted wax puddle.,
Expect the scent to begin wafting out as the candle continues to burn.",How to Make Scented Candles2," Allow it to burn until a small melted wax puddle forms around the flame area.


The candle should lack fragrance, else it may overpower or mix poorly with the scent you're adding.

, Avoid placing the oil anywhere near the actual flame.

, Top up as often as needed.

"
"
Consider designing the leaf pattern first.,
Fill the long jar with boiling water.

,
Dip the candle into the water.,
Remove from the jar and place on parchment paper.,
Dip the candle into the hot water again.,
Drip a few drops of essential oil down the sides of the candle before it solidifies.,
Repeat with as many candles as you'd like to make.",How to Make Scented Candles3," This will ensure that you arrange the leaves in a thoughtful way rather than quickly rushing to push them on. Look at at the leaves you have and imagine how they'll look and try to line them up in readiness for pressing on the candle.

,, Hold it in place from the wick for 1 to 2 minutes. Ensure that it is all submerged.

, Place the leaves onto the softened candle surface, using tweezers. Press in place gently.


Work quickly, once the wax solidifies, the leaves are stuck in place and no more can be added.

, The leaves will be sealed behind a new layer of melted wax.


Further dipping in the hot water will shift the pressed leaves further into the candle. Bear this in mind if adding more layers of leaves, as some will be deeper in, some closer to the outside if you approach this in several goes.

, Aim for an even distribution. Let set.

, These candles will keep for a very long time, but you may need to infuse more essential oil after long-term storage.

Get a suitable mold, then set it aside.,
Assemble your double boiler.,
Measure out your wax, then add it to the pouring pot.,
Melt the wax until it reaches 175 to 185°F (80 to 85°C).,
Consider adding some fragrance and/or color to your wax.,
Attach your tabbed wick to the bottom of the mold.,
Fill the mold one-half to three-fourths of the way with ice.,

Wait for the wax to harden.,
Consider doing a second pour in a contrasting color.,
Take the candle out of the mold.,
Leave the candle in a sink or bowl for a few days so that the water can drain.,
Trim the wick down to ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), ten use your candle.Trimming the wick down will prevent the wax from smoking as it burns.",How to Make Ice Candles1," You can use a tin candle-making mold, a cardboard tube with a solid bottom, or even a half-pint to pint-sized milk carton.If you are using a milk carton, open up the top all the way or cut it off so that you have a square-shaped opening.


Keep your work area clean by placing the mold on top of a baking sheet.You can also cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil first for easy clean up.;
, Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place your candle-making pouring pot inside. If you do not own a candle-making pouring pot, you can use a large, glass measuring cup instead.Consider placing a metal lid or a cookie cutter under the pouring pot/measuring cup. This will ensue that the wax is receiving equal amounts of heat from all sides., You will only be using one-half to three-quarters of your mold, and half of that will be taken up by ice. Measure your wax accordingly. As a precaution, however, it might be a good idea to add 1 to 2 ounces (cc to cc grams) of wax in case something spills.If you are using a block of wax, you will need to cut it up into smaller chunks first. If you are using wax pellets or shavings, you do not need to cut them up.
If you can't get any candle-making wax, you can use old candles instead. Make sure that they are all the same color, however.

, Turn the heat up to medium-low, and let the water come to a soft boil; do not let the water come to a roiling boil, however.As the wax starts to melt, stir it often to help it melt evenly.


Do not leave the wax unattended. Melting wax is combustible.
If you are using old candles, be sure to pull the old wicks out with a fork or a pair of chopsticks once the wax has melted.

, Most candle-making wax is either white, ivory, or clear. It is almost always unscented. You can leave it like this if you want something simple, or you can make it look (and smell) more interesting by adding some dyes or fragrances. It is best to use dyes and fragrances intended for candle-making. Stir the wax until the dyes and/or fragrances are completely mixed in, with no streaks or swirls.Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of fragrance per 1 pound (455 grams) of wax.
How much dye you add depends on how dark you want the candle to be. Start with a few drops of liquid dye, or a few shavings of a dye block. In a pinch, you can use a chunk or two of a crayon—just remove the wrapper first!

, The easiest way to do this would be to dip the tabbed part of the wick into the melted wax, then to quickly press it against the bottom of the mold.Alternatively, you can add a few drops of wax into the bottom of the mold first, then insert the wick.Can't get a tabbed candle wick? Make your own by tying a paper clip to the bottom of a plain candle wick.
Can't get any wicks at all? Use a long candle stick instead. You will have to cut it down starting from the bottom until it is about the same height as your mold, however.

, To prevent large holes or gaps, make sure that the ice chunks are no bigger than ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter).Also, make sure that the wick is centered at all times, or it will end up being crooked when you pour the wax.Experiment with using different shapes and sizes of ice cubes. You can even crush some of them with a hammer.

, Move the pouring pot around as you pour so that you are not pouring in one spot constantly.A great idea would be to pour in a swirl or zigzag pattern.


The pouring pot/measuring cup will be hot. Use an oven mitt or a pot holder to handle it.

, It will take about 1 to 2 hours for the wax to harden.Do not disturb the wax as it sets.

, At this point, your candle is almost done. You can choose to take it out of the mold in the next step, or you can pour wax in a contrasting color over it. If you take it out now, your candle will have holes in it. If you fill it with more wax, you'll get a multi-colored candle. If you want a multi-colored candle, do the following:Melt and dye your candle wax as before. If you used fragrance, make sure that it is the same one.
Pour the wax carefully over the candle; make sure that you pour it from different places.
Let the wax harden again. It will take longer this time because you aren't using any ice.

, You can try sliding the candle out. If it won't come out, try tearing the mold away from it instead. It might be a good idea to do this over a sink as there will be lots of water.

, You may need to rotate the candle from time to time to help the water drain from all of the holes.

, Remember to set it down on a heat-safe surface, such as a dish or a candle charger, to protect your table from melting wax.

Find two different sized cans.,
Clean the cans well and peel off any labels.,
Fill the larger can with some water, then place smaller can inside of it.,
Fill the smaller can with enough rocks until the rim is level with the larger can's rim.,
Tape the rims of the cans together so that the smaller can stays in the center.Cut four equal-sized pieces of tape, and stick them to the top, bottom, and sides of the small can's rim.,
Consider adding some greenery.,
Check the water level, then pour or add more water if needed.,
Freeze the water.,
Take the ice luminary out of the mold.,
Use the luminary with flameless candles.",How to Make Ice Candles2," You want your first can to be at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wider and taller than your second can. This extra space will eventually be filled with ice to make the sides and top/bottom of your luminary.Try to use cans with smooth walls rather than ribbed walls. This will make removing the ice easier.
You can also use plastic containers, such as old yogurt tubs or food storage containers. Glass is not recommended, as the expanding ice can cause it to shatter., Don't worry if there is any glue residue on the cans, as this won't stick to the ice; any paper will stick, however., Start by filling the larger can about half-way with water, then float the smaller can inside of it. Don't worry, you can always add more water later on.


Add some food coloring into the water for an interesting effect!

, Do not let your small can sink all the way to the bottom; you want both rims to be level with each other, and about a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of space between the two cans at the bottom.The water level will rise as the smaller can sinks into the water. Make sure that the water is ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the larger can's rim. If there is too much water, pump some of it out with a baster.
If you can't find any rocks, you can use other items from your kitchen or garden, such as pebbles, rice, dried beans, marbles, etc.

, Carefully fold the pieces of tape over onto the larger can's rim. This will help the small can float in the center, and ensure that your luminary will be the same thickness all around.

, At this point, your candle is just about ready for freezing. You can make it more festive, however, by filling it with bright items from your kitchen or garden. Here are some ideas:


For a spring luminary: bright green leaves, pieces of fern, and/or spring flowers (ie: Johnny-Jump-Ups)
For a fall luminary: brightly-colored leaves, orange slices, and or spices (ie: cinnamon sticks or star anise)
For a winter luminary: sprigs of pine, tiny pinecones, twigs, and/or holly berries.
For a summer luminary: leafy herbs (ie: basil or mint), citrus slices (ie: lime or lemon), and/or brightly-colored flowers.

, As you add more items into the water, the water level will rise. You want it to be ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the rim of the large can. The water will expand as it freezes, and if the water level is too high, it will over flow.If you have too much water, pump it out using a baster. This way, you won't risk messing up your added greenery.
If you don't have enough water, carefully pour it in a thin stream into the space between the two cans.

, If it is below freezing outside, simply leave your can outside overnight. If it is above freezing, stick the can into your freezer overnight. Remember, the larger your container is, the longer it will take to freeze.

, Run lukewarm or cool water over the outside and inside of your luminary until you can move the cans around. Peel the tape away, then slide the luminary out of the large can. Carefully pull the smaller can out.


Do not use hot water, as this may cause the ice to crack., You can use these luminaries right-side-up or upside-down. Because they are made out of ice, they do not last forever. If you cannot find any flameless candles, you can use real tea lights instead, but keep in mind that the flame will cause the ice to melt faster. The melting ice may also extinguish the candle.


If you want a centerpiece for your table, place the luminary with the hole facing up. Stick a flameless candle into the hole.
If you want to light your pathway, place a flameless candle down on the ground, then place the luminary over it, flat side up.

Select a suitable candle.,
Choose where you want the glitter to be placed on the candle.",How to Make Glitter Candles1," Any candle with a decent surface area will work well with glitter. This might be tall, taper candles; thick, wide candles, or even high votive candles. Choose the color of the candle the color of the glitter to complement or match one another.

, This might be just a solid section at the base, middle or top of the candle. Or, you could be fancy and add designs, such as wavy stripes, spots or letters.


If making a design, use paper templates to stick around the candle and guide where to add the glue and glitter.

Find a bowl or glass to make your candles with.,
Heat gel at 210 degrees Fahrenheit.In order to soften up the gel material, you'll need to heat it up on a stove top.,
Pour your gel into the candle bowl.,
Add ""glow in the dark"" powder to the mix.,
Add a wick.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Candles1," Gel-based candles are best if you want them to glow. This is because the paraffin wax used in wax candles is difficult to combine with ""glow in the dark"" powder. Because gel candles don't have the same stability as wax ones, it's a good idea to make them in the bowl you'll be burning them in. Get a small, clear glass bowl. Make sure the glass material is clear. That way, you'll be able to see the glowing properties across the body of the candle.


A small goldfish bowl is a recommended choice. It's small, made of clear glass, and has an opening at the top for the wick and flame to go.
If you want to make a bunch of small tea candles, the shells of used-up regular candles work perfectly. With these, you'll have a suitable mould of a candle already in place.;
, Place it in a double boiler pot and heat to 210 degrees. Use a thermometer to get the precise readout. To make a double-boiler, you should put a smaller pot in a larger pot, then proceed to fill the larger pot with water to boil. When you're ready, you can remove the smaller pot and pour the gel into the candle moulds.


The Celsius equivalent is 99 degrees.
If you do not have a thermometer, use a stick or spatula and stir to gauge how soft the gel has become. The gel should be a thick, syrupy consistency when it's ready to pour., With your gel heated, it's time to pour it into the mould. Unlike paraffin wax moulds, the mould for a gel-based candle should be the bowl it will ultimately be used in. A clear, glass bowl is recommended for this instance.

, Because gel is so easy to work with, it's a simple process to work the active powder in the mix. In order to get a really vibrant looking colour for your candles, you should keep your candle at a mix of about 20% powder and 80% gel.Although the specific proportions will depend based on the bowl you're making your candle in, you can roughly estimate proportions based on how much of the bowl the first-added material occupies before filling up the rest with the second.


With about an ounce (approximately 30 grams) of glow powder, you should be able to make at least half a dozen six-inch (15cm) tall candles.""Glow in the dark"" powder does not dissolve into the gel. Rather, it is suspended in the middle of the gel. This is why it is better for gels and has a worse-off time when used with wax candles.""Glow in the dark"" powder can be purchased at most arts and crafts stores. Otherwise, it can be ordered specially online.

, Adding a wick should be done while everything else has been completed but the candle is still in a melted form. Grab the tip with a pair of tweezers and lower it slowly into the candle. Take care to ensure that the wick is in the relative centre of your candle, and take care to keep it straight. This will ensure that the wick manages to last throughout the entirety of the candle.


As always, tabbed wicks are the best, as they're specifically designed with the issue of adding them in mind.

Cover your workspace with butcher paper or a similar covering.,
Add the glue according to the chosen design.,
Sprinkle the candle with glitter.,
Rotate the candle to keep adding glitter.,
Finish the candle with the layer of spray adhesive.,
Let the glitter sit for a while to settle.",How to Make Glitter Candles2," Grab an empty paper plate; the plate will be for catching the loose glitter.;
, If adding a template, tape on first, then only spread the glue in the cut-out area. If doing sections, only spray the adhesive in sections at a time, to avoid the glue drying out before you reach each section with the glitter.

, It will only stick where the spray adhesive has been placed.

, Continue rotating until the whole candle is covered.

, This creates a protective layer to prevent the glitter from falling off the candle.

, When fully dried and set, the candle is ready for use as usual. The glitter will burn along with the candle.

"

Cover your workspace with butcher paper.,
Pour Mod Podge into the bowl.,
Cover the candle on one side with the Mod Podge.,
Sprinkle edible glitter over the candle.,
Tap any excess glitter onto the plate.,
Allow the one side to dry.,
Finished.",How to Make Glitter Candles3," Grab a clean bowl and an empty paper plate. You’ll fill the bowl with your Mod Podge and then use the paper plate to catch errant glitter.

, Have everything ready to go including the glitter bottles (opened), candle unwrapped and paintbrush tapped for loose bristles.

, Dip the paintbrush into the Mod Podge and cover one side of the candle with glue. Work quickly, as you don’t want the Mod Podge to dry before adding the glitter.

, Catch any excess on the paper plate. Be sure to cover the candle well so that no hint of the wax is showing (or areas of the candle you don’t want to show).

, Recycle for another use. You want full coverage but you probably don’t want glitter to fall from the candle onto your cake; it's safe enough but not really meant to be eaten.

, Then repeat the process on the other side of the candle.

, Once dried, the candle is ready for use.

Melt paraffin wax.,
Pour wax into moulds.,
Insert the wick.,
Allow the candle time to harden before removing.Most candles need up to 2 hours to harden sufficiently.,
Use ""glow in the dark"" paint to cover your candles.Glow in the dark powder may be used in wax-based candles.,
Roll glow powder over your wax candles.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Candles2," Add your wax flakes into a double-boiler pot and heat the wax up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. This will liquify your flakes and prepare them for proper pouring. To make a double-boiler at home, place your wax in a small pot, and place that pot in a bigger pot. Fill the larger pot with water and let it boil. Use a thermometer to gauge the heat of the wax and pour it into your chosen moulds when you're ready.


The Celsius equivalent heat is 65 degrees.
If you don't have a thermometer, you can tell the wax is ready for pouring by a fine film that develops around the edges of the pot., A mould will be the thing that dictates the shape of your candle. A muffin tray or cookie cutter shape can work to this effect, although you can make a candle mould of your own design by wrapping aluminum foil in a cylindrical shape. Once you have your mould prepared, pour the wax slowly into the hole. Take care to be cautious with it, as hot wax can be painful if it gets in contact with skin.


Be sure to coat your moulds with a petroleum jelly or cooking spray. This will make it easier to pick the candles out of the moulds once you're done with them., Because some of your ""glow in the dark"" candles may be fairly big, adding an effective wick to the candle may take some effort. Generally speaking, you'll want the wick to trace down to the base of the candle. Keep the wick straight, and try to gently nudge it into the liquid wax. DO your best to make sure it stays in the relative centre of your candle.


Tabbed wicks are the recommended option for wax candles, as they help to hold the wicks in place once they're settled.

, While your candle is hardening, give it time to rest and go do something else. After it's ready to be taken out, remove the candle carefully by its wick.

, However, due to the melting properties of wax, it may be difficult to mix the powder in thoroughly.With that in mind, a ""glow in the dark"" paint coating the outside of your candle is an easier substitute. These paints come in a variety of different colours, and should be applied generously to the candles you're preparing.


Wait until the candles have finished hardening before you cover them with paint.
If you want, you can use a combination of the ""glow in the dark"" paint and some of the powder as well. This will ensure that you get at least some of the powder's thoroughness, with the even spread that paint can offer.

, Alternatively, you can add glow powder to the exterior of your candles.To do so, you should finish your basic paraffin candle. Next, unwrap a length of parchment paper and sprinkle a generous dose of glow powder onto it. From there, lay the candle down and roll it around. The candle will pick up the pieces of glow powder.

"
"
Draw on the candles.,
Place your candles near a mirror.,
Consider buying a professional ""glow in the dark"" candle.,
Look up ideas for creative inspiration.Sites like Instagram and Pinterest showcase countless arts and crafts ideas.",How to Make Glow in the Dark Candles3," Because the body of your candle will glow in the dark, you can create vivid patterns by covering up parts of the candle with a black marker. Draw shapes or patterns around, making sure to cover the coloured area thoroughly.


If you want to create a glow in the dark shape on your candle, you can ""reverse draw"" something, by colouring in the area around it and leaving a stencilled shape. This is perfect if you're making your glow candles for Halloween and want to make glowing shapes of spiders, ghosts and other assorted spooky denizens.

, A mirror offers a great opportunity to double the effective light of a ""glow in the dark"" candle. Place a table mirror near your candle for an extra glow. Mirrors by themselves can be used to spooky effect, so there shouldn't be anything stopping you from incorporating one into your presentation.

, Although there is a certain joy in making things from home, there are at-home and professional outlets that sell beautiful custom-made candles online.Looking at some of these candles may be good if you're not a DIY type.

, If you're looking for fresh ways of spicing up your ""glow in the dark"" candles, it may be a good idea to check on what other people have done first. You may choose to follow the idea someone else has designed. Better still, seeing the creativity of others may trigger an original idea of your own.

Gather your ingredients.Ingredients for candles may be purchased at arts and crafts store.,
Place wax in a double-boiler and heat to 185 degrees.A double boiler or hot plate will suffice while heating your wax.,
Introduce dye chips while heating.Dye chips will give your candles a pleasant colour.,
Heat the wax.,
Coat your tray with cooking spray.If you don't coat your mould with cooking spray or petroleum jelly before hand, your candles will put up a hassle when you try to take them out.,
Pour your wax into the tray slots.Once the heat is off, pick up the pitcher with wax.,
Add the wick.,
Allow the candles time to harden.,
Remove candles from tray.,
Pick a pot or vase.You can use any sort of pot or vase, so long as its clear.,
Add decorative gems or sand to the vase bottom.Floating candles are all about creating an ethereal atmosphere.,
Add water to the vase.,
Place candles in the vase.,
Light your candles.",How to Make Floating Candles," Quantities for each ingredient will vary, dependent on the size and amount of candles you plan to make. However, half a pound of wax equals to 10-12 small candles, and candles only require one wick each. You should check your mould tray for a point of reference if you're unsure about quantity.









Paraffin wax.Half a pound of wax should serve you well for a home set of candles. If you're feeling thrifty however, you can melt down old candles into fresh wax.
Drops of essential oil. These are essential, and can be used if you want to give your candles a scent. Only a couple of drops per candle will be needed to get the scent.
Baking tray mould. The size of your mould will determine how large the candles will be. Small muffin candles will burn for approximately one hour. Large muffin tray candles will go on for about three.Tart moulds and cookie cutters can be used as well for this, so long as there's a moulded slot for a candle to settle in.
Pretabbed candle wicks. Making sure to get pretabbed wicks can take some of the hassle out of adding them into the wax.
Dye chips.Dye chips are specifically made for use in homemade candles. They're small, but effective, so you'll probably only need around one per candle. You can eyeball the effects of the dye chips as you add them.;
, If you're using a double boiler, bring the outside water to a boil first before adding the wax. A double boiler is prepared by filling a larger pot with water to boil, and setting a smaller pot in the middle. The boiling water on the outside will heat up whatever's inside the smaller pot.








Do not apply direct heat to candle wax. It can catch fire if you do.
An empty coffee can will suffice for heating candle wax if you don't have an extra pot or pitcher to place in your double boiler.A small coffee can is a good alternative for someone who doesn't have a pot large enough to make a double boiler.

, One dye chip per pound of wax should be enough to ensure a bold colour. It's important to add your dye while the candles are heated. That way, they'll be able to disperse throughout the wax with stirring. Dye chips are designed specifically for use in DIY candle-making, so they tend to mix with wax very well.








Mix it in with a wooden spoon to ensure the dye is consistent in the candles.
Essential oils are added for the sake of scent, and should be added to the pot as soon as you've turned off the heat.

, Paraffin wax needs to be 150 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be ready for pouring.If you have a thermometer at hand, place it in the wax and gauge the temperature. Check the consistency periodically. You can do this by placing a wooden spoon in the boiler pitcher and gently stirring the wax around.









If you don't have a thermometer, wait until a thin film forms around the edges of your pitcher., Because you'll ultimately be taking them up held by their fragile wick, you'll want to minimize that resistance early on.









Excessive spray isn't necessary. Just make sure the bottom of each mould slot is evenly sprayed. Being thorough at this stage prevents hassle later down the road.

, Pour it into each of the holes in your mould, and try to get the wax as evenly distributed as possible. If you don't have enough, you should be able to eyeball how much more you'll need to heat to finish the job.









Pour slowly and steadily. The wax will be hot, and pouring it quickly could risk injuring yourself.
Cookie cutters are a great alternative. You'll be able to make interesting shapes out of your candle wax.To make a cookie cutter into a mould, run masking tape along the edge and bend the cutter so it can rest firmly on a sheet of aluminum foil. This will be a good makeshift foundation for the candles to rest upon.
Muffin tray are the most common choice for homemade candle moulds. However, you can use just about any type of mould your kitchen has to offer, so long as the slots are small enough to make working floating candles.

, Give the heated wax a few minutes to settle and cool. From there, you should be able to add wicks with the hopes they'll stand up in the wax. Tabbed wicks are generally easier to add because the tab helps to guide and secure the wick in place.









You can use a toothpick or bamboo skewer to fix the wick after adding it if it falls., Once the wicks have set, candles take up to two hours to harden completely.Set them aside, and occupy your time with something else while they settle.








, Once your candle have been given enough time to settle, pull them up gently using the wicks. Use a piece of paper towel to wipe off any extra gunk away from the candles once they've removed and ready to set.








If you try to take out the candles too soon, they'll become harder to remove. If you've made this mistake and want to fix it, put them in the freezer for a few minutes, then take them out and try again., You should aim for one with a wide base to ensure the most room for candles. Glass orbs with a to-the-side opening are a great choice with floating candles, as the surrounding glass helps intensify the flame light.








, You can get this impression further across by decorating the base of the vase. Adding sand to the bottom will give the vase an aquatic vibe. Using decorative gems will give your vase fantasy-based atmosphere.









Clear and coloured stones are both welcome additions to the base of the vase as well.It's best to keep your base to a single type of decoration. Otherwise, it will look messy and hurt the atmosphere.
Shake the pot gently around to get the stones evenly across the base. Make sure you add the stones before the water to avoid making a mess when you spread the foundation.

, For the maximum effect, you should fill your vase between 50-75% with water. Add your stones or other base decorations to the vase before filing with water. This will eliminate the risk of splashing, and make it easier to even out the stones across the base.








, Place the unlit candles gently in the pot holding the wick. Don't try to put them in holding the wax, as you'll risk capsizing them in the water. Continue to add the candles until the pot begins to look crowded. Try not to overcrowd the pot, as this will hurt the peaceful aesthetic you're trying to create.








, If your pot as a wide opening and there aren't a lot of candles, you can light them with a regular pocket lighter. In most cases however, a trigger-operated firestarter is preferable. With a firestarter, you can stick the fire nozzle into the pot without the risk of burning your hand in the process.

Paraffin wax was traditionally used for candles, but as a petroleum product it may not be the best for the air in your home. Soy wax is easy to find, simple to use, and is a clean vegetable-based wax.


Beeswax candles can actually purify the air, but the wax must be mixed with another oil to lower the melting point so that you can actually burn the candle. To use beeswax, consider blending it with palm oil at a half and half ratio.For a recycled candle project, keep the leftover wax from old candles and combine and use the wax to create new candles.;
, You can use almost any mold you like to make a candle, as long as the mold is durable enough to withstand the heat from hot wax. Different molds will give you different candle shapes, so feel free to experiment.Craft stores and candle suppliers will have special candle molds to make free-standing pillar candles, but you can also use clean, empty juice boxes, tins, or milk cartons.
Use clean glass jars, mason jars, or old candle jars to make a candle in a jar.
Try cookie cutters or baking molds to create special candles, or muffin tins to make votive candles.
For candles that stay in the mold, consider using hollowed fruit (such as an intact orange peel or pumpkin bottom), special tins, or sea shells., To make your own candle, you will also need a lead-free wick, double boiler to melt the wax, a thermometer, candle dye if you want a colored candle, and fragrance if you want a scented candle.


Scents and dyes can be purchased from most craft or candle supply stores. Candle dyes come in the form of liquids, blocks, or chips, and scents can either be fragrance or essential oils., Sometimes wax comes in chips, but sometimes it will come in a large block. If your wax is in a block, cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the wax into the top pot of your double boiler. Fill the bottom pot with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the top pot inside the bottom pot and heat the double boiler on medium heat, stirring every few minutes.


Consider using an old pot or a specially designated candle pot for this project that won’t be used for food as well, since the waxes, dyes, and scents may never fully wash out. You can find cheap pots at garage sales or thrift stores, or you can splurge on a special candle-making pot, which has a different handle and a pour spout.
For a DIY double boiler, place a large, heat-safe glass bowl on top of a metal saucepan. Fill the saucepan with water and the glass bowl with wax.
Two cups (227.5 g) of wax will yield an eight-ounce candle,four cups (455 g) of wax will yield a 16-ounce candle, and six cups of wax (682.5 g) will yield a 24-ounce candle.

, While you're waiting for the wax to finish melting, you can prepare the wick by stiffening it with wax, which will make it easier to maneuver when you pour the candle.


When enough candle wax has melted that you can access it easily, hold the wick by the base, dip it into the melted wax to coat it, and pull it out. Straighten the wick and let it dry.Once dry, take the wick and dip the base into the wax to coat it. Press the base of the wick into the bottom center of your candle mold (use a spoon or chopstick if necessary), and hold it there for a few seconds to allow the wax to dry and glue the wick in place.Lay a pencil across the rim of your candle mold and wrap the excess wick around it to keep the wick straight and in place when you pour the candle.

, When your wax is fully melted, remove it from the heat and add your dye. If you're using dye chips or a block, cut them into smaller chunks before adding them. To make a multicolored candle, separate the wax into different containers and then add the individual dye colors. Stir well to evenly distribute the dye throughout the wax.


Use a thermometer to keep an eye on the wax temperature, and when it reaches 185 F (85 C), add the fragrance.Add 15 drops of fragrance for an eight-ounce candle, 30 drops for a 16-ounce candle, and 45 drops for a 24-ounce candle., Fill the mold with the wax, but leave a quarter-inch (63 mm) of space between the top of the candle and the top of the mold. To make a multicolored candle, pour your first color, and give it about an hour to dry (you may need to keep your other wax colors warm during this time). After the wax has started to harden, add your next wax color. Repeat until you have poured all the wax.When you’ve poured all your wax, wrap the candle in a towel to stop it from shrinking and cracking., Allow the candle to cure for 24 hours, then remove the pencil and trim the wick to one-half inch (1.3 cm). If you made a candle in a mold that needs to be removed, place the candle in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before removing the candle from the mold., You can purchase thin sheets of wax from a craft store that can be punched or cut into shapes to decorate the surface of a pillar or free-standing candle. Using wax sheets in your desired colors, use a craft punch, cookie cutter, or sharp knife to cut the wax sheet into shapes. To affix the shapes to the candle:Use a heat gun or blow dryer to soften a wax cut-out, then warm the candle in the spot where you want to attach the shape. Press the shape into the outside of the candle, and hold it there for a minute to allow the wax to dry.

, This method will work best on a light candle that’s not in a mold, because you are going to use tissue paper to transfer a pattern, image, or decoration directly onto the candle. Choose the image or pattern you want to decorate your candle, and then:Gently tape a piece of white tissue paper to a piece of regular printer paper, and print the pattern onto the tissue paper.
Wrap the printed tissue paper around the candle and cut the paper to size. Or, if you're using an image, cut out the shape of the image.
Use a non-toxic glue to affix the tissue paper in place around the candle.
Wrap the candle in wax paper, and apply heat from a heat gun or blow dryer. As the wax heats up, it will saturate and absorb the tissue paper, leaving only the image or pattern on the paper visible. Remove the wax paper and allow the candle to dry.To use this decorative method on a jar candle, print off your pattern onto tissue paper (of any color), and then use a paint brush to apply liquid craft glue to affix the tissue paper to the outside of the jar.

, You can use opaque paint markers and glitter pens to paint a jar candle or directly onto the candle itself. You can experiment with shapes, designs, images, or anything else you desire. Use the paint pen for the major design, and then add points of interest with the glitter pen.For festive ideas, consider painting a tree or ornaments for Christmas, leaves for fall or Thanksgiving, hearts for Valentine’s day, flowers for spring, and snowflakes for winter.

, Take a cup (240 g) of Epsom salts and stir in food coloring in your desired color (or leave them white). Start with 10 drops, and add more until you achieve the desired intensity. Lay them out on a plate. Then, dip a paint brush in a non-toxic liquid craft glue and use the glue to paint designs or patterns (or the entire thing) onto the jar or candle. When the glue is still wet, roll the candle or jar in the pile of Epsom salts., Thinly sliced dried fruit and flowers can be glued onto a candle or jar to create a rustic and earthy candle. Use a non-toxic craft glue to affix the flowers or fruits onto the candle or jar. Arrange the flowers any way you like.If you're attaching the flowers directly to the candle, consider dipping the candle in hot, clear wax one last time after the flowers are attached. This will help seal them and keep them in place.

Gather your supplies.Rolled candles are one of the easiest and fastest types to make, so this is a perfect first project for beginners.,
Cut the beeswax and soften it with a hair dryer.Use a straightedge ruler and a craft knife to cut the beeswax sheet into 2 8-inch squares.,
Push the wick down onto the wax square and roll.,
Seal the candle.After you’ve finished rolling, put pressure on the edge of the wax with your fingers.,
Prime the wicks.If you aren’t using pre-primed wicks, you’ll need to prime yours before lighting the candles.,
Trim the wicks.Once the wicks are primed, trim both to ¼ inch.",How to Make Candles at Home1," Before you begin, be sure to cover your work area with butcher paper or newspaper. This procedure will create two 8 x 7/8-inch rolled taper candles. You will need:

One 8 x 16-inch beeswax sheet
One 10-inch-length braided wick
1 to 2 ounces paraffin wax (optional, for priming the wick);
, The wax now needs to be softened slightly, which you can do with a hair dryer.

Make sure to set the hair dryer on “low” to avoid melting the wax too much.

, Locate one edge of the wax square, then press the wick down into it, making sure that 1 inch of the wick extends from each side. Start rolling the wax. As you roll, make sure to keep the edges even and keep the rolling wax tight around the wick.For the tightest roll, try placing a piece of waxed paper between your fingers and the beeswax. Keep the waxed paper moving so that it doesn’t get stuck in the rolled beeswax.
Using the waxed paper will also protect the beeswax from the warmth of your fingers, which can complicate the roll by softening the wax so much that it comes hard to work with.

, Push the edge into the candle, which will seal it. If the wax is too hard to work with, use the “low” heat setting on your hair dryer to soften it up.

The first candle is complete.
Repeat the exact same actions with the second square of beeswax to create the second candle.

, Priming will keep the wick rigid, which means it will burn better. You do this by soaking the wick in wax, which removes any air bubbles that might exist.The easiest way to prime is to use two small pieces of wax sheet and simply press them around the wicks.

An alternate method is melting paraffin wax in a double boiler over medium heat.
Once it’s melted, dip the ends of the wicks into the wax for 5 seconds.
Allow them to cool completely before lighting them.

, This is the optimal length for burning, so that the flame doesn’t get too large. The candles are now ready to light. When lit, the flames should be about 1 to 2 inches high. The wax should pool around the wick. It should not spill over the side.If the wax is spilling over, the wick you’ve used is too small for the diameter of the candle.
If there is very little wax pooling around the wick and it’s not burning properly, the wick is too large for the diameter of the candle.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your jars.,
Attach the stickum to the wick.,
Drop the wick into the jar.,
Attach the wick holders.,
Melt the wax flakes.,
Add the colorant to the wax.,
Add the scent.,
Pour the candle.,
Allow the candle to cure for 24 hours.",How to Make Candles at Home2," This procedure will create 1 jar candle. If you decide to use a glass receptacle that isn’t a mason jar, be sure that the thickness of the glass is similar. Thin glass can crack once the candle is lit. Before you begin, cover your work area with butcher paper or newspaper.1 pound bag of soy wax flakes
Wax colorant; chips, bars or in liquid form
Candle pouring pot
Medium sized wicks and wick stickums
Wick holder sticks
Wooden spoon
1 Pint-sized mason jar – 5 inches (height) x 3 inches (width)
Scent oil of your choice (optional)

, Remove the inner seal part of the mason jar lid, since the finished candles won’t make use of them. Clean your jars with warm water and mild soap. Wipe them completely dry, especially the inside, where the wax will be poured. For best results, the wax should be poured into a clean, dry vessel.One pint-sized mason jar will use almost the entire bag of wax flakes.
If you want to make multiple candles of this size, multiply the supplies accordingly.
You will need about a pound of wax flakes for each candle.

, Run your fingers along the wick to smooth it out, since they often become crinkled in their packaging – you will need the wick to be as straight as possible. Prepackaged wicks will come with a thin, circular metal base already attached to the end.









The wick stickum, which is essentially a double-sided sticky sheet of paper, will also be circular in shape.
Peel it off its packaging and stick it directly onto the bottom of the metal base., The stickum you’ve just attached will keep the wick and its metal base firmly attached to the bottom of the mason jar. Drop the wick into the jar, metal base first. Aim for the center, but it doesn’t have to be exact.









Use the end of a spoon or some other utensil to press the metal base securely to the glass.
Once you pull the spoon away, the stickum will keep the wick and its metal base firmly in place.

, Wick holders are two small wooden rods with rubber bands on each end. These will hold your wicks straight up in the middle of the jar during the pouring process and while the wax is setting. Try to balance the wick as close to the center as possible to avoid a crooked wick.








If a wick is crooked and the wax sets, it won’t burn straight or well.
Once you put the holders in place, you won’t be removing them for about 24 hours to allow the wax to fully set.

, Pour all of the flakes into a large pot. Place the pot on your stove and turn the burner on the lowest heat possible. You will leave it at this setting during the entire melting process. You will need to keep the wax melted, but never boiling.









Stir the wax and continue stirring almost constantly as the max melts all the way down.
White wax flakes will look yellowish when melted down, so don’t be alarmed when you see that.

, If you’re using chips or blocks for colorant, use a knife to break them up into chunks the size of small marbles. Refer to the packaging of your product, since it may have specific instructions for ratios to achieve specific shades. Otherwise you can experiment. Pour in some of the chips, stir well and then observe the shade. If you want the color to be brighter, add a little more. Stir well.








You can start by using the primary colorants (red, blue, yellow) straight, or you can mix them to create secondary colors.
Achieving exact colors and shades will take a bit of practice.
You can add as much color as you want – the colorant won’t have a negative effect on the soy wax.

, Scented candle making oils are sold in all craft stores and come in almost every fragrance you can imagine. Choose your favorite or try something new. The ratio of scent is usually 1 ounce of oil for every pound of wax.

Since you’re working with about a pound of wax, you will need to measure out 1 ounce of your fragrance oil.
Pour it in and stir vigorously., Remove the wax from the heat. For best results, allow the wax to cool for about 20-30 minutes before you pour it into the jar. It should be thickened but still pourable. The consistency you want is close to a fruit smoothie in thickness. If you pour the wax too soon, before it’s cooled down sufficiently, the center of your candle may end up sagging or cracking once it has set.








Pour the wax carefully into the mason jar, stopping just under the base of the lid, leaving about 1 to 2 inches of empty space at the top.
Work carefully to pour around the wick. Try not to nudge it.
If you do, move it immediately back into place as best as you can.

, After you’ve poured the wax, leave the candle to set, with the wick holders still holding the wick firmly in place. Unless you live in a very hot climate, your candle will probably be cured slightly sooner than the full 24 hours but for best results, give the wax that much time to set.After 24 hours, remove the wick holders.
Trim the wick to approximately ½ inch.
Your mason jar candle is now ready to light.

Gather your supplies.This project requires few supplies, making it a very cheap project to try at home.,
Melt the wax in the double boiler.,
Cut the wicks into 16 inch (40.6 cm) pieces and weight them.,
Construct a makeshift dipping rig.,
Dip the weighted wicks into the melted wax.,
Cut the weights off.,
Hang the tapers to cool.",How to Make Candles at Home3," Make sure you have a place where your tapers can hang, undisturbed, for at least 24 hours. This will allow them time to fully set.

10 to 13 inch wicking
1 pound of beeswax
Nuts or some other small objects to weight the tapers
1 coat hanger

, For this project, a large stock pot will work well as the main vessel on the double boiler. This will be your dipping vat. Use a candy thermometer to watch the temperature. Once the wax has reached 165 °F (73.9 °C), it’s ready to use.

You will need to maintain this temperature throughout the procedure., Each piece of 16 inch (40.6 cm) wick will create 2 tapers. Tie the nuts onto each end of the wick pieces, since the tapers will need to be weighted during the curing process. These weights will hold the wick taut.

About halfway through the process you will cut these weights off.
Initially the tapers need to be weighted in order to form correctly.

, Use coat hanger wire and pliers to create a rig that will allow you to dip the tapers into the wax. If you don’t have the wire, you can use anything you have around that will allow you to drape one piece of wicking over it, with one weighted nut hanging down on each side.Each side will be dipped at the same time, so the tapers will be made in pairs.
Your rig needs to be wide enough (at least 2 inches) to keep the tapers separated from each other during the dipping and curing process.

, Don’t try to make your tapers any taller than your dipping vat. Allow at least 2 inches of undipped wick at the top, near the rig. Carefully lower your first wick into the melted wax using your rig, dipping the two sides of the string simultaneously. Make sure your motions are smooth and continuous. Dip and then pull out without pausing. Allow several minutes of cooling. Then dip again.Repeat this several more times.
Be sure to wait several minutes between dips to allow the wax time to cool enough.
If you don’t, the wax will start falling off the wick.

, After you’ve reached a substantial thickness and the wick doesn’t need a weight to be held taut, snip the nuts off. Repeat the dipping and cooling process 2 to 3 more times after removing the weights. This will seal the bottoms of the tapers.If you need a specific thickness to fit a particular taper holder, use a ruler to measure the holder.
Then dip the taper accordingly, until you reach the desired thickness.

, After you’ve reached your desired thickness, hang the tapers in a place where they won’t be disturbed and allow them to set. Give them at least 24 hours before trying to use them. When they’ve cured completely, snip the wicks to separate the two tapers and trim each wick to be ¼ inch.

Your tapers are now ready to light.If you won’t be using your tapers right away, leave them hanging in pairs, just as they are, until you’re ready to use them.
This will help them remain perfectly straight.

Find a clean, glass jar with a wide opening.,
Purchase some candle wax and cut it into small cubes.,
Heat the candle wax in a double boiler.,
Add citronella essential oil to your melted wax.,
Purchase a pre-waxed candle wick and cut it.,
Insert and attach the candle wick.,
Secure the candle wick.,
Pour the wax into the jars.,
Wait until your candle has cooled.,
Trim your wick.",How to Make Citronella Candles1," You will need some sort of heat-resistant container, such as a mason jar or an old candle holder, to pour your melted wax into. Make sure that the mouth of your container is wide enough for you to reach into and that the container can withstand high temperatures.;
, You can use any candle wax for your candles, such as paraffin, soy, or even old, unscented candles. Cut or break your chosen wax into cubes. Make sure that you have enough to fill your container, plus some extra. Wax shrinks a little when it hardens, and you may find that you will have to add a little extra wax into the container during the cooling process.

, Fill your double boiler with water and place it on the stove, then fill the smaller chamber with wax. Turn on the stove and wait until the wax melts. It will look mostly clear.


If you do not have a double boiler, you can make your own by filling a large pot part-way with water and placing a smaller, heat-resistant container, such as a glass measuring cup, inside it. The smaller container should be at least as tall as the larger pot; it should not be submerged in the water. Place the candle wax into the smaller container, and set the large pot onto the stove.
If you want to add some color to your candle, you can add in some crayons or wax dye.Wax dye usually comes in blocks, and you can find it online or in the candle-making section of an arts and crafts store. If you choose to add some color, be sure to stir your wax to blend it all in.

, Use about ½ teaspoon or 10 drops of oil per one pound of wax. You can use more essential oil if you'd like a more potent candle, or less essential oil if you'd prefer a less potent one. You can find citronella essential oil online or in the essential oil section of a health food store. Once you have added the oil, stir the wax to mix it all together.


Be sure to use essential oil, as a synthetic citronella oil (or citronella scent) will not be as effective at keeping the bugs away.You can also add other candle-making scents to help compliment the citronella. Consider using scents that other insects don't like, such as eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, peppermint, or pine., Measure out a pre-waxed candle wick and cut it with a pair of scissors. The wick should be a few inches longer than your chosen container; you will be trimming the wick down later.


If your candle wick came without a metal tab, you will need to purchase one online or from the candle-making aisle of an arts and crafts store and attach it to one end. Simply slip the metal tab onto one end of your candle wick and pinch it shut using a pair of pliers.

, Take the candle wick and dip the metal tab into the hot wax, then slip the wick into the container. When the wax hardens, it will affix the metal tab to the bottom of the jar, securing the wick., You want your candle wicks to be straight inside the candle, so you will need to secure them. You can do this by taking a wooden clothespin, closing it around your candle wick, and resting the pin on the top of your container.If you do not have any clothespins, you can support the candle wick by resting chopsticks or pencils on top of the container, and placing them to either side of the wick. This will help keep the wick upright and prevent it from falling over.

, Carefully lift the container holding the wax off of the double boiler and pour the melted wax into the container. Leave about ½ to 1 inch space from the rim of the container.

, You can tell if your candle has cooled if it is solid colored. Most uncolored waxes will appear white, ivory, or yellow when they have cooled.


If you find that your wax has shrunk a little, simply add more hot wax and wait for it to cool.

, Once your candle has cooled, you can remove the chopsticks, and trim the wick until it is about ½ inch long.

Light and use.",How to Make Citronella Candles2," You want your candle to be small enough to float inside your jar. Your jar should also be large enough to hold some herbs and citrus slices.

, Fill your jar about ¼ of the way with some fresh herbs. Consider using some herbs that repel insects, such as: eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, peppermint, or pine.

, Take some lemons and/or limes, and cut them into thin, even slices. You want the slices to be ¼ to 1 inch thick. Cut enough citrus to loosely fill your mason jar.
, Pour some cool water into the jar. Leave an inch or two of the jar unfilled.

, Add about 10 drops of citronella essential oil into the water and stir to blend it.You can use more or less citronella essential oil depending on your preference.

, Gently place the candle on top of the water in your jar. If your accidentally gets wet, do not worry. Either wait until it dries out, or dab the water off with a tissue, que-tip or cotton ball.

, To use your citronella candle, simply set it on a stable surface and light the floating candle.


The citrus and herb water will keep for a few days, but eventually you will have to discard it. Consider placing a lid on the jar and storing it in the fridge when you are not using it to help keep it last longer."

Carve the face as desired, exaggerating the features.Draw the face first with water based markers.,

Dip your ""finished"" face in the lemon juice mixture again.

Place the apple in a food dehydrator or in a warm, dry, well ventilated place.,

Turn the apple over every 12 hours or so until dry.",How to Carve Shrunken Head Apples,",,, This will keep the apple from turning dark., Do not worry too much about it because as the apple dries, your ""mistakes"" will shrink. Plus, apples are delicious, and so ""failed"" carvings can be eaten on the spot.,, You can insert a wire into the apple to hang it, pierce the center with a long skewer and put it in a vase, or place it on a rack. Make sure air reaches the entire surface of the apple so that it dries evenly. See Warnings., It'll feel ""spongy"" when it's done.

Find the eyes of the coconut.,
Poke into the eye with a knife, a drill bit, or a screwdriver.,
Drain the water into a bowl, jar or cup.,
Locate the thin line along the middle of the coconut.,
Smack the coconut against the line with the back side of a large knife or meat cleaver.,
Rotate the coconut about a quarter of a turn with each rap.,
Pry the meat away from the shell.,
Place the 2 coconut halves on a cookie sheet in the oven at 150°C (300°F) for 1-2 hours.,
Place the coconuts shell-side down in a well-ventilated area.",How to Hollow Out a Coconut," Sort of like a bowling ball, the coconut will have three ""eyes."" They're really just spots on one end. Two will be side-by-side, and one will be the odd one out – it's this odd one that is the soft spot, which you can tap into to drain.


Sometimes you'll need to remove strands from the husk to really get at the eyes. This is easy enough to do with your hands or a small knife. The area around the eye should be clean.;
, If your knife is small enough, you may be able just to poke right through the eye, through the meat, and into the liquid with your knife. If not, find a screwdriver or a drill bit that is small enough to force an opening.


You may need to tap the end of the screwdriver or drill bit with a hammer. Just a few light taps ought to do it.






If you experience a hissing sound once you break through to the meat, that's good – it means the coconut is depressurizing. If you don't (or if you experience air going out instead of in, it's possible your coconut has gone bad.

, Coconut water is delicious, so save it! However, make sure it's good before you combine it with other coconut water – you don't want to tarnish the whole batch. Here's how to know if it's good:


It should be fairly clear, almost like water.
There should be no clouds.
It should not be slimy.

, Every coconut has a natural ""center point"" that is marked by a thin line, sort of like an equator. This is where it will be easiest to break the coconut cleanly in half. Locate this line before you begin tapping.


To hold the coconut properly, hold it in your non-dominant hand. The eyes should be facing down and the ends should be facing out to the sides.







, Never use the sharp blade of a knife to hit a coconut! Not only could you hurt yourself, but this could force the coconut to break in a dozen pieces. Using the blunt, back side of a heavy blade to slowly break it cleanly in half.


A meat cleaver is great as there is a natural curve to the back side of the blade. This matches the curve of the coconut, applying pressure evenly. Again, the 3 eyes of the coconut should be facing away from your hand.







, Crack the knife against the line a second time. Keep making slight rotations, always rapping against the line. Keep going in this manner until you hear a cracking sound. Once it starts cracking, use less and less force to keep it in two large pieces.


For some coconuts, this will take a few smacks. For others, it will take a few full rotations. You're not doing anything wrong – some coconuts are simply easier to split than others.






Keep rapping and turning until the crack has gone all the way around the coconut and it splits cleanly apart.







, The easiest way to pry the meat away from the shell is first break the shell in pieces with hammer or something hard, then take a steel glass , position it between the meat and the shell and scoop out the meat easily within seconds. Another approach is to grab a spoon and position it between the meat and the shell with the back of the spoon facing the shell. The meat will come off in chunks as it breaks loose. You may not be able to get all the meat out (coconuts can be finicky), which is when the next step comes in handy.


Spoon not working too great? Some coconut meat is more difficult than others. In this case, grab a small paring-like knife to shred at the meat. Make a cut into the meat and drive the knife along the edge, much like you would peel an orange.






Before you toss the coconut meat, consider keeping it. It's delicious, especially when cold or turned into a smoothie!







, The amount of time you need depends on the size of the coconut and the thickness of the meat. Once it's finished, the meat will have shrunk and you'll be able to pull out the meat in one piece.


People in the Micronesian islands of Palau, Ponape, Chuuk, the Caroline's, etc., will lay coconut halves face up in the sunshine for a number of days till the meat separates from the shell.







, Give them a few days (or up to a week) to fully dry and harden. Giving them this extra drying-out period will make them easier to use for crafts or as a cup or bowl.


They make great decorations in the interim! And if there's even a shred of meat left, it will shrink up and dry during this time period, too.

Add sea glass to common items for embellishment.,
Display sea glass artistically.,
Sell it for profit.",How to Collect Sea or Beach Glass," Sea glass accumulates where rocks (gravel) are more abundant. Look for a beach with many pebbles and you will likely find sea glass there. The same forces of nature, wind, waves and sand, that break up small rocks also create sea glass., The best places to find glass are beaches close to a city or industrial/commercial zone. Sea glass starts out essentially as litter. So you want areas that are currently settled or have been in the past. This also goes for areas with lots of traffic in the sea because sea glass can come from shipwrecks or even war zones, which will produce a lot of waste.Most sea glass started as a simple glass bottle. It begins as a manmade item before the sea polishes it into sea glass. Therefore you need areas that have had bottles thrown in the water., A turbulent surf is needed to create sea glass. Areas that are regularly hit with heavy waves and winds are the best conditions to create the sea glass. The water acts as a giant rock tumbler by churning ordinary glass over time until it is polished. The bigger the waves, the better. Rough conditions will also help you to find the sea glass by moving it onto the shore.


Go between autumn and spring. This is when the sea is likely to be the most rough., This will give you the best chance to find sea glass so that you can look in all areas of the beach. You can also go about an hour before or after low tide as the tide is moving, which is likely to churn up sea glass.During a full moon, tides will be stronger. This is helpful for the water to move the sea glass onto the shore., A storm will move the sea glass onto the shore. Hurricanes have been especially effective in moving large quantities of sea glass so that you can find it easily. Don't go looking for sea glass during a storm, though. wait until it's over., Certain beaches have a reputation for having large quantities of sea glass. These are a good place to start. Fort Bragg in California has Glass Beach, which was once a dump and now has great amounts of sea glass. Kauai Island in Hawaii has a nearby lava network that traps and polishes the glass. Bermuda has great sea glass from shipwrecks, hurricanes, and bottles thrown in the water. Puerto Rico’s Vieques is also known for sea glass.With a location where there will likely be many people looking for sea glass, try to get there early to avoid competition.

, You are looking for glass that has been ground and polished by sand, rock, and water erosion over many years to form an irregular shape with a dull color. If the piece you find doesn't conform to these standards, it is too new to be considered sea glass. Simply throw it back into the water.


Distinguish between glass and sea glass. It takes at least 7-10 years for a piece of glass to become sea glass. If you’ve found a piece that has jagged edges and shiny spots, that’s still glass. Sea glass, on the other hand, is well-frosted and has smooth edges from being churned by waves over time., The most common colors are clear/white, green and brown. Less common colors are sky blue, blue, and indigo. Rare colors are red, yellow/amber, orange, and pink. Be aware that very tiny pieces of brown glass may look orange or amber. It is almost impossible to find true black sea glass, although dark-colored sea glass may appear black. The rarer the color, the more valuable it will be if you want to sell it later.The best glass comes from old bottles, which are thicker and of bolder colors. The brighter colors come from wine-cooler bottles which look pretty but are very thin. The new abundance of blue glass is credited to the popularity of SKYY Vodka. Green, brown and clear are beer bottle colors.

, Some people move rocks and sand around with a stick or rake. Having a small tool will help you to sort through all of the materials on the beach more quickly than with only your hands. It will also keep your hands from getting as dirty., Areas of wet sand are probably the best area to look in, but be aware that certain colors of glass (like white, for example) turn almost invisible when wet. This is a good place to find green or blue glass. Dry sand close to the wet sand is a great place to find white and brown colors. Also, the evasive red becomes more visible here.Some glass is easier to find wet, while other colors are easier when dry. Green is easy to find wet or dry. White is easier when dry. Brown is easier when wet. Blue can be found wet or dry, but may look almost black when dry. Red is easier to find when dry. Amber is easier when wet. Black is always difficult to find.

, Dry sand far from the shore can also contain sea glass. It has the added benefit that not as many people look here. You would be amazed by the amount of glass you can find where most people are not looking for it.

, Walk along the beach looking for pockets of gravel. Squat or sit down. Take your time. The trick is to select a small area and scan with your eyes. Collect the glass. Move to the next promising area.

, This will help make the sea glass more visible to you and will also keep the sun from obstructing your view. The sea glass will reflect light and glisten in the sun., If you are only gathering a few pieces, you can keep them in your pockets. If you wish to collect a lot, bring a couple of small bags and fill them as you go.

, Once you have collected a lot, you might not be sure which pieces are most valuable. A good book, such as Pure Sea Glass by Richard LaMotte, will help you to learn the specifics of your glass, including its origin., Popular jewelry items of sea glass include rings, necklaces, and earrings. You can glue the sea glass onto a ring band or earring studs. Try using a hot glue gun to adhere the sea glass securely. You could even drill holes in it to loop it through a chain or glue it to a pendant. Sea glass jewelry is elegant and beautiful, and you can also sell it., You can adorn many items around your house with sea glass. Glue it onto a mirror, candle holder, or drawer handle. Try making a sea glass border around a picture frame. Sea glass is great for all kinds of arts and crafts. You could even make a sea glass wind chime by hanging it on threads.Include your kids in this. They will enjoy not only finding sea glass, but also making crafts with it. Help them glue it to a picture they draw to add decoration.

, If you collect a lot of sea glass, you can display it artfully in a clear vase, lamp base, or bowl. You could choose one color of sea glass for a uniform look or make a multicolored display. Sea glass is a beautiful decorative item that looks expensive even though you can get it for free!You could even place sea glass at the bottom of a fish tank. It will add color and visual interest to the tank.

, Sea glass is well-sought after and people are willing to pay for it. Rare colors such as red, dark blue, and orange will likely generate a higher profit, up to around $30 for a piece compared to around $5 for more common colors like white, green, and brown. Shape is another factor and some shapes, like hearts and triangles, are popular for making jewelry. You can make up to $15/hour by searching for sea glass and then selling it on websites like eBay or Etsy.To help sell it, take quality pictures of it in good lighting. Try to eliminate any shadows or other distractions to the sea glass in the picture.

Arrange the flowers across the water.,
Place on display.",How to Make a Floating Flower Arrangement," Many flowers will work well for a floating floral arrangement but it's best to choose ones that will hold their shape nicely. For example, camellias, irises and roses work well.
, Cut up as high as possible without endangering the bud and petals., You'll need a bowl or wide raised platter that is elegant and able to hold water. It should have sufficient space to fit the amount of flowers you wish to add. Ideally, the item needs to be shallow without allowing the water to fall out.

Glass bowls are very pretty for floating floral arrangements.

, Keep the amount as low as possible, so as not to swamp the flowers., It is also nice to add a few leaves, especially fragrant leaves such as mint, pine or lemon balm leaves.

If you like, add some essential or scented oil to the water. This is only where the flowers chosen aren't sufficiently scented themselves.

Set the carnation into the water, then wait for it to change color.",How to Dye Carnations1," Avoid using wilted ones, as they won't take up the dye as well. You can use more carnations if you want to., It would be even better if you submerged the stem in water first, then cut the ends off underwater. This will prevent air bubbles from forming at the base of the stem. Air bubbles can clog up the stem, and prevent the colored water from flowing as well., You will need at least ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. How much you use depends on the size of jar you are using. The flower will soak up warm water much faster than cool water., You will need 20 to 30 drops of food coloring per 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of water. Stir the food coloring into the water with a spoon until the color is consistent.If you don't have any food coloring, you can use liquid watercolor instead (but not regular paint).

, How fast the petals change color depends on how ""thirsty"" the flower was and what color you are using. Some colors show up much faster than others. It also depends on how long the stem was to begin with; the longer the stem, the longer it will take.The flowers won't end up a bright and solid color; they will be streaky with patches of white.

, Use a sharp knife or a pair of scissors for this. For even better results, cut the stems while they are under the water. This will prevent air bubbles, which can lead to early wilting., Split the stems until you are about halfway up the stem. Place the cut carnation into a vase filled with plain water when you are done.If you are really careful, you can try to split the stem into three parts rather than two.

, You will need about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of water for each glass.Make sure that the glasses have straight walls; avoid using anything that curves inward or outward.

You can also use test tubes instead. Tie them together with string or a rubber band first, then set them down into a cup., Be generous with the dye. Plan on using 20 to 30 drops for ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. Stir the water until the color is consistent., Place the jars close together so that they are touching. Make sure that the segments are well-submerged; add more water and dye, if needed., This may take as little as a few hours to as long as a whole day. Keep in mind that some colors show up much faster than others. For example, if you used pink, yellow, and blue, you might see the blue show up after a few hours, and the yellow show up after a day., Keep in mind that carnations dyed in this manner will rarely turn out a solid color; they will usually have white streaks in them."

Use a square piece of paper.,
Begin with the colored side of your paper facing up.Traditional origami paper is colored on one side and white on the other.,
Fold your paper in half top to bottom and left to right.This should form the shape of a cross that passes through the middle of your paper.,
Fold an X on the back side of your paper.Turn your paper so that the reverse side is facing up.,
Collapse the sides to form a triangle and complete the base.At this point you should have folds folds forming a cross and an X on your paper, with the reverse side should facing up.,
Fold the outside flaps to line up with the center crease.There should be a fold that you can still see running down the center of your waterbomb base.,
Fold the outside corners of the outer flaps inward.You can do this by taking the left flap and pulling it over to the right side.,
Join opposite side flaps together.The flaps that you've just folded on both sides to meet in the middle should have slightly different edges.,
Blow up your tulip bulb.Next you'll need to inflate your tulip bulb by blowing air into it, but you'll have to use your forefinger and thumb to hold the overlapping seam where you tucked your flaps together.,
Peel the petals of your tulip back for a realistic effect.The top of your now-inflated tulip bulb should have ""petals,"" or extra layers of paper, on each of the four sides of your bulb.",How to Fold Paper Flowers," Most origami designs require you to being with a square piece of paper of equal length on all sides.You can buy specialty origami paper at most craft stores, or you could always make your own origami paper.;
, If you are using paper colored on both sides or white paper, it will not matter which side faces up.

, You will need to crease the paper along the seam of the fold well for best results. Specifically, you should:


Fold your paper in half from left to right.
Crease the paper well and unfold it.
Fold your paper in half bottom to top.
Crease your fold and unfold the paper.

, The lines of the X you will fold will run through the middle of your paper, similar to your previously folded cross. To do this, you should:


Fold the bottom right corner into the upper left corner.
Crease the fold well and unfold the crease.
Fold the bottom left corner into the upper right corner.
Crease the fold well and unfold the crease.

, Collapse the base by:


Tucking the left and right sides into the middle.
Pulling the top and bottom together to sandwich the left and right sides.
Creasing the resulting fold to form a triangular shape.

, Take the right corner and fold it until it lines up with the center crease. Repeat this fold with the left corner as well.


Then, turn your paper over and perform this fold one more time.
After you have completed the fold, your paper should be in a diamond shape, with the bottom point of the diamond facing you.

, Now take the leftward facing point and fold it straight inward until it reaches the crease at the middle. Then fold the rightward facing flap, so that both flaps meet evenly at the middle crease.


Repeat this fold for the two flaps on the right side.

, One side should have a fold of the paper, creating a kind of pocket, while the other should have the open sided tips of your paper. Join the paper by:


Tucking the open ended edge into the pocket formed by the fold of the paper.

, Air can escape easily from this seam, so hold it firmly. Then:


Put your lips to the center of the X shape that forms the base of your tulip bulb.
Exhale steadily until your tulip bulb feels fully inflated.

, Peel these petals back about ¼ of the way down from top where each petal comes to a point.


You may want to crease your petals for effect.
You may leave your petals uncreased and slightly pulled back from the tip of your tulip bulb to give a more natural appearance.

Select hardy flowers with low moisture content.,
Choose flowers that are almost at full bloom.,
Harvest flowers and herbs in the morning.,
Opt for flowers that have long, straight stems.",How to Make a Dried Flower Bouquet1," The best flowers for drying are sturdy, with a small calyx and tightly enclosed petals. Experiment with any flowers and herbs that interest you, but the best candidates for drying are amaranth, artemisia, aster, astilbe, baby’s breath, calendula, celosia, chrysanthemum, coneflower seed heads, dahlia, daisies, gomphrena, herbs, hydrangea, lavender, lunaria, marigold, poppy seed pods, rose buds, salvia, sea holly, statice, strawflower, yarrow and zinnia.Flowers with high water content, like peonies, are harder and take longer to dry. They can also lose their shape and color during the process.
Delicate flowers, like carnations, are beautiful when dried, but their fragility makes them difficult to work with.;
, Fresh flowers for bouquets are usually harvested with new buds in early bloom. If you want to dry fresh cut flowers that are already in a bouquet, wait until the blooms have opened almost completely. If you’re harvesting flowers yourself specifically for drying, wait until the buds have opened about 90% – you want them to be just shy of full bloom when you cut them.Avoid harvesting flowers that are mature or past their prime – they will often lose their petals and shed pollen during the drying process. Make sure the flowers haven’t set seeds yet.

, Flowers are at peak quality for harvesting on dry, sunny mornings after the early morning dew has evaporated. Get the flowers out of the sunlight immediately after you harvest them. This helps them retain their vibrant color.Do not use water to rinse dirt off the petals. Hold them upside down and shake them gently to remove any dirt.Dewy flowers take much longer to dry and the moisture may cause mold to develop between the petals.
Avoid harvesting at midday, when the temperature peaks. The heat can cause the flowers to wilt, making them less ideal candidates for drying., These work best when building dried flower bouquets. Cut the stems no shorter than six inches in length. This will facilitate the bundling and drying process later. Place the flowers upright in a bucket or basket while you’re harvesting them.This inflicts the least amount of damage to their fragile petals and is the easiest way to transport them from the field.If you plan to use tall vases for your dried bouquets, keep the final look in mind while harvesting.
If you don’t know how you’ll be displaying the flowers, leave as much length as possible on the stems. You can trim them to your desired length later.

The colors in the bouquet are generally coordinated with the color of this centerpiece, either to compliment that color or bring out contrast between the different colors of your blooms.


Deciding on the color scheme of your bouquet before choosing your flower can help you narrow down which flowers you will use in your bouquet.
Choose complimentary colors by selecting ones close to each other on the color spectrum.
Contrasting colors are those that are on opposite sides of the color spectrum.
Remember the order of the color spectrum with the acronym Roy G Biv, which stands for:Red orange yellow Green Blue indigo violet;
, The lighting and environment your bouquet will be in will influence how well your colors work together. Bright lit rooms will highlight subtler shades, while darker rooms might require bolder color choices.


A bulky bouquet might not be the ideal choice to give to your significant other at the start of a date, as it might be cumbersome during the date.

, Buying flowers that are out of season for your bouquet can add a significant cost to your bouquet making. Seasonal flowers, in addition to being more affordable, will also look more natural in your arrangement. Some popular seasonal flowers include:



Spring: daffodil, hyacinth, lilac, narcissus, peony, stargazer lily, sweetpea, tulip.

Summer: chrysanthemum, lavender, forget-me-not, daisy, hydrangea, iris, Asiatic lily, Oriental lily, aster, queen Anne’s lace, snapdragon, sunflower, zinnia.

Fall: aster, chrysanthemum, dahlia, marigold, zinnia.

Winter: camellia, Casa Blanca lily, daffodil, forget-me-not, holly, jasmine, narcissus, poinsettia, stargazer lily, star of Bethlehem, sweetpea, tulip.

Year-round: baby’s breath, calla lily, carnations, eucalyptus, gardenia, gladiolus, heather, lily of the valley, orchid, rose., It is an old European tradition to arrange flowers in odd numbers, and in many cultures, an odd number of flowers indicates joy.Beyond this, an odd number of flowers creates uniformity between your centerpiece and the flowers around it.


Avoid the number 13 when arranging your flowers, as in some cultures this number is considered unlucky.

, Now that you've figured out your color scheme and chosen some suitable flowers, you'll need to go to your local florist or the floral section of your grocery store to buy some flowers. Including these, you'll also need:


Floral or stem wrapping tape
Floral wire
Fresh flowers
Household bleach (optional)
Rubber bands (optional)
Scissors or a vegetable knife
Vase

, These will bloom as the existing flowers wilt, creating better balance in your bouquet over a longer period of time. Buds that are just breaking open and with a glimpse of color are a good indication the flowers will be suitable for your bouquet., Hold a stem by the base and see if it stands up. Weak stemmed flowers are sometimes an indication the flower is old, sick, or otherwise damaged. Verify that the stems aren't smelly or slimy, as this often indicates the blooms have been in water too long., You'll want leaves are crisp and clean with a rich, even color green. Any spots or bleaching may indicate disease, which can lead to rot and shorten the life expectancy of your bouquet., A general rule of thumb among flower arranging experts is to keep the top height of your blooms even. Use your scissors to cut your stems so that the length of each flower's stem is about the same, and be sure you cut the stems on an angle. An angled cut will allow the stem to draw up water more easily, lengthening the life of your bouquet.Cutting your stems under running water will lengthen the life of your blooms.
Woody stems, such as roses, should be split the bottom. This will allow water in and prolong the life of your woody stemmed blooms.
It's best to start with longer stems, about 12 inches long should do. Then trim these to suit your purposes of your situation. A small flower girl might require shorter stem length, a bouquet/present, longer stems to accommodate a vase., Thorns can poke the recipient of your bouquet, making your bouquet less desirable. Run a knife along the stem to shuck thorns free of the stem. You can also use your scissors to snip each thorn at its base. Many of your leaves can also be removed; the central point of your bouquet are its flowers. Too many leaves and you won't be able to see the flowers for the trees.Exercise caution while de-thorning your blooms. If you intend on using a knife, be sure to slide it along the stem away from your body to prevent accidental cuts.
You'll likely not want to completely denude your flowers of leaves. Doing so can sometimes create a lack of fullness in your bouquet.

, If you plan on putting your bouquet into a vase or some other container, first fill it with fresh, cold water to prolong the life of your blooms. Then add a few drops of bleach to the water to kill any bacteria that might have been in your cup, in your water, or on your stems.


Purifying your water with a few drops of bleach is a great way to prevent rot, disease, and decay, all of which can cloud water and create an unpleasant smell., If you are using a vase or container, you should use one hand to hold the position of your flowers as you add to the arrangement with your free hand. If you are planning on making a traditional, stem-wrapped bouquet, hold your flowers with your non-dominant hand and add to your arrangement with your free hand. Organize your centerpiece so it is the middle of your bouquet.Your centerpiece flower will usually be a specially chosen flower or accent. Around this central flower, you will build the rest of your bouquet.
You may find it helpful, as your bouquet grows in size, to use a rubber band to hold your bouquet in place., Work your way around your centerpiece, adding flowers one stem at a time as you do so. Working from the inside of your bouquet to the out will prevent it from looking thin or patchy. You may want to arrange your blooms at regular intervals, or you might want to see how clusters of your accent flowers work with your centerpiece.Remember to keep the top of your blooms evenly aligned! Extend your bouquet about an arm's length in front of you and hold it at eye level to check the height of your blooms.

, Now that your central bouquet is built, you'll have a firm idea of where you should fill out the flowers with accents flowers and sprigs. Berries can add a vibrant touch to your bouquet, as can accents like peacock feathers, bouquet jewels, and bear grass, to name a few.


If you plan on using ribbons on your bouquet, seal the ends after you cut it to prevent fray. Depending on material, sealing method can vary, but usually applying a weak flame to the frayed end for a few seconds will cause the fray to fuse.
A thin seam of hot glue can also work well for preventing your ribbon from fraying.

, Take your floral wire and wrap the entire length of the stems in a spiral pattern. Cut excess wire with your scissors, and then press your floral tape onto the topmost part of the wire to fix it in place. Pull the tape tight and corkscrew it down and around your stems to block them from view and create a snug stem-bundle., Be sure to double check the height and balance of your bouquet, as you may have disrupted the balance of the arrangement while binding stems and adding accents. Be sure the top of the flowers are of level height and the flowers distributed in a pleasing fashion. Now you're bouquet's ready for that special someone of yours!

, White roses are the traditional wedding flower, and a bouquet using the white rose as its main accent would likely match well with the bride's gown. You may want to choose an elegant lily or orchid as your centerpiece, as the gold color of theses flowers' inner parts can create an elegant appearance.


The white rose symbolizes unity and purity, making this the perfect flower to commemorate a new marriage.

, Choose mom's favorite flowers for your centerpiece and accent flowers, and coordinate colors to whatever her favorite might be. Mother's day roses are popular, but can be expensive due to increased demand.

, The color of roses can symbolize many different things, including gratitude. Though the recipient would likely appreciate any flowers you give as a way of saying thanks, dark pink roses are the traditional color for conveying this.

, Hospitals can be drab, and even your own home can become dull and lifeless when recuperating from an illness. Select vibrant, cheery colors for your get well soon bouquet.


Green is symbolic of nature, and can promote tranquility, health, and can have a calming effect.Orange is considered to be an energetic, enthusiastic color, and may be just the thing to cheer your ill friend.Red is associated with love, warmth, and has been known to evoke strong emotions. You might pair this color with orange to create a pleasing effect.Yellow is a color associated with happiness and warmth, though can be overwhelming. Use yellow in moderation in your get well soon bouquets., Mournful occasions are best suited with soft, muted colors. Depending on culture, the kind of flowers you use in a funeral bouquet can vary drastically, but generally lilies, chrysanthemums, and orchids are suitable for these occasions."

Remove the excess foliage.,
Gather the flowers into small bunches.,
Bind the small bunches together with rubber bands.,
Select a drying location that is dark and well-ventilated.,
Hang the flower bundles upside-down to dry.Use whatever means you have to suspend the flowers upside-down – hooks, wire clothes hangers, florist wire, or twist ties are all popular techniques.",How to Make a Dried Flower Bouquet2," Strip all the extra greenery and leaves away, leaving only the bare stems. Work carefully around any thorns and avoid touching the petals as much as possible. If you want to do any stem trimming, this is the best time to do it. The flowers you plan to use in the same bouquet should have stems that are approximately the same length.Some people find it easier to strip the leaves and foliage off when they’re out gathering flowers in the field, but use whatever technique works best for you.

, How you group them together is up to you – by species, purpose or any other way you like. The more stems that are bundled together in one bunch, the longer it will take for them to dry, so try to limit your bundles to about five or six flowers each.In most cases, it is better to dry flowers separately from herbs because their drying times can vary so much.

, Make sure the bundles are secure, but avoid packing them too densely or tightly. You can use twine, wire, string or unflavored dental floss to tie the bunches together, if you prefer. However, rubber bands are the best choice because they will hold the stems securely together when the flowers start to dry and contract.Avoid building your bouquets before you dry the flowers. The blooms and stems will contract as they dry, leaving you with empty spaces and unsatisfying bouquet shapes.

, Attics, garages, sheds, barns and closets are great choices, as long as the area is well-ventilated. Without proper ventilation, moisture can accumulate and mold could start to grow on the flowers. Avoid rooms and other areas with windows, since sunlight can fade the color of the petals.

When you’re trying to preserve vibrant color, the darker the drying location, the better., Hanging them upside-down will ensure that the stems remain straight through the drying process. Space the bundles apart so that proper ventilation is maintained.

Give the flowers two to three weeks to dry completely.Once the petals become crisp to the touch, they’re ready to use.

Use silica gel.,
Place the flowers in the microwave.,
Remove and cover the container.,
Use glycerine and water to dry the flowers.",How to Make a Dried Flower Bouquet3," Silica gel is an agent that can help you dry your flowers quickly and efficiently in the microwave. Cover the bottom of a microwave-safe container with one or two inches of silica gel and place the flowers, blossoms-up, into it. Gently pour a little more gel over the blooms and stems. Place the uncovered container into the microwave.Silica gel can be obtained at any craft store. It tends to be on the pricy side, so this method isn’t as budget-friendly as air drying., The time and temperatures required will vary, so you may want to experiment with a few flowers first. Begin with one or two heat levels above defrost and set the time for two to five minutes. Check their progress intermittently and make adjustments as necessary.In general, fleshier flowers (like roses) will require more heat than delicate ones (such as daisies).

, After the flowers are dry, open the microwave and cover the container right away. Then take the container out of the microwave and let the flowers sit for 24 hours. Use a fine-bristled paint brush to gently brush away the silica gel from the blooms.Spray the flowers with an acrylic spray, which can also be obtained at craft stores. Once the acrylic spray has fully dried, your flowers are ready to use.
Store them or display them out of direct sunlight and away from high heat.

, Mix equal parts vegetable glycerin and water in a tall, sturdy container. The mixture should fill the container to about three inches. Place the stems of the flowers into the mixture – don’t immerse the blooms themselves, just the stems. Leave them in the solution for two weeks. Remove them and allow them to drain on newspaper.The flowers are ready to use in a bouquet after draining and drying completely.
This method is unique because the foliage remains pliable after the drying process is complete.

Take the dried bundles apart.,
Pick out the largest flowers first.,
Tie the stems together or display in a vase.,
Scent the bouquet with essential oils and herbs (optional).",How to Make a Dried Flower Bouquet4," Remove the rubber bands and disassemble the flower bundles. Handle the flowers gently, since the crispy petals are prone to breakage. Spray the flowers with unscented hairspray to help keep them intact.You can also use spray varnish or florist’s fixative for the same purpose., Start building your bouquet around the largest flowers, since they will be the focal point of the arrangement. Then choose complimentary components and add them to the group in any way that pleases you. There is no “right” way to do this, so experiment!You can build the arrangement around a particular color scheme, for instance. Add greenery, such as herb sprigs, last.

, For a rustic look, secure your bouquets with twine and hang them on your walls. For a more traditional display, place the bouquets in vases of your choice. The bouquets can also make lovely, delicate gifts. Use a matching velvet or satin ribbon to secure the stems together before giving it away.

If you’re making hand bouquets, aim for a height of four to six inches.If you’re a crafty person, don’t forget to put some of the dried flowers aside to use in your projects! Store them in a safe place between sheets of tissue paper until you’re ready to use them.

, A sweetly scented bouquet, called a nosegay, can be created with just a few drops of floral essential oil. Use a dropper to place three or four drops directly into the centers of the biggest flowers. Additional scents can be achieved by including dried herbs in your bouquets.Geranium, jasmine and rose essential oils are popular choices for adding scent to bouquets.
Dried herbs like lavender, rosemary and sage are great-smelling options for nosegays, but you can experiment with any herb you like.

To begin you have to cut the flowers, morning is usually the best time, after all the dew has dried.,
Air drying is one of the easiest ways to dry flowers and many flowers can be dried this way roses, baby’s breath and hydrangeas to name a few.,
Another way to dry flowers is by the use of silica sand.,
Start by spreading a layer of sand in deep tray.,
The next step is to slowly spoon the sand over the flowers making sure you get the sand into every petal and part of the flowers.,
Once the flowers are dry gently brush the sand off.,

",How to Dry Flowers for Winter Enjoyment," You will want to pick perfect specimens as they will stand up to the drying process the best. Use a sharp pair of scissors and cut a long stem.;
, Once you have cut the flowers you want to dry bundle them together with a rubber band. Hang them upside down in a place away from sunlight with a good circulation of dry air. They should be dry in three weeks. Herbs can be dried this way as well.

, It works very well however it is a little more time consuming and requires a little more work. Silica sand is very fine sand and you can find it in craft stores. A much less expensive choice is builder’s sand that you can buy at hardware stores, however it usually comes in large quantities and to dry a few flowers may not be the best choice.

, Add your flowers, strong flowers can just be laid flat on the sand, flat blooms like sunflowers should have their stems cut short and laid face up.

, Continue to do this until the flowers are completely covered. It generally takes about four weeks for the flowers to dry.

, It works best to use a small artists brush for this process.

Choose your color scheme.,
Determine what size flowers you want.,
Ask which flowers are in bloom.",How to Create a Tropical Bouquet1," Tropical flowers come in subdued, pastel shades and some brighter, bolder colors. Before you choose your colors, decide which color scheme you prefer – this will help you select your flowers.For example, pale tropical flowers include the African moon (a small, white daisy), the Amazon lily, begonias, cattleya, frangipani, and lotus flowers. Many of these flowers come in colors other than white, but they are more subdued hues.Vividly colored tropical flowers include crab claws, African tulips, angel wing begonias, blanket flowers, bottle brush flowers, and chrysanthemums.;
, Are you going for a big, statement bouquet or something with smaller buds? Big is better for a large, loose bouquet, while smaller flowers look best in a gathered bouquet.The African tulip, cautleya, catasetum, bottle brush, and decorative dalia flowers are all larger tropical flowers.
Smaller tropical flowers include chrysanthemums, constantia, and frangipani.

, Depending on where you live, it can be expensive to order fresh tropical flowers. Asking your florist which are in bloom and likely to be cheaper can help you save money.A good way to avoid this – and save money – is to buy fake flowers. Keep in mind, however, that while this is a money-saving option, you’ll probably have less variety to choose from.

Work your way down the base of the flowers until you get to the end. Cover the tips of your flowers, and then work your way back up the stems to the top. Once there trim your ribbon as needed and tuck into the binding/top ribbon.
Secure the top of the ribbon with pins pushed both into the ribbon and the stems.

, If adding the pins for appearance, make sure that they are spaced evenly."
"
Cut off the bottom of the stem at an angle.,
Remove extra leaves.,
Fill a vase with fresh water.",How to Create a Tropical Bouquet2," How much you need to cut off will depend on how large the flowers are to begin with. It will also depend on how large you want your bouquet to be. When you cut the bottom of the stem, cut it at an angle – this makes it easier for the flower to soak up the water.

, Removing extra leaves increases the longevity of the flowers. How far down the stem you should remove extra leaves varies. You should remove enough so if you’re storing them in water, the leaves won’t be submerged. If you’re not storing them in water, remove enough so that you enough room to hold the bouquet., This is good whether you’re making a bouquet for a table or for a wedding. You’ll need to keep wedding flowers in water until they are ready to go. Fill the vase about two thirds of the way full with clear, fresh water.

Gather the smallest flowers in the middle.,
Frame the flowers in the middle with larger flowers.,
Add accents.,
Bind the flowers with floral wire.,
Cover the wire with floral tape.,
Wrap the stems in fabric.",How to Create a Tropical Bouquet3," This gives your bouquet a focal point. It also allows you to use larger blooms to frame the flowers in the middle.If you don’t want to arrange by size, you can choose instead to place your favorite flowers in the middle.

, Once you have your center flowers arranged, use the next largest flowers to frame the center. You should add these flowers in a balanced way.For example, if you put a larger flower on one side of your center arrangement, you should place a matching flower on the other side of the center. This gives your bouquet a clean, symmetrical look.

, Accents like tropical grasses will give your bouquet some extra style. You can also use things like seashells or brightly colored plastic jewels on pic sticks. Don’t add too many accents - you don’t want them to overwhelm the bouquet.Tropical grasses and leaves that you can use as accents include monstera, ginger foliage, and virions.

, Once you have the flowers arranged how you want them, twist floral wire around the stems to hold them in place. This will prevent your bouquet from falling apart and also make it easier to hold.

, This gives the bouquet an extra bit of strength. It also prevents the wire from rusting – which can happen if it gets wet. If that happens and the rust gets on your clothes, they can be ruined. Floral tape helps prevent this from happening., This will cover up the floral tape. It also gives you a chance to bring more of your theme into your bouquet. You can use any type of fabric that matches your theme or bouquet: ribbon, burlap, cotton, or even strings of gems or pearls."

Tie with fabric.",How to Create a Tropical Bouquet4," Starting with tropical grasses or leaves gives you a base for the rest of your flowers. Big tropical leaves like ginger foliage or virions are a great option for this.Keep in mind that your bouquet will need to match the size of your greenery, so if you’re aiming for a small bouquet, use less greenery, or smaller leaves.

, For a loose bouquet, you’ll want to build it from back to front. This prevents any of your flowers from getting lost in the arrangement., You’ll want to place your smaller flowers in bunches of threes. Generally it’s best to place them in the center, and to each side of the larger blooms., You can use smaller flowers up front and near the bottom of the bouquet – this allows them to be seen and also doesn’t overwhelm the bouquet in any one spot., To keep the bouquet together, you can loosely tie fabric around your stems. Don’t wrap them with wire, as this will give you a tighter look and will ruin the arrangement. Once your loose bouquet is finished, you can use it however you like - in a vase in your own home, as a hostess gift if you're attending a party at someone else's home, or even for a wedding.

When these ingredients are combined at the right temperature, they harden into soap in a process called saponification. Go to your local craft store and grocery store to purchase the ingredients listed;
, It's easiest to clear a space in the kitchen, since you'll need to heat the ingredients over the stove. You'll be working with lye, a dangerous chemical, so make sure children and pets are not underfoot while you work. Spread newspaper over a table and assemble the following equipment, which can be sourced online or from your local craft store:


Safety goggles and rubber gloves, to protect you from the lye.
A scale to weigh the ingredients.
A large stainless steel or enamel kettle. Do not use aluminum, and do not use a pot lined with non-stick surface.
A glass or plastic wide-mouth pitcher, to hold the water and lye.
A two-cup plastic or glass measuring cup.
Plastic or wooden spoons.
A stick blender, also called an immersion blender. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it reduces stirring time by about an hour.
Two glass thermometers that register between 80-100 degrees F. Candy thermometers work well for this purpose.
Plastic molds that are suitable for cold process soapmaking, or shoe box, or a wooden mold. If you use a shoebox or wooden mold, line it with parchment paper.
Multiple towels for cleanup.

, Before you start the soap-making process, read the safety warnings that came on your box of lye. Keep the following in mind as you handle lye or raw soap, before it has been cured:


Lye should never touch your skin, as it will burn you.
Wear safety goggles and glove at all times while handling lye and raw soap.
Work with lye outside or in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing in fumes.

, Use the scale to make sure the measurement is exact, and pour the lye into the two-cup measuring cup.

, Use the scale to make sure the measurement is exact, and pour the water into a large, non-aluminum container, such as a stainless steel pot or glass bowl.

, Place the container of water under your stove's running exhaust fan, or make sure the windows are open and the room is well-ventilated. Add the lye to the water slowly, stirring gently with a spoon until the lye is completely dissolved.


It is very important to add the lye to the water and not the other way around; if you add the water to the lye, the reaction between the two substances is too quick, and may be dangerous.
As you add the lye to the water, it will heat the water and release fumes. Keep your face turned away to avoid inhaling the fumes.
Set the mixture aside. Allow it to cool and let the fumes dissipate.

, Use the scale to weigh out 24 ounces of coconut oil, 38 ounces of vegetable shortening, and 24 ounces of olive oil.

, Set a large stainless steel pot on the stove on low-medium heat. Add the coconut oil and vegetable shortening and stir frequently until melted. Add the olive oil and stir until all are completely melted and combined, then remove the pot from heat.

, Use different thermometers for the lye and oils, and continue to monitor their temperatures until the lye reaches 95-98 degrees Fahrenheit (35-36 degrees Celsius) and the oils are at the same or lower temperature.

, When the two substances have reached the proper temperatures, add the lye in a slow, steady stream to the oils.


Stir with a wooden or heat-resistent spoon; do not use metal.
You may instead use a stick blender to stir the lye and oils.
Continue to mix for about 10-15 minutes until ""tracing"" occurs; you'll see your spoon leave a visible trace behind it, like one you'd see when making pudding. If you're using a stick blender, this should occur within about 5 minutes.
If you don't seen tracing within 15 minutes, let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes before continuing to mix again.

, Some fragrances and essential oils (cinnamon, for example), will cause soap to set quickly, so be ready to pour the soap into molds as soon as you stir in the essential oil.

, If you are using a shoebox or wooden mold, make sure it is lined with parchment paper. Use an old plastic spatula to scrape out the last bits of soap from the pot to the mold.


Be sure you are still wearing gloves and safety goggles during this step, since raw soap is caustic and can burn skin.
Carefully hold the mold an inch or two above the table and drop it. Do this a few times to work out any air bubbles inside the raw soap.

, If you're using a shoebox as a mold, put the lid on it and cover with several towels. If you're using a soap mold, tape a piece of cardboard over the top before adding towels.


The towels help insulate the soap to allow saponification to occur.
Leave the soap covered, undisturbed, and out of air drafts (including the air-conditioner) for 24 hours.

, The soap will go through a gel stage and a heat process during the 24 hours. Uncover the soap and let it sit for another 12 hours, then see what the results are.


If you measured accurately and followed the directions, the soap may have a light layer of a white ash-like substance on the top. This is basically harmless and can be scraped away with the edge of an old ruler or metal spatula.
If the soap has a deep oily film on top, it cannot be used, because it has separated. This will occur if your measurements were not accurate, you did not stir long enough, or if there is a drastic difference in the temperatures of the lye and oils when they are mixed.
If the soap did not set at all, or has white or clear pockets in it, this means it is caustic and cannot be used. This is caused by under-stirring during the soap-making process.

, Turn the box or mold over and allow the soap to fall on a towel or clean surface.

, You need to use tension to cut soap of this type. You can use a sharp knife, a length of wire with two handles, or heavy nylon string or fishing line.

, Set the soap on top of parchment paper on a flat surface or a drying rack for two weeks to allow the saponification process to complete and the soap to fully dry. Turn the soap over after two weeks to let it dry on the other side.

, Let the soap sit, exposed to air for at least one month. When the soap has fully cured, use in your home, as you would any store-bought soap, or wrap as a present for your friends. It will keep indefinitely.

, Important note: the caustic nature of the lye will etch the glass bowl making it appear frosted. The glass bowl will be fine but the look is permanent.

, The lye and water will react with each other and initially get very hot. Be sure to always add the lye to the water. Adding the water to the lye may cause a bubbling ""volcanic"" reaction.

,,, It is recommended to wear the goggles and rubber gloves here in case of any lye splashes.

, Expect to stir continuously for about 15 minutes, until the mixture starts to thicken, like pudding. This is called the ""trace"" stage. Using an electric stick blender is one way to speed up the stirring and bring the soap mixture to the ""trace"" stage more quickly.

, Again, the ""trace"" stage can be recognized by the patterns left in the soap mixture as it is stirred. It will resemble a thickening pudding.

, Be sure that the soap mixture is evenly distributed.

, Wrapping the molds in a blanket or towel for insulation will keep the soap warm and accelerate the curing process.

, Remove the soap from the mold, cut in to bars and allow the bars to cure and dry out for 4-6 weeks.

If it shows the drop on top of your mixture then blends back in easily, you have reached thin soap trace. Do not let your soap trace get too thick. A hand blender can speed up your soap trace and become too thick before you realize it.;
, Add essential oil or fragrance first. Then add your herbs and color last. The reason for this is that some essential oils and scents can change the color you desire your homemade soap to have. Blend them well before pouring your soap mixture in your soap mold.

, The soap mixture has to be very thin trace for it to swirl properly.

, Then pour the colored soap mixture into your base soap mixture after you have poured it into your mold. Use a wooden spoon handle or dowel to adjust the color in the direction you want it.

Use the flower pot.",How to Decoupage Flower Pots," You can use any size of terra cotta pot for this. If you plan on putting a plant into your pot, it must have a drainage hole at the bottom. It would be a good idea to pick up a matching saucer for it as well. You won't be decoupaging the saucer, but you can paint the outside to match your pot.;
, Even if you bought your pot brand-new, it may still be covered in dust. This can prevent the paint and glue from sticking. Wipe the entire pot, inside and out, with a damp sponge, then set it out to dry.


If the pot has any rough edges, buff them away with some sandpaper. Be sure to wipe the pot down again when you are done., You can use the spray-on kind or the brush-on kind. Let each coat dry before applying the next one. How long it takes for each coat to dry depends on the type of sealant you are using. If you plan on putting a plant into the pot, it would be best to use an oil-based sealant. If you'll be using the pot as a decoration or to hold craft supplies, you can use a water-based sealant.The sealant is important, especially if you'll be adding a plant. It will keep moisture from sinking into the pot and causing the paint/glue to bubble., You don't have to paint the pot at all if you don't want to, but it will give your design a nicer background. Once again, let each coat of paint dry before applying the next one.Acrylic paint dries quickly, so you'll only have to wait 15 to 20 minutes between each coat. When you are done painting, let the pot dry completely.


You can paint the pot any color you want, but something that matches the background of your paper will work the best., Wrapping paper, scrapbooking paper, tissue paper, and napkins make great choices. Seed packets also work well.If you can't find any paper that you like, cotton fabric is a great alternative. Choose something with shapes that are easy to cut out, such as birds or flowers.


You can use any design you want, but something nature-themed would look the best on a flower pot.
How much paper you need depends on how big your pot is and how much of it you plan to cover up. You can cover your entire pot with paper, or you can add just a few designs on it., For example, if your paper has birds on it, cut the birds out, and leave the background alone. You can also carefully tear around the shapes instead. This will give you a more rustic touch. It will also make it easier to overlap the edges if you plan on covering the entire pot.


If you are using a seed packet, you could simply cut around the front image so that it's a square or rectangle.If you are tearing a napkin, outline your shapes with a clean, wet paintbrush first. This will make your tears more precise., The patch needs to be a little bigger than the first image you will be laying down. You can apply the glue using a paintbrush or a foam brush.


You can use any type of decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. The finish does not matter because you will be sealing the pot later on.

, Flip your cut paper over and paint the back with a thin coat of decoupage glue.You can skip this step if you are using thin paper, such as tissue paper or napkin. This is because the glue that's already on the paper will seep through it.

, Use your fingers or a clean foam brush to smooth the paper down. Start from the middle and work your way outwards towards the edges.


If you are using a napkin, you will need to peel away the blank, back layer first., Paint the glue on in thin layers, starting from the center of the image. Extend the glue just past the image and onto the pot. The brush will help smooth down the edges, and seal them against the pot.

, You can glue down just one image, or several. You can even overlap images for a collaged effect. If you choose to overlap images, it might be a good idea to let the first layer dry. This will prevent things from getting too soggy.


You can cover the upper rim of the pot if you want to, but don't put anything inside the pot.
Leave the bottom of the pot blank.

, Take a close look at the top and bottom of your pot. If there are any rough, uneven edges leftover from the decoupage, file them down with a piece of fine-grit sandpaper or a nail file., Let each coat dry before applying the next one. Also, make sure that you extend the glue just past the bottom and top edges of your pot. This will help seal the designs in further. Wait for the pot to dry completely before moving on., Once more, allow each coat to dry fully before applying the next one. A water-based sealant would be best here, as an oil-based one may add a yellowish tint to your pot.For something more durable, use the type of varnish meant for boats.This will be your last coat, so use a finish that you like: matte, satin, or glossy.
You only have to do this if you will be putting soil into the pot. If you'll be using the pot as decoration, you don't need this extra coat.

, Overnight is best, but it would be best to check the label on your bottle of sealant. Some types of sealers have a curing time as well, which can take a few days. If you use your pot before everything has finished drying or curing, the surface may turn tacky.

, If you picked up a saucer for your flower pot, you can paint it as well. Only paint the outside edges, not the inside or bottom. Even with a waterproof sealer, the saucer will pick up too much water. This may sauce the finish to warp.


Use colors and patterns that match your decoupaged pot.

, If you plan on putting a plant into it, line the bottom with a coffee filter, a scrap of fabric, or a piece of window screening. This will help keep the dirt from falling through the hole at the bottom. You can also use the flower pot as a pencil holder on your desk, or as a piece of decoration.

Slowly pour the lye into the water. NOT THE WATER INTO THE LYE! It is important to use ice cold water because lye increases water temperature and you do not want it to get too hot.,,

Soap molds can be purchased at many hobby or craft stores. You can also use loaf pans and then cut the finished soap into bars. Cardboard cylinders can also be used because you can cut right through the cardboard to make round bars. Some recommend cutting your soap with a wire. Wire makes smoother cuts and leaves less broken pieces than cutting with a knife.

Gather your materials.,
Trim the wood down, if necessary.,
Create a rectangle out of the sides.,
Glue the bottom piece in place.,
Let dry.,
Use your mold to make soap.,
Address leaks.",How to Make Soap Molds1," To start making a rectangular shaped mold, first gather your materials. You should be able to find the materials for this mold at most craft stores. For this mold, you'll need the following:


Two pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 12"" by 4"" lengthTwo pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 4″ lengthOne piece of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 11″ lengthWood clampsWood glue;
, You may not find craft wood cut into the exact dimensions you need. You should be able to ask someone at the store to trim the wood down for you.If this option is not available, you can cut most craft wood on your own with a small handsaw.Measure the wood using a ruler or measuring tape. Draw a line marking the dimensions with a pen or pencil. Use your handsaw to gently saw along that line.
If the sides are rough, use sandpaper to smooth them down. Sand paper is rated by grit number. The higher the grit number, the stronger the sandpaper. As craft glue is fairly soft, you do not need a high grit sandpaper for your soap mold. Stick to grit levels below 100, as anything above a 100-level grit is best used on large furniture., Once your wood is cut into the proper dimensions, you can begin assembling your mold. To start, assemble the sides of the wood to form a rectangle.


The 12"" by 4"" boards make up the longer sides of the rectangle. The 3 1/2"" by 4"" sides make up the shorter sides. The shorter sides will fit inside the longer sides.Take the 12"" by 4"" boards. Place a line of wood glue along each 4"" side. Then, place the 3 1/2"" by 4"" sides between the 12"" by 4"" boards, creating a rectangle-shape with your boards. Use the wood clamps to secure while the wood is drying., Once the glue is dry to the touch, and the rectangle feels secure without the wood clamps, you can add the bottom board. The 3 1/2″ x 11″ board fits inside the rectangle. Run some wood glue along each side of the bottom board and then place it inside the rectangle. Use wood clamps to secure the board in place.If your board feels flimsy, use a cordless screwdriver to place four screws into the board where the sides connect. This will further secure the board, as wood glue may loose strength over time., Once you've assembled your board, set is aside and let it dry. To be 100% sure everything is dry, it's best to set your board aside overnight before use.

, Once you're done creating your board, you can use it to make soap. Make sure to line your board first, as liquid soap will stick to wood. You can use parchment paper or trash bags to line your board.It can take soap anywhere from a few hours to a few days to set. It depends on the soap recipe you're using. Once the soap is set, simply remove it from the board. Set it aside for 3 to 4 weeks to allow it to dry completely., In the event your box leaks, examine the area where the leak is occurring. You can seal this area up with masking tape, duct table, or extra wood glue. Also, you can deal with leaks by lining the box with parchment paper before use.

Make sure you get your liquid soap ready before preparing a cylinder mold, as you'll be pouring the soap in as you go along. To start, gather your supplies, most of which you can find at a local craft store. You will need the following:


A PVC pipe
A wooden cutting board
Masking tape
Heavy duty wax paper or baking paper
Old towels
A ladle
Plastic wrap, Wrap the wax or baking paper around the end of the pipe, making sure to cover completely so no soap leaks out. Then, take the masking tape and wrap it around the end of the pipe. Use a few layers of tape to make sure the wax paper is secure. You can also use rubber bands., Set your pipe down vertically. Use your ladle to transfer liquid soap into the pipe. Do not fill the pipe completely. Stop when you're about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the top of the pipe., Tightly wrap the plastic wrap around the other end of the pipe. Use a few pieces of tape or a rubber band to secure the plastic wrap. You want to keep the soap insulated during the curing process., Use old towels that you do not mind damaging. Soap may leak out, causing stains or odors. Wrap the mold in enough towels to cover the pipe completely, preventing outside air from getting into the mold., Set the mold aside for 48 hours, or as long as your soap recipe indicates it will take for the soap to dry. At this point, the soap should be cool enough to remove. Choose a safe place to keep the mold, away from children and animals. You want to make sure the mold is not moved or disturbed during the drying process., Once the soap is dry, you can remove it from the mold. This can be a little tricky. You should be able to push the soap through the pipe using a bottle or jar. If you have trouble removing the soap, consider lining the mold with parchment paper ahead of time the next time you use this method. This may make the soap slide out easier."

You will need a few seashells, large enough to contain about half a cup of liquid soap. You can purchase seashells online or at a craft store. If you live near the ocean, you can collect seashells yourself.If you're using seashells you find, scrub thoroughly with antibacterial soap and rinse before use., Once your seashells are chosen and prepared, pour the liquid soap into each shell. Set the shell on a flat surface and, if necessary, hold the shell down to prevent spilling. Do not fill the seashell to the brim. Leave about half an inch of wiggle room at the top., Take some plastic wrap. Wrap each mold in a few layers of plastic wrap, making sure to use enough layers prevent outside air from getting in and to keep the soap from leaking., Once the molds are secured in plastic wrap, place the shells in a box. You can use any box you can find, like a shoebox. Cover the box with plastic wrap. This helps insulate the soap, quickening the drying process., Choose a safe place, away from children or animals, where the box is unlikely to be disturbed. Your soap recipe should indicate how long the soap should take to try. Usually, it takes around 24 to 28 hours., After 24 to 48 hours, remove each mold from the shells. Place the shells on a drying rack. They should be fully dry in 4 to 8 weeks."

Copper and aluminum products will have a negative chemical reaction with lye. Choose products made of tempered glass, enamel, or stainless steel. Lye can also melt some plastics so be sure to check what works best.Styrene plastic or silicone soap-only spoons are best for this project.;
, Choose from a variety of soap molds at your local craft store or have fun with silicone baking pans that can be purchased at your local baking goods chain. Choose silicone products to easily peel off the soap from its mold.

, In addition to mixing bowls and spoons, you will need a pint and a quart canning jar, a stainless steel thermometer that can read between 90 - 200 degrees Fahrenheit, newspaper, and an old towel on hand., Protect yourself with goggles, gloves, and with newspaper to cover your work area from the lye. Wear a mask to protect yourself from the fumes produced by the chemical reaction created as you mix the lye with water. Pour water into your quart canning jar. Scoop ¼ cup of lye and slowly pour it in with the water making sure to stir it until the mixture is clear. Allow the mixture to sit.Use cold distilled water. Purchase distilled water at your local grocery store or pharmacy.
Purchase lye online or at your local drug or craft store.

, Mix your oils together as you pour them into the pint jar. Heat the pint jar once you have mixed your oils for about a minute if you are using a microwave. You may also heat in a pan of water on your stove until the oils reach 120 °F (48.9 °C).Use olive or coconut oil if you want to make a mild or hard bar of soap that produces a good lather. Grape-seed oil, safflower oil, almond oil and sunflower oil also produce similar effects.

, The lye and oils should cool around 95° and 105° degrees Fahrenheit. Do not allow them to cool below this temperature or they will be coarse and may crumble easily. Stir in the lye with your hand slowly once they have reached the right temperature. Stir the oils and lye for about 5 minutes in a mixing bowl.If available, use an immersion blender so that as much soap touches the lye as possible. Trace is when the soap looks and feels like vanilla pudding. It should be thick with a light colour. Once you have trace you are ready to add your essential oils and herbs.Wait until the lye reaches a thin trace before mixing the coconut milk with the water. Add coconut milk that is slightly warm., Stir thoroughly and pour ¾ of the mixture into your soap molds or silicone baking molds.

, Mix the petals into the remaining mixture. Create a zig zag pattern by pouring the new flower petal mixture over top the mold.To ensure the coloured soap reaches throughout the mold, change the height from which you pour the remaining flower petal mixture. Raising the soup bucket and lowering it will allow the petal mixture to penetrate the white soap base at different depths., Swirl the soap into a marble pattern or create other details before storing the shea butter soap., Allow residual heat to warm the mixture by covering with a towel. The saponification process will be started with this residual heat.The process that turns your base ingredients into soap is called Saponification.

, Check your soap after a day or 24 hours. If it still feels soft or slightly warm, wait another day or until it is firm and cool. Remove it from the wrap and allow it to cure for about a month. Be sure to turn it over once a week or place it on a baking rack to expose the entire surface to air."

Avoid the fumes that are produced when mixing the lye with the water and be aware that heat will also be produced.Do not mix water in with lye because there is a strong chemical reaction that occurs producing heat and fumes. Controlling the lye allows you to control the chemical reaction.

, To speed the cooling process, place the container in a basin of water or simply place it in your sink. Make sure to mix and keep at a well ventilated area. To be safe, create the shea butter outdoors., Measure and pour the coconut oil into a soap-making pan. Do not use equipment that will be used for cooking. Use bowls and equipment made from stainless steel, tempered glass, and enamel. Avoid using copper and aluminum as they have a negative reaction with lye. Moreover, some plastics melt when mixed with lye.Use soap-only spoons made of styrene plastic or silicone., Mix the zinc oxide with a tablespoon of the liquid oils. Once the coconut oil is melted, stop heating it and mix castor oil, sunflower oil, and olive oil. Use a digital thermometer to ensure the mixture is around 85-90°F. Take the temperature of the lye water and mix until it also reaches close to 85-90°F. Keep mixing the 2 separate mixtures until they are at within 5 degrees of one another., Use the double boiler method by placing the shea butter into a heat-proof container and floating that container inside a pan filled with boiling water., Pour the lye water through a sieve and into the oils ensuring that both mixtures are about 5 degrees within 85-90°F. The sieve ensures no pieces of lye are in your final bar of soap. Use a whisk to gently stir the new mixture together., Tap the stick blender against the side of the container holding the lye-water-oils mixture using short pulses. While the stick blender is off, stir the mixture in between each pulse to bring the soap to a trace. Trace is when your lye has successfully mixed with the oils of your soap and produces a thick consistency similar to vanilla pudding.It may take time to bring the soap to the consistency of pudding because you are using a low temperature. Keep pulsing and stirring.

, Pour the zinc oxide oil, jojoba, melted shea butter, and vitamin E oil into the soap and use a whisk to mix. Vigorously and thoroughly work the mixture as soap will quickly become stiff and difficult to work., Stir thoroughly and pour the mixture into your soap molds or silicone baking molds.

Next, place a pouring pot intended for soap making into the saucepan. You can also use a large, glass measuring cup instead.

Consider placing a metal ring or metal lid in the saucepan under the pouring pot/measuring cup. This will help distribute the heat more evenly.;
, Most melt-and-pour soap bases will come in larger blocks, so you likely won't end up using all of it.

Make sure that you are using a melt-and-pour soap base and not a regular bar of soap.
Goat's milk soap is recommended for this method, but you can also use a different melt-and-pour soap base, such as shea butter.

, While the soap is melting, you can start preparing your soap making molds, if needed. If you are using silicone molds, you likely don't need to do anything. If you are using plastic molds, however, consider lightly greasing them with coconut oil. This will make the soap easier to remove once it sets up.If you are using a plain soap making mold, consider placing a soap making stamp in the bottom, design-side-up.

, Using a pot holder, carefully take the pouring pot out of the saucepan, set it down onto the heat-safe surface, then stir in your essential oil.Grapefruit essential oil is recommended for this method, but if you don't have any, or just don't like it, you can use another type of essential oil instead. You can also use sop-making fragrance, but you might want to start with a smaller amount, as they are much more potent.
If you want unscented soap, skip this step.

, It may sound luxurious, but it has too high of a mineral content, and the soap may not set properly as a result., The soap should pour smoothly. If you need to, however, use a rubber spatula to help scrape the soap out of the pouring pot, and into the molds. Don't worry if the salt sinks to the bottom of the mold.

This is enough to fill four 4-ounce (120-milliliter) soap molds. You can also use smaller molds as well; you will simply end up with more, smaller bars of soap.

, After a few hours, flip the soap over, so that the bottom can dry too. It may take a few days for the soap to finish drying."

Get 4 bars of soap, each weighing 4 ounces (113 grams).This method produces something that is called ""re-batch soap."",
Shave the soap using a cheese grater.,
Transfer the soap into a medium-sized pot and add ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of milk.,
Stir the soap, then let it sit in the liquid for 2 to 3 hours.,
Heat the soap over medium-low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it softens.,
Cover the pot with a lid, and the soap continue heating until it won't soften any more.,
Stir in the shea butter and cocoa butter, then allow the butters to melt.,
Take the soap off the stove, then stir in your oils.,
Stir in 3 tablespoons (49.89 grams) of pink Himalayan salt.,
Use a spoon or rubber spatula to press the soap into you molds.,
Place the soap in the freezer for 30 to 45 minutes.,
Pop the soap out of the mold, and let it finish drying on a baking sheet.",How to Make Salted Soap2," The soap created by this method will never be as smooth as soap created by other methods. It will have a rustic, grainy texture to it, which some people find Aesthetically  pleasing.The soap can be scented or unscented, colored or white, but make sure that they are all the same.
The soap does not have to be brand new. Re-batch soap-making is a great way to use up old slivers of soap.

, Work over a large bowl, and keep grating until you have about 1 pound (453 grams) of soap.Alternatively, you can chop the soap up into very find grains using a sharp knife, or grind it in a food processor., If the soap doesn't fit into the pot, gently press down on it until it does fit.If you are vegan, or don't like the idea of using milk in your soap, you can use distilled water instead. Both will add moisture back to your soap, and prevent it from becoming too dry., This will allow the soap to start ""melting"" and will ensure that it is moist enough for the next step. You do not want the soap to burn., Unlike melt-and-pour soap, re-batch soap will never become fully liquid. Instead, it will become soft and sticky, sort of like mashed potatoes or oatmeal.If the soap starts to become dry at any point, add in another tablespoon (15 milliliters) of milk or water. Be careful not to over-do this, however. If you add too much liquid, your soap won't set up properly and will take too long to dry once it is made.If your soap is scented, consider turning the stove fan on or opening up a window. As the soap heats up, it will start releasing its fragrance oils, which can cause headaches.

, From time to time, crack open the lid, and use a rubber spatula to scrape any soap down the sides of the pot. Eventually, the soap will reach its final consistency, and not soften any more. At this point, turn off the burner, and take the saucepan off the stove.Be patient during this step; it can take up to 2 to 3 hours for the soap to reach this stage.
Do not allow the soap to burn. If it starts to burn, lower the heat, and add a little cold water.Again, if the soap starts to feel dry, stir in some more water.

, Once the butters have melted, give the mixture a stir with a rubber spatula. If you can only find one of the butters and not the other, simply use more of the butter that you do have., The hemp seed oil is there to soften and nourish your skin. If you don't have any hemp seed oil, or simply don't like using it, you can use another type of oil instead. Vitamin E oil would work great, but so would olive oil and coconut oil. If your soap is not fragranced, and you'd like it to be, add in some lavender essential oil (or any other type of essential oil that you prefer). You can also use soap making fragrance oils; start with a smaller amount, as they are more potent than essential oils.

If you soap is scented, skip the essential oils.

, You can use all the same grain and texture, or you can experiment with combining different grain sizes. If you don't have any pink Himalayan salt, you can use sea salt instead. Avoid Dead Sea salt, however. It may sound fancy and luxurious, but is mineral content is too high. As a result, the soap may not set properly., From time to time, tap your mold against the table or counter. This will help settle the soap into the grooves of the mold. When you are done, smooth the top of the soap down with the back of your spoon or rubber spatula. If your spoon or spatula are sticking to the soap too much, sprinkle more salt on top of the soap, then try again. The salt will help create a barrier between the soap and the spoon, as well as add texture.

You can use silicone or plastic soap molds for this. If you are using plastic molds, consider lightly greasing them with coconut oil first. This will make it easier to pop the soaps out later on.
Consider adding a sprinkle of lavender flowers to the bottom of your mold, before you add the soap. This will give your soap a nice texture.
This is enough to fill about four 4-ounce (120-milliliter) soap molds. You can use smaller molds too, if you'd like. You will just end up with more bars of soap that are a little smaller.

, This will help the soap set up faster.If you don't want to do this, allow it to set on your counter for a 24 hours., The soap is ready when it is no longer dry; this can take a few days."

Find an area to hang the chime.",How to Build and Tune a Wind Chime," The sound the chimes will make depends on many factors, such as what the chimes are made of, how long they are, and how thick they are. The most common substances for chimes are metal tubes, pipes, and rods, which you can find at hardware stores, craft stores, or from scrap metal. Try to choose pipes that have a uniform thickness on all sides for an even tone.Pipes and tubes are the same in wind chimes. Rods are not hollow and sustain notes longer.
Hard metals such as steel and aluminum produce sharper tones. Soft metals such as copper produce softer tones.
Metal objects are good at producing vibrations, so non-metal chimes such as glass sound more hollow.
To test out the sounds of different metal pipes such as copper or aluminum, visit a chime store or rap on the pipes with something that creates vibration, such as a piece of wood.
You can also experiment with many imaginative materials for chimes such as shells or glass.;
, These lines, made of chain, synthetic cord, or another sturdy material, connect the base from which the chimes dangle to whatever holds the wind chime. Cords such as strong nylon are good for bearing the weight of the wind chime and can also be used when connecting the chimes and the striker.


The support line material has little impact on the sound. It’s how you hang the chimes that will determine sound, so choose line materials that will last.
If you want to hang the chime from a hook or a tree, buy a metal ring to tie to the lines at the top of the chime.

, Also called a clapper, the striker is the piece that fits between the chimes and bumps into them to create the vibrations that cause sound. Possible choices for strikers include redwood or hockey pucks.Strikers are often circular so that they can hit all chimes equally. Strikers can also be star-shaped. These hit all chimes at the same time with less force.
The weight and material of the striker, in conjunction with the qualities of the chimes, will produce a unique sound.

, The platform holds the chimes, letting them hang around the object that will strike them. Buy a piece big enough for your design. The piece should be bigger than the striker.


Suspension platforms are often made out of wood, metal, or plastic.
Choose a platform that can hold five to eight chimes at equal lengths.

, The sail is the part that hangs from the striker. Extending lower than the chimes, it gets caught up in the wind, forcing the striker to move into the chimes. Sails are often rectangular or rounded and made of a substance that can be moved by a decent wind, such as a block of wood.The sail can be carved from wood into many artistic forms, such as animal shapes, but you may find it easier to choose a simple block of wood that you can drill into and hang from the striker with a suspension line.
A small sail will be less durable, but a bigger sail will require more wind to move.

, Choose five to eight points where you will suspend your chimes. Indicate the points with a marker. This is where you’ll drill holes, so the marks should indicate that the chimes are equidistant from the center with equal space between each chime. Don’t forget to include a hole for where the striker will hang.


Mark the other side of the base, too, to indicate where you plan on drilling holes to make the base hang from the wind chime’s point of suspension if needed.

, These should be tiny holes. Your goal is to be able to run the thread on the chimes through them. Drill a hole in the center of the platform between the holes for the chime threads, then drill a hole through the striker's center and one corner of the sail.

, Cut an appropriate length of thread. This depends on how low you want these pieces to hang. For a five foot thread, for example, fold the thread in half, then pull it through the sail and knot it. Make a second large knot where the striker will hang about 16 inches or less above, then thread it through the striker.


Try to keep the sail close to the bottom of the longest chime. The longer the sail’s support line, the stronger the wind has to be to move the sail and its extra weight.
Remember that wind velocity is often stronger the higher you hang the wind chime, so a sail too close to the ground also won’t cause the chimes to sound as much., Take the thread coming out of the top of the striker and run it through the hole you made in the center of the platform. On the top side, knot the thread securely. This thread, if you chose to make it long enough, can be used to suspend the entire chime. You can also choose to add other hanging implements such as hooks.

, If you want a specific set of tones, now’s the time to measure. Otherwise, you can plan on making the chimes as long as you wish, keeping in mind that shorter chimes produce higher-pitched tones.


Many commercial chimes play a five-note pentatonic scale. The way you achieve the proper notes depends on the type of pipe you use., Measure out the desired length on the chime material, mark it, then start cutting it. To do this, you’ll need to have a pipe cutter, a hacksaw, or a hand saw. For hand saws, be sure to choose a blade that is made for the kind of metal you are cutting.


Your local hardware store may be able to cut the pipes for you.
If you have a piano, tune the chimes by playing a note and matching the sound they make when you rap on them, then cut off more of the chime as needed.

, Wrap the pipes in towels to protect them. Use a file or sander to wear down the sharp edges on points. If you didn’t cut enough off the pipes, you can sand off the excess here. Unless you’re removing significant portions of the material, which makes the pitch higher, the chime’s sound won’t change.

, How you wish to make the holes depends on the material you have chosen and how you wish to hang the chimes. For copper pipes, for instance, you can drill holes into the sides in the area you wish to suspend by thread then run the thread through later.

, Take the suspension lines you have chosen. Measure out your desired length. It’s better to keep the chimes as close to the suspension platform as possible so that the chimes do not sway much, instead allowing the striker to do the work.


The length of this thread, if the striker’s suspension line isn’t measured to compensate, changes how the striker aligns with the chimes. The striker may have problems reaching some of the chimes.
Chimes that hang too low are more vulnerable in wind and move more, making the wind chime out of tune because the striker doesn’t hit them evenly., How you thread depends on what kind of hole you’ve made. For a chime with two holes, for instance, run the thread through the holes enough so you can tie a knot. You could also choose more complicated methods, such as filling the holes with a screw that you knot the thread around or drill into end caps that you make a knot inside before gluing the caps on the chimes., To do this, run the threads through the holes you made in the platform. Knot them on the other end. When you hold up the platform now, the chimes should hang with the striker between them and the sail below.


To achieve balance with the platform, try distributing the weight of the chimes as equally as possible. Hang long chimes on opposite sides.

, Hold the wind chime up or find a makeshift way to hang it, such as temporarily knotting a string. Provide wind or strike the chimes to see if they provide the desired sound. Check to see if all the parts hang evenly and securely.

, Chances are your chimes currently are top-aligned. This means the top of all the chimes hangs from the platform and the striker hits a little below the midline of the longest chime. You can manipulate the chimes and their strings for different sounds.In a bottom-alignment, the bottoms of the chimes are all level. The strings hanging them are different lengths and the striker hits a little below the center of the shortest chime.
In a center-alignment, the striker is even with the center of all the chimes. The string lengths are all different and the tops and bottoms of the chimes don’t align.

, If you haven’t run a wire through the top of the suspension platform, you can push a hook into it instead. You may need to use pliers to bend the hook over so it can latch onto the metal chain you use to hang the wind chime.


Other options include running one or more of the chime and striker threads through the platform or installing a triangle of hooks to tie together for hanging the wind chime.

, Stick the chime on a tree branch, from a metal ring or hook, or wherever else it pleases you. Find a location that provides an adequate amount of wind and keep the chime off the ground to achieve the desired sound.

You will also need glue. A hot glue gun works best, but children should have adult supervision. Also have paper, scissors, and a utility knife.


If you don’t want to use hot glue, a regular bottle of craft glue will work.
Always practice caution when using a hot glue gun as it can burn you.;
, Since you will be working with glue, it’s best to cover whatever surface you are working on with newspaper, a disposable tablecloth, or something that will protect the surface.
/images/thumb/3/3b/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-2-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-2-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3b/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-2-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-2-Version-6.jpg









Hot glue can be hard to remove from surfaces so take extra precaution. Hot glue will also spill out of the gun sometimes, so always set it over the covered surface.

, Lay down two Popsicle sticks parallel to each other, the same distance apart as the length of one stick. Lay two more sticks on top of the first two forming a square. Glue these at the corners. Repeat this to build three more squares.
/images/thumb/3/3a/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-3-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3a/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-3-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-3-Version-6.jpg









These squares will become the walls of the house.

, With the square laying flat, glue enough sticks in a line to cover the entire square. Place a line of glue on two of the opposite sides of the square and lay the sticks in place. Repeat this to complete all four walls.
/images/thumb/b/b9/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-4-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/b/b9/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-4-Version-6.jpg









Be sure that you place the sticks tight together so that there are no gaps in the wall.
You may not have room for an entire stick when you get to the the end, so use the utility knife to trim a stick down to fit in the final spot.

, Take three Popsicle sticks and form a triangle, overlapping the sticks at the corners. It doesn’t matter which of the sticks lays on top of which. Use a small drop of glue to connect the sticks at all three corners. Repeat the same process to make another triangle./images/thumb/f/f8/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-5-Version-5.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f8/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-5-Version-5.jpg









This basic roof uses just two triangles as the trusses, but you can make a more stable roof by making a third triangle, which would go between the two main ones in the roof.

, Place a dot of glue on the flat side of each end of a Popsicle stick. Attach the stick to both triangles so that it runs perpendicular. Repeat this process until you have covered the length of the triangles’ sides with sticks. Place the sticks tight together. Hold each stick in place for at least 5 seconds so the glue will hold.
/images/thumb/4/40/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-6-Version-6.jpg
/images/thumb/4/40/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-6-Version-6.jpg









Be gentle as you lay each stick so that you don’t pull any of the previous ones apart from the triangles.

, In the same way that you laid the first side of the roof, glue sticks in place for the opposite side of the roof. Continue to be careful as you handle the roof so that you don’t break any of the sticks apart from the roof.
/images/thumb/0/0d/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-7-Version-4.jpg
/images/thumb/0/0d/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-7-Version-4.jpg








, You now have a roof frame that is open on either end. As an optional addition you can close off the interior of the roof completely. Starting from the bottom of the roof, glue a stick across the frame. As you add each additional stick, you will need to cut it slightly shorter as the triangle narrows toward its apex.
/images/thumb/8/89/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-8-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-8-Version-5.jpg

Closing the roof off completely will add realism to your Popsicle stick house as this is how real houses are constructed.

, If you want to enhance the house, you can cut one or two windows into the walls. This is easiest to do before you glue the walls together. Take the utility knife and carefully cut a 1 inch by 1 inch square in one or more of the walls./images/thumb/7/74/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-9-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/7/74/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-9-Version-2.jpg









Either center the window or you can cut it off to the side if you want to.
To make further adornments to the house, you could use the pieces you just cut from the window to create shutters on the sides or a frame around the window.

, You can make your Popsicle house look even more realistic by cutting out a door. The size of craft sticks you use will determine how big the door should be. Make the door size most of the height of the house and about ⅓ of the width. Cut the door out with the utility knife.
/images/thumb/5/5b/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-10-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/5/5b/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-10-Version-2.jpg









You can glue a piece of paper the size of the door opening on the edge of the opening to act as an actual door. Bend the paper along the edge that you glue to simulate the door swinging open and closed.

, Take two of the walls and stand them so that the sticks are vertical. Squeeze a line of glue along the inside edge of the stick on the end of each wall. Gently press the glued edges together and hold for about 30 seconds./images/thumb/9/92/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-11-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/9/92/Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Build-a-Popsicle-House-Step-11-Version-2.jpg









Attach the remaining two walls one at a time to complete the basic structure of the house.

, Glue the roof in place by running a line along the entire top edge of the house. Set the roof onto the house and gently press down long enough for the glue to hold. You also have the option of not gluing the roof down and leaving it detachable so that you can place things inside the house.

, You have nearly unlimited options for how to decorate it. Use spray paint to paint the whole house one color. Use a small paintbrush to paint the walls one color and the roof another color. Attach fabric or gift wrap to give the walls of the house a pattern. You could glue moss, flowers, or sticks to the house to give it a woodsy look.

If you want to, you can trim it down a little further to make a shorter cup., Place a drop of hot glue on top of a soda bottle cap. Quickly place another bottle cap on top of it, upside down, so that the top parts are connected. Draw a line of hot glue around the rim of one of the bottle caps, then place a third bottle cap on top. Make sure that the top part is facing out and that all three bottle caps are aligned.Leave the bottle cap that's already on the bottle in place. Don't include it in the stem.

, Flip the disk over so that the blank side is facing you. Draw a line of hot glue around the bottom rim of your bottle cap stem. Quickly press the stem down onto the middle of the disk. Make sure that the top part of the last bottle cap is facing out.If you can't find a CD or DVD to use, you can use a round, plastic lid from a yogurt container.
If you are using a smaller bottle, a CD or DVD will be too big. Use a small, plastic lid, or cut a disk out of thin cardboard. It should be the same diameter as the bottle.

, Place a large drop of hot glue on the top of your cut bottle, right in the middle of the cap. Flip the bottle over, and press it down onto the stem. Once again, make sure that all of the bottle caps are aligned and even., You don't have to do this, but it will help make everything look like it is made from the same material. Silver and gold are great choices, but you can use a different color as well. Don't paint the inside of the cup, especially if you plan on filling it.


If you are using a plastic wine glass, you can leave it clear.
If you don't want to paint the cup but still want it colored, paint it with decoupage glue, then cover it with small pieces of tissue paper. Give it another coat of glue to seal it all in., You can use all one shape and color, or you can play around with different shapes and colors for a unique pattern. If you don't have any rhinestones, you can use beads, buttons, sequins, or glass tiles instead. You can also try using self-adhesive rhinestones or rhinestone stickers. This is a great option for younger children.


Avoid making the decorations too heavy, or your cup may tip over.

, If you have extra rhinestones left over, you can arrange them on the side/bowl part of your cup in a pretty design. For example, you could hot glue a large rhinestone to the side of the cup, then glue smaller ones around it.To give your cup a nicer touch, outline the rhinestones with glitter glue.

, This is the part that gets handled the most, so you'll want to go easy on the decorations here. Instead, wrap something flat and smooth around the handle. Great choices include colored/patterned washi tape or ribbon. You can also paint the handle with glue, then wind colored string or yarn around it to cover it up.


If your handle still looks too plain, you can hot glue some more rhinestones around the middle. Don't get too carried away, however.

, Try to use the same pattern that you did on the cup part. You can also make the decorations here a little heavier if you'd like to. This will help give the cup more support. As a final touch, you could outline the edge of the base with glitter glue.

Try to get clean sand from your local home improvement store or arts and crafts store. Sand from the beach or playground isn't always very clean.
If you have not already colored your sand, consider using pre-colored sand instead. You can find it in the children's crafts section or the floral section of an arts and crafts store.

, Although making this is a lot of fun, do remember to leave time at the end for your child to enjoy it, too! And when you go to play with it later, you can revive the stuff with 2-3 tablespoons of water.And when you're done, package it all up in a resealable, air-tight container. Store it in a cool, dry place to maximize its longevity. It should keep and be usable for 2-3 months."

Enjoy!",How to Make Oatmeal Soap1," This is a much simpler recipe than making your soap from scratch. It involves melting a pre-made soap base down and then modifying it with your own ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:1 lb Soap base of your choosing (suspension-friendly)
4 oz rolled oats (can add more or less to suit your tastes)
1.5 tsp almond oil (optional)
2 oz roasted almonds (optional)
1 to 2 tbsp honey (optional)
Pot and/or heat-proof container for melting soap
Large bowl or measuring cup for mixing
Whisk or spoon for mixing
Soap mould or pan measuring roughly 9 x 4 inches
Wax paper or parchment paper (optional);
, Craft shops have many different soap base options: goat’s milk, shea butter, and olive oil are popular choices.Most importantly, choose a suspension formula to ensure that your oats won’t sink to the bottom of the soap during the cooling process.

Soap bases are often called “melt-and-pour” soap bases by crafters, since all you need to do is melt down the base, add your ingredients, pour it into a mould, and then let it cool.
If a soap base isn’t easy for you to obtain, you can also purchase a regular bar of soap and just melt it down, add the oats, and let it cool. Any soap bar will do, although one with higher-quality ingredients will make your skin feel nicer.

, You can use whatever moulds you like for this recipe. If you’re making regular bar soap, you can get away with using a 9 x 4 inch baking pan. You can really use whatever shape you want though.

If you use metal or plastic containers that aren’t specifically made for soap, be sure to line them with wax paper or parchment paper before pouring your soap into them. This will make it much easier for you to remove the soap once it’s cooled.
Some soap-makers even line their professional soap moulds. This helps prevent the soap from getting stuck in the corners of rectangular and square moulds. If you’re using moulds with more detailed shapes, you won’t want to line them as this will obscure the design.

, Add your oats to a coffee grinder or food processor, or crush them using a mortar and pestle or rolling pin. You want to make an even, fine powder from the oats. This is called colloidal oatmeal and is great for soothing your skin.If you’re using a food processor, it will likely take between 5 and 10 minutes to get the oats down into a fine powder.

, Add almonds to the ground oats and grind together until they are both ground down into a fine powder. Be careful not to overdo it with the almonds, otherwise you’ll end up with almond butter.

If you’re using a food processor it will likely take another 5 to 10 minutes to get the almonds ground down into a fine powder.

, You can do this by placing it directly in a saucepan over low heat. Another option is to place it in a large heat-proof bowl and place that bowl in a saucepan full of a few inches of simmering water (i.e. a double-boiler).

You can also melt the soap base down in the microwave. For this option, you’d put it in a heat-proof container (ceramic or glass) and then microwave in short intervals (probably a minute at first, then 15 to 30 seconds at a time) until it’s completely melted.
For all three options, be sure to stir the soap constantly to make sure it’s fully melted and doesn’t get scorched. If using the microwave, take the soap out and stir it in between intervals.

, This will likely be a large, heat-resistant mixing bowl or measuring cup., Pour your oats (or almond-oat mixture) into the melted soap mixture while stirring it, ensuring that it’s well-mixed and that there are no clumps.

If you’re also adding honey and almond oil to the mixture, add these wet ingredients to the melted soap before you add the oats/oat-almond mixture. This will ensure the liquids are evenly distributed.
This is the point at which you can add any other ingredients you’d like to add to the mixture. Common ingredients that soap-makers like to add to their bars include vitamin E oil, essential oils (lavender and orange blossom are popular scents), and poppy seeds (alone, not with oats).

, If you’re using a baking pan, plastic container, cardboard box, or other rectangular-shaped mould, don’t forget to line it to make soap removal easier., The soap should cool and harden within 2 hours at room temperature. You can also place it in the fridge to speed up the cooling process if you like., Carefully remove the soap from its mould/pan/container. If applicable, cut the soap into bars. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts.

You might even score the block of soap before cutting it, just to ensure the blocks are fairly even. If you have a metal ruler, you can use this to help you draw lines on the soap block with your knife.

, Your soap is now ready to use. In general, you’ll want to use homemade soaps within 1 year of making them. If you live in a hotter climate, this time might shorten to 6 months.

If you’re giving the soap away as a gift, make it look extra fancy by wrapping it in parchment paper and tying it with twine.

Pour the flour into a large bowl.,
Add any powder-based colors, scents, or glitter to the flour.,
Add any oil-based scents and colors to the baby oil and stir well.Water and oil do not mix, so regular food coloring or liquid water colors will not work.,
Add the baby oil to the flour.,
Mix it up and play with it.,
Store in an air-tight container.",How to Make Moon Sand2," If you want to make different colors, divide the flour up into separate bowls. How many bowls you use will depend on how many colors you want. The best part about using flour and baby oil is that it stays nice and light, clean-looking, and a little less like sand (and the kids might just believe that it's from the moon).

, It is a lot easier to mix dry materials with other dry materials than with wet. If you plan on adding any color, glitter, or scents, do so now. Be sure to mix it into your flour well. Here are some powders that you can add to your flour right now:Add a tablespoon or two of powdered tempera paint, powdered water color, or powdered chalk if you just want to add color. If you are using an oil-based food dye, hold off for now.Add some powdered drink mix, such as Kool-Aid to give your moon sand a color and a nice smell.
Add in a few teaspoons or tablespoons of glitter to give your sand some extra powder.
Add in a sprinkle of spices, such as pumpkin pie, apple pie, vanilla sugar, cocoa, or cinnamon if you want to give your moon sand a nice smell.

, If you don't have any powdered paint or spices, you can still color and scent your sand by adding stuff to it. Here are a few suggestions:To color your moon sand without powdered paint, try using oil-based food coloring or oil-based candy coloring.
To scent your moon sand without spices, add a few drops of essential oil or baking extract (like vanilla or strawberry).

, Once your color is mixed in (or not, if you want a blank slate), add in 1 1/4 cups of baby oil. It'll probably be easiest to just mix it up with your hands, though you'll get a bit dirty. Or you could just let the kids do this step!

, Once everything is in—color, scent, glitter and all—mix it all up thoroughly and get to playing with it. What'll be your first creation? A giant octopus? A castle? The moon itself?


If you're dealing with small children, just make sure they don't get any in their mouths. Baby oil and flour isn't dangerous, but paint or chalk added into the mix won't be any fun.

, Moon sand does keep for a solid month or two, but you'll probably find that you want to make more anyway before the first batch gets old. But until then, store this batch in an air-tight container in a cool, dry place, like your pantry or in a child's toy box.


When you go to pull it back out for playtime round two, revive it with a couple tablespoons of water. It will come back to life and be just as good as new.

Pour 4 cups of corn starch into a large bowl.,
Mix in any glitter, scents, or powdered colors to the corn starch, if desired.,
Mix in any oil-based dyes or essential oils to the vegetable oil, if desired.,
Mix the vegetable oil into the corn starch to keep it looking like snow.,
Mix it up well and start play time.,
Keep it in an air-tight container.",How to Make Moon Sand3," If you can't find any corn starch were you live, try searching for cornflour instead. This sand will be pure white if you don't add any color to it. It can look almost like snow!


If you plan on creating different colors or smells, separate the corn starch into different bowls.

, It is much easier to mix dry ingredients with other dry ingredients. If you have any glitter, spices, or powdered colors that you want to add to your sand, do so now. Here are a few ways in which you can spruce up your sand:


Add in a few teaspoons of glitter to make your sand sparkle. If you are leaving your moon sand white, consider using white, iridescent glitter instead.
Add in a few tablespoons of powered tempera paint, powdered watercolor, or powdered chalk to give your moon sand some color.
Add in a packet of powdered drink mix, such as Kool Aid, to give your sand a nice scent and color.
Sprinkle in some baking spices, such as apple pie, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, cocoa, or vanilla sugar to give your sand a nice smell.
If you want to add any essential oils or oil-based food dyes, save those for later.

, You will need ¾ cup of vegetable oil. Because oil and water do not mix, you cannot use any water-based coloring or dyes. Whatever you add to the oil must be oil-based.


If you can't find any powdered colors but still want to color your sand, add in a few drops of oil-based food coloring or oil-based candy coloring. Do not use plain old liquid food coloring; oil and water do not mix.
If you can't find any spices that appeal to you, but still want to make your sand smell nice, add in a few drops of essential oil or baking extract, such as: vanilla, almond, or orange.

, If it seems a little on the dry side, add a tablespoon or two of vegetable at a time to loosen it up. If it is too wet, add some more corn starch.


The main advantage to this recipe is that these two ingredients combined make a moon sand that looks like snow. Only it's not cold, wet, and doesn't turn to black the more you play in it.

, Once everything's in, put your hands in and start being creative. How do the colors combine? What's it feel like? Ask more questions to get your child engaged in sensory play, which moon sand is notoriously great for., After your child has gotten his or her fill (and you have, too, of course), transport the moon sand into an air-tight, resealable container. Keep it in a cool, dry location, like in a closet, under the bed, or in a toy box.


When you go to play with it again (it keeps a few months, though it's cheap enough you could always make a new batch), bring it back to life with a few tablespoons of water. Start molding the sand with your hands to work the water in, and it'll be good as new in no time.

Enjoy!",How to Make Oatmeal Soap2," Because you’re making this soap from scratch, you’ll be using lye (aka sodium hydroxide), which you can purchase from most hardware stores. Here’s what you’ll need:6 oz distilled water
2.25 oz pure lye (aka sodium hydroxide)
10 oz olive oil
6 oz coconut oil
0.45 oz (1 tbsp) castor oil
Oats

, Note that lye will interact with non-stick, aluminum, cast iron, tin, and wood. Avoid using pots, pans, containers, or utensils in these materials. Here’s what you’ll need:Safety goggles
Thick, long rubber gloves
Face mask
Scale that can weigh items down to 0.25 oz
Digital food thermometer
2 Heat-proof 32 oz (4 cup) glass measuring cups
Plastic, ceramic, or glass bowl
Plastic or silicon stirring spoon
Container or mould for soap (lined cardboard box will do)
Plastic bag, cling wrap, or wax or parchment paper (for lining the mould)
Knife

, This recipe makes roughly 2 pounds of soap. How many bars that is will depend on the size of your mould. If you don’t have a mould, use a small cardboard box or plastic container.

Regardless of whether you’re using a proper mould, a plastic container, or a box, line it with some cling wrap, wax paper, or parchment paper to make the soap easier to remove once it’s cooled.

, Put on your protective goggles, rubber gloves, and face mask. You should also wear skin-covering clothes in addition to the protective gear, as lye will burn your skin. Do not take this advice lightly: lye burns can cause serious, permanent damage.If lye gets on your skin, brush off any solid material and flush with water or saline for 15 to 30 minutes, remembering to protect your eyes.If it gets in your eyes, flush them with lots of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.Inhaling lye can cause breathing difficulties. Many soap makers only use gloves and goggles, but really you should be wearing a mask, too., Use a plastic, ceramic, or glass bowl. As you pour the lye into the bowl, be careful that you do not inhale any of the powder, or that it does not get on your skin., You should be able to find distilled water at either your local grocery store, health food store, or drugstore.

You can also make your own distilled water by boiling tap water in an enclosed container that is connected to another container. The steam rises from one container and condenses into the other one, forming distilled water., Adding the lye to the water will generate heat and fumes, so be very careful while doing this. Once the lye is all in the water, stir it until it dissolves.

You should NEVER add water to lye. Adding water to lye will cause a strong reaction, with the solution erupting up out of the container, possibly causing injury to you.
If you want to reduce the cooling time of the water-lye solution (remember, it’ll generate heat!), you can start with cold distilled water.

, Add your coconut oil (6 oz), olive oil (10 oz), and castor oil (0.45 oz) to a heat-resistant glass measuring cup.

Place the cup in a saucer of simmering hot water, or microwave it in 30-second intervals until the oils have all melted together.
Only heat the oils to the point of melting. You want to avoid them being too hot, otherwise it’ll slow your process down as you want the oils and your lye water to be the same temperature when you mix them.

, The lye water and oils should be within 20 degrees Fahrenheit of one another when you mix them. They will likely be somewhere between 90 and 110 degrees at this point.Use the digital thermometer to ensure that this is the case before mixing them together.
Make sure that you mix the oils and lye water while they’re still warm, otherwise they won’t mix together as well. Closer to 110 degrees Fahrenheit is preferable.

, Do this slowly while continuing to stir. Measure the mixture’s temperature at this time to see where it’s at., You can do this with a stainless steel whisk or a hand mixer. A hand mixer will take much less time than a whisk, but both are okay. You’ll know the mixture is ready when it becomes thick and cloudy-looking.

You should be able to lift the hand mixer or whisk out of the mixture, and the drippings should appear on the surface of the mixture rather than disappearing right into it.
You can also check the mixture’s temperature to make sure it’s ready to go. If it has risen a couple of degrees Fahrenheit from when you last checked it (i.e. when you combined the oils and lye water), you’re doing well., Once the lye water and oils have been thoroughly combined, you can add additional things to the soap. In this case, you’ll be adding oats. You can add as little or as much as you like, depending on your own tastes.

For the best skin-soothing results, use colloidal oatmeal, which is simply oatmeal that has been ground into a fine powder.
You can make it yourself simply by grinding regular porridge oats into an even, fine powder using a coffee grinder.If you don’t have a coffee grinder, you can also grind the oats up manually using a mortar and pestle, or by crushing them with a rolling pin.

, Once it’s all in there, cover it up with plastic wrap and then store it in a cool, dry place for a couple of days., After 2 days, put on your gloves, goggles, and face mask, and check on your soap. It should look solid and fairly smooth. At this time you can take it out of the container and cut it up.

Be sure to wear your protective gear because the lye will not have completely neutralized at this point, and can still cause you harm.
If your soap looks crumbly, crusty, or has liquid or powder floating on top of it, you’ll need to throw it out and start again. If you’ve followed this recipe exactly, though, this shouldn’t be a problem.

, After cutting it up, let the soap sit and dry for at least 3 or 4 weeks. Some experts recommend curing your soap longer, up to 6 weeks.You’ll need to turn your soap bars once a day just to ensure that they dry evenly on each side.

Allowing the soap to “cure” will give it time to harden, dry out, and become more gentle as the pH of the soap lowers over time.
A bar of soap that hasn’t been properly cured will feel softer, slimier, and stronger than a well-cured one., Your soap is ready for use now. It’s best used within one year of making. If you live somewhere hot, you should probably use the soap even sooner, within 6 months of making it."

",How to Make a Willow Whistle," It should be less than an inch thick and have green bark. 8 inches (20.3 cm) is a good length. The ideal twig is straight, smooth, and round so it makes a perfectly shaped whistle.


If you can't find a willow twig that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, you can try to find a longer one and cut off 8 inches (20.3 cm) of it to make a whistle from. You can also cut off side branches if needed, although you may need a bigger knife.;
,, Take care to cut only the outer layer of bark and not completely through the wood.

, Wet the twig (all the way from the ring to the mouthpiece) with water and tap it gently with the handle of your knife so it loosens the bark. Then carefully twist and pull the bark off. Try not to rip or break the bark because you will need to put it back on the twig later. Dunk it in water to keep it wet and moist until you need it again.

, The length and depth of this notch is what changes the pitch of your whistle.

,, Dipping the bark-less end of your willow into a glass of water first will help. Blow on the end with the notch!

, Place a ruler on the paper so that it goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Use the ruler as a guide to trace a neat line. Repeat this step for the top right corner and the bottom left corner.








You can also fold the paper corner-to-corner twice to make an X instead., Stop when you are ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the center. Do not cut all the way to the center, or your pinwheel will fall apart.









, Your paper will have short, stubby corners and long skinny ones. Make sure that you are only folding the long, skinny corners to the center. Also, make sure that the corners all overlap in the center.








Do not fold the paper. You want it to remain curved.

, Make sure that you catch all four corners, and that the pin goes out the middle of the paper. Rotate the pin in the paper to widen the hole.







, You will only need 1 to 3 beads. Make sure that they are all the same size and shape. These beads will help lift the pinwheel away from the dowel and allow it to spin.










Avoid using plastic pony beads; they are too big.

, Use a thumbtack to make the hole, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) down from the tip.Press a thumbtack into the dowel until it sticks, then lightly strike it with a hammer. Pull it out when you are done.










Soak the dowel in warm water for a few minutes first; this will help prevent it from breaking.

, If the pin is loose, take it out, add a bead of glue into the hole, then push it back in again. Give the pinwheel a test spin, then pull the pin out further, if needed. If part of the pushpin is sticking out of the back of the dowel, you will need to fold it down with a pair of pliers.

Avoid using large beads, like pony beads, however., Use a thumbtack to punch a hole in the dowel, ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the tip. If you need to, use a hammer to help drive the thumbtack into dowel, then pull the thumbtack out., Give the pinwheel a test spin. If it gets stuck, pull the pushpin out a little further. If the pushpin comes out of the back of the dowel, bend it down with some pliers or a hammer. If the pin is too loose, pull it out, add some glue into the hole, then push it back in again."

Cut a circle cut from cardstock to the back of the pinwheel.,
Use double-sided tape to secure the pinwheel.",How to Make a Pinwheel4," Get some 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) square scrapbooking paper. Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to cut the paper into four, 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strips.Some scrapbooking paper has a white strip along the bottom edge for the price and label. You should trim this off first.
These pinwheels are meant to be used as decorations on gifts, walls, or ornaments. They do not spin like regular pinwheels.

, Take your first strip, and fold the narrow edge over by ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Use that as a fold as a guide for the rest of the paper. Repeat this step for the remaining three strips., Fold your strip back up so that it looks like a closed fan. Cut an angle into one of the narrow edges. Work one strip at a time, otherwise, the paper will be too thick to cut neatly.You don't have to do this step. This will simply give the pinwheels a more ornate edge.

, Place a strip of tape against one of the narrow ends of your first strip. Place it against the narrow end of the next strip, then press them together. Keep connecting the strips until you have one long strip.If both ends of the strips are folded in opposite directions, they will make a V or ^ shape. Trim off one of the ends until both are folded in the same direction.

, Run some glue or a strip of double-sided tape along one of the narrow ends. Bring the other narrow end towards it, and press the two together., If the disk won't lay flat, you will need to glue a support to the back. Flip the disk over so that the back is facing you. Choose a dowel, straw, or skewer that is the same height as the disk. Hot glue your chosen stick down the center of the disk, right between two ridges., For a fancy look, you can cut a small circle out of coordinating paper, then glue it to the front to cover the hole.For a more rustic touch, you can use a large button instead., This will make it easier to secure the pinwheel to walls, gifts, and other items. It would be best if you use a matching color, but you can use a different color as well.Use a cup, jar, or lid to trace the circle.

, Place a few strips of double-sides tape onto the back of the pinwheel, right over the cardstock circle. Secure the pinwheel to your desired gift of banner.

If you are securing the pinwheel to a wall, consider using double-sided, foam mounting tape instead.
Alternatively, you can string several pinwheels together to make a banner.

Choose a time when your child is rested, fed and happy.,
Gather all the supplies you will need ahead of time.,
Find an area where you can create the art.,
Explain the project to your child.",How to Make Handprint Art2," Your child will be more willing to participate when contented.

, Instead of finding items as you go, have everything purchased and unpacked before you bring your child into the project. If you are using paint, pour paint into separate bowls or plates and have plenty of towels and water for clean up. Also, if you plan to create a project (such as a plaster handprint), read the directions ahead of time so the project goes smoothly when your child is ready to participate.

, A picnic table outside or the kitchen table covered in newspaper is a great spot for an art project.

, If your child will be actively participating in the project, explain what he or she will be doing and every step that will be taken along the way. That way, your child can mentally prepare for what will need to be done and may be more patient.

Brush your child’s hand with the paint or plaster to create the print.,
Guide your child’s hand to the paper, canvas or board.,
Allow the paint/plaster to dry, depending upon your project.,
Decorate the handprint using your design.",How to Make Handprint Art3," Instead of having your child’s hand in a bowl of paint or plaster, apply the material with a brush. Spread paint or plaster evenly over the child's hand for full coverage.

, Gently press down on his or her hand to make sure you leave an actual handprint. Tell your child to hold his or her hand still (if he or she understands) and then gently lift the hand.

, If you're working with plaster, you may not be able to wait for the material to dry in order to decorate. Follow the kit’s directions for best results.

, If you waited for the handprint to dry, tap into your imagination and create art from your child’s handprint. Ideas for what to do are listed next:


Using a marker, draw in faces, wings, fins, arms and legs, etc., to create creatures from the handprints. Add scenery.
Draw a background pattern around the hands. Use interesting patterns, neon colors, bright lines, etc.
Make modern art. Turn the handprints into imitations of famous modern art pieces. Check online for images of such artworks.
Ask your child to decorate the handprints. He or she will be bound to come up with fun ideas.
Draw around the handprints several times, so that it looks like the lines are radiating out from the original handprints. Use the colors of the rainbow to do this.
If it's holiday time, use holiday themes to inspire the artwork touch-ups.

Buy crafts that are appropriate for your child's age level.,
Consider the safety and use of the materials to make the craft.,
Examine the ability required to complete the project.",How to Buy Crafts for Kids1," For example, sticker foam crafts are more suitable for young children. Painting, beading and clay are good choices for older children. Sewing and model building are best for teenagers.


Selecting age-appropriate crafts that children are capable of successfully completing will build self-esteem.






Many crafts will list an age range on the box.





;
,

Small children do not need projects containing small items such as beads. They can easily choke on small materials.






Older children can handle permanent markers, oil pastels, glitter and pottery wheels more safely and with less chaos, confusion and mess than younger children.






Items that state ""non-toxic"" on the package are best.






Healthier choices include white glue and glue sticks over rubber cement (with hexane or heptane), tempera paints and poster paints rather than spray or acrylic paints (containing ammonia,formaldehyde and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic), homemade, earth-based or flour-based clays instead of polymer clays (made of vinyl or PVC) and washable markers, crayons and colored pencils in the place of dry-erase markers (with alcohol or ketone).







,

Refrain from buying crafts for small children that take great concentration and detail.






Younger children should not be asked to complete projects that are physically demanding or make great use of fine motor skills, such as stringing small beads.

Choose your wax.,
Heat up your wax.,
Cut your wick.,
Heat your container.,
Pour your wax.,
Wait and repour.,
Finish your candle.",How to Make Candles1," You can buy many different kinds of wax in bulk online including paraffin, beeswax, and citronella. If you are interested, there are also many types of scented wax available as well. Choose one that fits your needs, and get enough to create your desired number of candles.






;
, Use a double boiler to prepare your wax for pouring. It should reach a temperature of 180–190 °F (82–88 °C); you can use a thermometer to get an accurate reading. If you would like, you can add a few drops of essential oil at this time.








, Use a piece of pre-tabbed wick (with the metal bottom) and stick it in your container. Add enough so that the wick sticks out a few inches from the top. Tie the top of the wick to a pencil or pen, and rest it over the top to keep the wick perpendicular to the bottom of the container.








, In order to create a smooth pour of wax with no bubbles, you will need to heat up the container you intend to use for your candle. Put it in the oven at 150 °F (66 °C) for several minutes to warm the material.








, Hold the pencil/wick steady at the top of the container, and slowly pour the melted wax in. Avoid bumping the sides or pouring too quickly so that you don’t create any air bubbles in the wax. Only pour ¾ of the way to your desired candle level.








, Wait several hours until all of the wax has cooled in your container. There will probably be a concave divot in the top of the wax. At this point, pour the rest of your wax the remaining ¼ distance to level out the top of your candle.








, When the wax has completely set, you can untie the wax from the pencil at the top of your container and trim to size. Burn your new candle around your house to add style or light to your décor.

",How to Make Candles2," Pillar candles are the largest of the candle varieties and require a lot of wax as a result. Decide: do you want colored wax? Would you like it to have a scent? Do you prefer beeswax, citronella, paraffin, or another variety of wax? Consider your desired use for the candle before making your choice.








, Use a double boiler to melt your wax. If you don’t have a double boiler, use a glass bowl over a pot of boiling water with your wax placed in the bowl. When the wax reaches a temperature of 180–190 °F (82–88 °C), it is ready to be poured.








, In order to create a pillar candle, you will first need to create a mold. The easiest way to do this is to purchase a candle-mold, otherwise the seams might not be tight enough to form a sturdy structure. You can also choose to rubber-band (very tightly!) Wood pieces to form a box mold.








, As a result of their height, pillar candles need a long wick. Add a pre-tabbed wick to your candle, making sure that it touches the bottom of your mold. Wrap the loose end around a pen or pencil and rest it horizontally across the top of your mold, to keep the wick from slipping into the wax.








, Begin pouring the wax from a space slightly above the top of the mold, being careful not to pour too quickly. Leave ¼ of your wax out of the candle, so that you can add it later and fix the shape of the pillar.








, After your candle has had time to settle and cool, a valley will have formed in the center of the wax. At this time, heat your remaining wax to pour back into the mold and cover up this concave indent.








, Wait 2-4 hours at least to allow the entire candle to cool and solidify. Untie the wick from your pencil at the top and remove your mold from the exterior of the candle. Trim any excess wick from the top or bottom, and enjoy your new pillar candle!

Cut your beeswax sheets.,
Arrange your wick.,
Begin rolling.,
Finish the candle.",How to Make Candles3," Typically, sheets of beeswax come very large and will make a rather ungainly candle. Cut your sheets to size so that they measure 4 inches (10.2 cm) x 16 inches (40.6 cm).








, Lay your sheet of beeswax out flat on a tabletop. Place your wick as close to the edge of one end as you are able to. Leave at least an inch of the wick hanging over the top edge, while the bottom of the wick should be flush to to bottom of your beeswax.








, Starting at the edge with the wick, roll the sheet of wax inwards. Try to roll in the same direction to avoid making the ends of the candle uneven or spiral-like. Apply gentle pressure to help the layers of beeswax to stick together.








, As you get to the end of the wax, use your fingers to stick the layers tightly together. Roll the candle between your hands so that the warmth of your skin softens the wax and helps it to maintain its shape. Place your new candle in your favorite candle holder and, voila! You’ve got a lovely decorative and useful addition to your home.

Gather your wax.,
Melt your wax.,
Prepare your container.,
Pour the wax.,
Wait and repour.,
Finish your candle.",How to Make Candles4," Use the very last of the wax from old candles to create this layered candle. You can also use small chunks of broken off wax from other projects, but try to use the same kinds of wax together (don’t mix citronella and paraffin, for example).









Choose wax tidbits that have similar scents so that you don’t create an overwhelming amalgamation of perfumes with your candle.
Avoid mixing several contrasting colors of wax or else you will create a muddy brown or grayish color. Stick to waxes in the same color and value range.

, Break your wax up using a butter knife, and place it in a double-boiler to melt. Wait until the wax reaches a temperature of approximately 185 °F (85 °C) before removing it from the heat source.








, Place a wick with a metal tab in your container, and wrap one end around a pencil or pen to rest over the opening. Heat the container up in the oven at 150 °F (66 °C) to help reduce the number of air bubbles in your candle.








, Use a cheesecloth to filter out any old pieces of wick or metal that might be in your recycled wax. Pour the wax over the cheesecloth slowly into your container. Avoid pouring directly over the wick or the edge, but use a steady, constant stream into the base of the container. Save ¼ of your wax to pour again later.








, When the wax has hardened completely in your container, reheat your remaining ¼ of wax to melt. While the candle hardened, a divot was likely formed near the base of the wick. Pour the rest of the wax over the top to fill in this indentation.








, Remove the pencil or pen from your wick and trim it to length. Once your candle has hardened completely, it is ready for use! Enjoy your recycled candle in your home, or gift it to a friend.

Whip the wax until it turns fluffy.,
Scoop the wax on top of the beer mug.,
Let the wax harden completely before using the candle.",How to Make Beer Candles," Slice the gel wax into smaller chunks first. This will help the wax melt faster. Next, place the wax into a stainless steel pot. If you can find one with a pouring spout, that would be even better.

Use an old pot or one dedicated to crafting. Don't use the same one that you cook in.;
, Allow the wax to reach 200°F (94°C); use a thermometer to keep track of the temperature. Once melted, the wax will be smooth and have a syrup-like consistency. Don't let the wax get too hot, otherwise it will turn opaque and ruin the clear effect.Do not leave the melting candle wax unsupervised.

, Set the pot down on a heat-safe surface. If your dyes and fragrance oils require a specific temperature, allow the wax to cool down to that temperature first. Every brand may be a little different, so check the label first., How much you add of each depends on what color you want the beer to be. Some types of beer are brownish while others are more of an amber color. Plan on using a drop of yellow dye and a toothpick amount of brown dye.Some types of candle dyes are opaque. Make sure that you use the translucent type.

, Be careful not to over-stir, or you might end up with too many bubbles.Also, make sure that the fragrance you are using is safe to use in gel wax. It would be even better if you use fragrance oil specifically made for use in gel wax; this way, you can be certain that it will work. If you use the wrong type of oil, the gel wax could ignite or explode.If you don't care about the smell, you can skip this step

, Avoid glasses with thin walls. The melted wax will be very hot, and it could cause the glass to shatter.A sturdy beer mug, tankard, or tumbler with thick, sturdy walls would be ideal. Make sure that it is clean., Place a drop of hot glue on the bottom of the tabbed candle wick. Press the wick, glue-side-down, into the glass, then let the glue set. This should only take a few seconds.If you don't have any hot glue on hand, you can also use a piece of double-sided tape.


Make sure that you use a zinc wick. A cotton wick will soak up too much gel.A tabbed candle wick is a long strand of waxed string with a metal disk attached to one end.

, Again, take your time with this so that you don't get too many bubbles. It's okay if you get some tiny ones, however, since beer is a carbonated beverage.Don't fill the mug up all the way. You want to leave 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of space for the foam. If you have any extra wax, discard it or make another candle.

, You can do this by laying two pencils across the top of the glass and balancing the wick between them. You can also roll the wick up on a pencil, then set the pencil on the rim of the glass., Gel wax never hardens like regular candle wax. Instead, it remains jiggly, sort of like Jello. How long this takes depends on the size of the mug/glass and the temperature in the room. The colder it is, the faster the wax will set., Set the melting pot into a larger pot filled with a few inches/centimeters of water. You can also use a slow cooker instead.Cut the soy wax into smaller pieces first to help it melt faster.
Try to use a soy wax that has a 140 or 142 melting point. The melting point is usually included in the product description or on the label itself.

, Clip a thermometer to the side of the pot, and watch the wax closely as it melts. Allow the wax to reach 160°F (72°C).Do not leave the wax unsupervised as it melts.

, Take the melting pot out of the water (or switch off the crock pot). Let the wax start to turn cloudy. How long this takes depends on how cold it is in the room; the colder it is, the sooner the wax will turn cloudy. As soon as it happens, you are ready for the next step., You can do this with a whisk, a fork, or an electric beater. If you are using an electric beater, make sure that you are using a slow speed setting. Don't get too carried away during this step, however, or the wax will dry and turn crumbly.Be very careful during this step. Wearing protective goggles and gloves is highly recommended.

, Remove the pencils supporting the wick first. Scoop the foam into the mug until it reaches the rim.At this point, you can leave the foam level with the rim, or add a final dollop of foam. You can also let some foam dribble down the sides of the glass.

, This should not take more than an hour, but it really depends on the temperature in the room. Once the wax has set, trim the wick down to about ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) before you light it."

Use the wick as needed.",How to Make Candle Wicks1," Heat 1 cup (250 ml) of water using a small saucepan or a tea kettle. Allow the water to reach a simmer, but not a full boil.;
, Pour the hot water into a glass bowl. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt and 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of Borax. Stir to dissolve.You'll use this Borax solution to treat the base wick material. Treating wicks with Borax can make the candles burn brighter and longer. Moreover, it can also reduce the amount of ash and smoke produced by the burning process.
Keep Borax away from children and pets since it can have a toxic effect when ingested or inhaled.

, Take a piece of heavy cotton butcher's twine and submerge it in the Borax solution. Allow the twine to soak for 24 hours.


Make sure that the length of twine used is longer than the height of the container you plan to use for your candle. If you don't know how tall the candle will be, you can soak up to 1 foot (30.5 cm) of twine and trim it down to size later.
Butcher's twine is a great base material for candle wicks, but nearly any thick cotton cord should work well enough. You can use embroidery cotton, torn pieces of cotton cloth, or a clean shoelace with the plastic cap removed.Soaking the twine for 24 hours will produce the best results. You can technically remove the twine after 20 minutes, but the results will not be as ideal.

, Remove the twine from the Borax solution using tweezers. Hang the twine and let it dry for for two or three days.


The twine must be fully dry before you continue.
Use a clothespin or similar clip to hang the treated twine in a warm, dry location. Place aluminum foil beneath the drying twine to catch any excess solution as it drips off.

, Break apart 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 ml to 125 ml) of candle wax. Melt the wax using a double boiler setup.


If you don't have a double boiler, you can use a clean metal can and a small saucepan.

Heat 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water in the saucepan over your stove, letting it simmer and steam without boiling.
Place the metal can inside the hot water. Wait another minute for the can to heat up before adding the wax.


Melted wax can cause serious burns, so handle it very carefully throughout the rest of the procedure.

, Carefully dunk the dry, Borax-treated twine in the melted wax. Coat as much of the twine as possible.


Technically, you can use Borax-treated twine as it is without adding a wax coating. The wax makes the wick stiffer and easier to handle, however, and may also make it easier for the flame to catch on the end of the wick.

, Hang the twine as before and let it dry long enough for the wax to harden. This should only take several minutes.


As before, place a sheet of aluminum foil beneath the hanging twine to catch any excess wax dripping off.

, Dip and dry the twine once or twice more to build up a thick coating of wax.


Ideally, the twine should feel stiff while still retaining some flexibility.
If you don't have enough wax to dip the string again, you can lay the string on a sheet of aluminum foil and carefully pour the remaining wax on top. Let the wick dry on the foil instead of hanging it again.

, Once the fully-coated twine is dry, it's finished and ready to insert into a candle.

Finished.

",How to Make Basic Taper Candles," Make the wicks as long or as short as you would like. However, remember that the wick should be 4-6 inches (10-15 centimeters) longer than the candles you are making. A good wick is one that is less flexible than sewing thread, but more flexible than wire. Tie one end of the wick to a stick, such as a chopstick or a piece of dowel. This stick will be used to help you dip and to hang the candle from to dry.;
, The container should be long enough to cover the candle size you are making. The more elongated the container, the less wax needed and therefore less waste.

, Dipping can take some effort, so set aside a block of time to complete it. If the wax starts to solidify, you will need to melt it again as you go, so keep an eye on this. No matter how you have chosen to melt your wax, set up the dipping place carefully:


Put newspaper down to protect the workspace from splashes.
Put the container of melted wax onto a trivet.
Place this on a sturdy work space at a height suitable for you to work around.
Ensure that the area is free of obstacles, pets and small children.

, There are two methods for melting the wax. The first is to melt the wax in a double boiler over the saucepan. The second is to allow the wax to melt in a container of hot water set to one side. The choice of method depends on how many candles and how large the candles, along with how much wax you have to melt. If you are making a lot of candles, it will be easier to melt the candles using constant heat over a double boiler.



Method 1:
Place small chunks of wax into the double boiler.
Allow to melt. See temperature notes in ""Tips"".
Keep an eye on it. Also, see ""Warnings"".



Method 2:
Place the boiling water in a large container.
Place the wax into the boiling water. Ensure that there is enough wax to reach the top of the container. Also make sure that the container is sitting one a safe place away from heat sources.
Allow the wax to melt. You can stir it if needed.



, Tighten the wick until it is straight.


Lower the taper into the melted wax. Cover it with wax. Holding on to the top of the wick by its stick, quickly dip it into and out of the melted wax. This must be done rapidly up and down, or the wax will slip off the string. The most effective method to ensure that the wax stays on, is to set aside each candle when there is a thin layer and then to return and dip some more when you reach the last candle and proceed to dip all of the candles again.
Gently blow on the string after each dip. This helps it to position for cooling in place.
Note that initially the wax will coat the taper and slowly a taper candle will begin to form. Keep dipping patiently to layer on the wax.
Reheat wax if needed.
Repeat this process as many times as needed to form a width and shape of taper candle that you are seeking.

, Lay out the taper candles on a ""drying rack"". Use a small cardboard box and lay the sticks over this, with the candles dangling down. Do not let the candles touch the ground - suspend them in the air. The candles are done when they are hard to the touch.

, At the thinner end of the finished taper, create a small wick for lighting of about 1/2"" (1.2 centimeters). At the thicker end, cut the wick as close as you can to the finisher taper. Trim any wax formations that do not form part of the taper candle shape.

For four 8-ounce (227 g) candles, you’ll need approximately 6 cups (1419 g) of wax flakes.You can use whatever type of wax you like for the candles, but soy wax tends to absorb fragrance better than beeswax or other waxes.;
, Once you’ve measured out the necessary wax for the candles, place the flakes in a medium size pot on the stove. Turn the burner to medium-low, and allow the wax to melt completely, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.Wax can ignite fairly easily, so watch the pot closely as the wax melts.
Be sure to stir the wax with a wooden spoon or chop stick, while it’s heating to break up clumps and ensure that it melts evenly.
If you find that it’s taking longer than 5 minutes or so for the wax to melt, turn the heat up to medium.

, After the wax has melted completely, remove the pan from the burner. The wax will be too hot to scent right away, so allow it to cool for 2 to 3 minutes.The wax will cool more quickly if you transfer it from the pan to a cool bowl or other container.

, While you’re waiting for the wax to cool, it’s a good idea to get the wicks ready in the jars. Place a small dab of glue from a hot glue gun on the bottom of the wick, and drop it down into the center of the jar. Allow the glue to set for several minutes before pouring the hot wax into the jar.If you don’t have a hot glue gun, you can also dab the bottom of the wicks with a small amount of melted wax, drop it down into the jar, and allow it to set for several minutes. Wax usually isn’t as secure as hot glue, though, because it may melt again when you pour the hot wax in.

, While securing the wick to the bottom of the jar helps keep it in place, the length of the wick may fall into the hot wax when you pour it into the container. To keep that from happening, tape the end of the wick to a chopstick or pen. When the wick is taped to it, rest the chopstick or pen across the top of the jar., Once the wax has cooled for a couple of minutes, it’s time to add essential oil(s) to it to create an aromatherapy effect. The amount of essential oil depends on how potent the oil(s) you’re using are and how strongly scented you want your candles to be, but 80 to 100 drops is a  good number to start with. Stir the oil(s) into the wax well to ensure that it’s well combined.If you want extremely fragrant candles, you may want to add more than 100 drops. Experiment to see what the right amount is.
You can use a single oil or mix two or more types of essential oils to create custom scents for your candles.
You can also purchase fragrance oils designed specifically for making candles. They come in a wide variety of scents, including specialty fragrances, such as Christmas Cookie or Fresh Cut Grass.

, The hot wax can sometimes splash up the sides of the jar when you pour it in. To avoid a mess, place a small funnel in jar, and pour the wax through it into the jar. Fill each jar in the same way.Depending on the size of the jars and how much you fill them, you may have some wax left over. To dispose of it, wait for it to solidify and then scrape it out of the pot or bowl. Never pour hot wax down the sink -- you’ll wind up clogging your pipes.

, Once all of the jars are filled with wax, you have to wait for the wax to cool completely before you can light the candles. As the wax cools, it will solidify, which should take approximately 1 hour.You can tell that the candles are finished cooling when the wax becomes fully opaque.

, When the candles are completely cool, remove the end of the wick from the chop stick or pen and use a pair of scissors to trim it to your desired length. In most cases, a ½-inch (1.27-cm) wick is sufficient. Light the candle and enjoy the scent that you’ve created.In addition to making candles for yourself, these homemade aromatherapy candles make ideal handmade gifts. You can customize the scent for each recipient for a lovely, personalized present.

Trim down balsa wood sticks.,
Soak the balsa wood in olive oil.,
Wipe away the excess oil.,
Attach a wick tab to the base of the stick.,
Use the wick as needed.",How to Make Candle Wicks2," Use scissors to trim down the length of the balsa wood so that it stands at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) taller than the container you plan to use for the candle.


Use the thin balsa wood strips you'd typically find at a craft store. These sticks should be 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches (1.25 to 3.75 cm) wide.
If you don't have a container in mind and don't know how large the candle will be, trim the wood down to a length between 6 and 12 inches (15.25 and 30.5 cm). You can trim away any excess later, so it's better to have too much than too little.

, Place the trimmed balsa wood into a shallow dish. Pour enough room temperature olive oil into the dish to completely cover the wood.


While wood is flammable on its own, coating the wood in oil will allow the fire to catch quicker and burn more evenly. Olive oil burns cleanly, making it a great choice for candle-making projects.
Let the wood soak up the oil for at least 20 minutes. You can wait up to one hour, if desired, so that the wood can absorb more oil and burn with an even brighter flame.

, Remove the wooden sticks from the oil and use clean paper towels to wipe away any excess.


Instead of rubbing the stick dry, you could place it on a plate covered with paper towels and allow it to air dry for several minutes.
When ready, the wood should still feel damp and slightly oily to the touch, but it should no longer leave an oily residue on your hands when you handle it.

, Pry open a metal wick tab and carefully push one end of the treated wood into the opening.


Push the wick into the tab as far as possible. The wick tab will hold the wood firmly in place as it sits in the melted wax during the candle-making process.

, The wooden wick should now be ready to use when you make your candle.


Treated balsa wood is easy to handle and burns well. Using wooden wicks instead of cotton ones will add a wooded scent to the candle as it burns, and wooden wicks may also make the occasional crackling sound as the fire consumes them.

Melt wax in a double boiler.,
Twist the pipe cleaner end.,
Trim the pipe cleaner.,
Dip the wick into the melted wax.,
Dry the wick.,
Repeat as desired.,
Use the wick as needed.",How to Make Candle Wicks3," Break apart 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of candle wax or paraffin and place it into the top part of a double boiler. Heat the wax until it melts.


You can use fresh wax or bits of old, recycled candles. Break it into small chunks so that it melts quicker.
If you don't have a double boiler, insert a metal can or metal bowl into heavy saucepan and surround it with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. The water should only sit in saucepan, not in the inner dish.
Bring the water to a simmer but do not allow it to boil. As the wax melts, continue onto the next part of the process.

, Wrap the end of an all-cotton pipe cleaner around the side of a pencil or pen. Once pipe cleaner meets itself and slightly overlaps, twist the remainder up so that it runs parallel to the side of the pencil.


After shaping the pipe cleaner, slide it off the pencil.
Note that all-cotton pipe cleaners are strongly recommended. Pipe cleaners made with synthetic fibers may not burn as well or as safely.

, Use side cutter pliers to trim the long end of the pipe cleaner. The finished wick should only have approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) standing above the circular base.


After cutting the pipe cleaner, use needle-nose pliers to carefully twist the upright portion of the wick toward the center of the circle. This portion should still remain upright, but it needs to be fairly centered.
If the upright portion of the wick is too heavy or off-centered, the distribution of weight won't be balanced and the wick may topple over instead of standing straight.

, Grab the trimmed pipe cleaner wick using long-handled tweezers and carefully lower it into the melted wax. Let the wick soak in the wax for several seconds.


Work very carefully. Melted wax can cause terrible burns if it splashes or drips onto your skin.
Make sure that the entire wick gets submerged in the melted wax. Do not release it from your tweezers, though, since it will be difficult to fish out if you do let go of it.

, Remove the wick from the wax and set it down on a sheet of aluminum foil. Wait several minutes for the wax to dry and harden.


Stand the wick on its circular base as it dries.
When ready, the wax on the wick should be hard and cool enough to touch.

, Repeat the dipping and drying procedure one to three times, letting the wax harden in between coats.


You need to build a thick, consistent coating of wax on the outside of the wick. The wax will allow the wick to catch fire more quickly and burn for a longer period of time.

, Once the wick is completely dry after the last coating of wax, it's done and ready to add to the top of a solid wick-less candle.


When you light the wick, the flame should spread heat throughout the entire wick, sending it into the candle beneath it. The candle will begin to melt beneath the wick, and the wick will eventually end up floating on top of the melted wax.

Squat mason jar or bowl
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Craft knife
Scissors
Cork
Nail and hammer
Olive oil
Water (optional);
, You can get a cork from a wine bottle or purchase a bag of craft corks from an arts and crafts shop. You can also use sheet of cork that's at least ¼ inches thick.

, Cut your cork horizontally using a craft knife. If you are using a flat, squat cork, you don't need to cut it. The cork will help keep your wick afloat.


If you are using a sheet of cork, cut it into a small circle or square. It needs to be small enough to fit inside your jar, but large enough so that it won't sink under the weight of the wick.

, The hole needs to be wide enough for the wick to be able to slip through, but not so wide that the cork slides off when you hold the wick upside down.

, The wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the hole.

, Hold the cork so that it is about two-thirds to three-fourths of the way up the side of the jar. Trim the wick down until the end touches the bottom of the war.


If you don't have a jar, you can use a pretty glass bowl instead.

, Olive oil is great to use, because it burns clean. It does not contain harmful chemicals, and it does not leave behind bad smells.


If you want to save on oil, use one part water and one part oil.

, Try to float it as much in the center as you can.

, This will give the wick enough time to absorb the oil and make it easier to light.

Squat mason jar
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Olive oil
Scissors
Floral wire
Wire cutters

, The thicker wick you use, the larger flame you will get. If you want something small, go for a #2 or ¼ inch lantern wick., The wire needs to be long enough so that it can hook over the mouth of the jar when doubled. You will be using it to support your wick.


Avoid using plastic-coated, painted, copper, or zinc/galvanized wire.Do not use scissors. Not only could you hurt yourself, but you'll also dull the scissors.

, You are sandwiching the wick between the two halves of the wire. The tip of the wick should be no more than an inch (2.54 centimeters) above the lip of the wire.

, The wire needs to be tight enough so that it can suspend the wick, but loose enough so that you can still pull the wick up and down.

, It's okay if the wick dips down a little bit into the jar. If it dips down too far into the jar, try bringing it a little bit closer to the rim.

, The wire should now be holding the wick just inside the mouth of the jar. If the wire does not hold its shape, you can try wrapping another piece of wire around the neck of the jar, securing the wick-holding-wire to the jar.

, Olive oil is great to use because it doesn't contain dangerous chemicals. It also burns clean and doesn't stink.

, This will give the wick enough time to soak up the oil and allow you to light it.

Mason jar
100% cotton cord or lamp wick
Olive oil
Hammer
Screwdriver or nail
Pliers (optional)
Two blocks of wood
Tape (optional)
Metal washer or nut

, If your lid comes apart, set the ring part aside and use the disk part for now. The two blocks of wood should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart. The gap should be right in the middle of the jar.

, Position your nail or screwdriver right over the middle of the middle. Use your hammer to force the nail or screwdriver into the lid. Once you have poked the hole, set the hammer aside, and wiggle the nail or screwdriver out.

, The hole needs to be wide enough so that you can slide your cord or wick through. It needs to be tight enough so that it can support the cord or wick and hold it up over the jar. If your hole needs to be widened, you can use a pair of pliers to peel the edges of the hole towards you.

, The tip of the wick should be now sticking up through the top of the lid. If you want, you can wrap the tip with some tape first; this will prevent the wick from unraveling as you work it through the hole.


You can also use a 100% cotton cord.

, This will hide the hole in the jar, and make your lamp look neater. The tip of the wick should be sticking no more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the top of the nut. Make sure that the inside diameter of the nut is the same as your wick.


If you used tape, be sure to snip the taped part off once you have the wick through the nut and hole.

, You can also use other types of oil as well, such as citronella or lamp oil. Olive oil, however, is the safest because it does not contain any harmful chemicals.

, This will allow the cord or wick to soak up enough oil so that you can light it.

Rosemary
Thyme
Lavender

, Cut a lemon, lime, or orange into thin slices and slip those slices into the jar. Push them against the walls of the jar so that the center jar is mostly empty. The citrus slices will not only give your jar a burst of color, but they will also give the oil a nice smell when it burns., Just don't get too carried away, of you won't have enough oil in the lamp for it to burn. Here are a few ideas to get you started:


For a nautical or beach-themed lamp, you can fill your jar with seashells and sea glass.
For a festive lamp, try adding some cedar cuttings, holly berries, and small pine cones.For a more fragrant festive lamp, add in some pine sprigs and cinnamon sticks.

, Fill your lamp part way with water and add a few drops of food coloring. Stir the water with a spoon, then add your wick and oil. The water will sink to the bottom and the oil will float on top, giving you a stripped effect.

Start the heat.,
Secure your wick.,
Consider adding color or fragrance while melting.",How to Make a Gel Candle1," There are two ways to warm up your gel wax do the desired temperature: a pouring pot on the stove or a glass measuring cup in the oven. Both ways require patience.









If you want to use a pouring pot, cut up the gel into sizable pieces and place in the pot, on a low to medium flame. Let the gel wax melt until it becomes a thick, liquid syrup consistency. Using the thermometer, do not allow the gel wax to get hotter than 230 F (110 C).If you are going to use the oven, preheat it to 225 F (107 C). While your oven is warming, cut or chunk off the desired amount of gel wax. When the oven is heated, place the gel wax into the glass container and carefully set it in the oven. Let the gel wax melt in your oven for approximately one hour. Check the temperature of the gel wax periodically using your thermometer to ensure the gel wax is at the correct level of heat.Keep a constant eye on your wax. Do not let it exceed temperatures of 230 F--it may burn and turn yellow, not to mention be hazardous.

;
, Do this while the wax is melting. Though you don't necessarily need a tab, it does ensure things don't go awry.









Place a small dab of hot glue at the bottom of your container. Take an individual tabbed wick and place it on the spot, holding it for 15-20 seconds. This ensures it remains exactly how you want it.
If you don't use a tab, wrap the top of your wick around a pencil and place it on top of your container to hang it freely, yet stabilizing it.

, You have a number of different options for color and timing that will all result in different looks. Add fragrance while heating, and color now if you want a uniform look.









Use a fragrance that's hydrocarbon compatible and non-polar. If you made your own gel wax, test 1 part fragrance with 3 parts mineral oil.If it mixes in nicely, it's fine. If you bought your gel wax from a store, separate a bit and test the dye before possibly ruining the batch.
Adding the color now will create a monotone candle. The color will be evenly spread throughout all the layers.
Adding the color when just poured into the container will create a swirling effect.
Adding the color once the gel is mostly cooled will create a ring around the top.
You can also add color layer by layer, either in the pan (pour a bit, add color, pour a bit, add color), or in the container. The tone will get richer with each layer.

"
"
Set up your embedded materials.,
Pour on.,
Let cool and arrange the next level.,
Let your gel candle cool completely.",How to Make a Gel Candle2," If you are working with multiple layers, only worry about the bottommost layer now. To create ""floating"" embeds, you'll be pouring your gel wax at different times.









Arrange your embeds around the bottom of your container. They should only move minimally when under the wax.
Have tweezers ready to adjust your embeds as necessary without burning yourself.
Use sand or salt to create a beach scene. Add seashells or pebbles for dynamics. Glue salt onto sticks to create white algae. Colored sand works well, too.
Petals or flowers add well to a color scheme in any room and combine easily with fragrance. However, natural embeds may require a gel coating before placed in the container of hot wax. This can be done with the same wax gel.
Wax pieces of fruit or ice cubes call to mind summery drinks and sunshine.
If you do buy gel wax premade, make sure it is high density if you are wishing to embed heavy objects.

, Take note: The faster you pour, the more bubbles there will be. And if you are working with layers of embeds or color, only pour enough to cover the first section.









Grab your tweezers to adjust your embeds if they've moved under the pressure.
If unwanted bubbles are starting to form on the top of your candle, grab a hair dryer to reheat the top, solving your problem!, Once your first layer has mostly cooled (this should only take a matter of minutes), create your second level of embeds on top of the wax and continue pouring.









If your wick is not tabbed, you may wish to take a careful hold of it while pouring.
Remember, you can add more color for a gradient effect!
Repeat this process for however many levels you desire.

, After about four hours, it should be ready. At this time, trim the wick to 1/4 of an inch (.63 cm) before burning.

, Put the wax into a glass measuring cup, then set the cup down in a large pot. Fill the pot with water until it is level with the wax; make sure that the water can't get inside the measuring cup. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, and wait for the wax to melt, stirring it occasionally.Use an old measuring cup that you no longer use for cooking.Alternatively, you can melt the wax in the microwave at 1 to 2-minute intervals. Stir the wax between each interval., For a more intense fragrance, add 15 drops of cinnamon essential oil.If you'd like a more complex fragrance, consider adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and ½ teaspoon of ground clove.Use pot holders to handle the measuring cup. It will be very hot.

, If you notice any air bubbles, use a wooden skewer to wipe the inside walls of the jar. This will send the air bubbles to the top.Be careful not to knock the wick aside. Keep the sticks to either side of it.

, It may take up to 4 or 5 hours for the candle to completely harden. If you are in a hurry, you can stick it in the fridge to speed the process up.

Select a jar to hold your candle.,
Choose the ingredients.,
Prepare the jar.,
Melt the wax.,
Pour wax into prepared container.,
Trim wick when candle has cooled.",How to Make a Jarred Soy Candle," Take size, scope, color and glass type into consideration when choosing your jar.


Consider the size of your candle. Remember, the larger the jar the more wax, color and oil you will need.
Determine if you want to recycle a jar or purchase something new. Sometimes using an old jar that holds sentimental value is a nice way to preserve or feature its meaning. However, if you plan to use an old jar, make sure it is free of blemishes or scratches as the hot wax may leak or possibly destroy the jar.
Decide if you want to use a jar with a lid. If you plan to give the candle as a gift you may want to select one that has a lid, which makes for better packaging.
Take into consideration the jar design. Are you interested in matching homey, country décor or do you want something more modern? Jars can match your decorating style.;
, Carefully assemble your ingredients that you will use to create your candle which includes scent and color. You can select a scent that you love or one that a friend or family member will enjoy if you plan to give the candle as a gift.


Purchase quality, high grade soy wax chips. You can find soy wax chips at a local craft store.
Select candle coloring. In some cases a plain, white soy candle will look gorgeous. However, if you plan to add a scent like chocolate or lavender you may want a deep chocolate color or a pale purple to match the aroma.
Choose your scent. Essential oil or fragrance oil. Fragrance oil choice is a very personal decision so spend time sampling the aromas and ask an employee at the craft store whether certain scents exude a strong smell or if they are weak.
Purchase a wick long enough for approximately 2” to peak beyond the jar’s opening. Also, pick up a pre-waxed wick with a metal tab on the end as this will make working with it much easier.

, Jar preparation is key to creating a nice soy wax candle. Even if you purchase a brand new jar, make sure you go through the same steps as if you are using a recycled jar.


Make sure the jar is completely clean. Wash and clean the jar with warm water and a mild dish detergent. Peel any labels off by soaking the jar in warm soapy water. Remove any residual adhesive.
Place the wick in the center of the jar. The wick will need to be in the middle of the jar so stand it in the middle and hold in place using two butter knives.
Pre-heat the jar. Preheat your oven to 100 degrees and warm jar(s) for five to ten minutes (or until warm).

, How you melt the wax will determine the quality and integrity of the candle. Be sure you take care and follow the melting directions carefully so you don’t burn the wax.


Use a double boiler or fill a pan with an inch of water and heat to a low simmer.
Place wax chips in a metal pitcher and place in water. Fill the pitcher only ¾ of the way in order to provide enough room for the wax to melt and meld.
Stir wax constantly until totally melted or until it reaches 180F. Don’t leave melting wax alone on the stovetop as it could burn or could become a fire hazard.
Add candle dye if desired once the wax has melted. For richer, deeper tones, keep adding dye until you achieve desired color. Stir as you add the color to ensure uniform coverage.
Add essential or fragrance oil once the wax has cooled to approximately 140F. As with color, be sure you stir well to permeate the oil into the wax.

, Another important step, be sure you are methodical with how you pour the wax into the jar.


Pour wax slowly into the jars in order to reduce shrinkage and air pockets.
Keep your eye on the wick to ensure it doesn’t move or bend during the pour process. Keep butter knives in place until the candle has completely cooled.

, It may take from an hour to up to three hours for the candle to cool depending on the size.


Cut wick to 1/4” for optimal burning. You’ll want to have enough room for the wick to burn down without burning the candle or snuffing itself out.
Avoid cutting the wick too low because to close and it will cause the candle to smolder when lit.

Get a short, unscented pillar candle.,
Place a rubber band around the middle of the candle.,
Start tucking the cinnamon sticks behind the rubber band.,
Straighten the cinnamon sticks up.,
Cover the rubber band by wrapping some ribbon around it.,
Consider adding some embellishments for that final touch.,
Use the candle.",How to Make a Cinnamon Scented Candle2," The candle can be any size you want, but keep in mind that you will be wrapping the cinnamon sticks around this candle. The thicker the candle is, the more cinnamon sticks you will have to use.


Choose a candle that is the same height as your cinnamon sticks.
You can also use a tea candle, and stick it in a glass candle votive instead.
For a twist, try a vanilla-scented candle. The cinnamon fragrance will blend well with it.

, If you are using a candle votive instead, then place the rubber band around the middle of the votive instead. The rubber band will hold the cinnamon sticks in place. Don't worry about how the rubber band looks for now; you will be covering it up later., Keep adding cinnamon sticks until the candle/votive is completely covered and there are no gaps left. How many cinnamon sticks you end up using will depend on how thick or thin the candle/votive was.The cinnamon sticks don't all have to be the same height. For a more interesting-looking candle, consider cutting some of the sticks shorter, so that you get a more natural, jagged look., It's okay if the cinnamon sticks are different heights or extend past the top of the candle, but they all need to be flat on the bottom. Gently tap your candle against a flat surface, such as a table, and push down on the cinnamon sticks until they are all even on the bottom. This will make your candle more stable, and prevent it from wobbling.All cinnamon sticks have a groove or seam. You can have the sticks all facing in the same direction, so that the groove is facing inward or outward. You can also make it random, with some of the sticks facing inward, and others facing outward., For a more rustic feel, you can use burlap ribbon instead. You can also wrap some baker's twine or jute string around it, then tie the ends into a bow; you'll have to wrap the twine/string a few times in order to cover the rubber band.You can use any type of ribbon you want, but something warm colored (burgundy, copper, or brown) will look best. You can also use fabric, gingham ribbon for that rustic, country feel. Grosgrain ribbon will also look great.
If you are using baker's twine, consider using the red-and-white or red-and-ivory kind. It will make your candle look more interesting.

, These types of candles already look pretty rustic, so anything that is related to fall, winter, or cozy, country cottages is a safe bet. Small pieces of branches, especially those with red berries attached, are a great choice. These branches and berries don't have to be real; craft stores sell realistic-looking plastic ones that last many years.


If this is for winter, consider something with holly leaves and red berries. You can also use a mini branch with fake ""ice crystals"" attached.
If this is for fall, consider something simple, such as a bare branch, or a branch with red berries.
If you used a fabric, gingham ribbon, get a plastic button in a matching color, and glue it over the top of the bow.

, Simply set the candle on a heat-safe surface, and light it. The heat from the fire will cause the cinnamon sticks to warm up, and release their fragrance. If you made a cinnamon-wrapped candle votive instead, you must use real candles; those battery-operated candles do not give off enough heat.

Choose a large container.,
Pick your flowers.,
Buy filler material, if desired.,
Find a location that's suitable for the flowers you are growing.,
Plan your layout.,
Loosen the soil in your desired location based on your plan.,
Set the container down on its side.,
Fill the base of the container with good-quality soil.,
Fill the loosened soil in the spill path with more soil.,
Remove the plants from their containers.,
Arrange the plants on the path where you want them to go.,
Add long, drooping plants into the mouth of the container.,
Place the plants into the soil.,
Water the garden.,
Add any extras, such as mulching.",How to Create a Spilled Flower Pot," Wine barrels and large, wooden buckets are very popular. You can also use other types of containers, such as: watering cans, milk pails, large vases, or flower pots. The larger the container, the better.


The opening of the container needs to be larger than your flowers, or it will look disproportionate.;
, Anything that would go into a hanging flower basket would work especially well. Alyssums, begonias, daisies, geraniums, lobelias, and petunias are all great choices.If you don't have a green thumb, try succulents instead!


Choose flowers that require the same amount of sunlight.
You can use just one type of plant, such as just succulents or just mini daisies., Mulch, bark, and pebbles are a great way to fill the gaps between the flowers and hide the bare soil from view. They can also help keep the soil most.Small rocks would work especially well with succulents.

, Check the how-to-grow tag that came with your flowers and see how much sunlight they require. Find a spot in your garden that has the right amount of sunlight.


If your entire garden is suitable, consider choosing a spot in the corner, by a fence, or near a tree.
If you don't have the tag anymore, research the flowers online.

, Get out a pencil and a pad of paper. Sketch out your container and the general shape of the spill path. How long and how wide do you want the spill to go? Do you want it to be straight or wavy? Do you want it to be the same thickness, or tapering? Here are some ideas to get you started:


For a tapering spill, have it start the same width as the container opening, then make it get wider and wider further out. This works best for vases.
For a short spill, try having something that's curved, like a puddle of spilt milk.
A long spill would look great along a fence or wall. Have it run for several yards/meters before running into a rock, pond, or other fixture.
Work with your landscape. If you want a wavy spill, have it wind around rocks and other pots that might be in its path.
Combine straight spills with tapering spills. You can have them grow wider or narrower the further they are from the container. This will make them look more interesting.

, You need to loosen the soil not just along the spill path, but also where you will be placing the container. You can easily loosen the soil by turning it with a trowel or shovel.

, Position it at the start of the spill, with the opening facing the opposite end.It should be about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way deep in the soil.If you are using something like a vase, push it down until the soil is just below the rim.


If you are using a vase, consider angling the opening downward or upward. This will make it look like the flowers are pouring out of it.

, Keep filling it until the soil is level with the soil on the outside. You won't be filling the entire container with plants, but you will be adding some in there to make it look like the flowers are splitting out of it.


The soil in the container should be at least 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) deep., The soil in your garden is likely not very high-quality. Your plants will be much happier if you give them nutrient-rich soil. Mix your high-quality soil into the loosened soil, and pat it down.

, Gently squeeze on the sides of the plastic pots that the flowers came in. Grab the plants by the base of the stem, and gently lift them out.

, Don't dig holes into the soil just yet. Simply set the plants down according to your plan and where you think they might look best. Even if the plants are all the same type, some might still be a little shorter/taller than others. You may have to adjust your plan based on the actual flowers.


Place the taller plants towards the center of the path, and the shorter ones towards the end and edges.

, This will make it look like the plants are slipping out of it.How many plants you put inside the container really depends on the size of the opening and how much of it is sticking out of the ground. If the container is very deep, or has a small opening (like a vase), plant a long trailing flower near the rim. If your container has a large opening or is shallow (like a barrel), you can fill it almost to the back with shorter plants.


Great examples of long, trailing plants include alyssums.

, Use a trowel to dig holes in the ground, then place the root ball into the hole. Work one plant at a time, and gently pat the soil around the plant down. Plant the flowers about 3½ inches (8.9 centimeters) apart.You can plant succulents even closer, if you want. Start with the largest ones, then fill the gaps in with smaller ones.

, If you want to, you can also add some fertilizer into the water to help the plants grow. Make sure that you are using the right type of fertilizer for the type of plants you have.

, Fill the place between the flowers with your filler of choice, such as bark or pebbles. Make sure that you follow the line of your path.You can extend the filler beyond the edge of the path by a little, however.


Outline your path with a row of small stones.
If your spill path is very large, consider adding a couple of gardening lights to it.

Use a bag of rice.,
Shake your flowers in cornmeal.,
Try compressed air.,
Use a hair dryer on low speed.",How to Clean Silk Flowers1," Rice can help pull unwanted dirt and grime off of flowers that have been sitting in storage for long periods. Place a cup of uncooked rice in a paper bag. Then, add your flowers. Give the bag a few good shakes and then remove the flowers. Some of the dust and dirt should come off this way.This can work great with dried flowers and wreathes as well.;
, Cornmeal can help remove dust and grime from very dirty flowers. Fill a Ziploc bag with four to five tablespoons of cornmeal. Corn meal can act like a tiny sponge and remove unwanted grime from flowers. Place the flowers in the bag and seal it. Shake the bag for about 60 seconds. When you remove the flowers, shake them lightly to remove excess cornmeal and then remove the flowers. Dust and dirt should be removed., Compressed air can be used to remove small amounts of dust and dirt from silk flowers. You can buy compressed air at most department stores and then use it to remove dust and dirt from silk flowers.You can use the compressed air to blow light coverings of dust and dirt off the flowers.
However, you should avoid compressed air on very delicate silk flowers. It may cause petals to crumble.

, If you have a hairdryer, you can use this on silk flowers. This may work on very delicate compressed flowers that would not respond well to compressed air. Turn the hair dryer to a low setting and use it to blow any unwanted dirt and grime from the flowers.This is very effective with very light layers of dust. Heavier dust or dirt may not respond as well to a hairdryer.

",How to Make a Natural Citronella Candle," Wind each wick around a pencil and line wicks up in an even line.


Balance the pencil across the top of the container in order to keep wick in place.;
, Follow package directions for melting wax or consider placing wax pieces in a glass bowl and heat wax in a microwave for approximately 30 seconds.


Remove from microwave, stir and return to microwave for another 30 seconds until full melted.






Instead of melting wax completely down, stop heating when you have just a few pieces of solid wax. You can stir the wax until those pieces melt and the mixture is smooth (you don’t want to burn the wax).







, Stir wax in between every few drops to fully integrate the oil into the wax.

, Avoid hitting the pencils if possible and fill wax to the top.

, This may take a few hours or overnight.

Wash your flowers in water.,
Use vinegar.,
Try cleaning sprays.,
Use the dishwasher.",How to Clean Silk Flowers2," If silk flowers have been in storage for awhile, they may build up dirt and grime. In this case, you can wash flowers in water with dish soap in a sink full of warm water, mix in two to three tablespoons of gentle dish soap. You can then gently swish your flowers in the water. This should remove any unwanted dirt and grime.When you're done, set your flowers on a towel. Allow them to air dry.
Make sure to add water to a small portion of the flowers first to make sure it does not damage them.

, Take a spray bottle and fill it halfway with distilled vinegar and halfway with water. From there, shake the bottle until the water and vinegar are mixed together. Spray the flowers with a light amount of the mixture and then let them dry.If you've never exposed your flowers to water before, spritz a light amount of water on a small corner of the flowers to see if it causes damage first.

, Many cleaning sprays are sold specifically for silk flowers. Some of these sprays can work well, but use discretion. Make sure the spray is designed for silk flowers, as sprays made for artificial flowers in general may not work on silk.You should also keep in mind flower sprays may be more expensive than other methods.

, If you have a dishwasher that can be a set to a gentle cycle, you can wash your flowers on the top rack without detergent. A mild amount of water will wash off set in dirt and dust. However, make sure manufacturer's instructions first as some silk flowers are not dishwasher friendly. This can result in your dishwasher getting stained and flowers getting damaged.As always, make sure your flowers respond well to water by adding a small amount to the flowers before washing them.

Use a duster.,
Vacuum your flowers.,
Try a blow dryer.",How to Clean Silk Flowers3," A regular duster, such as a feather duster, can be used on flowers on a regular basis. This does not work well for removing built up dust or debris, but can remove a light gathering of dust. During your regular dusting, make a habit of lightly dusting silk flowers.If some of the dust is stuck on, use a soft bristle brush instead of a regular duster and brush them flower by flower. Do this outside to prevent getting dirt and dust on your floor., If you vacuum regularly, you may want to use a vacuum on silk flowers. Use a detachable hose and hold it a few inches away from your flowers. The vacuum cleaner should collect some of the dust., A blow dryer can be used as part of your regular cleaning regimen in addition to removing set in dust. If you clean regularly, try blowing dust off your flowers each time you clean. This will prevent dust from becoming set in and difficult to remove."

, Make sure the chocolate touches the wax.

,, Make sure the wick is tall enough for it. Usually, the longer the wick, the easier the project is.


Use a stick and place it over the container. Attach the wick to it using sticky tape.

, If it has melted, pour the mixture quickly in the candle container and let it set to dry. The chocolate would dry with the wax mixture. There might be some leftovers. Quickly pour the left-overs in another candle-container. You can use this for next time.


If there is food coloring in it, it should spread it colors around the wax mixture. Mix it if you don't want this 'marble' effect.

, Don't touch it or do anything do it. Once the wax has frozen, place the candle container directly in the freezer so the chocolate can be 100% frozen too.

Pick a suitable fragrance oil.,
Measure the palm wax.,
Use a Bain Marie (double boiler) to melt the wax.,
Test the temperature.,
While the heating process is taking place, wash out the containers in readiness for the wax.,
Preheat the oven halfway through the melting process.,
Place a cooling rack on a bench.,
Prepare the fragrance oil.,
Remove the warmed containers from the oven and place on the cooling rack just prior to pouring the heated palm wax.,
Pour in the fragrance oil once the palm wax reaches 200 °F (93 °C).,
Take the heated palm wax off the heat and stir for two minutes to ensure a smooth consistency.,
Allow the candles to cool and set, sitting on the cooling rack.,
Let the candle sit for 24–48 hours to fully set.",How to Make a Container Candle Using Palm Wax," Palm wax has a pearlescent appearance. It takes fragrance easily and it is very easy to shape.
, As explained above, try to find one that has a reputable growing policy. If you can't, ask the store why it can't sell such palm oil and explain that you are concerned about the impact of palm oil on rain forests., A glass container is the most appropriate so that you can see the candle's qualities as it burns. Salsa jars are a great size, or you could make a series of smaller candles in baby food jars., You can go wild here and choose whatever scent pleases you most! Make a combination if you're clever enough. Just make sure it isn't overwhelming., It should be enough to fit your chosen container to almost the top but leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) space. As a guide, for a container of about 4–10oz, use about 2 pounds of palm wax., Place the palm wax into the top level of the Bain Marie, water in the base level, and place over the heat. Wax is a little like chocolate in the melting; it should never be in direct contact with either heat or water., Using a thermometer, check the wax. It should be heated to 200 °F (93 °C). The time for this to happen will be up to half an hour, so be patient and stay near it at all times. Never leave wax unattended while it is being heated!, Make sure they are bone dry; wipe with a paper towel if needed., Place it on its lowest temperature and place the containers into the oven. The reason for this is that the containers need to be warm when the wax is poured in but not so hot as to crack them, of course!, This will be the area for placing the warm containers when you remove them from the oven., Measure out the appropriate amount of oil, for example, if you are using 1 pound of palm wax, then use 1 oz fragrance oil, 2 pounds of palm wax, then use 2 oz of fragrance oil, etc. Measure by weight, not volume. Have this ready for pouring straight in., Add the candle wicks using a wick bar to keep it in position. Keep them spaced apart evenly; the containers should not be touching if you are using more than one container., If you are coloring the candle, do so at this time as well (use suitable wax colorant)., Once stirred well, pour into the warm, prepared containers. The temperature at pouring must be 195 °F (91 °C), so check this prior to pouring., Once cool, tidy the wick by trimming neatly to around 1/4"" height. Add any decorative elements to the outside of the jar., After this time, the candle is now ready to use or to give away."

Look for variants in foliage.,
Look for leaf shape and texture.,
Look for differing weights of leaves.,
Select leaves according to season.,
Arrange the leaves according to your preferences.,
Place the leaves firmly in the arrangement.,
Condition the leaves.",How to Arrange Foliage," Leaves aren't just green. They come in a range of green shades, from light to dark, from plain to patterned, with acid-yellows, pale translucent greens, mottled grey-blues, etc. The variety is infinite and only limited by your ability to obtain different leaf types.;
, Equally as interesting and varied as leaf colours, the textures and shapes of leaves are an important part of creating a good foliage display. For example, consider the different shapes and textures of:


A maple leaf
A sweetcorn leaf
A cabbage leaf
A camellia leaf
An English ivy leaf
A flax leaf
A beetroot leaf
A rhubarb leaf.

, Again, there is a lot of variety here and you can create layered dimensions using light and heavy leaves together, or singly. Look for:


Leaves that are very light and feathery
Leaves that are very coarse, strong, and heavy - firm leaves will often last a long time.

, Some leaves are better during certain seasons. The following rundown will help you:


Spring: Tulip, daffodil, chestnut, hellebore, iris, ivy
Summer: Globe artichoke, hosta, privet, gladioli, ginger, beetroot, Swiss chard, willow

Autumn: Azalea, magnolia, broom, geranium, rose, beetroot
Winter: Laurel, ivy, periwinkle, camellia, rhododendron, magnolia.

,


Place heavier leaves at the back or base.
Place lighter leaves at the front, or above.
If adding flowers, use flowers at the back and front, to create a sense of depth.
Group varieties of flowers, colours, and textures rather than placing them haphazardly.

, Push each stem firmly into the arrangement foam or other floral aid to ensure the arrangement sits well.


Ensure that there is some water in the container.
Remove leaves that sit beneath the water line or they will rot and go foul.
Crush or split woody ends before placing in water.

, To make the appearance of the leaves brighter, rub with olive oil. This will brighten shiny leaves, as well as removing any stains.


Trim off any scraggly, withered, brown, damaged or diseased parts of the leaf display.

Dust your flowers weekly.,
Use a silk flower cleaning spray.,
Shake the flowers in a bag of salt.,
Spray a mixture of vinegar and water.,
Use soap and water.",How to Clean Artificial Flowers1," Move in light back-and-forth motions over the areas where dust commonly accumulates. Weekly dustings will remove a little dust and keep your flowers cleaner between deep cleanings.As an alternative to a feather duster, you could use:


A microfiber cloth.
A hair dryer set to a low heat.
A vacuum cleaner with an old stocking secured over the hose by a rubber band. If possible, set the vacuum cleaner to its lowest setting.;
, Mist the flowers lightly. No wiping is required. You can buy the spray at major department stores like Target.


Cleaning sprays can be quite effective, but they are generally very expensive.

, Place the flowers in a plastic resealable bag along with a few spoonfuls of coarse salt. Shake the bag gently for one minute. The grains of salt will act as mild abrasives, gently loosening dust and grime. When you're done, remove the flowers from the bag and shake off the remaining salt.


As an alternative to salt, you could use two to three tablespoons of cornmeal. Follow the same directions for the salt method., If you think your flowers can safely withstand a little moisture, fill a spray bottle with equal parts water and distilled vinegar. Mist the flowers very lightly with the mixture and allow them to air dry. You may want to place a towel under the flowers to absorb any drips.

, Fill your sink with room temperature water and add a few drops of dish soap. Gently swish each flower around in the water, rubbing lightly to remove any stubborn grime. Immediately take the flower out of the water and blot the entire piece dry with a clean towel.


Use caution when drying the flowers, as the towel can loosen individual parts of each flower.
Don’t soak your flowers if they’re hand wrapped. Soaking erodes the glue and weakens the floral tape."

,
Snip off any leaves or flower parts that will fall below the lip of the vase.,
Place the roses in a vase of cold water.,
Set the vase of roses out of direct sunlight and away from heating vents or radiators.",How to Buy Fresh Roses," Roses are very deliberate, and giving the wrong color may send the wrong message. Because these symbols are widely known, be sure that the color you choose matches to the correct feeling you want the receiver to know.


Red means love, pink is a great choice for admiration, yellow is for friendship, white stands for purity and can be used for weddings and funerals, orange is known for conveying passion, and purple is for enchantment or ""love at first sight."";
, The petals on each rose should be vibrant in color and free from wilting or brown edges, both of which indicate that the roses are older and may have a shorter lifespan.

, Known as a ""bullet,"" rose heads that are still very closed at purchase stand a good chance of staying that way. Instead of blooming, they may simply lose their outer petals and die.

, If a rose is fully blossomed, it has already reached the peak of its life and will not last as long as others might. The ideal time to purchase roses should be when the flowers are slightly opened. The petals should be a bit loose at the top of the rose head, which allows you to see that it has a decent chance of flowering.

, Knowing when the flowers arrived can help you determine how old they are and how long they have to live.

, Keep them in a cool, dark storage container if at all possible until they arrive.

,, The only things that should be inside the vase are the rose stems and water.

, For optimal rose life, change the water every other day.

, Roses will wilt and die very quickly if they are subject to any heat.

Dust the flowers.,
Use lemon juice.,
Use glass cleaner.",How to Clean Artificial Flowers2," Do this weekly to prevent dust particles from building up. Move your duster in gentle, quick back-and-forth motions. Because plastic is more durable than silk, you could use any of the following as alternatives:


A feather duster
A microfiber cloth.
A hair dryer set to a low heat.
A can of compressed air.

, Put it in a spray bottle. Spritz the dirty areas of the flowers. The citric acid will help to break down dirt and grime.If the grime is especially stubborn, gently remove it with a cloth or dishwashing gloves. Rinse the flowers in cool water. When finished rinsing, lay the flowers on a towel to dry.Never use hot water, as it can weaken the glue that holds individual flower parts together.
Avoid scrubbing, which can damage the flowers.

, Cleaners with Ammonia D, like Windex, work best. Spray the glass cleaner onto the entirety of each flower. Lay the flowers in the sunlight for 30 minutes. This will help activate the cleaning product and restore the flowers' colors.

Dust weekly.,
Remove tarnish.,
Remove rust.",How to Clean Artificial Flowers3," Sweep back and forth to remove particles. Since metal is more durable than plastic or silk, you could also wipe dust particles from the flowers with a hand towel or microfiber cloth.

, Mix two parts distilled white vinegar and one part water. Soak the flowers for about two hours. Remove the flowers from the mixture, and rinse them with tap water. Pat the flowers dry with a towel. Alternatively, you could replace the vinegar and water mixture with:


Tomato juice.
A mixture of two parts milk and one part water, Scrape it off with a wire brush. Then, use a paintbrush to apply commercial rust converter to all affected areas. Alternatively, you could use spray-on rust converter. After the affected area turns black, you can repaint it.Whether you use liquid or spray-on rust converter, never apply it indoors. It gives off toxic fumes. Apply it outside for ventilation.

Sit the tulip inside.,
Consider adding plant food.,
Place the tulips away from sources of significant heat.,
Refill the water.,
Trim every few days.",How to Arrange Tulips," The right amount will depend on the sort of display you want to create. Large arrangements require 8 to 12 tulips, but smaller arrangements may only need three to six. You can also display single tulips.


It may also help to know which vase or container you plan to use before purchasing your tulips. Ideally, the tulip stems should fit snugly inside the mouth of the container without being squeezed together.;
, Tulips come in a fairly wide range of colors, and your arrangement can include one or more of these colors.


For home decor purposes, most people prefer to choose colors that coordinate well with the colors of the room. You can use tulips to draw out an accent color already in the room or to add contrast to the colors of that room. For instance, red tulips might look nice in a bedroom with red throw pillows and neutral walls. On the other hand, bright orange tulips can add a pleasant splash of complementary contrast to a room decorated in nothing but shades of blue.
Another option is to choose the color based on meaning. In the language of flowers, each tulip color carries a slightly different meaning.Red tulips are a declaration of love and mean ""please believe me.""
Yellow tulips once signified hopeless love but now state, ""there's sunshine in your smile.""
White tulips can symbolize forgiveness, heaven, novelty, and purity.
Cream tulips say, ""I will love you forever.""
Purple tulips symbolize wealth and royalty.
Pink tulips symbolize deep affection.
Orange tulips stand for energy, desire, and passion.
Variegated tulips state, ""you have beautiful eyes.""



, Your tulip arrangement will last longer if you start with tulips that still have closed buds with only a hint of color showing—just enough to let you see what color you're actually purchasing.


Tulips that have already begun opening can still create a nice display for a day or two, but since they're further along in their lifecycle, these tulips will not last as long in an arrangement.

, The cut should be made diagonally so that the stems can draw up more water.


As stems dry, they gradually close up, restricting their ability to draw in water. Making a fresh cut re-opens the stem and makes it easier for the tulip to drink.
You can lay the tulips flat as you do this, but cutting the stems under still or running water is recommended to prevent air from entering the fresh cut and blocking the water channels inside the stem.

, At minimum, you should remove the bottom leaf of each stem. You can remove more leaves, as desired, to change the appearance of the arrangement.


When creating medium to large arrangements, you'll usually want to remove all but the top leaf from each stem. The single leaf provides just enough volume and greenery to make the arrangement look full, but too many leaves can distract from the appearance of the tulip blossoms.
Any leaves you leave behind should be inspected for dirt. Brush or wash away any hidden debris trapped along the inside of the leaves.
To remove the leaves, simply pull each leaf back and gently peel it off the stem.

, Before arranging your tulips, it can be a good idea to train the stems so that they stand strong and upright.Roll the bouquet of tulips in a snug newspaper or wax paper cone. The paper should rise above the tops of the tulips, but roughly one-third of the lower stems should be left uncovered.
Place the wrapped bouquet in a clean container of cool water. The water should be deep enough to cover the exposed stems.
Let the tulips remain in this position for one or two hours. Afterward, remove them from the paper cone and arrange as desired.
Note that you can also do this periodically throughout the lifespan of the tulips once they start drooping inside their arrangement.

, Tulips can look great in wide range of containers. You can use a traditional vase or experiment with a recycled option.Keep the size in mind when selecting a container. Large arrangements do best in containers that are tall and wide, while smaller arrangements are best when constrained in short or narrow containers.
Consider using a crystal, metal, or opaque ceramic vase.
If you'd like something more rustic, reuse a container once meant for something else. A few good options include large mason jars, tin cans, pitchers, plastic tumblers, and teapots.

, Clean your chosen container with hot water and soap, then rinse it well to remove any residue.


Bacteria can significantly shorten the lifespan of cut tulips, so it's crucial to start with a clean container if you want your tulips to live past a few days.

, Roughly three-quarters of the container should be filled with mildly cool to lukewarm water.


The stems draw lukewarm water up more readily than ice cold water, so if you want to keep the tulips healthy, room temperature water is your best option.

, For the vast majority of tulip arrangements, you should trim the stems so that roughly two-thirds of the stem height remains constrained by the vase.This height makes use of the natural arc of the stem.
For large arrangements, you'll want the tulips to hit about 5 inches (12.7 cm) above the rim of the container. For medium and small arrangements, you'll need to keep about 4 inches (10 cm) above the rim.
As before, trim the stems under running water with a clean, sharp knife.

,


You can situate the stems so that they are standing straight up, or you can crisscross them in the basin of the container to create an interlocking web that will hold the stems in place. The former will keep the tulips upright while the latter will cause the tulips to tilt outward.

, Use the remaining tulips to fill in the space at the center of the container. Space them apart as evenly as possible.


If the outer tulips are angled, the inner ones should be placed at a slight angle, too.
Likewise, if the outer tulips are straight and upright, the inner ones should also be upright.

, If you placed the stems in an upright position, grab the portion just above the mouth of the container with both hands and rotate the top of the stems slightly to one side.Doing this will cause the tulips to fan out gently without bending the stems. The effect will be less dramatic than stems placed at a crisscross, though, which means there will also be less stress on the stems themselves.

, Single tulip displays can work well in a range of containers, too, but the containers either be very narrow or very short.


A single bud vase would work well as a more traditional option, or you can look for a tall, narrow cylinder vase that extends above the height of the entire tulip. Make sure that the vase is skinny enough for the tulip to fit snugly; otherwise, the flower will flop around inside.
Glass bottles with narrow mouths can be a good option if you want to go the recycled, rustic route. Teacups, baby food jars, and tiny tin cans are a few other options.

, Use hot, soapy water to thoroughly clean out any dirt and debris from your chosen container. Rinse it with clean, running water when done to remove any soap residue.


Bacteria in the vase or water will cause the tulips to die significantly faster than they would in a clean vase.

, Fill the container with enough water to cover anywhere from one-half to three-quarters of the tulip stem.


The height of your chosen container will somewhat determine how full you can make it.

Tall, skinny containers should be filled to cover roughly three-quarters of the tulip stem.
A short, wide container may not extend that far along the height of the stem, but you should try to keep at least half of the stem submerged to avoid dehydrating the tulip.


Use lukewarm water since tulips are able to draw it up more easily than ice cold water.

, The exact stem height you'll need for your single tulip display will depend on the type of container used.


When using a tall, narrow container meant to enclose the entire tulip, a longer stem will look nicer than a shorter step. The idea is to keep the tulip under the rim of the container without having too much empty glass above it.
For standard, narrow bud vases, keep two-thirds to three-quarters of the stem constrained by the vase.
If using a wide, short container, the depth of the container should be no less than half the height of the tulip stem.

, Place the tulip inside the container and adjust as needed.


Tulips will always droop a little, but this drooping should be minimal if you are using a tall, narrow container.
When using a wide, short container, position the tulip so that the stem crosses diagonally from the bottom of one side to the top of the opposite side. The soft stem will droop some, but that is usually part of the appeal in this type of display.

, There is some debate regarding how helpful floral preservatives are when arranging cut tulips. While some argue that tulips do not need powdered plant food, there is no evidence to suggest that this preservative will hurt the flowers, so you can add it as a precaution if desired.


Floral preservative can be purchased at nearly any floral shop. Some may even come with your tulips when you buy them.
Sprinkle the preservative in the water and let it dissolve before arranging your tulips. Add more preservative each time you change the water.

, This includes direct sunlight, radiators, stoves, lamps, and television sets.


Heat can cause the tulips to run through their lifespan at a more rapid pace. As a result, your arrangement will not last as long as it otherwise could.

, Tulips are heavy drinkers, so you should check the water level twice a day and add fresh water at least once a day.


To improve the health of your tulips, it is wise to completely change the water every three or four days. Changing the water as soon as it starts to look cloudy minimizes the amount of bacteria in the water, thereby increasing the overall lifespan of your flowers.

, Each time you change the water, you should also trim the bottom 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the stem using a sharp, clean knife.


Regularly trimming more off the bottom of the stem removes decayed stem that could otherwise block the rest of the healthy, active water uptake channels. As a result, the stems can draw water up more easily and for a longer period of time.
Keep the stems submerged under water while cutting them.

This is especially relevant when you are making the arrangement for a special occasion, such as a wedding, anniversary, or special birthday party.










Spring: The most popular flowers for springtime include daffodils, peonies, tulips, sweet pea, narcissus, hyacinths, anemones, ranunculus, lilacs, delphiniums and boronia.

Summer: The most popular flowers in summertime include lilies, gerbera daisies, sunflowers, snapdragons, hydrangeas, larkspur, freesias, lavender, forget-me-nots, bells of Ireland, chrysanthemums and tuberoses.

Autumn: The most popular autumnal flowers include dahlias, marigolds, zinnia, statice, chrysanthemums and aster.

Winter: The most popular winter flowers include camellias, poinsettias, star of Bethlehem, star gazer lilies, jasmine, holly, cosmos and amaryllis.

Year-long: Flowers that can be found in-season all year round include orchids, gardenia, roses, lily of the valley, carnations, baby's breath, protea, scabiosa, heather, gladiolus, eucalyptus and calla lilies.;
, The vessel you choose to make your flower arrangement in depends on the style you are going for. Almost any type of container can be used for a flower arrangement, as long as it's suitable for the height, weight and look of the flowers being used.









In terms of vases, long, thin, trumpet-shaped vases work best for delicate, thin stemmed flowers like lilies and crocosmia. Shorter, wide vases are better for large-headed, shorter-stemmed flowers like roses and chrysanthemums.
Beyond standard vases, feel free to use your imagination when it comes to containers. Use egg cups, champagne bottles, wide-brimmed bowls, old boots, umbrella stands, teacups or candle holders., Color is very important when it comes to flower arrangement, but there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to what color combinations work best. It will depend on the style and mood you're going for. However here are some things to keep in mind:









Add complimentary colors to your arrangement for a cheerful and varied look. Try mixing red and orange flowers, with a little bright green for freshness. Or mix a selection of pink and purple flowers, with a little white baby's breath for softness.
Try mixing a selection of flower varieties in a single uniform color, or in varying shades of the same color. Add some depth by including a cuff of green leaves around the outside.
Alternatively, you can try arranging a single variety of flowers in a selection of different colors, such as orange, white and yellow gerbera daisies or pink and purple tulips.

, Flower arrangements shouldn't be all about the flowers though. You can add some texture to your arrangement by adding in some greenery, some woody stalks or other, season-appropriate items.









Try adding some long grasses, berry stems, pussy willow, corn stalks, sour dock or iris leaves.
For more seasonal arrangements, try adding things like pine cones, pumpkins, sprigs of holly, bunches of berries, and other fruits and vegetables.

, One final thing to consider is the purpose and location of the arrangement. Consider the color scheme and general mood of the room you intend to place it in, so you can choose a design to match. You will also need to consider the amount of space available.









For instance, some brightly colored flowers can brighten up a dark hallway or add a splash of color to a monochrome bathroom, while some softer, pastel colored flowers might compliment an airy, sun-filled room.
In addition, the location of the finished arrangement should be considered when planning its size. A small bowl of colorful daisies might look cute on a coffee table, but be swallowed up on a kitchen counter. A tall vase might look great on a dresser in the hallway, but hinder conversation on a dining table., Before you jump straight into your flower arrangement, it's important to have all of the necessary materials easily at hand -- this will make the process more efficient. Depending on the type of flower arrangement you are making, you will need a selection of some or all of the following:









A clean vessel to contain the flowers -- this could be a vase, a bowl or a basket (amongst other things) depending on the number and size of flowers the flowers.
Some floral foam or a flower frog, to secure flowers in wide-mouthed containers.
Some floral tape or elastic bands to hold flowers together, especially in tall, narrow vases.
A sharp knife or garden clippers to cut the flower stems.
Some preservative solution (often supplied with the fresh flowers).
A clean, spacious work surface, lined with newspaper.
Selection of flowers and greenery.

, Before you place the flowers in an arrangement, it is necessary to cut the stems. This allows the flowers to absorb water more easily, keeping them fresh. Cut the flower stems diagonally, about an inch from the ends, using a sharp knife or garden shears. It's not advisable to use a kitchen scissors, as these can crack the stems and prevent the flowers from getting enough water.









If you plan on leaving the flowers to sit in a vase for any length of time before arranging them, remember to give the stems a second snip directly before placing them in the arrangement.
Before placing the flowers into the arrangement, you will also need to remove any leaves that are below the water level. This is important, as otherwise the leaves would rot, contaminating the water.One trick for keeping roses extra fresh is to soak the stems in an inch of boiling water immediately after cutting them. Leave them there until the water turns tepid, then give the stems a second snip before placing them in cool water. Wrap the flowers in brown packaging paper to protect them from the heat., The next step is to prepare the vase, bowl, box or whatever vessel you plan on using for the flower arrangement. Make sure the vessel is nice and clean, with no residue or dirt.









If you're using floral foam (which is great as it holds the arrangement in place and also provides the stems with water) allow it to soak in the preservative solution for 15 minutes, then use a sharp knife to cut it to the shape of the container. Place the wet, cut foam into the vessel and secure with a little floral tape.
If you're using a flower frog or a cellophane grid (which are good for holding top heavy flowers or those with woody stems), place it into the container and secure with some tape or a little floral adhesive.
Alternatively, you can criss-cross the woody stems of your chosen greenery across the bottom of the vessel. This creates a kind of organic grid which successfully holds your arrangement in place.

, If you're using a flower frog, grid or allowing the flowers to stand on their own, you should add the water to the vessel at this point. If you're using floral foam, there is no need to add additional water.









Pour the water to the vessel, then add a single package of preservative solution. If you don't have any preservative solution, try adding a couple of drops of Clorox bleach to the water instead -- this kills off any bacteria and helps to keep the flowers fresher for longer.
If you have any closed buds and you want them to open quickly, use warm water instead of cool water. This works best for flowers like roses and ranunculus, which have tightly closed flower heads., When you begin working on the arrangement, start with the largest or most prominent variety of flower first.









Rather than adding one type of flower and then another, it's better to work with a single flower type at a time. In this way, you can layer the different varieties, shapes and colors of flower evenly and create a more balanced arrangement.
Work in a circle, placing in flower around the outer edge of the container. If you're using wet foam, the stems should slide in easily. If they don't, use a sharp object to poke a hole first, then insert the stem -- just be careful not to make the holes any wider than the flower stems or the flowers won't be secure.
Turn the arrangement as you work to ensure that it looks even on all sides -- a lazy Susan is great for this!

, Once you have finished with the first circle of flowers, move on to the second, using a different variety of flower.









This circle of flowers should be inside the first. Try to create a domed effect by leaving the stems slightly longer on the inner flowers. The finished arrangement should look like a bunch of flowers growing on a hilltop.
Continue to layer the flowers in this manner, one variety after another, according to the size and number of flowers in your arrangement.

, One of the main rules when it comes to flower arranging is to use an odd number of each variety of flower.









For instance, you might have 7 red roses in the outer circle, 5 white roses in the inner circle and 3 sprigs of baby's breath interspersed between them.
This uneven number of flowers helps the arrangement to look less uniform and more organic.

, The height and width of your arrangement is another factor to consider when making your arrangement.









The general rule when it comes to height is that your arrangement should be one and half times the height of the vase or container it's held in.
There's no clear-cut rule when it comes to the width of your arrangement, but it should be wide enough to balance out the height.
Rotate the arrangement as you work to ensure that the height and width are even on both sides.

, When you have arranged all of the flowers to your liking, you can add the final touches by inserting any greenery, leaves, berries or other decorations.









This is step is important -- not only to add interest and texture to your arrangement -- but also because the greenery helps to separate the blooms, giving air room to circulate in between them so the flowers stay fresh.
Using filler material also helps to give the impression that there are more flowers in the arrangement than there actually are, so you can create an extravagant looking arrangement without the extravagant price!"

Select vibrant leaves.,
Coat both sides of each leaf in decoupage.,
Allow the decoupage to completely dry.,
Repeat on the other side.",How to Preserve Fall Leaves1," Harvest freshly fallen leaves that are bright in color and fairly supple. The leaves can be somewhat dry, but they should not be so dry that they are brittle or turning up at the ends. Avoid leaves with rips or rotten spots.;
, Decoupage is a white, gluey substance that turns clear when it dries. You can find it at your local craft store. Use a foam brush to carefully apply a liberal coat of decoupage to one side of each leaf. Set them to dry on a piece of newspaper.


In most cases, you should apply the decoupage to the leaves the same day you collect them. If you wait too long, the leaves will dry out, becoming brown and brittle.
If the leaves are very moist, however, or if you plucked them directly off the tree instead of waiting for them to drop, you can dry them out slightly by pressing them in between the pages of a heavy book for a few days.

, It will turn clear and will no longer be sticky., Turn the leaf the leaf and apply the decoupage to the other side. When the second side is dry, the leaves are ready to use. This method preserves the color and form of the leaves for an extended period of time.

Choose fresh leaves.,
Melt paraffin wax in a disposable pan.,
Remove the melted wax from the stove.,
Dip each leaf into the melted wax.,
Lay the leaves out to dry.",How to Preserve Fall Leaves2," Start out with leaves that are vibrant, and newly fallen. Coating the leaves with paraffin wax will preserve them at the height of their brilliant color. Dry them off with paper towels before you begin.

, You can buy a a 16-oz (453 g) box of paraffin wax at your local craft or grocery store. Melt it in a disposable cake pan by heating the pan on your stove over low heat.To make the paraffin wax melt more quickly, slice it into thick chunks and spread them evenly along the bottom of the disposable pan.
If you do not use a disposable pan, use a cake pan that you do not plan on using for cooking anymore. The wax can ruin the pan, so you should not use a pan that you frequently use for cooking and baking.

, Exercise caution, since melted wax is very hot. Transfer it carefully from the burner to your work table. Pay close attention to it to make sure that it does not get knocked over, especially if you have pets or small children.

, Hold a leaf at the tip of the stem and dunk it into the liquified wax several times.Make sure both sides of the leaf get coated in wax. Avoid getting your fingers too close to the wax. Repeat with the remaining leaves.

, Lay each wax-covered leaf out on wax paper until the wax hardens. Let the leaves dry in draft-free area for several hours. Once dried, they should lift off the wax paper easily. This method preserves the form and color of the leaves for a long time.


To be extra safe, line the counters with newsprint before lining them with a layer of wax paper. The double-layer minimizes the risk of getting wax drippings on the counter. If they get on the counter, wax drippings can be extremely difficult to scrape off.

Select fresh leaves or a small branch with leaves attached.,
Open up the end of each branch.,
Mix up a glycerin solution.,
Stand the branch in the solution for three to five days.,
Remove the branch and leaves from the solution.",How to Preserve Fall Leaves3," If you would like to preserve an entire branch of fall leaves, this preservation method is easier to use than wax. Choose a branch with leaves that are vibrant and firmly attached.This method will make the colors more vibrant. Yellows become more intense, and reds and oranges become a vibrant ruddy color.
Look for sprigs that have fallen off the tree on their own instead of breaking them off the tree yourself. Removing a branch from a tree can damage it.
Do not choose branches that have diseased leaves or those that have gone through a frost. This method does not work on leaves that have already gone through a frost.

, Strike the end of each branch with a hammer to split it open, exposing the live portion of the wood. This exposes the live wood of the branch so that it can absorb the glycerin solution properly. Otherwise, the solution will not be able to reach the leaves.


If you're just preserving individual leaves, you can skip this step.

, You can find vegetable glycerin in your local craft or grocery store. To make a solution, add 17 oz (530 ml) of liquid vegetable glycerin to half a gallon (2 liters) of water in a large bucket or vase.


Glycerin is a natural product derived from vegetables, making this a fairly organic option to preserve your leaves.
If you're preserving a large, woody branch, mix in four to five drops of mild liquid dish soap. The dish soap acts as a surfactant, breaking down the glycerin molecules so that they can penetrate the wood more easily. For best results, use a mild dish soap with no added colors or scents. You could also use liquid surfactant, which is available at most gardening stores.

, Allow the branches and leaves to absorb the glycerin for at least three to five days. Store the bucket in a shaded place during the absorption process.


If you're preserving individual leaves, you'll need to weight them so they stay submerged. Pour the solution into a flat pan, place the leaves in the solution, and cover them with a plate or lid to hold them down., The color will look brighter, and the leaves should feel supple. You can use the whole preserved branch in your crafts or you can pluck the leaves off and use them separately.

Sandwich fresh leaves between paper towels.,
Microwave the leaves to dry them out.,
Let the leaves sit out overnight.,
Seal the leaves with craft spray.",How to Preserve Fall Leaves4," This is a great way to dry leaves for crafts, but some color fading will occur. Place fresh leaves on top of two paper towels. Cover them with another single layer of paper towel.


Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots.
For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry.

, Place the leaves in the microwave and heat them for 30 seconds. Afterward, continue microwaving the leaves in 5-second intervals.Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry.
Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire.
Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough.

, Store the leaves in a draft-free, shady area. Leave them there overnight, at minimum, or for two days, at maximum. If you notice a change in color, the leaves should be sealed immediately.

, Spray both sides of each leaf with clear acrylic craft spray to preserve the remaining color. Let the leaves dry before using them as decorations or for crafts.

Place the leaves between two sheets of paper.,
Lay a heavy book over the paper.,
Alternative pressing with a book: Press the leaves directly inside the book.,
Check your progress after one week.",How to Preserve Fall Leaves5," This preservation dries leaves, but does not preserve their color. Sandwich your fall leaves in between two clean sheets of heavy white typing paper.Use paper that is at least as heavy as typing paper, rather than something thin like tracing paper. Otherwise, the leaves may bleed through and create stains.
Lay the leaves out in a single layer. Do not stack or overlap the leaves since doing so will cause them to stick together.
Choose leaves that are in good shape. They should be recently fallen and moist. The tips should not be dried or turned up.

, A large, heavy book should work. To reduce the risk of staining the book or other pressing object, as well as the work surface, place sheets of blotting paper or paper towels in between the typing paper and the book. This will help to absorb the moisture from the leaves.

, Use an old book that you do not mind staining just in case the leaves damage the pages. Simply tuck the leaves away into the pages of the book. Allow at least 20 pages in between leaves for best results.

Telephone directories work very well, if you have one available.
Put weight on top of the book. The pressing helps press out moisture as well as keep the leaf flat. This can be other books, bricks, or any object with some heft.

, They should be dried; if they are still pliable, press them for another few days.

, Place the leaves in a single layer in between two paper towels to dry them if they're wet. Make sure they aren't overlapping, since this will cause the leaves to stick together. Use a medium-hot iron to iron each side. Iron each side for three to five minutes to absorb extra moisture.Drying the leaves out beforehand will allow them to retain their color and quality after being sealed into the wax paper.
Do not use a steam setting on your iron, since steam will keep the leaves moist. Only use a dry setting.
Feel the leaves after ironing them for 3 to 5 minutes. If a leaf does not feel dry, iron both sides for a few more minutes.

, It does not matter which side of the wax paper faces the leaves, since both sides are waxed. Arrange the dried leaves in a single layer in between the wax paper sheets. Leave a little space around each leaf. The wax paper will need to be able to adhere to itself.

, You can also use brown paper bag material or another thick paper. Make sure all of the wax paper is covered by regular paper, so the iron won't stick to the wax. Make sure that the leaves remain spaced apart and in a single layer.

, With the iron on a medium-hot setting, iron both sides of the paper to seal the wax together. Keep the iron constantly moving so it won't burn the wax. Heat the first side for three minutes, then flip the paper, wax and leaves over carefully and repeat on the other side.


Do not use a steam setting on your iron; only use a dry setting.
Handle the hot paper carefully. If your skin is sensitive, you may want to wear gloves to protect your hands.

, The wax will have slightly melted around the leaves, and as it cools it will adhere to them. Wait until the wax is cool before handling it.

, After the whole thing has cooled to the touch, remove the paper sheets from the wax paper. Carefully cut around each leaf using scissors or a sharp craft blade.


Leave a small border of wax paper around the edge of each leaf so that the leaf remains securely sealed in between the layers of wax paper.
You could also try to peel the wax paper off the leaves instead of cutting them out. A coating of wax should remain on the leaves, and it may be enough to keep the leaves preserved.

For a hand-held bouquet, you will need to know the best possible date to prepare the arrangement so that the flowers are still fresh for the big occasion. For a centerpiece or hanging basket, you will need to figure out how much space needs to be cleared so that the arrangement will fit.;
, You could either select flowers for your bouquet in a range of colors or go with a monochromatic (based on one color) scheme. You should determine which flowers will not clash with the colors in the room you choose for your arrangement or with the attire of the person holding the bouquet.


If you are arranging a bridal bouquet for someone who wants to wear a green dress, red flowers (which is the complementary—opposite—color of green) might create an overly intense effect., Whether you choose a monochromatic or multicolored scheme, you can go with one species or a variety of them. For a multicolored scheme, you have more options, but you should avoid colors that clash with one another.


For a monochromatic scheme based on red, you could go completely with red roses or mix it up with pink and light purple flowers.
Sunflowers and violets might clash with each other if you don’t add colors that will offset the yellow and deep purple.

, Choose a vase or flowerpot that will hold all of the flowers without a great deal of open or leftover space. Make sure the container is small enough to avoid dwarfing the arrangement yet large enough to withstand the added weight of larger stems or blooms. The blooms should be able to fit tightly against one another when arranged.

, This is rather easy if you or a friendly neighbor has a flower garden. If this is not the case, you will need to find a florist that will allow you to buy unarranged flowers. Make sure the flowers are newly cut so that they will last as long as possible. Flowers that haven’t bloomed yet are also a good choice.


Although organic flowers are more expensive, they are a safer choice. Even if you are not designing a hand-held bouquet or plan to wear gloves as you arrange the flowers, chemicals can become airborne., The size of the vase or where the bouquet will be displayed will often determine the overall height of the arrangement. Consider how long or short the stems should be. Sometimes, flowers with overhanging parts will be necessary.


For smaller vases and spaces, shorten the stems of the flowers.
Opt for longer stems and trailing blossoms, such as roses or fuchsias, for larger vases and open areas.
Go with flowers with long overhanging leaves or vines, such as impatiens or zinnias, for hanging baskets., Use clean gardening shears or clippers. Start by removing the material on the lower inch (2.54cm) of the main stem. Gradually remove enough stem so that the flowers fit your vase neatly. Snip at a 45-degree angle to allow for efficient water absorption., Because cut flowers are no longer have roots to connect them to the soil, they will eventually wilt. Although many flower preservation hacks have been debunked (see Warnings), some can maintain the freshness of cut flowers. All you need are a few common household items.


Wrap the ends of roses in brown paper, and dip them in boiling water to force air from the stems. Leave them in the water until it cools, then trim the stems again.Spray cooking spray on tropical flowers to help seal in their moisture.Dip the heads of hydrangeas and other large flowers into water. Soak them for a few minutes before arranging them., Fill ¾ of the vase with water. Before creating the final arrangement, dip each flower in the water. Take note of any leaves below the water level, and remove them. This will slow the growth of bacteria that could speed up the demise of the flowers and create a foul odor., Place the larger, more vivid blossoms in the vase first. Then, place the smaller blooms or buds around them. This will give the arrangement a sense of stability. It will also first draw the viewer’s eyes to the center of the arrangement.In a peony arrangement, place a larger red flower in the center. Surround it with pink and white blossoms either in full bloom or in a budding stage.

, Add some support to the bouquet so that it doesn’t lean to one side. Use tree branches or twigs adjusted to the size of the arrangement to hold up more delicate flowers. Make sure smaller or flowers or buds are interspersed throughout the larger ones to prevent a sense of lopsidedness.


For example, intersperse pink tulips, white peonies, irises, and pink delphiniums so that each color is evenly distributed throughout the arrangement.

, Vary the blossoms in height and color evenly throughout the arrangement. Tuck smaller flowers or buds around the edges. Keep taller plants toward the center and top.


For example, arrange aster, blue veronica, blue lisianthus, and larkspur as the base colors. Add accents to the color scheme with red dahlias and “Black Prince” snapdragons inserted between the lighter hues.

, Do this constantly as you place the flowers inside it. Rotation will ensure you don't neglect any one area and give an even hand to the entire bouquet.

, When you’re satisfied with the appearance of the bouquet, tie the stems together right at the waterline. This will pack the flowers tightly together and force them to support one another.


Use a clear elastic band to avoid detracting attention from the flowers.
Use twine for a more rustic appearance.
Use ribbon to add a decorative touch to a bridal bouquet.

, Like all organic material, dead flowers emit methane (a greenhouse gas 24 times as powerful as CO2) when taken to the landfill.Get crafty by reusing your flowers as they begin to wilt and die. Use your new creations as home décor or as unique gifts.


If you have a compost heap or a municipal composting program, you can reuse your flowers by turning them into organic fertilizer. Just make sure your flowers were not treated with chemicals or grown with genetically modified seeds beforehand.

Choose flowers to press.,
Pick the flowers at the right time of day.",How to Press Flowers1," Pick flowers from your garden or someone else's with their permission; or you can gather wildflowers from a field. You can also buy flowers from a florist if you want a certain type of flower that doesn't grow in your region.









Pick the flowers either in bud or as soon as they open. This is when the color is best. Choose blossoms and petals that haven't been bruised, torn, damaged by insects, or wilted.
Flowers with naturally flat faces, such as pansies, violets, or apple blossoms are easier to press than flowers a more 3 dimensional shape like orchids, lilies, or peonies. However, you can take a flower apart to press, and then reassemble it when you want to use it.

, Flowers that are still wet with dew or rain will be more prone to molding in your press. Flowers picked in the hot summer afternoon sun will be more prone to fading.

Find a flower press.,
Prepare the flower press.,
Arrange flowers on the piece of flower press paper.,
Add the remaining paper and cardboard layers.,
Press the flowers.,
Change the blotter sheets every few days.,
Remove the flowers from the press.",How to Press Flowers2," Flower presses are made with wood and metal screws and come with pieces of cardboard and flower press paper. They are available at craft stores or through trading or auction sites online.









If you're using a used press, check that the press has clean papers and cardboard inside. If not, you may have to replace these.

Recycle cardboard from boxes around the house. Cut them into pieces that fit inside your flower press.
Cut pieces of parchment or freezer paper to use in your flower press. These should be the same size as the cardboard.


You can easily make your own flower press if you can't find one.

Cut two pieces of plywood to 9 by 12 inches (23 cm by 30.5 cm).
Drill holes large enough for bolts in all four corners of both pieces, making sure the holes in the pieces line up when they are stacked.
Slip bolts through the four holes in one of the plywood pieces. When you're ready to press flowers, you will cover them with the second pieces of plywood and screw the pieces together tightly using wing nuts.
Cut cardboard as sheets of parchment paper that will fit inside your press.

;
, When you're ready to press the flowers, remove the top piece of the flower press and set it aside with the wingnuts. Place one piece of cardboard on the bottom of the press, plus two sheets of flower press paper, the bottom most of which will serve as a ""blotter.""








, Lay the flowers flat on the top sheet of paper, leaving ample space between them so they are able to thoroughly dry.









Play with the arrangement of the petals according to your artistic sense. You could lay them flat, or overlap some of them to create a windblown effect. The flowers will be preserved just as you position them.
To press flowers with more dimension, cut them in half lengthwise, or press individual petals.

, Place a piece of paper carefully over the flower arrangement you made.









Without disturbing the arrangement add add a second ""blotter"" sheet.
Add the second piece of cardboard to the stack.

, Fit the top piece of the flower press over the screws, and gently lower it onto the cardboard piece. Use the wing nuts to tighten the flower press. Store the press in a dry place in your house.








, Unbolt the flower press to switch out the blotter sheets every couple of days. They will have absorbed some moisture from the flowers even if you can't feel it. Changing the sheets can help prevent or lessen the flowers from turning brown..








, After a few weeks, the flowers will be completely dry and flat. Gently open the layers of paper and lift them using your fingers or a pair of tweezers. They are ready to use in a craft design.

Find a heavy book.,
Lay the book open and line it with paper.,
Arrange flowers on one side of the book.,
Close the book.,
Change the blotter sheets every few days.,
Remove the flowers from the books.",How to Press Flowers3," Dictionaries, phone books, and encyclopedias are excellent choices for pressing flowers. The moisture from the flowers will cause the pages to wrinkle, so be sure to choose books that can be damaged.








, You will need four pieces of paper, two of which will serve as blotters. Place two sheets of paper on either side of the book.








, Using the directions outlined above, choose flowers to lay flat or arrange artistically. You are only limited by the size of the book.








, Be careful to close it in such a way that the flower arrangement does not get disturbed, and the paper stays aligned with the book.









If you have a lot of flowers, you can place more flowers at different parts of the book. Make sure to leave about half an inch (1.3 cm) between the pages so your flowers don't transfer moisture to the other flowers in the book. Too many will cause mold.
Pile more heavy books on top of the pressing book, and store them in a dry place in your house.

, Carefully open the book to the pages where you're pressing flowers and remove the under sheets of paper you are using as blotters. Replace them with fresh blotter sheets, close the books, and continue to let the flowers press.








, After a few weeks, the flowers will be completely dry. Gently open the layers of paper and gently remove the flowers preferably with a pair of tweezers. You can use your fingers but be very careful. They are very delicate now.

",How to Press Flowers4," Microwave presses are available for purchase, but you can easily make one yourself. Press the flowers between two ceramic tiles held together with rubber bands.









Don't place a regular flower press in the microwave. This could start a fire.
You may microwave a book flower press, but only if you're sure the book does not have metal parts.

, Use printer paper or a coffee filter if you wish.









Since the flowers will dry quickly in the microwave, there is no need for extra blotter paper in this method.

, Using the directions outlined above, choose flowers to lay flat or arrange artistically. You are only limited by the size of the tile.








, Add a second sheet of paper on top of the flower arrangement, followed by a piece of cardboard, followed by the second tile. Secure the press with two rubber bands.








, Start by microwaving it on low for a minute, then open the press and check the results. Continue microwaving in short increments until the flowers are completely pressed and dry.

Collect some fresh flowers.,
Cut off the stems of each flower.,
Cut your string.,
Thread the needle.,
String the first flower.,
String the remaining flowers.,
Finish the lei.",How to Make a Lei1," A lei can be made from any kind of fresh flowers — plumeria, roses, daisies and carnations are all popular choices — but you can choose any blooms, leaves or ferns from your garden.









You'll find it easier to make a lei from medium-sized flowers with sturdy stems and durable petals. Flowers with delicate petals that fall off or bruise easily are not a good choice.
To make one, single-strand 40"" lei you will need approximately 50 blossoms. Try to pick each flower at the base of its stem to make sure the stamen remains intact.;
, Leave about 1/4 - 1/2 inch left.








, Cut a piece of thread, cotton string or fishing line 100"" in length. Doubled over, this allows for a 40-inch lei with 5 inches at each end for tying together when you are finished.








, Take a large needle and thread the length of string through the eye, until it is doubled over. Tie the two ends of the string together to form a knot — this will act as a stopper for the threaded flowers.









Make sure to leave 4 or 5 inches of string hanging below the knot — this will be necessary to tie the lei once it's finished,
In Hawaii, they use a 12'' to 18'' steel lei needle to string the flowers — so if you can get your hands on one of these, that's great. Otherwise, any large needle will do., Take your first flower and pass the needle straight through the center of the face of the flower, all the way through to the back. Gently push the flower down along the string.









Alternatively, you can pass the needle up through the stem and out through the center of the flower. Which method you choose will depend on the type of flower you're working with.
Be very gentle when pushing the flower down the string — if you push too forcefully you could damage the flower or even rip it off.

, Continue to string the remaining blooms in the same fashion, passing the needle through the face or stem of each flower. You can have all of the flowers facing the same direction, or alternate for added texture.









Some lei-makers prefer to slide blossoms to the end in groups of five or so, which accelerates the process but can cause wear and tear on the flowers if you're not careful.
If you're working with different colored flowers, it's a good idea to separate them out into different bundles — this will allow you to work more quickly and avoid mixing up the order of the colors.
Continue adding flowers until the lei is approximately 40"" in length. Hold it up around your neck in front of a mirror to ensure that you're happy with the number and placement of the flowers.

, When you've finished stringing all of the flowers, adjust the placement of the first and last flowers so they're nested together, and then tie the ends of the string in a square knot.









Leave the hanging ends of your knot in place until just before you present the lei – this way you can hold it by these strings and avoid touching the flowers.
Cut off the excess string and, if you like, add some curling ribbon for extra adornment. Now your lei is ready to be presented to its recipient!
A lei can be worn more than once. Store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator between uses to keep it fresh. Mist lightly with water to keep it hydrated.

Fold the crepe paper.,
Thread the needle.,
Pinch the folded paper between your fingers and pass the needle through the center.,
Twist the crepe paper.,
Repeat with a second color of crepe paper.,
Finish the lei.",How to Make a Lei2," To make a crepe paper lei, you will need strips of colored crepe paper ( 20 long and 2 wide) — the number of strips you need will depend on how long you want your finished lei to be. You will also need a needle and thread and a pair of scissors.








, Take one strip of crepe paper and fold it, accordion-style, along the entire length. Each fold should be about 1/4 inch in length.








, Pass the thread through the eye of the needle, double it and tie a knot at the end. You'll need approximately two yards of thread, but again this will depend on how long your want your finished lei to be.








, Push the crepe paper to the end of the string.








, Use your hands to open the threaded piece of crepe paper slightly, then twist it clockwise to form flower-shaped twirls. Try to keep the crepe paper twisted as tightly as possible — this will produce a fuller-looking lei.








, Take a second strip of crepe paper, in a different color (or the same color, if you prefer) and repeat the process of folding, threading and twisting. Keep going with each piece of crepe paper until you have filled the thread.








, Once you have filled the thread with twisted crepe paper (this may take up to an hour, depending on how tightly packed the twists are), pass the needle through the crepe paper at the opposite end and tie a knot to close the lei. Cut off the excess string.








"
"
Gather your materials.,
Fold the dollar bills.,
Make the flowers.,
Assemble the lei.",How to Make a Lei3," To make a money lei, you will need 50 crisp and new one dollar bills, a collection of colored beads, two 50 inch lengths of thread, a glue stick and twenty small binder clips.








, Take a dollar bill and fold it in half, right down the middle. Make sure the two edges are perfectly aligned.









Set the folded bill on the table in front of you, then fold back one of the edges, just to the edge of the white margin. Flip the bill over and do the same of the other side.
Continue folding each half of the bill, accordion-style, until you reach the center. Make sure each fold is the same size and that you press it firmly to get a crisp edge.

, Once you have finished the accordion folding, the dollar bill should look like a single, rectangular strip. Fold the strip in half, down the middle.









Open the folded strip so it forms a ""V"" shape. Take your glue stick and rub a little glue on the inside edges of both sides of the V. Don't take the glue all the way to the center though, only glue the top half on each side.
Press the two glued sides of the V together and use one of the binder clips to hold it in place while the glue dries.
Pull out the outside edges of the V, until the bill forms a circular, flower shape. Glue the two outside edges of the flower together (leaving the lower section glue-free) and secure with a binder clip.
Repeat this process for the 49 remaining dollar bills — these will be the money flowers for your lei.

, Once the glue on the money flowers has dried, you are ready to assemble your lei. Take your two pieces of string and tie them together at one end.









Thread three beads (in any color combination you like) onto the double layer of string, then take one of the money flowers, remove the binder clips and pass the strings through the center.
Continue in this fashion, adding three beads and then a flower until you have used up all of the money and the lei is full. Tie both ends of the string together to close the lei."

Display.",How to Arrange Flowers in a Large Vase," Leaves rot in water and will cause the water to smell.


If you are using a flower with thorns on the stems like roses, carefully remove the thorns with either the blade of the scissors or vegetable knife. The thorns can pierce other stems and flowers causing them to wilt.
If any of the bottom flowers are looking wilted or tired, pinch them off with your fingers.;
, Cut off the stems of three monstera leaves.


With the other five leaves, cut the stems to about 30 centimeter (11.8 in).

, Ensure that your vase is clean. Fill with fresh cold water and add a small dash of household bleach to keep it nice and fresh. It may seem unlikely but it really works!

,, Using the scissors cut the stems on an angle, to enable maximum water absorption.


If the flowers you are using have a woody stem like roses, slightly split the stems about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) up the middle.
Cut the flowers to stand double the height of the vase. Measure your flowers against your tape measure, from the end of the stem to the tip of the flower.

, Arrange 20 flowers ensuring they are the same height and an even spread. With the last 10 flowers, cut 10 centimeter (3.9 in) off the bottom and feed them in around the outside of the vase. This will make it look like the flowers are bursting out of the vase.

, Place your vase in the middle of a table.

Make sure your pot has holes for draining.,
Plant the focal plant or biggest plant first.,
Fill in the rest of the pot with the other plants.,
Fill in the rest of the container with potting mix.,
Water the plants thoroughly.",How to Arrange Flower Pots," The first step in creating a successful arrangement is knowing where it’s going. Once you’ve chosen a spot, you’ll have a better idea of what kind of plants you need. For example, if it is a spacious area, you can put large pots with tall plants like elephant ear or agave. If you want to work with hanging plants to line a porch, try a sweet potato vine or wishbone flower.


You also want to consider whether the area you are placing your pots in gets lots of sun or very little, as you will have to place different types of plants in those areas.;
, The colors in the area you want to place your pots are likely going to affect the color of the plants you put into your arrangement. For example, if you have a red door, maybe a pot with deep purples and whites would be complementary for that area. It will stand out against the red of the door and really bring the eye of any visitor to that space. Or, if you are placing an arrangement on your deck, which is deep brown, any bright color like yellows or oranges will appear striking against the wood.


You can also play with the colors of your pots. Try mixing up the lighter and darker shades of some terracotta pots or mixing white and black pots for a chic and sophisticated look.

, Once you know where you are going to place the plants, you can figure out the shape of the arrangement. This should be where you decide the size of the plants and how they’ll fit together in a pot.


There are three basic kinds of plants - tall/upright, broad/bushy, and trailing. Tall or upright plants are going to continuously grow upwards, while broad/bushy plants are going to grow outward. Trailing plants, on the other hand, will spill out over the sides of the pot in every direction.
Think about how often you’ll be able to prune or cut down the plants before you decide which ones you’d like to have in your pots.

, Similar to choosing the size and growing pattern of a plant, it’s important to know which plants grow well where. For example, an area that gets a lot of sun is going to need plants that are able to survive direct light. You don’t want a pot mixed with plants that need direct light along with plants that need shade, this will make keeping the plants alive and healthy very difficult. Instead, you need to match up growing conditions before placing them.Consider how much light or shade a plant needs, as well as the amount of water, and the condition of the soil.
Some good plants to grow in partially shaded areas are rhododendrons, hydrangeas, or bay laurel. If you are planning to place your pots in a space with direct sunlight, try rock rose, silver queen, and lavender.
Look for plants labeled as “annuals,” or “bedding plants,” as these are the plants that will survive a whole season rather than just a few weeks., If you want a solid pop of color, try filling a pot with just one type and color of a plant. This adds a bright spot to any area while keeping a clean and uniform look. You can also try filling a pot with one single plant, like a fern, which makes a statement without being over-the-top.Using a single type of plant is great in areas where you want to keep symmetry, like on the sides of a front door or along a fence or walkway.

, If you want some diversity in your pot while still maintaining the same shape and texture, putting in different colors of the same plant can help add variety. Some flowers like petunias, impatiens, or zinnias will even come in multipacks which makes mixing up colors easy.


If you want to mix up your own arrangement, try choosing complementary colors like reds and purples, or blues and yellows. You can also choose similar colors like pinks and reds for a clean look.

, The most striking arrangements have a variety of each type of plant. For example, a tall plant like a dracaena, a bushy plant like a begonia, and a trailing plant like a morning glory. The most common way to put together this arrangement is to place the tall plant in the middle and surround it with both trailing and bushy plants that are similar in height and width.These arrangements usually contain one focal plant, which could include plants with striking foliage, like a coleus, or trailing plants like the ivy geranium. However, most focal plants should be the largest component in a pot and sit higher than the other plants. Once you’ve chosen your focal plant you can build the rest of the arrangement around it.
When mixing up different kinds of plants for one pot, make sure you keep all the plants with similar watering/sunlight needs together.

, Don’t just mix up the colors, but try to use a variety of foliage as well. Every plant has different leaves with an assortment of textures. Putting together plants with smooth leaves, rough leaves, or even the near artificial look and texture of a rubber plant adds a lot of exciting variation to an arrangement.


You can also mix up the sizes of the leaves and the colors.

, To prevent overwatering your plants, make sure to get a pot with holes or a detachable bottom that will allow water to filter through. This will help keep your plants hydrated as well as prevent root rot.


You can also try placing a layer of gravel along the bottom, or broken terracotta or Styrofoam packing peanuts to promote drainage., As this plant is likely to take up the most space, it’s best to put this into the pot first. You can either put your focal plant in the middle of the pot and place the other plants around it. Or you can place this plant in the back with other larger plants and put smaller ones up front.

, Once you’ve planted the focal plant you can fill in the pot with your other plants. How you want to place them is up to you, however, it’s best to keep those of a similar size placed together. You should also keep trailing plants closer to the edge of the pot as they are going to grow over everything else if they’re in the middle.

, You can do this by pouring the soil around the plants and arranging it using a garden trowel. When you’re finished, the surface of the soil should be 1” to 2” below the lip of the pot. Be careful not to pack the soil too tightly, though, as it will make it difficult for the plant's roots to grow.

, After you’ve planted everything, make sure to water the plants. You should try to water at the base rather than over the leaves. Once you see water come out the bottom, you should stop watering. Also, if the soil sinks, simply add more soil and water the plants again.

2.3 ounces of lye (sodium hydroxide)
6.1 ounces of distilled water
4.8 ounces of 76 degree melt coconut oil
4.8 ounces of palm oil
6.4 ounces of olive oil (pomace, not virgin);
, To make natural soap from scratch using the cold process method, you will need:


Scale that measures to the tenth of an ounce
Two commercial-grade heat-resistant pitchers (2 qt. capacity is great for beginners)
Two stainless-steel long-handled serving spoons
Digital food thermometer
8 oz. disposable plastic cup
Stick blender (also known as an immersion blender)
Rubber spatula
Set of measuring spoons

, Once you have prepared your soap mixture, you will need to pour it into a mold to allow it to set. To make 4 rectangular bars of soap that are 1"" thick, use a mold that measures approximately 4""L x 4""W x 3""H.

When it comes to a mold, a cardboard baby-shoe box with a lid is perfect. Just remember to line the box with freezer paper to prevent your soap batter from soaking into the box. If you are making a larger quantity of soap, a cardboard pizza box lined with wax paper will also do the trick.
Alternatively, you can use a cake tray lined with freezer paper, or a silicone mold (which doesn't require any freezer/wax paper). If you want to make individual, round soaps instead of bars, you can set aside a muffin or cupcake tin specifically for soap-making. Just be aware that lye is incredibly caustic and will ruin baking pans, especially if they're not protected (wax paper isn't sufficient, and the wax may melt due to the hot soap; freezer paper is thicker and will do a better job).
You will also need a couple of old blankets or towels to wrap around the mold while the soap sets.

, Making soap at home is more dangerous than one might think, so it's important to take a number of safety precautions.


When you mix lye with water (as you will be doing during the soap-making process) the mixture becomes very hot and gives off a fume-ridden steam. Therefore, it's important that you mix the lye in a well-ventilated area and wear safety goggles throughout the process.
Lye is also an extremely caustic substance, so you also need to be very careful to avoid getting it on the skin. As a precaution, wear latex gloves during the soap-making process and keep the lye mixture well out of reach of children and animals.
Done incorrectly, making soap can result in the ruining of countertops, cabinets, floors, furniture, etc. Additionally, failure to follow instructions to the letter can result in injury, including blindness and burns. Take care to follow all safety guidelines as you work.

, The first step in the cold process soap-making is to mix the lye and water.


Place the disposable plastic cup on the scales and set it to zero. Accurately measure the correct amount of lye (2.3 oz) into the cup, then set it aside.
Place one of the pitchers on the scale and set it to zero. Measure 6.1 oz of distilled water.
In a well-ventilated place, slowly add the lye to the pitcher containing the distilled water. Use one of the long-handled serving spoons to slowly mix the two.
The water and lye mixture will get very hot and start to steam. Don't inhale the fumes. Once the water and lye are well-combined, set the pitcher aside to cool.

, The next step in the process is to combine and melt the selection of oils used in your natural soap.

Place the second pitcher on the scales and set the scales to zero. Add 4.8 oz of coconut oil, then reset the scale to zero. Add 4.8 oz of palm oil, the reset the scale to zero. Finally, add 6.4 oz of olive oil.
Heat the oils in a microwave or over a saucepan of water until melted. Stir them well to combine.

, The next step is a little tricky. The lye and oil mixtures are not easily combined, so they must be brought to a similar temperature before you can mix them.


Use your digital food thermometer to periodically check the temperature of both the lye and soap mixtures. When they have both cooled to a temperature of between 100 and 105 degrees F, they are ready to be mixed.
However, some people do not use a thermometer to check temperatures at all, they simply place a hand on the outside of each pitcher and go by feel).
Set the lye pitcher in the kitchen sink and slowly pour the oils into the lye pitcher. Use the rubber spatula to scrape all of the oil from the sides and bottom of the mixture.

, Take your stick blender, submerge it in the lye and oil mixture and pulse for several seconds. Use the blender to stir the mixture a little, then pulse again.

Alternate between stirring and short bursts of pulsing (periodically scraping down the sides and bottom of the pitcher with the rubber spatula) until the mixture begins to resemble a thick pancake batter. This should take about three minutes.
Alternatively, you can beat the mixture using a handheld whisk (if you want to experience soap-making as it was in the old days) however it can take a very long time and lots of elbow grease to achieve the correct consistency this way.

, Continue pulsing and stirring the soap mixture until it reaches ""trace"" -- this is a sign that the oils and lye have emulsified, which means that the soap mixture is ready.

To test if your soap mixture has reached trace, dip a rubber spatula in the mixture, hold it above the pitcher, then let the soap mix dribble back in. If it sits on top of the rest of the mixture for a couple of seconds before sinking back in (leaving a ""trace"" behind), the soap mix has emulsified.
Once your soap mixture reaches this point, you will quickly need to add in any scented oils, herbs or colorings that you intend to use, before the soap becomes too thick and unworkable. Once these items have been added, you can pour the soap mix into the prepared mold.
Popular additions include 100% essential oils like lavender, chamomile, cinnamon and vanilla oil; drops of natural or synthetic food coloring to give a subtle or vibrant color to your soap; dried herbs and flowers such as lavender, sage, basil, mint and orange or lemon zest; and grains like ground oatmeal or wheat germ to give your soap texture. Experiment with different combinations to make your own unique soap!

, Use the rubber spatula to pour the soap mix into the mold. Make sure it is spread in an even layer.


Replace the lid on the mold (whether it's the shoebox lid, pizza box lid, or a second baking tray) and wrap the box with the old towels or blankets.
This will help to keep the heat inside, allowing the chemical reaction to take place.

, The next day, remove the towel from around the mold and remove the lid. The soap should be firm and cool to the touch.

If your natural soap shows any signs of liquid pockets, an oily, separated layer on the top, or patches of crusty dry white crud (although, a thin, white, ""ashy"" dusting on top is most likely not a concern), do not use the soap. It most likely has un-reacted lye in it.
Try again, making sure to mix the lye and oil mixture thoroughly, and to scrape the sides of your pitcher often with the spatula.

, If your soap appears to be uniform and firm, you can cut it with a knife (provided it's not too thick).

Be careful when cutting the soap -- apply even pressure, and keep your fingers out of the way!
Soap can also be cut with a bench scraping tool (found in a kitchen shop) or even with a guitar string in the same manner that you would use a wire cheese slicer.

, After you've cut the soap bars, you need to set them aside to cure for approximately a month before you can use them.

Stand the bars upright on brown paper covered surface, or on a cookie cooling rack in a cool location -- it's important for air to circulate around the bars.
Leave them for 4 weeks to harden. After the minimum 4 week cure, you can finally try out your natural soap. Hopefully, you will find your natural soap to be worth the wait!

Pour the soap into dispensers.",How to Make Natural Liquid Soap1," You can use any bar you like. The finished product will inherit its properties (like scent) from the bar you choose, so make sure that you choose one that you like. Creating liquid soap from a bar of soap is much faster and safer than making soap from scratch, as you will not have to work directly with any lyes.


Your finished product will only be as “natural” as the bar of soap you choose. When specifically trying to make natural soap, make sure you have read the ingredients list on the bar you are using.;
, The more finely you grate the soap, the easier it will be to combine it with water. A conventional kitchen grater will get the job done just fine. If you use a grater that you use in your kitchen for food, make sure that you rinse it thoroughly before using it again.

, Use about 950 grams of water (about 4 cups) for an average sized bar of soap. You may alter the amount slightly depending on how thick you want the resulting soap to be. Using substantially less water, about 350g, you can create a cream-like soap that can be used for shaving. You can vary the water amount depending on the precise thickness you want, using the above amounts as a guideline.

,


It will take about 15 minutes for the soap and water to combine. When it is done, it should have a frothy, soupy look.
Before moving on, let the mixture cool for about 15 minutes. Repeat this entire step if the mixture is becoming separated.

, You can choose to skip this step if you do not want to add any additional scents to your soap. If you do want to add essential oils to create your own scent, it is best to start with with a neutral, scentless soap.


Essential oils are very strong; a few drops is all you need. Simply put a few drops into the mixture, and stir thoroughly. , It takes about between a half and full day for the soap to fully “gel.” You can leave the soap in the same pan you used before, or transfer it to another container. If you shake the soap and it retains its gel-like consistency, it is ready to use.
Make sure you add essential oils only after the soap has cooled and sat for 24 hours.

, The soap will be ready to use immediately.


When creating large amounts of soap that you might not use all at once, make sure that you store the excess in a clean, sealed container.

Use a bar of facial soap to make a liquid soap you can use on your face.
Use a bar of antibacterial soap to make a good cleansing hand soap to use in your kitchen or bathroom.
Use a bar of moisturizing soap to make a liquid soap you can use as body wash.
Use unscented soap if you want to add your own scent to create customized liquid soap.;
, Use a fine cheese grater to grate the entire bar of soap into a bowl. Use the finest grater you have so that when it's time for the soap to melt, the process goes more quickly. You can cut the soap into chunks if that helps you grate it more easily.


You should end up with about 1 cup (229 g) of soap flakes. If you have less, grate a second bar of soap.
This recipe can easily be doubled or tripled if you want to make a lot of liquid soap. It makes a great gift, especially when it's stored in pretty jars.

, Boil 1 cup (235 ml) of water, then pour into a blender along with the grated soap. Whip the water and soap until it takes on the consistency of paste.


Making soap in your blender may leave a residue that's hard to clean out, so if you'd prefer not to use it, you can make your soap on the stove instead. Simply add the soap flakes to the water once it has started to boil on your stove.
Try making soap in the microwave as another alternative. Place a cup of water in a microwave safe dish, bring it to a boil in the microwave, add the flakes, and let them sit for a few minutes to melt. Place the dish back in the microwave and heat it up in 30-second increments if it needs more heat.

, Glycerin acts as a moisturizer for the skin, making liquid soap a little gentler on your body than regular bar soap. Mix in 1 tsp. (5 g) glycerin, stirring until it is thoroughly combined.

Mix in honey or lotion to add moisture.
Stir in a few drops of essential oil to scent the soap.
Add 10 to 20 drops each of tea tree and lavender essential oils to make your soap naturally antibacterial.
Use some natural food coloring to change the color. Avoid using standard chemical-based coloring, since it's not good for your skin to absorb.

, Continue to whip the mixture in the blender once it has thoroughly cooled. Gradually pour water into the mixture as it whips until your soap is an ideal consistency. If you're not using a blender, just stir in the water and whisk it vigorously., Once it has completely cooled, you can pour it into jars or pump containers using a funnel. If you have a large amount of soap, put whatever doesn't fit in your containers into a large bottle or jug. Keep the remaining soap on hand to use when refilling your smaller bottles.

11 oz. potassium hydroxide flakes
33 oz. distilled water
24 oz. coconut oil
10 oz. olive oil
10 oz. castor oil

, When you work with lye, you need to wear safety gear and set up your work area properly. Plan to work in a well-ventilated room with good lighting so you can see what you're doing. You'll need the following supplies:


A crock pot
Plastic or glass measuring bowls
Kitchen scale
Stick blender
Gloves and protective goggles

, Weigh the oils and place them in the crock pot on low heat. Make sure you add the exact amount specified for each oil; adding more or less will throw off the recipe.

, Put on your protective gear and make sure the window is open. Weigh the distilled water in a large bowl. Weigh the lye in a separate bowl, then add it to the water. Stir it constantly as you pour it in.Make sure you add the lye to the water, and not the other way around! Adding water to lye causes a dangerous reaction.

, Pour the solution into the crockpot slowly, making sure none splashes back onto your skin. Use the stick blender to blend the lye with the oils to make sure they get thoroughly combined.


As you blend the liquids, the mixture will begin to thicken. Continue stirring until it reaches trace, which happens when the mixture gets thick enough that you can run a spoon through it and see the line in its wake.
The mixture will continue to thicken into a paste., Continue cooking the mixture on low for about six hours, checking it every 30 minutes to break it up with a spoon. The paste is finished cooking when you can dissolve one ounce of paste in two ounces of boiling water and it comes out clear, rather than milky. If your test comes out milky, keep cooking.

, You should have about a pound of paste after it's finished cooking; weight it just to make sure, then put it back in the crock pot. Add 33 oz. of distilled water to the paste to dilute it. It may take a few hours for the paste to get completely dissolved into the water.

, Use your favorite essential oil and a natural food coloring to add a special scent and color to your soap once it has been diluted.

, Pour the soap into jars you can seal, since you'll have a lot more than you can use at one time. Pour the soap you want to use into a soap bottle with a pump dispenser.

Add regular dish soap to the dishwasher’s detergent cup.,
Fill the cup with baking soda.,
Top off the cup with salt.,
Run the dishwasher as you normally would.",How to Make Homemade Dishwasher Soap1," If you find out that you’re out of dishwashing detergent when the dishwasher’s already full, start by adding three or four drops of regular dishwashing soap to the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Any brand or type of dish soap will work as long as it’s a liquid.If you’re cleaning a particularly dirty load of dishes, you may want to bump the soap up to four or five drops.;
, After you’ve placed the dish soap in the washer’s detergent cup, add baking soda. You’ll want to pour enough baking soda into the detergent cup to fill it up approximately ⅔ full.To avoid spilling baking soda all over the interior of the dishwasher, use a spoon to carefully fill the detergent cup rather than pouring the baking soda straight from the box.

, Once the dish soap and baking soda are in the detergent cup, reach for a container of regular table salt. Add enough salt to the dish soap and baking soda mixture to completely fill the detergent cup.If you only have sea or kosher salt, you can substitute either for the table salt.

, When you’ve completely filled the detergent cup with the mixture, close the compartment. Set and run your dishwasher as you usually do, and when the cycle is done, you’ll have clean, sparkling dishes without any suds overflow.Not only is this dishwasher detergent easy to make, it’s cheaper than store-bought versions. Most people usually have dish soap, baking soda, and salt in their kitchen, so it’s a convenient alternative to the usual dishwasher detergent.

Combine the borax, washing soda, citric acid, and kosher salt.,
Place in a jar or jug with a lid.,
Fill the detergent cup in your dishwasher with the mixture.",How to Make Homemade Dishwasher Soap2," Add  1 cup (237 g) of borax, 1 cup (237 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (118. 5 g) of citric acid, and ½ cup (124 g) of kosher salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it is well blended.Borax is a natural mineral that is often used in cleaning products. You can find it at most grocery and big box stores in the aisle where laundry or cleaning products are sold.
Washing soda is a water-soluble sodium salt of carbonic acid that works as a natural cleaner or cleaning booster. You can find it at many grocery and big box stores in the laundry or cleaning products aisle. If you can’t find it locally, it’s also available at online stores.
Citric acid is a natural compound found in citrus fruits that is an ideal disinfectant in cleaning products. You can find it in many grocery stores where canning or brewing supplies are sold, or at health food stores and pharmacies.

, Once the detergent mixture is fully combined, transfer it from the bowl or pot to a jar or jug with an airtight lid. To avoid spilling the detergent all over your work surface, you may find it easier to pour the mixture into the container with a funnel.The detergent may clump if it’s exposed to moisture, so try to keep in a cool, dark closet or pantry with low humidity.

, When you’re ready to wash a load of dishes, take 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture and place it in the detergent cup in your dishwasher. Run the dishwasher as you normally would.The recipe should make enough detergent for 48 loads of dishes.

Stir the mixture so all of the ingredients are well combined.If you don’t have sea salt, you can substitute kosher salt.

, When the detergent ingredients are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a jar or other container. Make sure to choose a container with an airtight lid because the borax-free detergent is especially prone to clumping when exposed to high humidity.If you live in an area with high humidity, place 2 tablespoons (30 g) of powdered bentonite clay inside a piece of cheesecloth or pantyhose. Secure the fabric so the clay won’t spill out, and throw the packaged clay into your container of detergent. The clay will absorb the excess moisture so the detergent doesn’t clump.

, When you need to wash a load of dishes, place 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Set the dishwasher as you normally would, and allow the cycle to run."

Stir the mixture with a spoon until it begins to clump together.You can substitute baking soda for the washing soda.
When you mix in the vinegar, there may be some slight fizzing. That is normal.

, Once the mixture is fully mixed and clumped together, transfer it to two ice cube trays. Load the mixture into the compartments, pressing down on it to create tightly packed cubes.If you pack the trays the right way, you’ll use up all of the detergent mixture.

, The tabs need to dry so they’re fully hard before you use them. Place the trays in a dry, sunny area, and let them dry for at least 24 hours., When the tabs are dry, carefully remove them from the ice cube trays. Place them in a jar or other container with a lid, and keep them in a cool, dry location.Make sure that the lid fits tightly on the jar that’s holding the detergent tabs. You want the container to be airtight.

, When you’re ready to wash some dishes, take one tab from the jar and place it in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Run your dishwasher as you normally would for a load of clean dishes.If you’re washing a particularly dirty load of dishes, you can add three drops of dishwashing liquid into the detergent cup with the tab to boost the cleaning power.

",How to Make a Hanging Cloud1," How long the wires are will depend on how big you want your cloud to be. You will be folding these wires into a ring, so keep this in mind. Make sure that all of the wires are the same length.;
, Take your first wire, and overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Twist the ends to hold the ring together. Repeat this step for the other wires.

, Hold one right horizontally. Hold the other ring above it, vertically. Slight the vertical ring into the horizontal one halfway. Your two rings will make a cross.

, You can do this by putting beads of hot glue on the joints between the two rings. You can also tie the joints together with some more wire. Be sure to tuck any sharp ends into the wire ""orb.""

, Slip the third ring over your frame at a left angle. Secure it to the joints between the other rings with hot glue or more wire. Repeat this step with the fourth ring, but insert it at a right angle. These two new rings should form an X.

, Pull off a long strip of polyester stuffing. Draw a squiggle of hot glue across it, then wrap it over your frame. Make sure that it covers at least two rings.


Work quickly. Hot glue sets fast.

, Keep doing this until most of your frame is covered. Be careful not to wrap the frame too tightly, or your will distort it.

, Once you have most of your cloud covered, pull out smaller tufts of polyester. Draw a swirl of hot glue, then press it against the cloud.

, If your cloud looks too much like a ball, gently pull here and there on the tufts to bring them out. This will make your orb look more lumpy and cloud–like than like cotton candy. Don't pull too much, however, of the polyester stuffing won't hold together.

, Cut a long piece of fishing line. Dig through your cloud until you find a joint between two wire rings. Tie the fishing line to the joint.

, Get some tape and tape your hanging cloud to the ceiling. For a stronger hold, screw a ceiling hook into your ceiling. Tie a loop into the end of the fishing line. Slip the loop over the ceiling hook.

Draw a swirl of hot glue, then press the stuffing against the lantern.Work quickly. Hot glue sets up fast.

, Alternate between large, small, and medium-sized clumps. Be sure to cover the top and bottom of the lanterns as well.

, This time, apply the hot glue directly onto the lantern, then quickly press the stuffing into the glue. If you glued multiple lanterns together, be sure to fill the seams between the lanterns., Gently pull on the polyester tufts until the cloud is fluffy. Make some of the tufts larger than others. This will make your cloud look more cloud-like and less like cotton candy., For something quick and easy, tuck a battery-operated LED light into the lantern.Alternatively, you can fill the lantern with white string lights. If you use the icicle kind, you can even pull the strands out through the bottom of the cloud to make it look like rain.Make sure that the lights doesn't generate too much heat and never leave them unattended., Dig through the the fluff until you find the top hanging wire of your lantern. Tie some fishing line to it. If you attached multiple lanterns together, be sure to tie some fishing line to each one. Cover the gap at the top of the lantern back up when you are done., Insert some hooks into the ceiling. Tie small loops into the end of your fishing line. Slip the loops over the hooks. You will need one hook per lantern. This means that if your cloud is made from three lanterns, you will need three hooks.

Attach the cloud to the ceiling.",How to Make a Hanging Cloud3," You can find polyester stuffing in craft stores and fabric shops. This method is suitable for smaller clouds about the size of your hand.

, Hold the stuffing between your hangs and tug on it at various places. Pull some chunks out more than others., A little bit of stuffing goes a long way, so your cloud can get up to twice its size. Avoid making it too large, however, or it won't hold its shape. For a more realistic cloud, consider making the bottom flatter and less fluffy than the top and sides.

, Use a pair of wire cutters to cut a short piece of wire. You can also use a short piece of white pipe cleaner. Wrap the wire around a pen or pencil to make a coil, then pull it off., Gently pull the coil apart first, so that it is more like a spring. Use a piece of pliers to twist the wire at the end of the coil into a small loop. If you are using a pipe cleaner, you can use a pencil instead., Keep twisting it, like a screw, until just the looped end is sticking out. This will help anchor the string into your cloud., The best type of string would be clear thread or fishing line, but you can use regular thread as well. How long you cut the string depends on how far down from the ceiling you want the cloud to hang.

, These clouds are pretty light, so you can tape the other end of the string to the ceiling.If you want a stronger hold, screw a hook into the ceiling. Tie the end of the string into a loop, then slip the loop over the hook.

,,,,,,


You can also use leftover wax from candles that have been used up. Place the old candle wax in a small pan, and place that pan in a larger pan of simmering water. Use a thermometer to gauge when the wax has reached about 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius).
Also use this method if you have bought paraffin wax flakes.

,, Make sure to do this immediately after the wax has melted.

Color the wax.,
Add fragrance.,
Pour the candle.,
Let the candle cure.",How to Make a Candle1," There are a few wax options for making candles, and beeswax, soy, and paraffin are among the most popular. Beeswax candles are a natural air purifier, but the wax has a high melting point and must be mixed half and half with an oil, such as palm, to lower the melting point.Soy is a great vegetable wax option for candles, and is readily available online or at craft stores.
Paraffin wax is a traditional choice for candles, but paraffin is a petroleum product and can contribute to poor air quality.
Another option is using leftover wax from other candles. Store the wax from candles you burn until you have enough to make a new candle.
Two cups (227.5grams) of wax will yield an eight-ounce candle.;
, Along with your wax, you will also need a wick, jar, double boiler, and a clean, dry towel. For a scented or colored candle, you’ll also need dye and fragrance.


Be sure to buy lead-free wicks. If your wick isn’t attached to a metal base (called a tab or sustainer), be sure to purchase one separately.
For the jar, you can use a recycled candle jar, mason jar, cleaned out glass jar from the kitchen (like a salsa jar), or even an old metal tin.
You’ll also need something to stir the wax and secure the wick tab in place, such as a spoon, chopstick, or skewer. You can also use a clothespin or pencil to secure the wick in place while the candle sets.
For scented candles, you can either use your favorite essential oils or fragrance oil. For colored candles, you can purchase dye chips, blocks, or liquid.Scents and dyes can be found at most craft stores or candle suppliers.

, Fill the bottom of the double boiler with about an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the top portion of the double boiler in position and put in your wax. Heat it over medium heat.


If your wax came in a large block, cut it into smaller chunks before melting it.
Always use the double boiler method to melt wax, and never try to melt the wax faster at a higher temperature. Wax has a low flash point and can catch fire.If you don’t have a double boiler, you can place a large, heat-safe glass bowl on top of a metal saucepan and use it as the top portion of the double boiler.

, As the wax melts, hold the wick by the base and dip the wick in and out of the wax quickly.Straighten the wick and allow the wax to dry. This will keep the wick straight and make it easier to position in the bottom of the candle jar.

, Dip the base of the wick into the wax, pull it out, and then position the wick base in the bottom center of your candle jar. Use a spoon handle, chopstick, or skewer to press it down until the wax dries, holding the wick in place.Lay a clothespin, chopstick, pencil, or skewer across the rim of the candle jar. If you’re using a clothespin, simply clamp the wick into place so it is straight and centered. If you’re using a chopstick, wrap the excess wick around the chopstick to keep it in place, straight, and centered.

, Stir the wax every so often as it melts. As it’s continuing to melt, chop your dye block or chips into small chunks (if you’re using them). Consult the manufacturer’s instructions regarding how much to use based on the amount and type of wax you’re using.


Once all the wax has fully melted and it’s become a clear liquid, remove it from the heat. Add in the dye and stir until the dye has melted and been dispersed evenly throughout the wax.

, Once your wax is off the heat and dyed, allow it to cool for 20 to 30 minutes before pouring your candle or adding fragrance. This will prevent the wax from cracking down the center of the candle, and prevent the fragrance from burning off.For an eight-ounce candle, add about 10 to 15 drops of fragrance and stir to evenly distribute the oil., Pour the wax into the jar, making sure you don’t pour wax all over the top of the wick. Fill the jar, leaving about one-quarter inch of space between the top of the wax and rim of the jar (this may not be necessary if you don’t have that much wax). Wrap the jar with the clean towel. This will prevent the wax from cooling too quickly, and prevent the candle from shrinking and cracking., Let the candle set for about 24 hours. This will give the wax time to fully dry, and give the dye and fragrance time to bind with the wax.


Once your candle has cured, remove the towel, remove the clothespin, and trim the excess wick to one-half inch."

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your wax.,
Prepare your wick.,
Pour the candle.,
Fill the holes.,
Remove the candle from the mold.",How to Make a Candle2," Most of the supplies you need to make a pillar candle will be the same as what you used for a candle in a jar. The main difference is that because a pillar candle stands alone, you will need a mold instead of a jar. A proper candle mold is ideal, but you can also use:


An old juice box or milk carton with the top cut off. Be sure to clean it with soap and water before reusing it as a candle mold.
A clean, empty juice tin
A muffin tin (to make votive candles)

, Melt the wax in the double boiler. When it is fully melted, add the dye. After 20 minutes, add your fragrance. For a natural wax candle that isn’t dyed or scented, just set the wax aside for 20 to 30 minutes to cool.


You can determine how much wax you need based on the size of the jar you’re using.

, For a proper candle mold that has a hole in the bottom, thread the wick through the hole, then insert and tighten the wick screw. Apply putty to seal the hole and prevent wax from dripping out.With a DIY mold, dip the wick in wax to straighten it, then dip the base in the wax so you can glue it to the center base of the mold. Use a chopstick to press the wick tab into place.
For either mold type, keep the top of the wick in place with a clothespin or by wrapping it around a chopstick sitting across the mold rim.

, When the wax is ready and the wick in place, pour the wax into the mold. Leave a half-inch space at the top of the mold. Allow the wax to cool to a semi-solid state, then poke four relief holes around the wick with the chopstick.


These will allow air to escape, and prevent cracking. Allow the wax to cool to room temperature.

, In the double boiler, reheat the remaining wax to a liquid state again. When it has completely liquefied and is good and hot, pour the wax into the top of the mold to fill the relief holes. Allow the candle to cool and cure.

, When the candle has set and cooled, it should slide out of the mold easily. In the event that it doesn’t come out, refrigerate the candle for 15 minutes, then try again.Trim the wick to one-half inch.

, In a double boiler on medium heat, heat the shortening until it is completely liquid. Remove it from the heat.

, Chop your crayon of choice into small pieces. When the shortening is still hot, add the crayon and stir until the color has saturated the shortening. Allow the shortening to cool for about 10 minutes, then add your fragrance of choice.

, Prepare the wick like you did for the candle in a jar. When the shortening is ready, pour it into your jar, leaving about an inch of head space at the top. Let the shortening cool to room temperature and set.

Get your paws on some sheet wax.,
Draw your own design on tissue paper.",How to Decorate Candles," This one gets a bit messy (actually, most do), so place a layer of newspaper under your candle or somehow get it to a protected surface. Then you can start melting!


Light a different candle -- not the one that's getting decorated. Alternatively, you can use a lighter or a fireplace lighter as the source for your flame.






Start melting a colored crayon with your flame on top of the candle.The drops will make pretty shapes when falling on the candle.






Don't be afraid to mix colors, but do be afraid of burning yourself! Always be careful.





;
, You'll need a clean candle to do this, so wipe it down with rubbing alcohol first. Then with your acrylic paint and stamp, you're ready!Spread some acrylic paint on a piece of wax paper.






Dip your stamp into the paint and set the stamp down, paint side up. Are all parts of the stamp covered in an even layer of paint?






Roll your candle over the stamp slowly, ensuring that everything gets an even coating.






Keeping it on its side, allow it to dry for at least 20 minutes. Done!

If you're having problems, try mixing the paint with a bit of candle painting medium. It helps your paint stick to the wax.You could always just paint the candle freehand!



, If you've got a length of twine and you know how to make a loop, you're set. Just heat your candle for 30 seconds or so with a blow dryer -- this gets the wax warm, but not hot. Then press your twine into the wax in whatever design you like (loops and curly cues work best). If you have a bone folder, press it into place with that.Voila! Instant jazzed up candle.


When the candle burns down to about 1/2"" (1.25 cm) above the twine, remove it. That stuff will catch on fire like no one's business.







, This is possibly the easiest, prettiest, why-didn't-I-think-of-that?! method there is. Grab a handful of cute pushpins or snaps -- anything that will press into your candle and stick -- and start designing away! You can create words or shapes in any style you like. Even a simple border along the bottom will turn your boring old' dollar store candle into a piece from the Martha Stewart Living catalog.


Just be careful when burning the candle -- burning plastic isn't the scent you're probably going for.







, Since you're rolling out cookies about once a year, why not put those cutters to use? If you have some small ones lying around (letters, mayhaps?) grab that hammer from your toolbox (or someone else's toolbox because let's be honest) and lightly pound them into the side of your candle. It's about time you work on your engraving skills, you know?


You only want to pound in about 1/2"" (1.25 cm) or so. Just enough so that the cutter makes a very clear impression but that the candle isn't sawed in half!







, This is an especially great idea around springtime. Here's the gist:Apply non-flammable adhesive glue to a blade of grass.
Stick it on your candle, folding the bottom of the blade under the candle.
Repeat the process with more blades of grass of varying sizes and lengths, creating a natural pattern with varied spacing.

, Have some fruit lying around? If you're feeling extra artsy, create a base for your candles made out of lemon, lime, and oranges. Here's how:Slice your citrus fruit incredibly thin -- about 1/8"" (.3 cm) thick.
Arrange them on a wire cooling rack on a cookie sheet. Bake them at 250°F (121°C) for 2 hours (or until they're completely dry).
With a glue gun, connect the slices around your candle -- but not touching the candle itself. Overlap them as you see fit. Create designs with different fruits and different sized slices. They're beautiful alone, but they're exponentially beautiful together!

, This one is almost too easy. Anything that can go around a candle is fair game. Try candy canes, cinnamon sticks, or whatever you have lying around -- all you need is some double-sided tape!


If you don't have that, glue works too. Just glue them on the side of your candle, each one touching, creating a ring around your once boring candle. Just be careful when lighting -- some things burn, smoke, and can be very dangerous.

, You probably have some ribbon lying around from some other DIY project long forgotten about. Use the bits left over to spruce up your candles! All you need is some glue (tape would even work) and 5 free minutes in your afternoon. Just once around the candle adds flair, but if you have enough, think about showing off your bow tying skills, too.


Or you could combine methods and adhere the ribbon to the candle with pushpins or brads!
Don't light this candle. Or, if you do, remove the ribbon first. This is not an article on how to accidentally light your house on fire.

, There's a number of things you can do with thin slices of tree. Here's a few to get your creative juices flowing:

Cut up tissue paper and bust out your decoupage. With a foam brush, brush the decoupage over the tissue paper and allow it to dry. Instant fancy pattern! (Just don't light the candle. Ever.)
Glue paper onto your candle in the same fashion as the ribbon. You can also iron tissue paper (on a very low setting) to make it stiff and durable. But again, don't light the candle.

Print photos onto tissue paper. Wrap the printed tissue paper around the candle (photo side directly touching the candle) and hold it on with pushpins. Then, take out your heat gun or blow dryer and heat the candle until the wax paper is saturated. The photo will transfer onto your candle!Poke holes into a paper, creating a design. Place the candle in a clear jar and place the paper wrapped tightly around the jar. When the candle is lit, the design will glow!

, We're not out of good ideas yet! Take epsom salts, some beach sand, or your favorite glitter and dump a whole bunch in a baking tray. Then, cover your candle in modge podge and roll it in the baking tray, covering it as you'd like. Give it several hours to dry.You can also just cover the bottom or give it a fading effect -- having the covering be thinner and thinner toward the top of the candle. Try experimenting!






Cover part of your candle with a paper stencil before rolling. Then, when all is said and done (and dry), take off the paper stencil. Boom, inverted design!

, Did you know it comes in sheets?! Yep! Then all you need to do is cut out some shapes (those cookie cutters yet again! Who knew they would come in so handy?!) and put them on the sides of your candle. With a heat gun and some chopsticks (so your hands aren't directly in the line of fire), blast the wax onto the candle. It'll start melting and combine with the original wax of the candle. Almost too easy!Repeat this with as many shapes as you like, creating your own pattern. Different sized hearts or stars are a great addition to any candle, any time of year.

, Any chance you vaguely remember that tissue paper transfers? While you can rely on pre-made patterns, why not personalize your own?


All you need to do is draw your design on normal, white tissue paper. Then, hold it taut around the candle (you may want to pin it in place or use a drop of glue at the corners). Hold your heat gun or blow dryer to the candle, moving evenly back and forth for about 45 seconds. Be careful of your fingers! When you're finished, peel the paper off. Voila!

Decide on the type of candles you want to make.,
Familiarize yourself with the different types of candle wax.,
Choose an appropriate wick type.,
Create a list of the supplies you will need to make candles, which you can refer to when you purchase your supplies.,
Shop around.",How to Buy Candle Making Supplies," This will determine the candle making supplies you must purchase. Types of candles include:


Taper candles. These long, slender candles must be held upright in candle holders.
Pillar candles. These candles are broad enough to stand on their own, although they must be placed on a fire-safe plate for burning. They may have more than 1 wick and, although they are commonly cylindrical, they also come in a variety of other shapes, including square, oval and octagonal.
Poured candles. This type of candle may come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, as the candle wax takes the shape of whatever container it is poured into. Be sure to use fire-safe containers when you make candles using this technique.
Votive candles. These short, cylindrical candles are dropped into clear, glass votive containers for burning.
Tea lights. Tea lights are similar in shape to votives, only they are shorter and sit in aluminum cups for burning.;
, The type of wax you use will be determined by the type of candle you choose to make. Remember that different types of wax have different melting points - the lower the melting point, the softer the wax - and that they may each react differently to additives. Therefore, you should always read the manufacturer's instructions before purchasing candle wax.


Paraffin wax comes in a variety of melting points, and can therefore be used for everything from poured candles (low melting point) to molded candles (high melting point). Paraffin does not have natural oils, so it does not hold scented oils as well as other oil-based waxes.
Beeswax is a natural wax that, as its name suggests, comes from bee hives. It has a sweet scent, is slow burning, has a high melting point, and can be relatively expensive.
Tallow is a wax that is derived from animal fats. It is colorless and has a low melting point, but it tends to emit smoke and an unpleasant odor when burning.
Bayberry wax is made by boiling leaves from the bayberry plant. This wax has a sweet, floral scent, is naturally a shade of green and has a very low melting point. Bayberry wax can be very expensive in comparison to the other types of candle making wax.
Soy wax is relatively inexpensive, burns cleanly, has natural oils that blend well with additives and comes in a wide range of melting points. Therefore, soy wax may be used for any type of candle.
Gel wax is clear and odorless, and has a very high melting point. It is generally used for theme candles with embedded objects, as gel candles are typically clear. Gel wax does not have natural oils, and therefore may not mix well with additives, which easily give the gel an opaque appearance.

, The purpose of the wick is to draw fuel up from the candle and to the flame, and the type of wick you choose should be compatible with the type of candle you make, and the type of wax you choose.


Flat wicks are generally knitted or braided of 3 fibers. They burn consistently and are self-trimming, and are widely used for pillar and taper candles.
Square wicks are thicker than flat wicks, making them a good choice for use with additives, as the thicker wick helps prevent against wick clogging. Square wicks are self-trimming, and are generally used in pillar and taper candles.
Cored wicks are thick, braided wicks that have a metal core that makes them stand straight up, as opposed to the curling of flat and square wicks. The stiffness of cored wicks makes them a good choice for poured candles.
Wax coating. Wicks that have a wax coating work well with oil-based waxes, but you will want to use a wick that is not coated in wax if you are using candle gel, as the wax will cloud the gel.

, The supplies you need will vary according to the types of candles you make, and a candle supplies list could include any number of the following:


Double boiler. Use a double boiler for melting your candle wax.
Thermometer. Your thermometer of choice should fit inside the double boiler. Use a high-quality thermometer, as it is very important to keep your melted wax at the appropriate temperature to prevent it from reaching its flash point and erupting into a fire.
Pouring pot. You will pour your melted wax from the double boiler into the pouring pot, and then use the pouring pot to pour your candles.
Candle wax.
Wick.
Additives. There are a number of things you can add to your candles for different aesthetic effects. Fragrances and dyes are the most common candle additives.
Containers. You will need to purchase containers if you plan on making poured candles. Depending on the type of candles you make, you may need to purchase votive holders, tea light cups, vases, bowls or any of a wide variety of containers that can be used for candle making. Remember that you may pour candles into any type of container that is fire-safe.

, Compare prices before purchasing candle supplies. Explore these candle supply resources:


Chain retailers. Search the arts and crafts departments at your local retail department store.
Wholesalers. You can find many wholesalers of candle making supplies on the Internet. Wholesalers are a good option if you want to purchase your supplies in bulk. Just be prepared that you may need to provide a business license or business references in order to purchase wholesale.
Online retailers. There are many online sources for purchasing candle supplies from the comfort of your own home, and shopping on the Internet is a great way to compare prices before buying.
Craft stores. You can purchase candle supplies in person at craft stores, or you may even browse their catalogs online.
Farms. Search online and locally for farms that produce any of the natural waxes, such as tallow and bayberry.
Beekeepers. Local beekeepers are a good source for beeswax, or you may search online for beekeepers who distribute beeswax.

Buy a candle.,
Pick out ribbons.,
Settle on a design.,
Apply the ribbon with glue.,
Wait about a half-hour for the glue to dry.

,
Your candle is now complete.",How to Decorate Your Own Candle1," Choose one that is scented or unscented, depending on your preference. It can be any color, size, or shape, but plain white candles are the easiest to decorate, since everything matches them.


You may already have a candle around the house. Take a look around, and you can avoid buying one.
Dollar stores are great places to get inexpensive, plain candles to decorate.;
, Now you can get creative. Ribbon is a great decoration for candles because it comes in so many patterns and colors, so you can try a variety of different looks.


If your candle is colored, pick out ribbon that matches the color or looks pretty in contrast.
Choose ribbon made from fabric, paper, or plastic - any type will work fine.

, Once you have your ribbon picked out, think about how you want it to look on the candle. Would you like a simple band of ribbon? How about several bands? You could also make a ribbon bow to adhere to the candle.


Wrap the ribbon around the candle to measure how much ribbon you'll need, then go ahead and cut the ribbon to the right length.
If you want to make a ribbon bow, Cut a length of ribbon and tie it in a pretty bow shape. Snip ""v"" shapes into the ends of the ribbon for a neat effect.

, Use either a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or super glue to stick the ribbon to the candle. Start by putting a spot of glue on the end of the ribbon and sticking it to the candle. Now wrap the ribbon around the candle, applying more dots of glue as you go to hold it on place, Finally, put one last dot of glue on the end of the ribbon and secure it over the place where you started.


Use more glue than you might think you need, so the ribbon doesn't come off later.
Have a paper towel handy in case you need to wipe excess glue off the candle.
If you're going to glue on a ribbon bow, secure it over the seam where the ends of the ribbon meet.

,, You may wrap it as a gift or keep it.

If the beeswax you are working with is rolled, gently unroll it.,
Lay a piece of wick along one of the short edges of the beeswax sheet.

,
Roll it up.

,
Voilà!",How to Make a Beeswax Candle1," If it's stiff, or cracks while unrolling, soften it by warming it with the hair dryer set on low.;
,,, You have yourself a nice straight thick candle.

Save heavy cardboard type containers.,
Wipe the inside of the container with a damp paper towel to remove any food residue.

,
Attach your wick to the center of the inside of the container.,
Lay a pencil (or similar object) across the top of the container and tape your wick to it, so that the wick is centered in the container.

,
Pour a little bit of melted wax in the container and wait a few seconds to make sure the container isn't going to leak.

,
Pour the wax into the container almost to the top.,
Wait several hours or overnight for the wax to cool and harden.

,
Let the candle cool.,
Finished.

",How to Create a Mold for Candles," Useful types of cardboard include a Pringles can, Chinese take-out containers, or waxed milk cartons. Make sure that the cardboard is coated with wax in some way... regular cardboard will absorb the melted wax and become a fire hazard, not to mention a mess.;
,, You can use a little scotch tape to do this. Also a good way to attach the wick is to melt a space for it when the candle is done and put the wick in.

,,, Reserve a little wax for topping up, as the wax shrinks into the center as it cools.

,, When the candle is cool, peel the container away.

Choose a candle to decorate.,
Get some dried flowers.,
Decide on a design.,
Glue the flowers to the candle.,
Continue making your flower pattern.",How to Decorate Your Own Candle2," Votive candles are a nice choice when you're decorating with flowers, since the flowers accent their delicate shape. Taper candles probably aren't the best choice, since the flowers might stick out too much.

, Go to a craft store and pick out some dried flowers to use as candle decorations. You can find pressed daisies, mums, violets, and other beautiful blossoms that accent the candle you picked out.


If you'd rather not use dried flowers, check out the artificial flower section in your craft store. Choose from an amazing variety of silk and plastic flowers. The upside of these is that they'll never fall apart.
You can also make flowers out of fabric or paper to glue to your candle.

, You could put the flowers in random spots all over the candle, make uniform rows or stripes, or place them in an even polka-dot pattern. Consider these other great options:


Make a flower garden. Glue flowers along the bottom of the candle to resemble a growing garden.
Make vertical flower vines. Glue flowers in vertical rows that have vine-like twists and turns.
Make a flower rim. Glue flowers along the rim of the candle and leave the sides bare.

, Heat up the glue gun or prepare to use your fabric glue. Choose a spot on the candle for the first flower, and put a dot of glue there. Press the flower firmly to the spot and hold it in place for thirty seconds.


If the flower falls away, it might be a little too heavy. Choose a flower that is flatter and lighter.
Try holding the flower in place for a full minute if it isn't sticking.

, Place another dot of glue on another part of the candle. Stick a flower to the spot and hold it in place. Continue gluing flowers to the candle until you're satisfied with the way it looks, then wait for the glue to dry. Your candle is now ready to give away or use to decorate your home.

Buy candles in several different colors.,
Decide how to decorate the candle.,
Melt colored wax.,
Create your wax design.",How to Decorate Your Own Candle3," One will be your base candle, the one you'll decorate, and the others will be melted down so you can use the wax. Keeping this in mind, choose candles with colors that complement each other.

, You can use different-colored wax to dye half of the candle a different color, make a polka dot design, or create random, modern art-esque shapes. Have a plan in mind before you start melting wax, since it tends to harden quickly.

, Choose one color to work with first. Melt the wax in a wax warmer or place it in a microwave-safe bowl and zap it for a few minutes. When the wax has melted, handle it very carefully - melted wax can burn your hands if you aren't careful.


Place the container of wax on a paper towel or cloth so that it doesn't get on your furniture.
You may want to work in the kitchen or bathroom to minimize the mess.

, You can dip the candle in the colored wax or use a paintbrush to paint on a design. When you're finished using one color, heat a second candle and create a wax design using that color. You'll see that the wax hardens very quickly.


Colored wax tends to make translucent, watercolor-like patterns.
For best results, use only two or so extra wax colors. If you use too many, the candle could start to look messy.

Gather materials.,
Buy fragrance oil.,
Light the candle.,
Add fragrance oil.,
Stir the wax.,
Let the wax cool.,
Light the candle.",How to Add Scent to a Candle1," You probably already have an unscented candle at home but if not, you can find one at stores that sell home furnishings. Purchase the scented fragrance oil at a candle shop so you can smell several options.;
, Fragrance oils are simply a synthetically created smell. Many perfumes are created using fragrance oils because the scent options are plentiful. It is also an inexpensive way to add scent to candles.Oils can be purchased at most major retailers that sell home décor or candle products.

, Let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, blow the candle out.

, Use an eye-dropper to add a few drops of fragrance oil into the hot pool of melted wax. About 3-4 drops should be enough to create a nice, light scent. However, if you want a richer scent, add several more drops.


Every bottle of fragrance oil is a little different so read the instructions for best results. The bottle will offer insights into how concentrated your particular oil is.

, Use a toothpick or other small instrument to mix the wax and oil. Start with small circles close to the wick and work your way to the outer edges. Be as thorough as you can to create an even distribution of oil. Mix slowly to avoid making a mess or splattering hot wax onto your hands.


You can create a unique scent by adding two oils. Consider combinations like vanilla and rose or lavender and pine.

, Wait for the wax to cool and harden completely. This will take several minutes. Doing this will allow the oil to settle into the wax and really absorb, which will further enhance the scent.

, When ready, relight your candle. Within seconds, you will be able to smell the scent you’ve added. After several minutes, the smell will fill the room.


If you are unhappy with the potency of the scent, make note of how many drops you added and increase the number for the next time.
If you can’t smell anything at all, blow the candle out again and repeat the steps of adding drops to the wax, mixing, allowing it to cool and relighting.

Lay a piece of wick along a short edge and firmly fold the wax over it.,
When you have finished rolling all the wax, run the hair dryer over it to mold the edges together just a bit, and soften the bottom so that you can give it a nice flat smooth surface.

,
Because you cut your beeswax sheet in half, you will end up with a pair of matched candles.",How to Make a Beeswax Candle2," Now squeeze it together. The wax is slightly sticky, so this is easier than it sounds. Begin rolling the candle, making sure that it is tightly rolled and as even as you can make it.

,, And if you want you can lay different colored beeswax sheets, one on top of the other, before you start rolling. This will give you a funky layered, striped candle set.

"
"
Begin by unrolling a sheet of beeswax.,
Divide your pile of shapes in half.,
When you have squished half of your shapes together, lay your wick on top of the shapes and continue to squish the rest of the wax pieces onto your candle, trapping the wick between the two thick layers of wax pieces.

,
Occasionally heat it with the hair dryer, this will help the wax stick together.

,
When you're done, trim the wick and set your candle upright.",How to Make a Beeswax Candle3," Choose a cool shaped cookie cutter (like fish, stars or flowers) and cut out an even number of shapes from your sheet of wax. 12 to 16 pieces should be good.

, One at a time, put one piece on top of another and squish them together. Just make sure that they are firmly stuck together.

,,, Don't be shy about making your candles. Mix the colors of wax you use and try lots of different cookie cutter shapes. These make great gifts for friends and even better additions to your own bedroom!

Make a mess-free candle.,
Pour beads into container.,
Add essential oil.,
Let the beads rest.,
Light the candle.",How to Add Scent to a Candle2," You will need wax beads which are tiny wax balls, slightly larger than sand. These are available in a myriad of colors. You will also need a glass jar, wick and an essential oil of your choosing. The glass jar can be any size and any shape, based on your preferences. You can even use something you have at home like a mason jar or small glass bowl.


Wax beads and wicks can be purchased at the local craft store, along with an essential oil.

, With one hand, hold the wick in the center of the desired container and pour your wax beads around it. Do not fill the container completely. Leave about an inch of room at the top. The wick should also stand slightly above the beads. Use a spoon to flatten and smooth the top of the beads so they are evenly distributed in the container.If the wick is too long, simply cut it to size and save the remaining piece for a future project.
Avoid wicks with metal in them like lead, as this is a toxin. Instead, choose one made of soy or bees wax.

, An essential oil is a highly-concentrated scent produced using plants, leaves and flowers. The aromatherapy benefits are plentiful as they promote health, positivity, joy and more. Use a dropper to add a few drops of oil onto the beads. About 3-4 drops should be enough to create a nice, light scent.However, if you want a richer scent, add several more drops. Using a toothpick, slowly stir the beads to allow the oil to penetrate the entire container.


Every bottle of essential oil is a little different so read the instructions for best results. The bottle will offer insights into how concentrated your particular oil is. Keep in mind that because essential oils are natural, they are more potent than fragrance oils so a little goes a long way.

, While you can light your candle immediately, for best results, allow the scent to absorb throughout the container and settle. Waiting 24-48 hours is best. If the container has a lid, cover it during this time.

, When ready, light the wick and enjoy your scent.

Purchase scented cubes.,
Light the candle.,
Continue to enjoy.",How to Add Scent to a Candle3," Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent. Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from. While most people place them on a warmer,causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles.

, Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax. The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room.


Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife.

, The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax. Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time.

Gather materials.,
Set the wick.,
Measure your wax flakes.,
Melt the wax.,
Add scent.,
Pour the wax into the container.,
Burn the candle.",How to Add Scent to a Candle4," To make your own candle, you will need a bag of soy wax flakes, one wick (more if making several candles), a glass container for the candle, a scented oil of your choosing, skewers and a glass measuring cup. You will be able to find these items at a craft store.


Consider using palm or beeswax flakes as an alternative.

, Grab the container of your choice. This could be a glass bowl or a mason jar. Lay the metal end of the wick flat along the bottom of the container. Tape the top end of the wick to a skewer so that the wick is pulled completely straight. Lay the skewer on top of the container with the wick outstretched.


If the wick is really long, simply cut it with scissors. It should reach slightly above the rim of the container.
If a skewer isn't available, just about anything will work. Try using a kitchen utensil instead.

, Use a glass measuring cup for this. You will need twice the amount of wax flakes as the size of your container. For example, if your container measures one cup, pour two cups of wax flakes.


If you're unsure about the size of your container, simply fill the container with water. Pour the water from the container into a measuring cup to have an exact measurement.

, Fill a saucepan halfway with water. Then, set your glass measuring cup with wax flakes in the water. Make sure water isn't getting into the container. If it is, you will need to pour a little water out.Turn your heat to medium-high and stir the wax with a metal spoon or spatula. Once completely melted, turn the heat off. This will only take a few minutes.

, Using an essential oil, add about 10 drops into the melted wax. This will create a moderately scented candle. For a stronger scent, add more drops. Stir the wax and scent slowly using a toothpick or metal spoon.


Remember that you can replace the essential oil with a fragrance oil or scented cube, if that's more readily available.
Each bottle of oil will have specific instructions regarding number of drops, follow these guidelines for best results.

, Use an oven mitt to hold the glass measuring cup. Hold the skewer so the wick doesn't shift while pouring. Slowly pour the scented wax into the container. Let the wax sit and cool for 3-4 hours.

, After the candle is completely solidified, remove the skewer. Feel free to burn your scented candle and enjoy.


These make excellent, inexpensive gifts as well.

Pour melted wax into teacups.,
Allow for ample dry time before using or giving as a gift.",How to Make Vintage Teacup Candles," Set up wicks inside clean teacups by placing the wick in between two wooden skewer sticks and taping the ends.


Place sticks with wick over the top of the cup so that the wick is standing in the middle of the cup.





;
, Place wax flakes in your double boiler or pan and turn heat on stove to medium.

Stir flakes frequently so flakes dissolve evenly. Flakes should appear opaque as they melt.






Add one or two drops of food coloring (or until desired color is achieved).







, Using oven mitts to protect your hands, pour wax into waiting teacups. Pour slowly as you don’t want to disturb the position of the wick.

, The wax should appear cloudy and smooth to the touch and it is ready.

Pour the melted wax into the bottle caps.,
Allow the wax to set for several hours.,
Trim the wick to the desired length before using.,
Arrange the bottle cap candles on the table or other surface.,
Done.",How to Make Bottle Cap Candles," Remove any rubber sealing from the inside of the cap and then wash each before you store it, using warm soapy water and a clean towel for drying.


Find wax supplies. There are a few ways you can do this – gather as many old, broken crayons together to melt and use as the wax or you can go a step further, hit the craft store and purchase candle wax. Another option is to use old, melted-down candles you find around the house.






Pick up a package of pre-waxed wire wicks. Do not worry about the wick length, as you will trim it to desired size after the candle wax has been poured.





;
, Use only undamaged bottle caps. If the cap is dented or twisted, do not use it for this project, as the wax may spill from the sides.


Place one pre-waxed wick in the middle of each bottle cap. Place the wick in the dead center of the bottle cap so that when you burn the candle, the wax melts away evenly.






Leave the long wick intact, as you will not know exactly how low you want to trim it until after the wax has been poured.







, Whether you're using crayons or actual candle wax, melt the wax the same way.

Place the candles or wax in a small pot. Remove all the paper from the crayons before melting the wax.






Fill a larger pot halfway to the top with water. Check that the smaller pot containing the crayons or wax can fit inside the larger pot (with room to spare).






Bring the water to a rolling boil and then place the smaller pot with the wax inside the larger pot. Allow the wax to slowly melt until it is of a liquid consistency.







, It is best if you transfer the heated wax to another container with a spout that allows for easy pouring – this makes it more accurate.

, Fill each bottle cap to the top, holding the wick upright to keep it centered and above the wax (an extra set of friend's hands may come in handy here).

, Although wax congeals rather quickly, don't move or use the candle until it has fully set, which takes approximately two hours.

, Shape a wick that is neither too long (which may create a larger than necessary flame) nor too short (which may create a crater inside your bottle cap).

, Ideally, they should sit on a saucer or candle plate to catch drips and hot wax overflow. There are plenty of lovely candle plates available but using your own pretty crockery works just as well.

, To light, simply use a match or lighter as for any candle. If you find the wick is not catching, you may need to move it upright with a toothpick or similar tool.

",How to Make Homemade Candles," There are several different kinds of wax to choose from. One pound of paraffin wax by weight will equal approximately 20 oz of liquid melted wax. One pound of soy wax will equal approximately 18 oz of liquid when melted. One pound of beeswax by weight will equal approximately 16 oz of liquid when melted.


Paraffin wax is the traditional wax for candle making and is still by far the most popular wax. It is good for beginners because it melts quickly, is cheap and is easily colored or scented. However, it should be noted that the chemicals that are emitted when this wax is melted could be irritating to some people.
Soy wax is becoming increasingly popular as it is easy to use, made from soybeans and cleans up pretty easily. It is eco-friendly and renewable. Soy wax is also known to burn more slowly than most other waxes.Beeswax is all natural and has air purifying qualities to it; however, it doesn’t retain scent or coloring that well. Essential oils will generally work with beeswax but keep in mind that beeswax has its own lovely scent.You can also use old candles that have been burned down or are half-used and warped. Using old candles is a great way to recycle wax. Simply melt them just as you would melt other wax (see Part Two).;
, Unless you have a dedicated area that you can get wax on without worrying about it, you should put newspaper, wax paper, or towels and rags down on the surface you will be working on. Have some warm soapy water at the ready as well in case of spills.

, Smaller chunks of wax melt better than larger chunks. By using smaller pieces, you will also ensure that the wax melts at an even rate.







, Make sure there's enough room in the pot for a smaller container; you'll be using the smaller vessel to melt the wax in a makeshift double boiler.








, Place this smaller container inside the larger pot, creating a makeshift double boiler. Note: You cannot put candle wax directly on heat or it will catch fire or evaporate. Turn the heat to high so that the water boils. The boiling water will slowly melt the wax.









Keep in mind that wax can be difficult to clean--you may want to purchase a cheap, heat-safe pot that you designate specifically for making candles.

, You can purchase candy or candle thermometers at a cooking or craft store. If you do not have a candy thermometer, you can also use a meat thermometer. Just remember that wax can be hard to remove.









Paraffin wax should be melted until it reaches between 122 and 140°F (50 and 60°C).Soy wax should be melted until it reaches between 170 and 180 degrees (76.6 and 82.2°C).Beeswax should be melted until it reaches roughly 145 degrees (62.7°C). You can go a little bit higher but try not to exceed 175 degrees (79.4°C).Old candles should be melted at around 185 degrees (85°C). Remove the old wicks with tongs., The scent you choose is up to you. Scents such as essential oils can be purchased at your local craft store. It is best to read the bottle’s directions rather than base the amount you put in on how strongly it smells after the scent has already been added. Stir well.








, Normal food coloring will not work in candles because they are water-based. Purchase oil-based dyes at your local craft store. You can generally find specific candle dyes. Read the bottle for the proper amount of dye to put in to achieve a certain color. Add drops of coloring until you have reached your desired color. Stir well.








, You can use tins, mason jars, old teacups, really any sort of container that you know can withstand heat. Metal tins are generally the safest way to go but as long as you know your container can stand up to heat, you can really use whatever you like. Place them on a flat surface in your protected workspace (such as on a cookie sheet or a cutting board.) The wick should be in the center of the candle mold with about two inches sticking out of the candle. Loop the end that will be out of the wax around the center of a pen or pencil. Rest the pen across the top of the mold you will be pouring your wax into. Make sure the wick hangs down straight into the center of the mold.







, Pour slowly so that it does not spill over. Make sure not to knock the wick out of the mold accidentally. You are the judge of how full you want your molds to be. Beeswax will shrink a little once it has cooled so keep that in mind when pouring it into your molds.








, It is best to cool them for a full 24 hours if possible. The longer you let them cool, the better they will be.









Paraffin candles generally take 24 hours to cool.
Soy candles generally take 4 to 5 hours to cool.Beeswax candles generally take 6 hours to cool, but if you can wait, cooling them overnight is best.If you made your candle with old candles, you should only need to let it stand for a couple of hours., This will help contain the flame, as a longer wick will cause the flame to be too large.

Melt the wax.,
Prep the mold.,
Add wax chips.,
Add color and scent.,
Pour the wax.,
Allow 24 hours for the wax to cool.,
Remove the mold.",How to Make Soy Pillar Candles," Place the wax into a double boiler. Use medium heat and stir the wax until completely melted.;
, It is best to use a metal mold without seams. There should be a hole on the bottom that is just small enough for the wick to go through.


Using the pieces from a standard wick kit, cut the wick to be twice the size of the candle height.
Run the wick through the black sponge piece and washer.
Tie a tight knot in the wick, with the knot against the washer. This prevents the wax from running out the bottom of the hole in the mold.
Run the long remaining part of the wick through the hole on the bottom of the mold.
Place it through the center hole on the wick bar.
Pull the wick tight.
Wrap the wick around the side of the wick bar.

, Add wax chips to help bind the wax and add color. You can use any color.


When wax cools, it shrinks; by breaking up the wax into chips, you help to prevent shrinkage. The chips are also pretty to look at as a decorative element in each candle.
If you have old candles that have burned down, you can use those as well - chop them up into little pieces. Make sure that there are no wicks or small metal parts left in them etc.

, Only use oils designed for candle making - essential oils made specifically for candles are the safest. Use 1/8 of a cup (30 ml) scented oil for an average sized candle.


Stir the color chips and scented oil until completely blended in.

, After pouring the wax.

, If the wax shrinks, then you can add more wax to fill any divots.

, Cut the wick on the exposed side, which will actually be the bottom of the candle. It is actually better to cut the wick before the wax has completely hardened. This is so that you can stick the scissors in the wax so the wick is hidden underneath the wax for a flatter base.


Cut the top of the wick, above the black sponge and washer, leaving enough room so it can be lit. Be careful not to cut too much as this is the end that you are going to light. You can always trim it a little more as needed.

"
"
Secure the wick to the bottom of your jar.,
Place two pencils over the mouth of the jar, to either side of the wick.,
Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water, and place a candle-making pouring pot into it.,
Add the wax into the pouring pot, and let it melt over medium heat.,
Consider adding some color and/or fragrance.,
Let the wax cool to about 130 to 140°F (55 to 60°C).,
Fill the jar to the neck, or until you have 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space left.Pour the wax into the jar slowly.,
Let the wax set for 24 to 48 hours.The bigger your jar is, the longer it will take to set.,
Trim the wick down to ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) before using the candle.This will help keep the wax from smoking as it burns and help the wick last longer.",How to Make Mason Jar Candles1," You can do this by putting a drop of hot glue onto the bottom of the wick tab, then pressing the tab against the bottom of the jar. You can also use some melted wax or a piece of double-sided tape instead.


If your wick doesn't have a tab at the bottom, you can buy a wick tab separately, and secure it to the wick using a pair of pliers. You can also tie a paper clip to the end of the wick instead.
You can reuse jars from jams and baby food as well, but make sure that the walls are thick. If the glass is too thin, it may shatter.;
, Alternatively, you can wrap the excess wick around a pencil, and place the pencil over the mouth of the jar. This will help hold the wick in place. You can also use pens, chopsticks, short dowels, or even popsicle sticks. If the mouth of your jar is small enough, you can even use a clothespin, and slide the wick through the spring hole.

, If you don't own a candle-making pouring pot, you can use a large, glass measuring cut instead. To ensure that the heat is distributed evenly, consider placing a cookie cutter or jar lid under the pouring pot/measuring cup.

, Heat the wax to about 170 to 180°F (77 to 83°C). Stir the wax often as it heats to help it melt evenly. Do not leave the wax unattended at this time, as hot wax is flammable.You will need about 1 pound (455 grams) of wax for a pint (475-milliliter) sized mason jar.

, Let the wax cool to 140°F (60°C) before adding any color or fragrance.Once you have the dyes and/or fragrances added, give the wax a final stir to blend everything together.


You can add color with liquid or solid dyes meant for candle-making. Add a little bit at a time, and keep in mind that the color will lighten once the wax hardens.
You will need about ½ to 1 ounce of fragrance oil for 1 pound (455 grams) of wax.If you can't find dyes or fragrances meant for candle-making, you can use a broken crayon and essential oil instead.

, This is very important. If the wax is too hot, it may cause sink holes or cracks as it sets.Use a thermometer to test the temperature. If you don't own a thermometer, wait until the wax starts to thicken and resemble a slushie. This will take about 20 to 30 minutes., If you pour too quickly, you risk the wax splashing or forming air pockets. Make sure that the wick is centered as you pour., If you are in a hurry, however, you can let the wax set partway, then stick the jar into fridge for 20 to 60 minutes., Always keep something under the candle, such as a dish or candle charger; even through your candle is inside a mason jar, the jar itself can get hot.

Fill your mason jar with natural, decorative items, such as cinnamon sticks and pinecones.,
Fill the jar with water until it is 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the rim.,
Pour in a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) layer of vegetable oil.,
Assemble your floating wick.,
Place the floating wick on top of the oil layer, and light it.",How to Make Mason Jar Candles2," Use a pencil, dowel, stick, or chopstick to push the items about until they are positioned the way you want. Be careful not to overfill it, however. Also, note that these items won't add fragrance to your candle. If you want, consider matching the decorations to the season. For example:


Fall: orange slices, cinnamon sticks, star anise, or brightly colored leaves.
Winter: mini pinecones, twigs, pine branches, or holly leaves and berries.
Summer: orange, lemon, and lime slices.
Spring: Whole flowers, such as dahlia or daisies.

, If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water for a special effect., Light olive oil and sunflower seed oil are great, because they burn clean.You can also use just about any other type of oil meant for cooking or burning in lamps.


Consider mixing some essential oils into your vegetable oil first. Lemon, rosemary, and sweet orange are all great choices., Purchase your floating wick from a store or online. Next, take one of the wicks, and push it half-way through one of the waxed disks., The candle will burn for about 2 hours. When you want to extinguish it, simply place the jar lid on top. Eventually, the wick will burn completely. When that happens, simply insert a new one; the waxed disks can last much longer, and do not need to be replaced as often.Fresh fruit and flowers will last about 1 week in the water. If you want something that lasts longer, use fake flowers. Some craft stores also sell fake fruit."

, Using a thumbtack, poke a hole through the top and bottom of each egg. Your grip should be fairly loose so that the egg does not break. The hole should be about the size of the top of the thumbtack.

, Place your mouth on one end and blow until the eggs are completely empty., Place the eggs into a bowl of warm soapy water so that they fill. Once the eggs are filled, blow through each egg to empty them., Place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 2 days to allow them to completely dry., This will allow them to melt faster and have an even consistency. Use about 3 ounces of paraffin wax per egg.

, Each color crayon should have its own container.

, The paraffin wax will turn clear.


Fill a pot up with water
Place the plastic containers of wax and crayons in the water so that they float
Bring the water to a boil

, Using a glass thermometer, make sure the paraffin wax is at 125 °F (51.7 °C) or more., Pour the melted paraffin wax directly to the melted crayon., Trim the wick so that there is at least half an inch sticking out from each side.

, This allows the egg to not leak by having a solid seal.

, Using a funnel, overfill the eggs to assure they are filled to full capacity.

, As the wax starts to cool, you'll notice the egg is no longer filled to full capacity. You'll need to refill the eggs about 3-4 times., Place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 2-3 hours to allow the wax to completely cool.,, This can be done by knocking the eggs on a counter or hitting them all around with a spoon or other utensils.

, If the shells are sticking to the wax, use a knife to peel it off.

,, Use a hair dryer on low heat to just slightly melt the wax. Rub your finger over the wax to give it a shine finish.

, This will flatten down the bottom allowing it to stand on its own.

Place a large piece of newsprint or wax paper on a clear flat surface.,
Lay a piece of tissue paper on top of the newsprint or wax paper and secure in place.,
Provide your child with different color paints and paintbrushes.,
Decide how you plan to integrate your child’s fingerprint into a design.,
Guide your child’s finger into the paint and create your fingerprint design on the tissue paper.,
Embellish the fingerprint design with paintbrushes after washing hands.",How to Make Fingerprint Candles1," This is where your child will work. Use a comfortable spot at the kitchen table, workroom––or even outdoors if the day is nice.


Always cover the surface before working. Since your child will be creating his or her design on the tissue paper, the paint will eventually soak through onto the surface.





;
, You may want to use a small amount of clear tape on each side of the tissue to avoid having it slide around the table. Your child will create the artwork directly on the tissue paper, which will be wrapped around the candle and placed under heat to transfer the design.


Make sure the tissue paper is the same size as the candle. Test it by wrapping it around the candle and cutting to size if it isn’t an exact fit.







, Also, provide clear water to wash brushes and hands. It might be easier to transfer the paint to smaller, separate bowls.

, The print could double as flower petals, animal heads (or bodies), stick figure people or other designs. It can help guide the fingerprinting if you draw a design outline first––nothing too fancy, and be prepared to be flexible and incorporate changes your child makes.

, Depending on your child’s age, he or she could work independently too.


Keep a clean towel or paper towels on hand to wipe excess paint from your child’s fingers should the project become a little messy.







, Add the fingerprints first and then paint around them and/or create designs such as animals or flowers, following the design you planned earlier.


Use a paint pen to mark the occasion such as, “Happy Birthday Grandma 2013!”, or add your child’s name.







"
"
Allow the tissue paper painting to dry before transferring it to the candle.,
Wrap the painted tissue paper around the candle.,
Transfer the design to the candle using a heat embossing gun or a hair dryer.,
Remove the wax paper with care once the design has been transferred to the candle.,
Finished.

",How to Make Fingerprint Candles2," Allow for up to 24 hours of dry time before performing the next step.

, The painted side should face outward from the candle (this ensures the writing reads the right way, etc.). Next, wrap a larger piece of wax paper around the tissue paper and candle. Leave excess wax paper to allow you to hold the candle while you transfer the design.

, Heat the candle holding your chosen heat source close over the paper until you see the tissue paper begin to disappear and the wax paper melt. Shift the heat source around the candle to ensure the whole design is covered. The design will be transferred to the candle as the heat is applied.


Hold the heat source away from the hand holding the candle! Beware burning yourself––this part must be done by an adult.

, Go slowly as you don’t want to peel away any of the newly transferred design.

Gather your supplies.,
Make your center loop.,
Make your next two loops.,
Continue making loops.,
Secure with the florist wire.,
Fluff out the bow.,
Cut the tails.",How to Make a Floral Bow1," To make a large floral bow you will need a piece of wired ribbon, approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide and 3 yards (2.7 m) long.


Wired ribbon is much easier to work with than soft ribbon as it holds its shape better, making a fuller bow.
You will also need a 9 or 10 inch (22.9 or 25.4 cm) length of florist wire (although pipe cleaner will do in a push) bent into a U-shape, and a pair of scissors.;
, Take one end of the ribbon and form a loop, making sure that the ""right"" side of the ribbon is facing out.









Hold the bottom of the loop tightly between your thumb and fingers. Keep in mind that the size of the loops you make will determine the size of your finished bow.
At the bottom of this first loop, give the ribbon a tight twist to ensure the correct side of the ribbon is facing out. This is the secret to a pretty-looking bow.

, Form a second loop on one side of your original center loop.


Secure it between the thumb and fingers holding the first loop and give the ribbon another good twist to ensure that the right side is facing out.
Make a third loop on the other side of the center loop, again securing it between your fingers and twisting the ribbon.

, Continue using the same technique of looping, securing and twisting until you have four or five loops on each side of the original central loop.Depending on how you want your finished bow to look, you can make all of the loops the same size or you can make them progressively bigger as you go.
When you've finished making loops, pick up the tail end of the ribbon up and secure it between your thumb and fingers (do not twist this piece of ribbon - keep it straight). This will create a large circular loop hanging beneath your bow.

, Take the U-shaped piece of florist wire and pass one leg through the center loop, so there is a leg sitting on either side of the bow.









Twist the legs of the wire tightly to secure the underside of the bow and hold all of the loops in place.
Alternatively, some people recommend twisting the bow itself (rather than the wire) as they claim this produces a tighter bow which will not fall apart.

, Take a couple of moments to pull out all of the loops (some to the left, some to the right) to create a rounded, flower shape.









This may require some firm tugging, but the wire ribbon should eventually do as its told!
Also be sure to round out each loop, so it looks full and circular rather than flat.

, Cut the large hanging loop beneath the bow in half to form the tails. Cut the tails as short as you like and give them a slanted or swallow-tailed ending, whichever you prefer."

Gather your materials.,
Make a slit in the foam or cardboard.,
Start making loops.,
Continue to make loops.,
Cut the ribbon.,
Carefully slide out the bow.,
Secure with the piece of wire.,
Fluff out the bow.",How to Make a Floral Bow2," To make a small floral bow you will need a length of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) soft ribbon, a piece of cardboard or foam, a scissors and a piece of floral wire or a pipe cleaner.

, Cut a thin, V-shaped slit into a piece of foam or cardboard with a sharp knife or scissors.









The slit should be wide enough to insert the ribbon but small enough to hold the ribbon in place.
If you're using a ribbon that is shiny on one side and dull on the other, make sure that the shiny side faces down so that as you make your bow, the shiny side will form the outside of your loops.

, Fold the ribbon to make a loop on one side of the slit, then slide the ribbon into the slit. As you push the ribbon into the slit, twist it so that the shiny side faces down again.








, Continue to make loops, alternating between one side of the cardboard and the other. If you want your bow to have smaller loops in the middle, just make each loop smaller as you slip it between the cardboard., When your bow is full enough, cut the ribbon at an angle.








, Slide the bow out from between the cardboard, making sure to firmly grab the center of the bow between your thumb and forefinger.








, Take the piece of wire or pipe cleaner and wrap it around the center of the bow. Twist the two ends of the wire tightly to secure.








, After you have secured the bow, take a minute or two to readjust the loops to fluff out the bow and make it look even.

Gather your materials.,
Start making figure-of-eights.,
Assemble the flower.,
Stick the rhinestone, pearl or button in the center.",How to Make a Floral Bow3," For this project you will need 3 pieces of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) ribbon, each 8 inches (20.3 cm) in length along with another 3 pieces of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) ribbon, each 7.25 inches (18.4 cm) in length.


You will also need a hot glue gun and a rhinestone, button or pearl.
Using different colored ribbon for the longer and shorter pieces creates a pretty finished product.

, Lay all six pieces of ribbon out in front of you, with the shiny or patterned side facing down.









Take your first piece of ribbon and fold it in half to form a crease down the middle. Lay the ribbon out flat again.
Place a small dot of glue along the crease line, then the bottom end of the ribbon and make a sideways loop. Glue the end of the ribbon onto the crease line, making sure the shiny or patterned side is glued facing down.
Repeat with the top end of the ribbon, making the loop in the opposite direction to form a figure of eight.
Now do the same thing with the five remaining pieces of ribbon, until you have six figures-of-eight.

, Take the three slightly larger figures-of-eight (these are the ones you made with the longer lengths of ribbon) and place a dot of glue in the center of one of them.


Take the second figure-of-eight and and stick it to the first one horizontally, so they form an ""X"" or a cross shape. Take the third figure-of-eight and stick it on top of the other two, to form a flower.
Repeat this process with the three remaining figures-of-eight to form a second flower. Then place a dot of glue in the center of the larger flower and stick the smaller one on top.

, Place a dot of hot glue in the middle of the smaller flower and attach the rhinestone, pearl or button to form the center of the flower."

Buy or recycle an empty bottle with a dispenser pump.,
Buy the right bottle of gel soap refill.,
Mix the ingredients.",How to Make Foaming Hand Soap1," Plastic and glass bottles can be acquired cheaply in most supermarket and online. If you want to make a good gesture for the environment or save money, you can clean and recycle an old bottle with dispenser instead of buying a new one.


Choose a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bottle. Remember that you want to use it for a long period of time.
If possible, test a few bottles. Make sure that the pump works well and look for a sturdy bottle which can survive a fall on the floor.;
, Washing your hands can damage the skin. If you suffer from hand dryness, irritation, itching or cracks, look for hypoallergenic or scent-free soap. Examine the label. The most common allergic reactions are caused by the following ingredients: QAC, iodine, iodophors, chlorhexidine, triclosan, chloroxylenol and alcohols. Look for a soap with moisturizer to protect the skin of your hands.

, Pour tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Shake well to mix the gel and the water until they form a liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.


Add the water first. If you don't, the water will make the soap foam up.
Do not fill the bottle beyond two thirds of the way. If you do, the bottle will overflow when you screw the cap back on.
If the dispenser pump is not springing back to the up position, rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the dispenser stem to get it freely moving again.
The mixture must be diluted enough to flow through the pump. If the dispenser is clogged, clean it and add more water to the mixture.

Prepare the room in which you will make your soap.,
Mix the ingredients.",How to Make Foaming Hand Soap2," In addition to an empty bottle with a dispenser pump, you will need liquid scent-free soap and perfumed essential oils. Essential oils will determine the color and the scent of your foaming hand soap and are believed to have various health properties.Make sure to use a scent-free soap. Otherwise, the soap will overpower the subtle smell of the essential oils.
Essential oils can be found in most supermarkets and health shops. There is a large range of colors and scent, such as orange, rosemary, violet, and many more.
Aromatherapy claims that essential oils have many health benefits. While some are true, many others are largely exaggerated., Cover the surface on which you will work with a plastic tablecloth and be sure to have a tap in the room. Wear an apron to avoid staining your clothes and use gloves if you have sensitive hands. Keep a kitchen roll handy in case water spills on the table or on the floor.


Be particularly careful with essential oils. They stain easily and are very hard to remove.

, Pour the tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Add a teaspoon of essential oil and mix until the ingredients form a homogeneous liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle.If the scent is not strong enough, add another teaspoon of essential oils. Don't add too much at once as essential oils are both powerful and expensive.
You can also modify the color by adding food coloring. Always use natural coloring to avoid chemicals.

Enjoy your arrangement!








",How to Arrange a Dozen Roses in a Vase," To improve the longevity of the roses, mix an additive for cut flowers into the water. The warmer the water, the faster the roses will open. Colored roses open much faster than red roses, which have been treated to open more slowly.






;
, Trim off bottom of greens and place in vase. The greens should be resting on edge of vase with a secure feeling. If the greens are loose, your arrangement will not work. If you need to add a few more pieces of green to this mixture to fill in, do so now. This should take about a half bunch of leather-leaf fern for an arrangement of a dozen roses.








, It should be 1 to 1 1/2 times again as tall as your vase. This will set the height and width of your arrangement, so keep that in mind. Submerge the stem in tepid water and then snip the stem at an angle, to bring the rose to the perfect height. Place it in the center hole of your grid.








, Remove any large thorns before inserting roses into greens. Hold the roses up to the vase until the top of the heads of these 5 roses reach the bottom of the head of the first rose you placed in the vase. Snip all 5 the same length, at an angle, where they will be high enough to stand at the measured height. Place them in aiming towards the center rose making sure they are an equal space apart.








, The roses will land the same distance from the bottom of the top rose and the top of the vase. Cut all the same length at an angle.








, Each rose may not stay in the exact place you want it at this point; that, too, is okay.








, Even though it will be arranged ""all around"", you will have a front. You can even snip this rose a little shorter and put it back in, if you wish, as it will be your focal point, and should be the lowest rose toward the vase.








, Divide your filler and make sure you fill in all around the vase pretty much equally. You do not want filler in every spot; this will make it too round and full. You will want air space there and the color is evenly distributed. Pay extra attention to your focal flower that you placed lower in the front. The filler flower will frame and accentuate your other flowers, and should always be lower and deeper in your arrangement than your main flower, the rose.








, Look at your arrangement from the level that it will be placed. If it is going on a 3' tall table, look at it from that view, you will see more of the top than the bottom, so your focus should be that way. If you will be seated around it, look at it from a seated position, from every angle, if it will be up high, make sure it looks good from the bottom.

Pour the soap into molds.",How to Make Embedded Soap," Before you make embedded soap you have to decide what you want to embed. Dried herbs and small toys are the most popular, particularly if you’re making the soap to give as a gift. You should avoid embedding things that are dangerous, like sharp objects. Fake flowers will wilt and lose their color, so you should avoid using them as well., Crayons are not approved for use in soap, but colorants like LabColors, Color Blocks, Micas, and Clays are. They come in a wide variety of colors. Choose colors that complement your embed and the theme of your soap.For example, if you're making soap for kids, you might want to choose bright, primary colors. If you're making soaps that you want to look more feminine, try softer, more pastel colors.
The color of your soap base will affect the final color of your soap. A clear base will give you an intense color; a white base will make your color look more pastel., Microwave 1 inch (2.5 cm) squares of base for 30 seconds at a time. You should stir in between each round until the base is completely melted and smooth. The amount of base you need will vary by recipe., Once you’ve got your soap base melted, you can add fragrance. Most people add fragrance by adding a few drops of essential oils to their soap base and mixing it well.You probably only need three to four drops if you’re using essential oil for fragrance. For a subtler fragrance, you can use two drops or so. More than four will probably make the scent pretty overwhelming.

, Spraying your mold with alcohol will get rid of any air bubbles on the surface of the mold. This will give your soap a smooth surface and prevent air bubbles from forming in the soap.Using a silicon pan – like a jelly roll mold – is your best bet for melt and pour soap, since it will make it easy to take the soap out once it has set.

, The bottom later of soap base should be thick enough that your embed won’t just sink to the bottom of the mold. Be sure not to make the bottom layer so thick that the top layer of soap won't properly cover the embed., If you try placing your embed in the bottom layer of soap right away, it will just sink to the bottom. Let the bottom layer set for a few minutes before pressing the embed partway into the bottom layer of soap., Once the bottom layer of soap is partially set, place your embed where you want it to go in the soap. Depending on what it is, you might want to push it almost all the way to the bottom or the pan, or you might want to just barely put it into the bottom layer if you want it to stick out the top.If you’re adding more than one embed – as you might if you’re using dried herbs, for example – place them carefully. Dropping a handful of herbs into your bottom layer probably won’t produce the prettiest soap.

, Wait a few minutes after placing your embed and then pour the second layer of soap. Pour slowly, as you don’t want to risk the embed being moved from the force of the second layer being poured., After you’ve poured the second layer of soap, let the whole thing set for a few hours. Once it's set, take the soap out of the mold. If you’re using a silicon mold, you can carefully peel the mold away from the soap. Then cut the soap into the shapes you want – you can simply cut it into bars or use cookie cutters to create different shapes., If you’re not using or giving your soap away immediately, wrap it in plastic. This keeps it from getting ruined and maintains the scent. Store it in a cool, dark place., Because you're using lye in cold process soap-making, make sure there are no kids or pets in the area. You'll also want to put on your protective gear: safety goggles and gloves., Measure out the lye and water you need for the recipe you're using. Slowly add the lye to the water and stir until the liquid turns clear.Turn your head away from the container you're mixing in the lye and water in. Breathing the fumes is very dangerous.
Do not add the water to the lye, as this will cause the mixture to foam up.
You should mix the lye and water in a stainless steel or tempered glass container.

, Measure out each of the oils your recipe calls for. This might include having to first melt down the oils - particularly if you're using something like shea butter. Once they're all measured out, mix them together.You should use a metal or tempered glass bowl to the mix your oils.

, Before you pour the lye into the oils, make sure the mixtures are within ten degrees of each other and have cooled to under 130 degrees Fahrenheit (55 degrees Celsius). Pour the lye slowly into the oils.To prevent air bubbles, you can pour the lye down the stick of your stick blender into the oils.

, Using a stick blender, pulse the lye and oil mixture a few times to start the mixing process. Once you've pulsed the mixture a few times, you can keep the stick blender on and blend the soap together continuously.Look for tracing to know when the soap is fully mixed. Tracing means that soap drizzled on top holds its shape for a moment before it sinks back down., Before you pour the soap into molds, add your color, fragrance, and embeds. You should always stir these in by hand. You should also add color before fragrance, and place the embeds last., Once you've added your extras, pour the soap into your molds. Allow them to set for 24 to 48 hours at room temperature. Once they've set, take them out of the molds, cut them, and let them cure for 4 to 6 weeks."

Avoid using copper and aluminum as they have a negative reaction with lye. Moreover, some plastics melt when mixed with lye.Use soap-only spoons made of styrene plastic or silicone.;
, You can pick up a variety of soap molds at your local craft store or use silicone baking pans. Silicone is prefered because you can peel off the soap molds easily.

, Aside from the actual ingredients you want in your soap, make sure you have a pint and a quart canning jar, a stainless steel thermometer that can read between 90 - 200 degrees Fahrenheit, newspaper, and an old towel., Ensure that you get dried herbs for your soap. Some popular choices are lavender, chamomile, lemongrass, or oakmoss. Make sure you know who will be using your soap as some people may be more sensitive or even allergic to certain herbs. Each soap batch should use about a ¼ cup of dried herbs., While essential oils come from the roots, stems, flowers, and seeds of plants, their aroma can be artificially produced. Use about 15-20 drops of oil, or around a teaspoon, for a batch of this size.

, Cinnamon and cocoa powder create brown soap, powdered chlorophyll creates green, turmeric creates yellow, while beetroot makes an orange soap. Food coloring doesn’t hold up well in soap so it’s best to stick to natural colors..Be aware that colors may change during the process, like magenta beet powder turning yellowish orange.

, Choose your materials based on their healing properties. For example, a lemon scent is said to aid concentration while calming and clarifying someone who feels angry, anxious, or worn out. Mix and match your ingredients for your desired effect.Lavender is said to aid with emotional stress while rosemary is said to give energy, improve memory, and fight exhaustion, headaches and mental fatigue.Cinnamon aids concentration and focus while peppermint is said to boost energy and increase concentration., Use newspaper to cover your work. Before working with lye, make sure to have your protective gear on including gloves and eye wear. Scoop ¼ cup of lye and measure water in your quart canning jar. Stir as your slowly pour the lye into the water. Avoid the fumes by wearing a mask or standing back. Stir until clear and let sit.Make sure to use cold water. If you have the time and budget, you can use distilled water. Most pharmacies or grocery stores will have distilled water that you can purchase.
You can purchase lye at your local drug store, craft store, or online.

, Mix your oils together in the pint jar. Heat the pint for about a minute in the microwave or add the oils to a pan of water and heat over a stove. The temperature should be around 120 degrees Fahrenheit for your oils.If you’re making a mild to hard bar, use olive oil or use coconut oil in order to produce soap with a good lather. You may also use almond oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil, or safflower oil to achieve similar effects.

, Check the temperature of the lye. Wait for both the lye and oils to cool around 95° and 105° Fahrenheit. Make sure not to let these ingredients cool too low or your soap will come together too quickly and become coarse and crumble easily. Once both the lye and oils are at the right temperature, pour the oils into a mixing bowl and slowly stir the lye in by hand for about 5 minutes.You can also use an immersion blender to ensure as much soap contacts the lye as possible. Once the soap is thick and light in color, similar to vanilla pudding, it’s referred to as “trace” and is ready for herbs and essential oils., Stir everything thoroughly and pour the mixture into your soap molds or silicone baking molds. Cover the molds with plastic wrap and cover with an old towel. The towel allows residual heat to keep the mixture warm and start the saponification process. Saponification is the process at which all your base ingredients becomes soap.

, Let your soap sit for 24 hours. Let it sit for another 12-24 hours if your soap is still soft or warm. Once cold and firm, remove your soap and place onto parchment paper or a baking rack. Allow your soap to cure for about a month or 4 weeks but turn each piece of soap over at least once a week to ensure air gets to all the sides of the soap.If you’re using a loaf pan for your mold, you should cut the loaf into bars before the 4 week curing period.

, Once cured, wrap your soap in wax paper or place it in an airtight container because handmade soap creates glycerin, which pulls moisture from the air. Moisture may attract debris and dust so keeping your soap covered will keep them clean and pure., Neutralize the lye with white vinegar before washing your equipment. Let all your equipment sit for several days because residual lye will may burn your hands while fat will be very difficult to remove if fresh. Waiting allows the residual lye and fat to become soap that washes away when soaked in hot water., Protect your hands because soap batter may still irritate your skin even though most of the saponification is over. Goggles and an apron are also great for protecting your eyes and clothing., Scrape any extra soap batter with a spatula. Use paper towels to wipe raw soap from bowls and utensils. Getting rid of any extra raw soap material before washing cuts minimizes any harm the oils and lye might do to your pipes or septic tank., Place all containers, bowls, and utensils in your sink once you’ve removed any excess soap. Soak and wash in hot water and dish soap Grease-cutting dish soap and a special sponge for utensils work best., Grease-cutting dish soap and extremely hot water helps to both prevent clogging and greasy residue on your bowls and utensils. Handmade soap is gentle on the hands so don’t be afraid to touch any soap material."

This will help the soap melt faster and more evenly.Some types of melt-and-pour soap bases have cutting guidelines, which you can use. Make sure that you are using the melt-and-pour type of soap base, as regular bars of soap from the store won't melt. You can find melt-and-pour soap bases in the craft store and online.


You can also use 12 ounces (340.2 grams) of white glycerin melt-and-pour soap base instead.Melt-and-pour soap is a great way to get started in soap making because you won't be working with lye, which can be dangerous.;
, There are two ways you can do this: in a double-boiler on the stove or in a glass container the microwave. Choose the method that works the best for you, then remove the soap from heat. Keep it in the container you melted it in.


Stove: Assemble a double-boiler. turn the heat on to low. Add the soap to the top bowl. Allow the soap to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally. Take the pot off the stove, then let the soap finish melting.Microwave: heat the soap for 30 seconds. Give it a stir, then heat it for 10 seconds. Stir it once more, then continue heating and stirring at 5 second intervals until the soap has melted., Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot while you stir. This will help keep things from settling on the bottom., This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help make the soap more nourishing., Stir them in with a spoon until the color of the soap is consistent and no streaks remain. You don't have to add the dye in, but it will help make your soap more pink and reminiscent of calamine lotion.You can also leave out the dye if you prefer.


Make sure that you are using soap making dye. Candle dye and fabric dye are not skin safe, and food coloring can stain.

, Once again, you don't have to do this, but it can make the soap smell nicer. Use a calming fragrance, such as rose or lavender. If this is for a kid, try something associated with the color pink, such as bubblegum or cotton candy.Make sure that fragrance oils meant for soap making. The kind used for making candles are not considered to be skin-safe.You can try using essential oil instead of fragrance oil. Make sure that it is skin-safe as not all essential oils are.

, You can use a round or square PVC mold. You can also use individual soap molds as well. If you use a round or square mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars after it dries.For a more unique mold, cut off the bottom 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of six water bottles, and use that instead.If the mixture forms bubbles, spray the surface with rubbing alcohol. This will make the bubbles disappear., This will take 30 minutes if you are using several small molds. It may take up to several hours if you are using one big mold., Simply turn the mold over, and pop the soap out. You may have to wiggle the sides to loosen the soap. If you used a large mold, such as a round or square PVC mold, you will need to slice the soap into smaller bars. You should be able to make 3 to 4 bars.Once you pop the soap out of the molds, it is ready to use!

Put on a pair of goggles, a mask, rubber gloves, and along sleeved shirt.Have an accurate, digital scale ready. Your measurements must be precise, or they may not saponify properly.


You will use the scale to measure everything, including the liquid ingredients.This recipe will make a lot of soap. You can resize this recipe to make a smaller amount, but you will need to use an accurate soap-making calculator to convert the amounts., Measure and pour 38 ounces (1123.79 grams) of cool water into a large pitcher first. Next, measure out 15 ounces (425.25 grams) of lye and sprinkle it into the water.Let it heat to 200°F (94°C), then stir with spoon for 30 seconds to dissolve the lye.Never add water directly into lye, as this will cause the lye to erupt.Use a pitcher designated specifically for this purpose. Do not reuse this cup for anything else.
There are different types of lye used for soap making. You want to use Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH)., Cover the pitcher with lid, then place it some place where it won't tip over. Let the solution cool down to 100 and 125°F (38 to 52°C). This can take 30 min to 2 hours., You will need: 2 pounds (907.2 grams) coconut oil, 2 pounds (907.2 grams) olive oil, 1 pound 6 ounces (623.7 grams) soybean oil, 1 pound 2 ounces (510.3 grams) palm oil, 0.8 ounces (22.68 grams) coco butter, and 0.4 ounces (11.34 grams) shea butter.You can do this in a large pot or in a double-boiler, if you can find one big enough. Heat them up to somewhere 100 and 125°F (38 to 52°C)., Wait for the oil and butter mixture to cool down to at least 125°F (52°C), then pour in the cooled lye solution. Mix everything together using a stick blender set to low speed. Keep the blender near the bottom of the pot.Be careful so that the mixture doesn't splash. It hasn't saponified yet, so it is still caustic and can cause burns.

, Trace happens after 3 to 5 minutes. It will turn runny and pudding like. If the blender leaves marks on the surface when you pull it out, you're at trace. Be prepared to work quickly during the next few steps as the mixture will start to harden., Mix about 1 teaspoon of red iron oxide dye with ½ tablespoon of glycerin or olive oil. Stir it into the soap mixture until it is almost the same color as calamine lotion. Don't worry if the mixture looks a little dark. The zinc oxide in the next step will help lighten it up.You may not end up using all of your prepared dye.

, You will need between ½ and ¾ cups (663.28 and 994.91 grams). Keep adding the zinc oxide until the mixture is the same color as calamine lotion. Combined with the iron oxide, the zinc oxide will help make your skin less itchy. Both zinc oxide and iron oxide are important ingredients in calamine lotion., You will need 4 ounces (113.4 grams) total. You can use any fragrance or combination of fragrances you what. A combination of chamomile, lavender, and tea tree would work especially well., You can also use several smaller molds instead. Some molds will need to be lined with parchment paper or plastic wrap first.Other molds, usually those made from silicone, do not need to be prepared.


Tap bottom of mold against counter to release any bubbles.
Some people like to leave the top of the soap bumpy. If you want it smoother, run a spoon over it.

, Wrap some plastic wrap over the mold(s) first, then cover them with blankets and quilts. This will keep the soap insulated while it hardens and saponifies.you can take a peek every now and then. If you see a crack forming on the soap, it's getting too hot. Remove the blankets., Remove the soap from the mold(s) first, then cut it into bars. Spread the bars out on a baking sheet. Place them some place where they won't be disturbed. Let them cure for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the soap will have saponified. It's ready to be used!"

Let it dry further for several weeks before using.",How to Make Bar Soap," This method is called ""cold process"" soap making but it actually requires a fair bit of heat, not to mention dangerous chemical reactions. It can take over an hour of constant stirring, followed by up to eight weeks of ""curing"" before it is ready to use.


Follow the melt and pour method for an easier, safer, and less time consuming process.
Never use this method when around kids.;
, Making soap from scratch involves the use of lye. This is a natural product made from wood ash, but it is extremely caustic and can dissolve skin, melt kitchen utensils, and cause an explosion if used improperly.Always wear rubber, plastic, or latex gloves to protect your hands.

Always wear safety goggles that protect your eyes from every side. Lye can permanently damage your eyes. Ordinary eyeglasses are not sufficient.

Always wear long sleeves and long pants that fully cover your skin.

Always work in a well ventilated area. Use a fan blowing out the window to increase ventilation if necessary. To be extra cautious, move all open containers with lye to a well ventilated room whenever they are not in use, making sure everyone in your house knows to avoid it.

Always use separate containers and utensils for soapmaking than for food preparation and eating. Make sure everyone in your house knows where your special soapmaking implements are kept so they don't use them for food. The exception is pots and utensils that only come into contact with the oil mixture, before it is added to the lye.

Never pour water into lye. Always add the lye to the water, small amounts at a time. Pouring the water on top of the lye will create a lye explosion that spatters everything nearby.

Never use aluminum for soapmaking. Lye and aluminum react dangerously, releasing fumes and ruining your soap. Always use stainless steel, heat-safe glass, or heat-safe plastic for all containers and stirring implements involved in soap making. A wooden spoon or stick will work for a while, but the lye will eventually break it apart and put splinters into your soap.

Never leave lye or freshly made soap somewhere a kid or pet can reach it. Let everyone in your house know about these safety risks before you begin.

, Read this beforehand and become familiar with safety procedures in case of accident. If you do get lye on yourself or someone else, here's what to do:If you get lye on your eyes, take out your contacts if you are wearing them. Immediately rinse your eye under cold water for fifteen minutes. Have someone else contact medical emergency services while you do this, or wait until your eye is rinsed before calling.
If you swallow lye or freshly made soap, drink regular tap water. Do not try to vomit. Call medical emergency services immediately, then the poison control center. Look up the number of your region's poison control center before beginning the soapmaking process.
If you get lye on yourself, remove any articles of clothing covering it and rinse the affected area in cold water for at least fifteen minutes.

, You can use all kinds of vegetable oils to create soap, but the amount of other ingredients you need varies depending on the type. If this is your first time making soap, make a small batch with one or two types of oil. Even an ordinary kitchen vegetable oil will work.For a simple recipe that's a little fancier than kitchen vegetable oil, try pure hemp seed or palm oil, or mix one of them with or equal parts olive oil.For a creamier soap with more lather, use 1 part coconut oil, 1 part palm oil, and 1 part olive oil. A small amount of sweet almond oil added to this mixture creates a pleasant scent.Whichever oils you pick, the total amount for your first batch should be 16 oz (450 grams) or less. Measure by weight if you have a kitchen scale, since this is more accurate than volume measurements.
Read a book about making soap or look at this chart for an idea of how each type of oil affects your soap.

, If you are following a specific recipe for the amounts and types of oils you chose, you can use the amount of lye specified in that recipe. Otherwise, find an online lye calculator and enter the amounts and types of oils you are using.


Try the pine meadows or MMS calculators, or use a search engine to find your own.
Be sure to set the calculator to the correct settings. Don't accidentally enter your amount in grams if your recipe calls for ounces.
If there is a ""superfatting"" box, set it to 5%, a good default consistency for soapmaking.

, Some of these instructions may not make sense if you have not read part I. You also risk serious injury if you skip the safety instructions before handling lye.

, Using the amount in the recipe or derived from the lye calculator, measure your water into a heat-safe glass or plastic container such as a Pyrex measuring cup. Metal will get hot and may corrode when you add the lye, so even stainless steel is not recommended for this purpose.


If you halved a recipe to make a small beginner's batch, remember to halve every ingredient, not just the oil.

, Carefully measure out the lye into a heat-safe glass or plastic container. If using a small amount of lye, you can measure it in a paper ""cup"" formed from half an envelope. Handle with caution regardless, to avoid spills.


Lye is usually sold at hardware stores or online.
Measuring by weight is more accurate than measuring by volume and will produce better results.

, Stir continually with a stainless steel or heat-safe plastic implement. Let the mixture grow warm and turn white before you add more lye. Continue until all the lye is mixed into the water and the mixture is scalding hot.



Never pour the water into the lye or dump the entire packet of lye into the water. This can cause a massive lye explosion that will splatter everything nearby with dangerous chemicals.
Do not breathe near or directly above the mixture, as it releases dangerous lye fumes.

, You should let it cool to at least 125ºF (50ºC) but 110ºF (43ºC) or less is ideal. You should move on to the next step while you wait, since you'll need to heat the oils up to a similar temperature before the lye is ready., The goal is to get the oils about 10ºF (5.6ºC) cooler than the lye or less, so get the oils to roughly 110ºF (43ºC), or about 125ºF (50ºC) if the recipe you're using specifically says the mixture can handle the higher temperature.


This mixture of hot oils is referred to as ""fixed oils"" in some recipes.
Do not heat the oils hotter than the lye mixture., Think about whether you need a larger container first, but only use Pyrex or stainless steel. Pour the oils slowly into the lye and water mixture.

, This could take fifteen minutes to half an hour or even longer, depending on the type of oils you used. If stirring by hand, use a stainless steel or heat-safe plastic implement, and be aware that it will probably corrode after long use.


Only use a stainless steel electric mixer or stick blender if you have the soap batter in a deep container to prevent splattering. They will greatly speed up the stirring process, but you should not use them again for cooking. Be aware that they will corrode after multiple batches.
If using a stick blender, fully submerge it in the batter before turning it on. Tap it against the side to release air bubbles, then set it to low. Once the mixture is much thicker, you can set it to medium or high.

, If you have any essential oils, herbs, or thickeners such as colloidal oatmeal, stir it into the batter at this time. Typically, a soap contains no more than 6% additives by volume, so go easy with them.Read the label on essential oils to see if they are safe for skin.
Stir them in thoroughly to spread them evenly throughout the soap.

, The result is called a ""trace"" after the lingering trace lines left by the movement of the stirrer. Another way to test it is to lift the stirring implement up. The soap batter should clump to it, and when it falls, the drop should stay supported on the batter's surface.If it is taking a long time to thicken and your arms are getting tired, you can take a fifteen minute break after at least fifteen minutes of stirring.

, Soap molds are simply boxes for the liquid batter to set in. Any clean, dry plastic container will work, or you can buy a silicone mold. If using a wooden container, line it first with a silicone lining or freezer paper. The latter is available in supermarkets.

, Fill each mold to near the top; you'll be cutting it into smaller bars later. Use a rubber spatula to scrape out the remaining batter.


Drop the mold from two inches (a few centimeters) above the counter to jar any air bubbles out of your soap. Do this several times if your mixture looks frothy., Tape a piece of cardboard over the mold to cover it. Wrap a towel around the entire mold to insulate it and ensure proper setting.

, The ""saponification"" process that results in a solid bar takes about a day to reach a good stage for cutting. Remove from the mold after that period has passed and cut into more convenient, smaller bars.


Keep your soap at room temperature and out of reach of children. It is still dangerous to touch when freshly made.
Wait an additional day or two if it is still soft.

, Leave the soap bars out in the open to dry somewhere people won't move them. Put them on top of wax paper or a similar disposable material to prevent the oils damaging the surface they are sitting on. They will form usable soap after 3 to 8 weeks, depending on the oils used.


Wait for at least four weeks if you are not following a specific recipe.

Understand that the basic ash soap making process involves a chemical reaction of adding a fatty acid (oil) to a base (lye) to get ""a salt"" (soap).,
Choose and buy the type of lye that you will be using for the ash soap preparation.,
Obtain the fat needed for the ash soap making process.,
Choose any preservatives, oils, or fragrances that you want to add to the soap.,
Find soap molds to pour your soap in for shape.,
Pour 3 cups of distilled water into a 2-quart pot.,
Heat the water on the stove, and slowly add 1 can (12 ounces) of sodium hydroxide lye.,
Add fragrance and oil.

,
Cool for 1 hour.

,
Add the lye mixture to room-temperature lard in a large dishpan.,
Stir for 15 minutes.

,
Pour into molds, and allow the ash soap to cool and harden completely.

",How to Make Ash Soap," Too much of the alkaline part can cause the soap to be caustic and cause skin burns. Too much fat can cause the soap to be greasy.;
,

Homemade lye comes from wood ashes and can be made by making an ash hopper and allowing the lye to leech out of the ashes. The ashes are added to the hopper and periodically soaked with water. The lye is collected as it seeps out of the hopper. This lye is less caustic than store-bought lye and is composed of potassium hydroxide.






Commercial lye is composed of sodium hydroxide and may be purchased as granules. To properly make soap, the lye should be pure sodium hydroxide and there should be no flecks of gray or black on the crystals.







,

You may choose to render your own fat from butchered animals by cleaning the lard from pigs or the tallow from cattle. The rendering of fat is done by putting equal amounts of lard and water in a pot over an outside flame and boiling until all fats are melted. Remove from the heat, and add an amount of water equal to the first. Allow this to sit overnight. The hardened fat that forms will clean of all impurities. This may also be done with leftover cooking grease.






You may also choose to buy purified lard from the store.






Lard may be either animal or vegetable based.







,


These can be bought online at soap making sites, or in a hobby/craft supply store that has soap making supplies.

, Make your own with items around the house such as the bottom of a round, plastic container, or buy shaped molds at a craft supply store.

, The water should be very cold, and you may wish to refrigerate it the night before. The pot should be glass or enamel.

Cure the soap.",How to Make Black Soap," Palm oil, palm kernel oil, shea butter, or cocoa butter are traditionally used as base oils in Africa.If using palm oil, you can extract it yourself by processing coconut palms in a hand press.Since this is laborious work, and palms are hard to come by in some regions, you can purchase palm oil that has already been extracted.
The amount of base oil needed will vary depending on how much soap you wish to make. The amount of oil used should not exceed half the capacity of your double boiler. However, those who wish to make a larger amount of soap generally process it in batches.;
, In order to ensure consistent texture, oven roast or sun dry the plantain skins (or alternative ingredient)., Now, burn the plantain skins (or alternative ingredients), creating an ash that will be leached to release its component parts.


Plantain skins are typically used in Africa, but plantains are rare in many other countries. Soap makers typically replace them with cocoa pods, palm tree leaves, or shea tree bark. Often, a combination of these ingredients is used.The amount of skins and pods needed will vary depending on how much soap you are making and how concentrated you would like the black ingredients to be in your soap.
The ashes contain potassium hydroxide, a precursor to many solid and liquid soaps., Add the ashes to 2 cups of warm, distilled water and stir until they are dissolved.


Add more ashes or water as needed until the liquid is as dark and concentrated as you would like.
Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat.
Once the ashes have dissolved completely, remove the ash/water mixture from heat, and strain it through a fine strainer, setting aside the remnants.

, Using a double boiler, heat the base oil over low heat until it's melted and heated through.

, Pour the ashy liquid to the heated base oil, while stirring. Add more ashy liquid until you achieve the desired shade of dark brown or black. Continue stirring over low heat until the liquid is smooth.

, If desired, add drops of essential oil, such as lavender, or dried plants, such as chamomile. Traditional African black soap does not contain any additives, but some soap makers prefer to make their own scented versions of the soap.

, As you continue stirring the mixture, a frothy, waxy substance will begin to form at the surface. Scoop this liquid soap from the surface of the double boiler as it forms, continuing until all the water has boiled off. Transfer it into molds.

, The soap must be left in the molds for up to two weeks to cure. This will allow the soap time to solidify before use. The finished product will be solid, but malleable when pressed.

Begin by gathering the items that are necessary to start the project.,
Purchase the base soap.,
Decide if you wish to purchase a soap mold from a craft store.,
Make a trip to an essential oil supplier and discuss with a qualified sales person what organic oils would be best for your project.",How to Make Baby Soap1," Most items are readily available and can be found right in your kitchen. You will need 2 different sized pots, one slightly smaller than the other. Using an old smaller pot is best as it will not be suitable for cooking in after this project. A coffee can or tin bowl that fits inside a larger pot can be substituted for the second pot. A double boiler is ideal for this project. In addition, you will need a spatula, freezer wrap, a sharp sturdy knife, paper wrap, and a cardboard box or soap mold.
, Check your local suppliers for organic soap base or order from an online supplier. This generally comes in a huge block. There are several different bases available and the gentleness differs from one to the other. Request a safe base that is suitable for a baby., There are many cute molds available that come in a variety of sizes. This is an optional step. A soap mold would replace the need to make a box mold. The recipe and remaining steps will remain the same., Some oils will be better suited for baby while others are best avoided. Keep in mind that there is a difference between essential oils and perfume or massaging oils. Organic markets may carry the oils as well and they generally hire a person trained in the safe use of oils."

If you are using a coffee pot or tin bowl, be sure to keep the water level from reaching the top., When the water has boiled, lower the temperature to maintain a constant source of even heat. It is best to avoid placing the second pot into the boiling water to prevent water from splashing into it., Smaller sections will make it easier to quickly melt the soap at an even pace. Try to keep track of how much soap you are cutting. Is it 1 pound, 2 pounds? This will make a difference when it comes time to add the oil., Use a little caution if you are using a coffee pot or tin bowl to prevent causing a burn to yourself. If you are using a double boiler this should present no problems for you.,, Stir it up a little if necessary. Stirring will help distribute the heat evenly. This can take a bit of time, often up to an hour., Add oil sparingly. Better to have a mildly scented soap than to create a soap that will be overbearingly scented., Keep the shiny surface of the wrap up to assist with easier removal. Be sure to cover all areas. Overlap the paper if necessary to avoid any bare spots. Omit this step if you purchased soap molds., It could take up to 24 hours to completely set., Prepare to cut the soap into bars by marking off sizable sections. A sharp knife can be used. The best approach to getting even bar cuts is to use a ruler and utility knife., Press down gently but firmly until you have completely sliced through each section. Take your time and be patient if you wish to obtain a clean cut., You can try to duplicate a store wrapper or create your own wrapping design. If you really want to get fancy you could embellish each wrapper with a decorative design., The cover will help maintain the aroma of the soap."

Pour it into containers.",How to Make Castile Soap," Prepare a work space in your kitchen or near a source of water, and lay out your equipment so everything is at the ready. The bowls, measuring tools and other utensils you use should be reserved for soapmaking only - don't use them when you're making food, since residue from the soap will remain on them. You'll need the following equipment to make Castile soap:


Large measuring cup
Stainless steel pot
Large bowl
Spatula
Handheld blender or mixer
Meat thermometer
Kitchen scale
Rubber gloves and safety goggles (for handling lye)
Lye crystals (these come in plastic containers, and you can store what you don't use; you'll need 4.33 ounces (122.8 grams) to make 10 medium bars of soap);
, True Castile soap is made with 100 percent olive oil, but many soap makers  use a blend of oils to create a soap with balanced properties. Pure olive oil soap has doesn't produce fluffy suds, and it results in soap bars that are a little slimy in texture. Coconut oil is commonly added to help produce better suds, and palm oil helps the soap bars firm up. A ratio of 8 parts olive oil, 1 part coconut oil and 1 part palm oil produces fine soap. For the purposes of this soap recipe, measure out the following oils. You'll end up with a total of 34 ounces (1005.5 milliliters) of oil:


27.2 ounces (804.4 milliliters) olive oil
3.4 ounces (100.55 milliliters) coconut oil
3.4 ounces (100.55 milliliters) palm oil

, If you want to scent your soap, you'll need 10 drops of your favorite essential oil, or a combination of more than one essential oils amounting to 10 drops. Increase the amount of essential oil you add for a stronger scent, or scale it back to 5 - 7 drops for a milder scent. Common essential oils used in Castile soapmaking include:


Peppermint
Orange, lemon or grapefruit
Lavender
Rose
Vetiver
Pine
Sandalwood
Bergamot

, The mold you use will determine the size and shape of your finished bars. If you want to make rectangular bars of soap, choose a rectangular soap mold shaped like a loaf pan; the soap will come out in a loaf shape, and you'll be able to cut it into bars as thick as you want. Line the mold with waxed paper so that the soap easily separates from the mold.


Molds are available at craft and soapmaking supply stores, and you can check online for a large variety of options.
If you don't want to go to the trouble of buying a mold, you can convert an old shoebox into an adequate soap mold. Just find a sturdy shoebox, reinforce the corners with tape to seal the edges, and line it with waxed paper.
You can also make your own soap mold using wood, or turn an existing wooden box into a soap mold.The mold should be as wide and deep as you'd like the finished soap bars to be.

, Lye is a caustic chemical that can burn the skin and eyes and is hard on the lungs when inhaled. If this is your first time working with lye, take extra care to make sure that you handle it safely. Put on your rubber gloves and protective goggles before opening the container of lye. Open some windows and turn on a fan to make sure the room is well ventilated.


Keep a bottle of white vinegar nearby. If you spill some lye on the counter, the vinegar will neutralize it.
If you accidentally touch or inhale too much lye, immediately call your country's Poison Control Center phone number, which you can find by doing an online search. The US National Poison Control Center number is 1-800-222-1222.

, When you mix lye and water, it's important to use exact measurements. For this soap recipe you need 10 ounces (295.7 milliliters) of water and 4.33 ounces (122.8 grams) of lye. Using separate containers, measure out these exact amounts using your kitchen scale. Carefully add the lye to the water. The mixture will immediately begin to heat up and become cloudy, then clear a bit as it cools. It will take several minutes for the mixture to cool. Use the meat thermometer to test the temperature. The lye is ready to use when it reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).


Never add water to lye - always add lye to water. Adding water to lye creates an explosive reaction.
When you weigh out the ingredients, be sure to zero out the containers you're using first so that they aren't included in the measurements.
If you're creating a bigger or smaller batch of soap, use a lye calculatorto find the exact amount of water and lye to use.

, While the lye is cooling, heat up the oils. Place them in a saucepan and heat them using medium high heat. Stir the oils to incorporate them. Continue heating the oils until the mixture reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius). Use the meat thermometer to determine when the oils are ready to mix with the lye. The oils and lye must be as close as possible to the same temperature to properly blend.


Neglecting to make sure both the oil and lye are close to the same temperature will result in soap that doesn't set up correctly. Be sure to use the meat thermometer to measure both mixtures and complete this crucial step.

, Pour the lye mixture into the oil mixture. Use a handheld blender or mixer to begin blending everything together. After a few minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken. When you can see the trail left by the blender, the mixture has reached ""trace."" It should have the consistency of honey.


You can use a spoon to blend the lye and oils, but it takes much longer to reach trace this way.

, Once the mixture reaches trace, you can add oils to scent to the soap. Pour in 10 drops of essential oil and blend them with the soap until the mixture is thoroughly incorporated.

, Be careful not to spill the soap as you pour it directly into the mold. Cover it with a clean dishcloth or towel, making sure the cloth doesn't touch the soap itself, but drapes over the sides of the mold. This will protect the soap from getting dust or bugs in it. Let it sit for 48 hours.


During the first 48 hours, the soap will set up and harden a bit. However, it's not ready to use; it has to cure first, so that the water evaporates and the soap becomes milder. Don't use the soap right away, as it will be harsh on your skin.
Examine the top of the soap after 48 hours have passed. If it has a film on top, or looks as though it has separated, the soap won't be useable. Either it has too much lye, which could hurt your skin if you use it, or the lye and oils didn't properly blend. Unfortunately, there's no way to save it if this happens - you'll have to discard the soap and start again.

, A store-bought soap mold will have removable sides you can simply detach from the sides of the soap log. If you used a shoebox, you can tip the soap out or cut away the sides. If you used custom molds, you can simply pop them out.

, Decide how thick you want the bars to be. One inch is standard, but you could make thinner or thicker bars if you choose. Use a ruler to measure out the thickness of the bars, and make evenly-spaced notches along the soap loaf to indicate where you'll make the cuts To cut the bars, you have the following options:


Use a sharp knife. Don't use one with a serrated edge, unless you want to intentionally give the edges of the soap a wavy appearance.
A bench cutter. This is a common baking tool used to cut dough, and it works well for cutting through soap.
A wire cheese cutter. Make sure the wire is taught so that you end up with a clean, vertical cut.

, Line a baking sheet or tray with waxed paper and lay the bars flat. Put them in a cool, dry place to cure for at least 2 weeks, and up to 9 months. The longer you wait, the better the soap will work; it'll produce fluffier suds and have a better texture.You can technically start using the soap after a few weeks. When it's ready to use, the soap should be hard, without a hint of chemical smell.

, This amounts to an average-sized bar of soap. Use a cheese grater or a knife to grate it into small flakes. This will help the soap combine with the hot water more easily.

, Pour the water into a pot and turn the burner to high heat. Bring the water to a full boil.

, Pour the water into a large plastic bowl or pitcher, then stir in the soap flakes. Let the mixture sit for a few hours until it thickens a bit. If the soap gets too thick, you may need to heat it and add more water. It should have the consistency of shampoo at room temperature.

, Keep the liquid soap in squeeze bottles, and store them in the bathroom or kitchen. The liquid soap will keep for months at room temperature. Use it to wash your hair and skin, your clothes, dishes, or other items in your home.

Assemble the supplies needed.,
Cut the soap base into chunks that are easily melted.,
Place the chunks into a heavy based saucepan.,
Heat the baking pan and saucepan over medium heat.,
Pour the melted soap into the cake pan.,

Place decorations on top of the cake.,
Display the cake.",How to Make a Soap Cake," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".;
, This will be around 2.5cm or 1 inch in size.

, Place this saucepan into a baking pan. Fill the pan with water up to the halfway mark of the saucepan.

, The soap will start to melt. When it does, add the essential oil and coloring.

, Allow it to set.


If you're wanting to make layers, like a layer cake, you'll need to follow the steps above for melting the soap as many times as you want differently colored layers. Simply pour each layer over the top of the last set layer of soap in the cake pan, until you're done.

, This layer should be a contrast color to the cake (such as white for vanilla or brown for chocolate). To make the frosting, whisk the melted soap base in the same manner you'd use for whipping cream. Once you see bubbles in it, pour it quickly over the set soap cake. If you want it over the sides too, remove the set soap cake from the cake pan first.


It is best to do this part in small batches, whipping a new batch each time, because you'll probably find that the whipped melted soap is setting almost as fast as you can spread it on the soap cake.

, At this point, you can continue to make soap decorations or you can take a shortcut and add ready-made decorations such as fabric flowers. If you do want to make soap flowers and leaves, here is what to do:


Melt the soap base in the colors required for the flowers. You'll also need to melt soap base in green for leaves; do that after you've made the flowers.
Spread out the melted soap thinly across a sheet of kitchen foil.
Roll the flower into a flower shape.
Continue to make as many flowers in desired sizes as needed.
Do the same for the melting the green soap, only when it is on the foil, cut out little leaf shapes rather than rolling. Use a butter knife to gently push in one long leaf vein and some side veins too.
To attach both flowers and leaves to the soap cake, dip the base of each item in hot soap base and stick in place on the top of the cake.

, It's unlikely that the cake will be mistaken for a real cake because soap has a distinctive glossy and chunky texture to it. However, it will impress everyone with its beauty, so place it on a cake stand as with a real cake and cut out one slice, which you can leave on its side to show the beauty of the inside and how clever you've been to make this! When it comes to time for your guests to go home, cut the soap cake into even slices and place in little cellophane bags. Tie with a ribbon and let each guest take home a piece to use in their bath or shower.

",How to Make a Candle out of an Orange,";
, Use the paring knife to slice into the peel of the orange. Insert only as far as the pith, taking the knife around the middle of the orange, going all the way around the circumference.








, Gently push your finger under the skin of the orange and peel the skin away so that it separates from the orange without tearing.








, Once separated from orange flesh, the orange peel should be easy to remove. When removing the orange flesh, a white wick-like “stem” part should remain––leave this intact, still attached to the peel.

, Pour olive oil (approximately 3 tablespoons) to cover the stem and allow wick to soak for a 2-3 minutes.








, The design is both pretty and functional, as it allows the candle to breathe. Create a design on paper first, to help prevent mistakes when cutting the orange. Then, take the top off the orange and score out the design you've made, using the paring knife.

, Light the orange’s stem with a lighter. This may take a couple of attempts. It might be easier to use extra long barbecue matches if you feel it's too cramped using a lighter.

Stir two different colors together to make swirled soap.,
Pour differently-colored bases at different times to create layers.",How to Make 'Melt and Pour' Soap," You can find melt and pour soap bases in arts and crafts stores and online. White or clear glycerin are the most popular choices. For a more luxurious bar of soap, try one of the following melt and pour soap bases: goat's milk, olive oil, or shea butter.










Do not use a plain bar of soap for this; it is not the same thing and it will not melt easily.;
, The size and shapes of the chunks do not have to be exact. Cutting the soap into chunks will simply help it melt faster and smoother.







, Place the soap chunks into a microwave-safe dish. Heat the chunks at 30-second intervals, stirring between each one, until they are melted. The melted base should be smooth and liquid-y, with no lumps or chunks.If you don't have a microwave, then do the following:








Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water.
Set a glass, heat-safe bowl on top.
Place the soap into the bowl and bring the water to a simmer.
Allow the soap to melt over low heat, stirring it occasionally.

, Once the soap has melted, set it down on the counter, and allow it to cool of slightly If you melted the soap over the stove, take the bowl off of the saucepan, then set it down onto a heat-safe surface.Adding dyes and fragrances to too-hot soap can affect the final color/fragrances.

, Use ⅛ teaspoon of dye or pigment powder per 1 pound (450 grams) of soap. You can add more later, if you want, but be aware that it may stain your skin.








If you are using pigment powder, stir it into 2 to 3 teaspoons of liquid glycerin first, then add the glycerin to the soap base.If you are using liquid dye, 3 to 6 drops will be enough for 1 pound (450 grams) of soap.Make sure that you use dyes made for soap making. Other types of dye, such as candle dye, are not skin safe.

, You can combine different oils to create a unique fragrance, or you can use just one type. Once again, make sure that you use oils that are either safe to use on skin or are labeled for soap making. Do not use candle fragrance oils, as they can irritate the skin. Listed below are the recommended amounts:








Fragrance oil: 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) total per 1 pound (450 grams) of soap.
Essential oil: ½ tablespoon (7.5 milliliters) total per 1 pound (450 grams) of soap.

, You can find soap making molds alongside the other soap making supplies in the arts and crafts store. You can get them in either plastic or silicone. If you can't find any, you can use silicone baking, chocolate, or cupcake molds instead.










You can use a larger, traditional mold, if you want to, but you will need to cut the soap into slices after you de-mold it.
If you are using a plastic soap making mold, you make want to coat the inside with petroleum jelly.

, This will send any air bubbles to the surface. If you see air bubbles, lightly spray the surface of the soap with rubbing alcohol., Do not get impatient and put it into a fridge or freezer., Gently pull the edges of the mold away from the soap, then turn the mold upside-down, and pop the soap out. If the soap gets stuck in the mold, stick it in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, then rinse the outside of the mold under hot water for a few seconds.








If you used one big mold, you will need to cut the soap into smaller bars/slices after you remove it from the mold.

, Unlike traditional cold or hot process soap, melt and pour soap is ready to use. This is because it has already saponified and does not need to be cured. The edges may still be damp after you remove it from the mold, however. If this happens, simply let it sit out on a wire cooling rack for about an hour or so., Dried lavender, chamomile, and rose petals are great choices, but you can use others as well. You will need 1 to 2 ounces (6 to 12 grams) per 1 pound (450 grams) of soap. Add the herbs or flowers into the mold, before adding the soap. This way, they won't lose their color as much.You can also sprinkle the herbs or flowers onto the soap, after you have poured it into the mold, instead.
Keep the application in mind. Herbal soaps work great as a hand soap, but they may be too scratchy for the tub or shower.
Chop larger petals into smaller pieces so that they don't clog the drain.

, With just 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of ground spices, you can take your soap to a whole new level! Stir the spice into the soap after you take it off heat, along with any other colors or fragrances you might be using. Great choices include cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and ground tumeric.Consider limiting your fragrance or omitting it entirely.

, You will need them into the soap base as it is melting. Do not use regular butter made from cow's milk, or it will go rancid.,
Mango butter is great for calming irritated skin, treating sunburn, and reducing dryness.

, Extracts are not the same thing as essential oils or fragrance oils. While some of them may add fragrance to your soap, they are mostly used for their specific properties. Plan on using 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of extract per 1 pound (450 grams) of soap; add them alongside your dyes and fragrances. Listed below are common extracts and their benefits:Chamomile extract is calming and good for relieving stress. It is also antiseptic and anti-inflammatory.
Grapefruit seed extract is a natural disinfectant. It is filled with vitamins A, C, and E.
Green tea extract can help sooth sunburns, irritations, and acne.
Guava fruit extract contains vitamins A, B, and C. It is especially good for aging skin.
Papaya fruit extract is good for both dry and oily skin. It helps make your skin softer and smoother.

, Stir it into the soap base, right before you add it to the mold. In most cases, you will need to use 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams). Listed below are some popular choices:Jojoba beads and ground oatmeal are both gentle exfoliants, suitable for sensitive skin.
Fine-grained sea salt and sugar are medium-strength exfoliants.
Coffee grounds and strawberry seeds are coarser exfoliants. Limit yourself to 1 to 2 teaspoons.

, Some soap making molds come with pretty designs already embedded into them. Some of them, however, come as plain circles, ovals, squares, or rectangles. If you want a fancier bar of soap, place a soap making rubber stamp into the mold (design-side-up) before pouring the soap. You can find soap making rubber stamps alongside the rest of the soap making supplies in the arts and crafts stores. They are rubber sheets with raised designs, like ink stamps.

Match the shape of the stamp to the shape of you mold. Use a circle stamp for a round mold, and a square stamp for a square mold.
If the rubber stamp is stuck to the soap after you de-mold it, simply peel the stamp away.

, This is a great idea for kids soap. Place a small, plastic toy, like a fish or spider, into the soap mold. Pour the soap into the mold, over the toy, then let it set. When you de-mold the soap, the toy will be embedded inside.This is not recommended for solid-colored or opaque soap; the toy will not show up.

, Melt your soap as usual, then split it into two batches. Add a different color and fragrance to each batch. Pour the melted soap, one color at a time, into the mold, then gently stir it together to create swirls. Do not over-stir the soap, however, or the colors will mix.If you want your soap to be white with colored swirls in it, do the following:Make your soap base as usual, but omit the dye.
Pour the soap into the mold.
Add a drop of dye into each corner and the middle.
Stir the drops together using a toothpick.

, Prepare a half-batch of soap, and pour it into your mold. Prepare your next layer using the rest of the soap. Wait for the first layer to form a thick skin, then score it with a fork. Pour the second layer on top, and let the soap harden.Spray each layer with rubbing alcohol while it is still wet to reduce bubbles.
This method works better with larger soap molds. De-mold the soap once it's hard, then slice it into smaller bars to show off the layers.

Unclog drains.",How to Make Lye," To make potassium hydroxide lye, you need the white ashes from hardwood fires. When hardwood trees are growing, they draw potassium from the ground. This potassium doesn’t burn in the fire, and is still present in the ashes after the fire. You can then leach the potassium from the ashes with water.After every hardwood fire you have, allow the ashes to cool for a few days. Then collect the white ashes and store them in metal containers.
The best hardwoods for lye water include ash, hickory, beech, sugar maple, and buckeye.To make lye using this method, you'll need enough ash to nearly fill a wooden barrel.
Don’t use ashes from softwood trees, as these don’t contain enough potassium.;
, The second thing you need to make liquid potassium hydroxide lye is soft water. Rainwater is ideal because it’s soft and available in large quantities.


Set up a rain barrel in your backyard or under the eaves of your house to collect rainwater. Make sure there's a filter on the barrel to strain out leaves and organic debris.
Soft water has lower concentrations of other elements, so it’s ideal for soap making. Hard water will produce soap that doesn’t lather.You'll need at least 10 pints (4.7 L) of soft water to make lye water.

, After you fill your barrel with ashes, you'll run water through the ashes to leach the potassium. The water needs somewhere to drain out of, so you need to make holes. With a drill and a small drill bit, drill about six small holes into the bottom of the barrel.Concentrate the holes near the center of the barrel so the water will drain into a bucket.

, Fill the bottom of the barrel with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of clean stones and pebbles. The pebbles should be large enough that they don’t fall through the holes in the bottom. Cover the stones with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of dried straw.The straw and stones will act as a filter. The lye water will drain down through the straw and stones, leaving the ashes and particles on top.

, Transfer the wood ash you’ve collected in your metal buckets to the barrel. Shovel the wood ash over top of the straw. Fill the barrel to within 4 inches (10 cm) of the top of the barrel., Mount the barrel on sturdy blocks so the holes underneath are accessible. The barrel has to be high enough off the ground to accommodate a bucket underneath.You can also mount the barrel inside an open wooden frame.
Make sure the barrel is sturdy and will not fall over.

, Place a lye-safe bucket under the holes in the barrel. This bucket will catch the lye water, so it has to be a lye-safe material. Acceptable bucket materials include:Glass
Stainless steel
Number 5 plastics
Heavy-duty plastic

, Slowly add rainwater to the barrel by the bucketful. You want to add enough water in total to make the ashes wet, but not soaking. If you start to see the water line at the top of the bucket and the ashes are starting to float, stop adding water.Pay attention to how many bucketfuls of water you add. This will give you an idea of how many buckets of lye water to expect from the barrel.
You don’t have to put a lid on the barrel, but make sure that it’s protected from rain in case you get a storm.

, Lye is very caustic and corrosive. It burns skin, causes blindness, and can damage organic tissue and inorganic materials. When working with lye and lye water, it’s very important to be extremely careful and to wear personal safety equipment, including:Goggles
Hard shoes or boots
Elbow-length plastic gloves

, After a few hours, the first run of lye water will start to trickle out from the holes in the bottom of the barrel. Let the bucket underneath fill up to within 4 inches (10 cm) of the top of the bucket. When the bucket is full, carefully remove it from under the barrel. Be careful not to spill the lye water.


Replace the bucket with a fresh one to catch the rest of the water.

, Your lye water has to be a certain strength before you can use it to make soap. The lye water will probably not be ready after a single run, but you can test it. There are four different tests you can use to test the strength of the lye:Use pH test strips. You're looking for a pH of 13.
Use a pH meter to see if the pH is at 13.
Place a small potato in the lye water. If it sinks, the lye isn't strong enough. If it floats, the lye is ready.
Dip a chicken feather into the lye. If the feather doesn’t dissolve, the lye isn't strong enough yet.

, Most lye water solutions will have to be run through the ash barrel at least a second time. If your lye wasn’t strong enough after the first run, carefully pour all the lye water back into the ash barrel. Be extremely careful not to spill or splash the lye water, as it can burn your skin.Replace a bucket under the holes in the barrel.
Let the water drain through the ashes again.
The lye water that comes out the second time will be stronger.
When all the lye water has drained through a second time, test the pH again.
Run the lye water through again if necessary.

, Homemade lye water made from potassium hydroxide is ideal for making liquid soaps. You can also make your own castile soap, which uses a lot of fat to make a moisturizing soap.


Potassium hydroxide lye is not ideal for making hard bar soaps. To make these types of soaps, use sodium hydroxide, which you can buy from home improvement stores, farm supplies, and online.

, There are several foods, such as olives and lutefisk, that are traditionally cured with lye. You can use your homemade lye water to cure olives and other foods at home.

, Because lye is so caustic and eats organic materials like skin and hair, it has long been used as a household cleaner and drain cleaner. You can use your lye water to unclog drains in the laundry or utility room, clean bathtub drains, and unclog sink drains.

Shave as normal.,
Mix and Match.",How to Create a Superlather," Your shaving brush should have more water than normal. For best results soak your shaving brush in hot water using in a mug or shaving bowl preferably while showering. This will allow the brush to absorb the maximum amount of water preparing it for lather creation and shaving.
, A shaving bowl is needed to create superlather as it is used to for combining the shaving soap and cream together. You can use the shaving bowl used to soak your shaving brush in step one as this will heat the shaving bowl as well for warmer lather., In order for the soap and cream to properly and evenly mix together the cream should be spread around the bowl rather then placed in one spot. Use a little less shaving cream as you normally would when using just the cream by itself., It is best to use a glycerin based shaving soap especially if your shaving cream lacks this ingredient. Try to use shaving soaps that have qualities and ingredients that may be lacking in your shaving cream., Once the brush is loaded with shaving soap and the bowl with shaving cream, swirl the brush using circular motions in the bowl mixing the two together for at least a minute generating a rich creamy lather in the process., Continuously watch the shaving lather to see if it's too dry and has paste like qualities. If this is the case, add a few drops of water so the lather is properly hydrated and the brush moves around the bowl with ease., Your lather should look rich, creamy and have a shine to it when in direct light. When this is the case the lather can be applied to your face., Using circular motions with the shaving brush lather the shaving area of your face for at least a minute. This will make the lather even richer and allows it to get under your hairs while softening them as well making them easier to cut., Using your already learned shaving technique with the razor of your choice continue to shave as normal. After shaving, wash and dry your face and apply any aftershave treatment if desired., Part of the fun of creating superlather is the mixing and matching of various soaps and creams. Experimenting with creams and soaps that have various qualities and scents through superlather can be a never ending experience and allow you to find the ultimate shave."

Let the soaps cool, then pop them out.",How to Make Glycerin Soap1," Craft stores sell glycerin, which is a soap base, in solid, meltable blocks. If you're feeling ambitious, you can make your own glycerin, but it's easier to buy blocks of clear glycerin, white glycerin, or a different color. Clear glycerin soap always looks a little transparent, no matter what color you choose. In addition to glycerin, you'll need the following supplies:


Essential oils. Craft stores sell essential oils meant for use in glycerin soap. You'll only need a few drops to scent an entire batch of soap, so you can buy a small bottle. Choose lemon verbena oil, rose oil, lavender oil, peppermint oil, or another oil you'd like to use to scent your soap.
Soap molds. Craft stores sell many different types of molds, ranging from very small to very large in size. Be sure to get a type of mold that is usable for glycerin soap, which will pop right out of the mold as soon as it has set.
Rubbing alcohol. If you don't already have some in your medicine cabinet, pick up a bottle at the drugstore. Pour some into a clean spray bottle; you'll need it to remove bubbles from the glycerin before it sets.;
, Place the glycerin pieces in a double boiler, fill the boiler with water, and place it over medium heat. Continue heating the glycerin until it is completely melted.









If you don't have a double boiler, you can make one. Find two pots, a large one and a smaller one that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water. Set the smaller pot inside the larger pot so that it floats on the water. Place the pots on a burner over medium heat. Put the glycerin chunks into the dry, smaller pot and allow them to melt.
You can also melt the glycerin in the microwave. Place the chunks in a microwave safe bowl and heat them in 30 second increments until they are entirely melted.
You can melt the entire block of glycerin or just cut off a little at a time until you've melted an amount that seems suitable for your soap-making project.The finished soaps will have the same mass and volume as the glycerin chunks, they'll just be reformed into pretty shapes.

, Add just a few drops of the oil; since it's so concentrated, a little goes a long way. Use a wooden spoon to stir the drops in until they are thoroughly combined with the glycerin, then remove it from heat.








, Set the molds on a flat surface lined with paper towels. Use the spray bottle full of rubbing alcohol to lightly mist the insides of the soap molds, coating the area where the glycerin will go. The alcohol prevents bubbles from forming in the soap as it cools and dries. If you don't use alcohol, your finished soap may have a layer of bubbles.








, Lift the top of the double boiler and carefully pour the soap into the molds. Fill each mold to its rim. Be careful not to let it overflow, or the soap will come out misshapen.









If the soap is tricky to pour using your double boiler, use a funnel to pour it into a bottle or pitcher with a spout, then transfer the liquid to the soap molds. You'll have to do this quickly, though, so the soap doesn't get too cool before it makes it to the molds.
If necessary, reheat the soap before you pour it. Heat it back up in the double boiler or place it in the microwave for a few more short bursts of heat to make it easier to pour.

, Use the spray bottle to mist the soap after it has been poured into the molds and while it's still in its liquid stage. This way you'll prevent the formation of bubbles on the flat side of the soap, too.








, Let the soaps cool in their molds for an hour or two, until they're completely hard. Invert the soap molds to pop out your brand new glycerin soaps.









Tap the back of the mold gently if the soap does not come out right away.
Store the soaps in an air-tight container until you are ready to use them.

Choose some soap.,
Grate or cut the soap into small pieces.,
Place the soap into a double boiler.,
Pour some water into the soap.,
Start heating the soap, stirring every 5 minutes or so.,
Continue cooking and stirring the soap until it softens.,
Allow the soap to cool down to 150 to 160°F (66 to 71°C).You do not have to add the extras from this section if you don't want to, but they can make your soap feel more luxurious.,
Stir in some fragrance oil or essential oil for a nicer scent.,
Mix in some nourishing oils for extra luxury.,
Add a few drops of soap making dye for color.,
Add some texture with botanicals and exfoliants.,
Prepare the mold.,
Scoop the soap into the mold.,
Drop the soap mold.,
Allow the soap to dry for 1 to 2 days before de-molding it.,
Allow the soap to cure, if necessary.",How to Make a New Bar of Soap from Used Bars of Soap," You can use any type of soap you want, but something unscented and natural, such as pure-castile soap, would work best. This will give you more options for customization later on. Plan on using about 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.


Rebatch soap will have a grainy texture once cured. It will not be as smooth as a regular bar of soap.
If you are using multiple scraps of soap, try to use the same fragrance, otherwise, you might end up with a not-so-nice fragrance.
You can use different colors, but keep in mind that they may not always blend together to form a new color. Sometimes, they may appear as specks.;
, The easiest way to do this would be with a grater, but you can also mince the soap with a knife. The smaller the pieces, the faster your soap will melt.








, Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Set a heat-safe bowl on top; make sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water. Pour the grated soap into the bowl.









If you have a crock pot, you can use that instead.
You can also melt the soap directly in a saucepan without the bowl, but make sure that it's small so that the soap doesn't scorch., You will need 9 ounces (255 milliliters) of water per 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.This will help soften the soap up. Avoid adding too much liquid, however, or the soap won't dry properly.









If you want something extra-special, try tea or milk instead.You can also try goat's milk or buttermilk.
If you are using freshly-made cold process soap, you may not have to use as much liquid, if any at all., Turn the stove on to medium-high heat and allow the water to come to a boil. Stir the soap every 5 minutes or so with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Make sure that you scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl.








If you are using a crockpot, cover it with a lid and set it to high heat.You will still need to crack the lid open and stir it from time to time so that the soap does not burn.
If you are heating the soap in a pot, heat it over low heat., Rebatch soap will never fully melt like melt-and-pour soap. Instead, it will turn into a grainy mixture, sort of like oatmeal or mashed potatoes. Be patient. This can take about 1 to 2 hours.








At some point, the soap will no longer change texture. If some time has passed, and the soap still looks the same, it's not going to melt any further.You are ready for the next step.
If the soap starts to scorch, turn down the heat and add in a little cold water., You also don't have to add in all of the extras. Choose one or two (or three!) that appeal the most to you!

, Plan on using about ½-ounce (15 milliliters) per 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap.If your soap is already scented, you might want to skip this step, or use a similar fragrance. For example, if your soap base is lavender scented, you could add in an extra drop of lavender oil.









You don't need to use as much essential oil as fragrance oil. This is because essential oil is much more potent.
Do not use candle making fragrance oil. It is not skin safe.
Another option for fragrance is through spices. This will also give your soap some color. Plan on using 1 to 2 tablespoons (7.5 to 15 grams) of spices, such as ground cinnamon., If you want your soap extra fancy, add in a few drops of nourishing oils, such as vitamin E oil, jojoba oil, almond oil, etc. Anything that you'd put on your skin is great for soap. Don't get too carried away here, however; too much oil can affect the curing process!









Another nourishing additive is honey. Not only will it make your soap smell nice and more moisturizing, but it will also give it a nice, golden color. Plan on using ¼ to ½ cup (90 to 175 grams) of honey., Because soap-making dye is translucent, this option is only recommended for white-colored soaps. Purchase some soap making dye online or from an arts and crafts store. Add in 1 to 2 drops, then stir it in. Keep stirring until no streaks remain. If the color is not deep enough for you, stir in another drop.









Soap making dye is very strong. Mix in 1 to 2 drops at a time until you get the color you want.
You must use soap making dye. Do not substitute candle making dye, as it is not skin safe. Food coloring will not work either.
You can add dye to brighten an existing color. For example, you can deepen a light blue soap base with blue dye.

, This is great for those with dull or dry skin. The exfoliants gently buff away dry skin, leaving your skin feeling silky-smooth. Great choices include sea salt, oatmeal, and dried lavender buds. Here are the recommended amounts for every 12 ounces (341 grams) of soap:








¾ to 1 cup (90 to 120 grams) of exfoliants, such as oatmeal, almond meal, coffee grounds, etc.
1 cup (50 grams) of low volatile oil content herbs, such as chamomile, calendula, and lavender. They can be fresh or dried.
1 to 2 tablespoons (1 to 2 grams) of high volatile oil content herbs, such as rosemary. They can be fresh or dried.

, Purchase a plastic soap making mold. If your mold is plain and you want fancy soap, add in a rubber soap making stamp into the bottom, design-side-up. If you want to, lightly spray the inside of the mold with non-stick cooking spray. You can also rub a little bit of petroleum jelly into it.








You can purchase soap making molds and stamps online and in arts and crafts stores.
Alternatively, you could use a silicone ice cube tray or baking mold.

, Because of how thick this soap is, you won't be able to pour in. Instead, use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scoop the soap into its mold. Smooth the back of the mold down with the spoon or spatula.








, Hold the soap mold about 6 to 12 inches (cc to cc centimeters) above the counter, then drop it. This will settle the soap in the mold and release any air bubbles.You may need to do this a few times.

, Once the soap is dry, carefully pull it out of its mold. If you used a long, rectangular, soap making mold, you can cut the soap into 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) thick slices.








If you are in a hurry, pop the soap into a freezer for 1 to 2 hours before de-molding it., Depending on the type of soap you used, your rebatch may still feel a little soft and gummy. In this case, set it down on a wire cooling rack, and let it air dry for 2 to 4 weeks.If you used store-bought soap, you may not need to do this, but if you used freshly-made cold or hot process soap, you most likely will.


Some types of rebatch soap (typically made from store-bought bases) only need to dry for 2 days."

Make soap on a rope.,
Make soap of different colors.,
Add decorations to the soaps.,
Make your own molds.",How to Make Glycerin Soap2," After melting the glycerin, pour it into a large metal or plastic bowl. Add a few drops of the essential oil of your choice. Dip a length of rope into the liquid, then remove it from the bowl and let the liquid cool and harden. Dip it again to add a second coating, then remove it from the liquid and let the second layer cool and harden. Continue dipping the soap in this manner until the soap has reached your desired thickness.









Get creative with the material you use for your rope. Rather than dipping a straight length of rope into the glycerin, try tying it into a loop or a knot to create soap in different shapes.
Hang the rope from your shower head so it's handy to use each time you take a shower.

, You can buy a block of clear glycerin and color it yourself using cosmetic-grade coloring, available at craft stores. After melting the glycerin, separate it into a few different containers and add a few drops of coloring to each one before pouring the liquid into the soap molds.








, You can add solid objects to the soaps if you want to give them extra flair. This is a great way to personalize soaps to make favors for baby showers or kids' birthday parties, or to match your bathroom décor. Consider the following options:


Make floral soaps by suspending dried flower petals in the liquid glycerin before you pour it into the molds.
Make birthday party soaps by filling the molds halfway and then inserting a small toy, like a tiny plastic animal or other gadget, in the center of the soap. Pour more liquid soap over the toy to cover it completely.
Make baby shower soaps by pouring soap into the molds and then inserting small plastic rattles or other baby items into the soap.

, If you can't find a mold you like at the craft store, try making your own. Any hard plastic item can serve as a mold. If you use an item that's usually used to make food, be sure to wash it carefully before you use it again.


Ice cube trays make excellent soap molds. Use simple square trays or buy trays with interesting shapes, like fish, shells or skulls.
To make larger soaps, use small plastic bowls or cups. You could also use a recycled plastic container, like a yogurt cup.

Find one or more plain white mugs with a shape you like.,
Buy a package of oil-based Sharpie paint markers.,

Allow time for the marker to dry completely.,
Preheat your oven to around 425 degrees.,
Heat the mug in the oven for 20-30 minutes.,
Let the mug set up overnight.,
Wash used mugs by hand only.,
Stencil geometrical patterns or shapes.,
Create an abstract finish.,
Add a personalized message.,
Draw on your favorite character.,
Make a set of holiday-themed mugs.",How to Make Sharpie Mugs," Go on the hunt for a plain white mug with the right shape for the kind of design you wish to create. Mugs come in all different sizes, so explore your options. Think about how the shape of the mug might influence the design and vice-versa. Your mug can have a colored rim or handle, if you like, but make sure that the body is blank so that there’s plenty of room to draw.Cheaper mugs tend to work best for holding the Sharpie design because they typically make use of a thinner layer of glaze covering the outside of the mug.
Wash or wipe down your mug with rubbing alcohol and dry thoroughly before designing. This will get rid of any moisture, oils or fingerprint stains so that the Sharpie will draw on clean.;
, While some people have had success making mugs with regular Sharpie markers, others have reported smudging and fading and recommend an oil-based paint marker instead. These are only slightly more expensive than regular Sharpies and will set into the ceramic surface of the mug better to produce a more durable, longer-lasting design.Sharpie is the most recognizable brand of permanent marker, but it’s not your only option. Experienced crafters also recommend ArtDeco and Pebeo Porcelaine paint markers for a finish that won’t smear or wash away., Once you’ve got an idea in mind for what you’d like your mug to look like, make it a reality. Get creative: utilize different color combinations and take liberties with the shape of the mug and the space you have to work with, or blend text with visual elements for a collage look. The possibilities are practically endless!Use masking tape to craft precise lines and angles.Get as complex or minimalistic as you want. One mug might feature a single pastel flower design, while the next may be covered in a wild tessellation of bright colors.

, You’re going to want to let the marker dry completely on the surface of the mug before you cure it—this way, you’ll minimize the chances of the marker failing to set up in the ceramic and coming off too easily. After you finish designing your mug, let it sit in a well-ventilated area for a couple hours. Once the marker is dry enough to where it won’t smudge to the touch, it’s ready to go in the oven.Mugs decorated with oil-based paint markers will probably require a little longer to dry because of the thickness of the paint.

, Get your oven nice and hot in preparation to cure the unfinished mug. The dry heat from the oven will bake the marker or paint into the glaze of the mug, making it a permanent addition. The hotter the oven, the more thoroughly the marker will set in, but be careful not to set the oven any hotter than about 450 degrees, as this may cause the mug to crack or shatter.Put the mug in the oven before it has reached the specified temperature to allow the ceramic to warm more gradually.

, Stand the mug on a flat baking sheet and place it into the heated oven. It will take about half an hour in the oven for the ceramic to hold the marker. Keep an eye on the mug as it heats to ensure that it doesn’t become damaged. When heating multiple mugs at once, allow ample space between each mug so that the heat circulates more evenly between them.As the mug heats up, the outer coating of glaze will soften and the ink or paint will sink in, becoming permanent once it dries again.
Don’t leave your mug in the over for more than 30 minutes. Heating mugs in large batches might require a little extra time, but the chances of an empty mug shattering increase the longer it is exposed to intense heat.

, Turn the oven off and leave the mugs inside as it cools (ceramic is prone to cracking when exposed to abrupt changes in temperature). Then, find a dry, open space to leave the mugs to finish cooling and setting up overnight. By the time you wake up in the morning, the marker will have had sufficient time to fully infuse into the ceramic and the mug will be ready to use!Keep cooling mugs out of the reach of pets and children.

, If your mug is to be for drinking rather than display, it will need to be washed after use. This should always be done by hand rather than in the dishwasher. Simply take a small amount of dish soap and a dish scrubber or sponge and wash out the interior and rim of the mug, then dry gently with a clean towel.Some crafters claim that their mugs have held up fine under machine washing, but generally speaking the heat and pressure of dishwashers is extremely harsh on dishes with delicate designs.

, Using your masking tape and a pencil, outline and trace precise designs before painting. Give your mug vertical or horizontal stripes, zig-zags or a gridwork finish. Stenciling will allow you to create geometrical objects with much greater accuracy and neatness.Premade stencils can also be used to trace basic designs.
Try monogramming your initials onto a mug you use every day to help you keep up with it at work or in a busy household., Add an element of randomness when designing your mug for an abstract aesthetic. Don’t think too much about what you’re drawing, just let your hand take over for your mind. Use a variety of colors and texturing techniques like stippling and deliberate smudging to produce something entirely unique. No two abstract mugs will be the same!A little running or smudging will not matter on an abstract mug design, but make sure you still avoid washing the mug in a dishwasher, or the colors might bleed out entirely.

, Write out a quirky quote or slogan on a Sharpie mug for a unique handmade gift idea. Mark the mug with your own or someone else’s name for personal use, or use the design to commemorate a special event, such as a birthday or bridal shower. Adding script elements gives you full control over what your mug says to people, literally.Write the names of the bridal party on oversized mugs and stuff them with treats to create fun little gift baskets for a wedding shower.A hand-designed mug bearing a personal message could be given in place of a store bought card for mom and dad on Mother’s Day or Father’s Day.

, Why pay for an overpriced mug from an official merchandiser when you can make an original for a fraction of the cost? Emblazon the outside of your mug with your favorite comic book superhero or Disney princess and incorporate other accents and visual features as you please.Search the internet for printable templates if you’re having a hard time drawing a character on the curved mug surface.

, Deck your Sharpie mugs out with elves and holly leaves for the Christmas season, or spooky spiders and a glowing jack-o-lantern for Halloween. Create a set of one-of-a-kind mugs that you can break out on every major decorative holiday. Make enough mugs for everyone to have one when you have company over; you can even let your guests keep the mugs as gifts.Serve hot chocolate, spiced cider or punch in your Sharpie mugs at holiday-themed parties.
Your collection of holiday mugs will make great display pieces year-round, even when they’re not in use for a particular season.

Use the vase to display flowers.",How to Wrap a Vase with Burlap," For this type of project, it will be best to use a simple rounded vase or candle holder that’s roughly the same width from top to bottom. This will allow the burlap to wrap tighter and lay flat against the body of the vase.Spruce up an old, unused vase that you’ve had in storage to instantly revitalize it.
Shop around for a new vase that’s just the right shape and size for the design you have in mind.;
, Take the loose end of the burlap and press it to the center of the vase, or whichever section is thickest. Unwind the rest of the roll and guide it around the vase until it meets the loose end. Pull the burlap taut to prevent it from sliding down the vase.If the vase you’re using is curved or tapered, line up the edges of the burlap as best as you can and trim any corners that stick out.
It may help to tape the loose end of the burlap in place while you measure.

, You should overlap the edges of the burlap a few inches so that the vase is completely covered all the way around. Run your scissors straight up the roll. Make sure both edges are straight and in line with one another.You may need to trim or iron the crimped edge of the burlap roll before you get started.Overlapping the edges of the burlap will also make it easier to glue them down.

, Using a hot glue gun, dab a few spots of glue down the inside edge of the burlap, then pull the opposite end over the top and press down firmly. Hold the edges together until the glue is dry.You can also glue the strip of burlap directly to the vase itself. It will be much more secure, but the vase will show unsightly glue marks should you decide to remove it., As you did with the burlap, stretch out the roll of ribbon and wind it around the vase. Make sure the ribbon is centered with the strip of burlap. Plan on cutting the ribbon a little longer so that it reaches all the way around.Choose a white, dark or brightly colored ribbon that offsets the burlap.
Look for ribbons with eye-catching patterns or styled edges. This will help create a further sense of depth.

, Determine how long you want the ribbon to be and snip it accordingly. A short ribbon can be attached in the exact same manner as the burlap strip, while a longer ribbon can be tied into a bow. This will give you a few more options in customizing the look of the finished vase.Practice tying bows before you make any actual cuts to the ribbon to avoid cutting it too short.

, Line up the edges of the ribbon and glue them into place for a smooth, streamlined look, or leave them longer and tie them into a bow for a more fanciful finish. For added security, go around and glue down the ribbon to the burlap. You might also choose to leave it loose so that you can switch it out for other colors and designs later.To replace the ribbon layer on your vase, simply slide off the old ribbon and cut a new one to fit.
If you decide to tie the ribbon, use an extra dab of glue to make sure the bow holds., Glue mismatched buttons down the burlap seam, or find fabric flower buds or other unique and attractive items to enhance the look of your vase. You could even rummage through your home to find miscellaneous improvised accents to include, such as bottle caps, pins or old jewelry.Browse craft shops and home goods stores for handsome trinkets that might make a good addition to a burlap vase.

, Before you attach the ribbon, cut a length of lace to drape over the burlap. This will lend the vase a more delicate, sophisticated look. Trim the lace so that it’s a little narrower than the burlap strip—that way each layer will be distinctly visible.Vases adorned with burlap and lace make ideal centerpieces for an outdoor wedding.Top the lace with a separate ribbon, or tie the ends of the lace and ribbon together to form a more elaborate bow.

, Fill the vase with water and stick in a fresh-cut bouquet, arranging the flowers around the outer edges of the vase. The vibrant floral elements will contrast pleasantly with the muted texture of the burlap. You’ll have a vase that’s simple, chic and can be put to use for any number of formal or casual occasions.Smaller vases and candle holders could also be filled with sand and soil and used to house flowering succulents.Select a ribbon in a neutral shade that doesn’t clash with the color of the flowers.

You can buy larger ones that a decorative clay shape can be directly attached to or you can buy a more complex split ring and chain assembly that is made specifically to attach your own keychain art to. Pick whichever one you like. You can even reuse parts from an old keychain if you have one lying around.;
, The clay should come out smooth and the thickness should be uniform throughout.









If desired, press more than one color together to create a swirled effect. You can even make small shapes and press them into a larger piece of the clay. Be creative!

, Choose the shape of your choice, such as a flower for Mother's Day, a clover for St. Patrick's Day, a heart for Valentine's Day. Sports fans will enjoy a keychain shaped like a basketball, baseball or football.









You can also create your own shape for your key chain with a sharp paring knife or utility knife.

,









This hole will be used to attach your clay shape to the split ring, so make sure the hole is in a position that will make this possible.
Many mold-and-bake clays allow you to attach small jewelry findings, such as small metal loops, directly into the clay before baking. If the clay you purchased allows this, it may be a good idea to attach a loop of wire to your clay shape so that a split ring can be easily attached to it later.

, Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before attempting the next step.

, Be careful not to be too rough when connecting the two pieces together, as it could break your beautiful new keychain.

Gather your materials.,
Cut out small squares of the adhesive craft foam measuring approximately 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) each.,
Write out one of the letters you have chosen for your keychain on each piece of the craft foam using a pencil or marker.,
Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut out the craft foam letter.,
Lay all the letters on of the remaining piece of craft foam, the one with no adhesive.,
Cut out the overall shape of your keychain on the craft foam.,
Peel the backing from each letter.,
Use a paper punch, or something with a sharp point, to make a hole about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top of the foam shape you have made.,
Attach a split ring or keychain assembly through the hole.",How to Make Keychains2," You will need to collect at least two colors of craft foam (one that has adhesive on it and one that doesn't), scissors, and a split ring or key chain assembly.


You do not need a ton of craft foam! Even pieces only a few inches long and a few inches wide will work just fine. In fact, this project is a good one to use up scraps from other projects.

, You will need to cut out as many squares as letters you want on your keychain.









Alternatively, use up to four different colors to create a keychain with layers of color.
When deciding which letters to put on your keychain consider using your initials (if the keychain is for you) or a simple four letter word that is important to you, such as ""love"" or ""cute"". You don't want a huge keychain hanging off your keys, so keep it short and sweet.

, Each letter should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) tall.









Use block letters to draw each letter to that when you cut out the letter the center of the letter will be the color of the foam, not the color of your pen or pencil. Try a creative design or font that will make the letters unique but legible.

, Take your time to cut the letter out as neatly as possible. If the letter you are cutting out has a central area that you need to cut out, start cutting in the center of the area, away from the edge line. This way you can be careful and gradually cut away the foam up to the line.








, Decide how they should be arranged and what the overall shape and size of the finished keychain should be.









Don't take the backing off of your foam letters just yet. Take the time to make sure your layout is just the way you want it before you do!

, Remember that all of the letters you cut out earlier should fit onto it with space around each to frame the letters nicely.









While a rectangular shape is just fine, remember that you can be creative with this shape too.

, Stick each letter onto the larger piece of foam, working carefully to be sure the letters are lined up. Be sure to press each letter down firmly, so that they won't fall off.








, This hole is for the ring to attach to, so make sure you are putting it in a spot that will make that possible.








, Be gentle with the foam, as you don't want to tear your project at the very end. Now you have a great personalized keychain that is ready to use.

Gather your materials.,
Thread both ropes through the ring or keychain assembly.,
Weave the ropes together.,
Tie off the ends your rope and make sure to neatly trim them.",How to Make Keychains3," To make a lanyard keychain all you will need is a split ring or keychain assembly and some thin rope or plastic lacing. The rope or lacing will need to be at least four times as long as you would like your finished lanyard to be, so lengths will vary, but they need to be at least three feet long so you will have enough rope to handle. Cut two pieces of the rope or lacing the same length. It is nice if each is a different color, so that your finished keychain is colorful and so it's easier to keep track of where you are in your weaving process.
Some people like to make these keychains with paracord, so that if you are ever in an emergency and you need a bit of rope, you will have it with you!, Make sure the center of each rope is positioned at the ring (unless you are using a weaving technique that requires something different). Secure the ring to a flat surface with a piece of tape. This will allow you to have a secure project as you weave. You should now have four ends of rope to weave together.









Pick a spot to attach your ring that allows you to have a lot of room to weave your ropes together. A great spot is a table that is free of clutter.

, There are a variety of techniques you could use for weaving your keychain, but even a simple braid can look beautiful with the right rope or plastic lacing. Whichever technique you use, make sure to keep your strands tight and don't be afraid to undo a bit of your weaving if you find you have made a mistake. It's better to fix a problem now than notice it in your keychain forever.









For an assortment of weaving techniques see: How to Make a Cobra With Plastic String, How to Make Lanyards, and How to Make a Box Styled Gimp. Any technique you have used for lanyards or friendship bracelets should work for making a keychain.

, Your lanyard keychain is finished!

Gather your supplies.,
Prep your ornaments.,
Plan your design.,
Tape your ornament.,
Hang your ornament.",How to Make Washi Tape Ornaments1," An easy way to make washi tape ornaments is to simply apply washi tape to blank ornaments. This works well on smooth, round bulbs or other flat surface ornament blanks that can be found at many department and craft stores. For this type of project, you need:Blank ornaments of any color (avoid textures such as glitter)
Washi tape of different colors and patterns
Scissors
Ribbon or ornament hooks;
, Help the washi tape hold longer by wiping down your ornament blanks to get rid of any dust or surface debris. Use a damp wipe or towel to wipe down each ornament and let them dry completely before applying the tape.


You may also want to remove the metallic or plastic ornament caps at this time if you plan on doing a design that runs to the top of the ornament.

, Plan your design before you start putting on the tape. One minimalist design would be to run a single band of washi tape around the horizontal center of the bulb. You can also do horizontal or vertical stripes, or a more creative design. The only limit is your vision.If you have a patterned washi tape, consider cutting out individual parts of the pattern to create a more detailed design. For example, cut out individual dots instead of taping a whole row of dots.
Use a colored pencil one shade darker than your ornament (or a wax pencil for clear ornaments) to sketch or outline your design before you start applying tape.

, Once you have your design ready, add the washi tape to your ornament. If you want to vary the edges of your tape, use scissors or pinking shears to create patterns and textured edges.If you have small tape pieces such as individual dots or flowers, use tweezers to help you apply the tape to the designated area.
If you are creating multiple stripes or lines, try to have all the tape seams on the same side of the ornament so that you can face the side without seams outward.

, Once your washi tape ornament is ready, replace the cap and add a hook or ribbon to hang your ornament. Then, hang the ornament from your tree, around your house, or anywhere you think it will look good.While hooks work well for trees, ribbon works best for other areas such as from a mirror or on a nail.

Get your supplies ready.,
Create patterns.,
Make your tag bases.,
Make your tag tops.,
Create your cut-outs.,
Assemble your tag.,
Decorate and hang.",How to Make Washi Tape Ornaments2," Make paper tags that you can hang as ornaments or put onto gifts as to/from tags. For this project, you will need:Construction paper or cardstock in a variety of colors
Washi tape in different colors or patterns
Craft glue or glue stick
Scissors
Ribbon
Die cut punch in any shape (optional)
Puffs, sequins, glitter, or any other additional decoration (optional)

, This project is done easily by using two die cut punches: one in the shape of the tag you want and the other in the shape of the cut-out you want. However, it can be done without those by creating patterns. You will need two: one for the tag and one for the tag cut-out.Create a pattern for the tag in any shape that you want. These could be oval, square, rectangular with clipped edges, or anything else. Trace the pattern onto a sturdy paper or cardboard and carefully cut it out with scissors.
Create a pattern for the cut-out. It can be any shape, though hearts, stars, and trees may be easiest, but it needs to be small enough to fit inside your tag and leave room for edges on each side. Trace the pattern onto a sturdy paper and cut it out using scissors.

, Take a piece of cardstock or construction paper and lay strips of washi tape along the length of the paper. Get the tape strips side-by-side or have them overlap slightly, but try to leave no paper showing.Once you have all your washi tape down, use the die cut punch or trace your tag pattern across the page, creating as many tags as you want. Then, cut out the tags.

, Using your die cut punch or tag pattern, create tops for your tags. These are where you will place your cut-outs, so that you can see through to the washi tape. The tag tops do not need to be taped, but should be a color of paper you want to display.


Cut out as many tag tops as you have tag bottoms.
Have fun by making tops in multiple colors.

, Take your cut-out pattern and center it on your tag top. Then, using either scissors or your die cut punch, cut out a window in the shape of your cut-out from the top of the tag. Save the tag top, and dispose of our recycle the cut-out piece.Use a ruler and pencil to make sure your cut-out is centered and in the same place on every tag.
Create variety by making multiple shapes of cut-outs.

, Place a thin, even layer of glue across the back side of the top of your tag. Line up your tag base and your tag top, and glue the two together with the washi tape side of the base facing the tag top.


The end result should be a tag where the cut out in the tag top shows through to the pattern of the washi tape.

, Once your tag is assembled, decorate it as you see fit. You can use pens, sequins, glitter, paint, pom poms, or anything else you want. Then, punch a hole in the top of the tag and run ribbon through to be able to hang your tag.You don’t have to add additional decoration to the tag if you like the way the cut out and the tape look. The choice is up to you.
Use twine instead of ribbon to give your tag ornament a more package-oriented motif.

Choose your materials.,
Make your cut-outs.,
Tape your cut-outs.,
Prepare to hang your ornaments.",How to Make Washi Tape Ornaments3," DIY ornaments by using acrylic cut-outs or making your own cut outs from cardboard and covering them in washi tape. For these ornaments, you will need:Acrylic cut-outs or cardboard to make your own cut-outs
Washi tape in different colors and patterns
Scissors
Ribbon or string for hanging

, If you decide to make your own cut-outs, use thick paper such as cardstock to trace templates for the shapes you want for your ornaments. Trace the templates onto cardboard, and use scissors or an exacto knife to cut out the shape for your ornaments.


Use the template repeatedly to ensure you get consistent shapes for your ornaments
Your cut-outs can be as large or as small as you want. If you intend to use them on your tree, though, remember to make them small enough to fit comfortably between the tree branches.

, Decorate your cut outs with the washi tape. The design is up to you. You can cover up the whole cut out and make patterns with your tape, or you can add some tape in strategic places on your cardboard cut-outs for a shabby chic look. The choice is yours.Cut out individual components of a pattern from your tape to help you make more elaborate designs. For example, if you have washi tape with snowflakes on it, cut out individual flakes to customize your design.

, Once you have decorated your cut-outs to your liking, punch a hole in the top and run ribbon or string through so that you can hang your ornament. If you cannot punch through an acrylic cut-out, hot glue a loop of ribbon or string onto the back of your shape.Be aware that your cardboard cut-outs may not stand up well to water or atmospheric moisture, so hang them indoors and away from the kitchen to get the most out of them.

Paint the top half of the polystyrene balls gold using the small brush.,When dry, paint the bottom halves and leave to dry again.,
Repeat with a second coat so no white is showing through.,
While drying, draw the left wing of a snitch onto the piece of stiff cardboard (I used the back of a cereal box for this).,
Cut the wing out of the cardboard, being careful as you shape the ends of the feathers (a frilled edge will look loads better than a smooth one!),
This is your template.,
Flip over the cardboard template so it becomes a right wing and draw around it 6 times.,
At the side of each wing where it will join the body of the snitch, draw a small square tab so that you can pin it to the body.,
Cut out each wing, making sure the tab is attached.,
When the polystyrene balls are completely dry, attach the wings.,
Do this for all 6 balls until they all have two wings.Then cut 6 lengths of ribbon (how long you make the ribbon depends on how far down you want the snitches to hang) Pin one end of the ribbon to the tops of the snitches and you're done!",How to Make Golden Snitch Hanging Decorations," Two thin coats are better than one thick, so it won't look great at first, don't panic! While they dry, find a circular hollow to rest them so they don't roll about. Leave to dry completely.
,, If it looks streaky, don't worry, it will look a lot more even when dry!, You can find a picture of a snitch on Google and copy out the wing, but don't worry about making it very precise, as long as it is the right sort of shape. The only important bit is to make sure the wing is in scale with your polystyrene balls! You can see this in a picture, but roughly the wing should be twice as long as the ball is wide.,, On the cartridge paper draw around the wing 6 times- these are the right wings of your six snitches (you will flip them over so they face the opposite way), These are the left wings., Make sure these are attached to the wings., This is a long job, but cutting neatly will make the wings look so more better, so it is worth spending time on the frilled edges to make a feathered look., Fold the square tab at the base in half, and then flip the wing over so that the side where you have drawn around the template is facing the back. Use a pin to attach the folded tab to the body and then fold the wings over so they stick out from the body. Repeat with the wing for the other side., You can now hang the ribbon by knotting it around or pinning it to whatever you want them to hang off."

Try attaching the plates directly to a surface.",How to Make Inexpensive Flower Plate Garden Art," Start your hunt for plates by scouring yard sales and thrift stores.


Keep an eye out for plates with interesting colors and textures.
Aim to get 3 plates, one of each that is small, medium and large.
These will need to fit together so that all 3 are visible, so each needs to be slightly larger than the next.
A mix of solid-color and patterned plates works well.
Don't limit yourself to just plates – pretty pot lids, teacups, small vases, votive candle holders, or glass lampshades can also work nicely.
Transparent glass plates work well, and ones with textured edges.
You don’t have to use china or glass. Consider using metal or plastic plates, lids, or colanders.
You can always try customizing your plates by painting them with glass paints or gluing on marbles and glass beads to add extra color and texture.;
, In addition to the plates that will make your flower's head, you’ll need some lengths of piping (copper piping works well), threaded rods, or wooden stakes to form the long flower stem.


Remember that this stem will be driven into the ground, so make sure it’s at least 1/3 of it can sink into the ground while still maintaining your desired flower head height.
The deeper you can drive it into the ground, the more secure and stable it will be.

, You’ll need something to fix your plates to their stems.


Gather pipe fittings, coupling nuts, a washer/nut, or wire.
The following methods require different materials, so pay close attention to the materials used.
Depending on how you plan to assemble your plate art, you’ll also need glue, or a drill and drill bits and a way to stabilize the plates while drilling them.

, Before you begin gluing, make sure your plates are ready and that you have the proper materials.


You’ll need to get a really strong glass glue, such as E6000 glue or marine grade glue.
If you plan to paint your plates with glass paint, do so in advance and fire in the oven if needed.
Surfaces need to be clean and dry before gluing, so wash and dry the plates beforehand.

, Arrange your plates in your desired order, and glue them so that the designs you want are visible.


Make sure that you glue them facing the right direction, to avoid one part of your design being inadvertently hidden.
Let it air dry for about 24 hours (check the instructions on the glue).
Once it has set firm, turn the flower head over.

, Glue a half inch coupling nut or pipe fitting onto the back of your plate by sticking it to the plate's side.


Again, leave this to dry overnight.
Once that’s dried, you can thread a 3 inch (7.6 cm) threaded rod into the coupling nut, or (if you used a pipe fitting) a length of pipe to secure your plate head to the rod.

, You need to find a way to hold the plate in position while you drill.


One way to do this is to wet an old towel that you don’t mind putting holes in.
Put the sodden towel onto an old metal oven tray.
The sides will stop the contents from shooting out if your drill slips.
Add a bit more water.
Make sure the water slightly covers the towel.
This will help stop the drill from overheating and being damaged, as you will be drilling continuously for long enough for it to heat up.
Alternately, try spraying the surface of the drilling site with water as you drill.

, Mark where you want to drill your hole using a pen or marker, in order to guide yourself.


Before drilling, it’s a very good idea to practice on an old plate that you don’t mind breaking.
After your first successful attempt, you can then use plates you want to use for your art.
Make sure you are wearing safety goggles and gloves.

, You might want to make a pilot hole first using a diamond-tipped 1/8” drill bit.


This just scores the surface to create a divot you can start from.
A pilot hole can make the upcoming drilling easier if you have never drilled a slippery surface before.

, Attach a 5/16” masonry drill bit and begin drilling.


Drill without applying much pressure.
You’ll need to be very patient, as it can take several minutes to penetrate.
You may find it easier to drill at a 45 degree angle for the first few seconds to score the surface, then switch to a 90 degree angle to penetrate it.
Unfortunately not all plates can be drilled.
If you haven't made any progress after 7 or 8 minutes of drilling, consider gluing tough plates instead!
Repeat the entire drilling procedure for each of your plates.

, Once your plates are drilled, thread a nut onto a piece of wire.


Then, fold the wire in half and thread it through a washer.
Thread the wire through each of the plates' holes, front to back, so the nut and washer are at the front (nut at the front of the plates, washer against the back of the rear plate).
Use the excess wire to attach the flower to a length of piping or a wooden stake.

, If you are using the drilling method, you might like to doubly secure the plates against each other using silicon sealant.


This stops them rubbing against each other.
Preventing friction can make the wire on your flower head last longer.

, You’ll want to insert it pretty deeply in the ground for stability.


The deeper you can sink the stem, the more resistance it will have to wind and other environmental forces.

, You might like to finish off your flower by creating ‘leaves’ using colored glass wine bottles.


To do this, remove the labels from a couple of wine bottles (green works well).
Stick some rods into the ground and stick the bottles over the rods.
Position them in the ground so they look like the leaves on a flower.

, If you don't want to bother with creating stems for your flower plates, you can attach the plates directly to a surface such as an old tree stump or wooden fence.


It’s best to use the drilling method and nail them to the surface through the hole.
This can be a good way to solve the issue of stability, by affixing them to a strong and immobile surface.

Sketch out an idea for your mobile.,
Gather your materials.,
Transfer your shapes onto cardstock.,
Cut out your shapes.,
Arrange one set of shapes.,
Cut a length of string or fishing line.,
Attach the string to your shapes.,
Secure a penny to the bottom shape.,
Attach the remaining duplicate shapes to finish your mobile.",How to Make Mobiles1," For this type of mobile, you will hang multiple shapes in a single straight line. You may use any combination of shapes you prefer, but make sure each shape is roughly symmetrical vertically. The right and left side of each shape don't have to be exactly the same, but if they are too different your mobile may hang lopsided. You may also choose to make two or more similar mobiles to hang near each other.


If you have trouble coming up with something from scratch, search online for printable templates.;
, You will need scissors, thread or fishing line, glue or scotch tape, a penny for each mobile, and sheets of cardstock in as many colors as you want. If you plan on printing out your designs, you will also need a printer. If you will be drawing them by hand, you will need a pen or pencil, a ruler, and a compass or protractor.

, There are multiple ways of doing this, and you may choose to use more than one in constructing your mobile.


Download a template or design your own shapes using an image editing program. If your printer can print on cardstock, print the shapes directly onto your cardstock. If your printer can't print on cardstock, or you would like to incorporate a detailed color image into your mobile, print the shapes onto normal printer paper instead. Glue or tape the printed image to a piece of cardstock.
Draw out your shapes onto the cardstock. Use a ruler and other drawing tools to make sure the shapes are vertically symmetrical. Draw out only one of each shape.
Glue or tape other paper products to the cardstock. You may also choose to incorporate existing pictures, stationary, or newspaper clippings into your mobile. To do so, glue or tape the image onto cardstock. Then draw out your shape as described previously.

, Take the cardstock with the shapes either drawn or printed onto it. Place it over a second sheet of cardstock that you would like to be each shape's opposite side. Cut both sheets at once using the lines as a guide.


If you are unable to do both sides simultaneously, cut out one and use it to trace the shape onto the other sheet.

, Lay one side of the mobile on a flat surface in the order that you choose to put them in. The side of the shape you want to be seen should be facing down. Make sure that you can picture a perfectly straight line going down the middle of all your shapes., Use your layout to determine how much string you will need. Use either a tape measure or the string itself. You will need a string long enough to start at the bottom shape and reach a few feet past the top. The amount of extra string you will need at the top will depend on how low you want your mobile to hang. Keep in mind it's always easier to correct a too-long string than a too-short one.

, Use tape or glue to secure the string to each shape, making sure to keep it centered on each. Start with the bottom section and work your way up. Try to make your adhesive as flat as possible.

, The penny will act as a small weight to keep your mobile hanging straight and balanced. Tape or glue the penny towards the bottom edge of the last shape over top of the string. Make sure to leave a small perimeter at the shape's edge so you can seal it properly later on., Glue or tape each of the remaining shapes to its match. Place these shapes face up over top of the string. Focus your adhesive on the edges to properly seal each side together. Once you've finished this step, your mobile will be ready to hang.If you use glue, wait for it to dry before hanging your mobile.

Cut the trophy handle and base out.,
Trace the handle and base into cardboard and cut them out.,
Paint everything.,
Decorate the paper cup and toilet paper roll.,
Glue the handles on.,
Glue it all together.",How to Make a Trophy1," To make a paper cup trophy, you'll need paper, a pencil or pen, cardboard, a paper cup, a toilet paper roll, paint and a brush, a marker, craft glue, and scissors.


For the cardboard, you can use a cardboard box, a cereal box, a packaging box, or something similar.;
, On a piece of paper, draw a trophy handle. Make sure it's roughly as tall as the height of your paper cup. The exact shape is up to you, whatever you want your trophy's handles to look like.

, Use scissors to cut the handle shape out of the paper. You'll also need a base for your trophy, so draw either a square or a circle on the paper, and cut that out as well.


The size of the base is up to you, but it should be at least a little bigger than the width of the top of your paper cup. That way it will be able to support the trophy without it falling over.

, Using the paper handle and base you just cut out, trace the shapes onto a piece of cardboard. You'll need to trace the paper handle twice so you have two cardboard handles. Then use scissors to cut the base and handles out.

, Get your paint ready. You'll want to paint the outside of the toilet paper roll, and the whole paper cup inside and out. (You can leave the bottom of the paper cup unpainted.) Paint the handles and the base as well.


The color you use is up to you, but paint everything with the same color.

, Draw on, paint, or otherwise decorate the painted toilet paper roll and paper cup however you like. You can paint stars, or write a title for the trophy with a marker.Some other ways to decorate your trophy include glueing glitter on the trophy or glueing sequins or plastic stars on it. Have fun and use your creativity here.

, Fold a small portion of each end of your trophy cup's handles. Fold them so there's a small surface that can be attached to the paper cup. Glue the folded ends of the trophy handles to the sides of the paper cup.


If the ends of the handles don't line up right with the slant of the paper cup, you may need to trim them.

, Glue one end of the toilet paper roll to the cardboard base. Then glue the other end of the toilet paper roll to the bottom of the paper cup."

Understand the basics of balance.,
Gather your materials.,
Plan your mobile from the bottom up.,
Add three paperclips to each of your straws.,
Make paperclip chains at the lengths you prefer.,
Attach the paperclip chains.,
Adjust your mobile until it achieves balance.",How to Make Mobiles2," Traditional mobiles consist of rods chained together to form multiple branches. Each rod has either an additional rod or an object hung from both its right and left ends. They rely on equilibrium to keep each rod roughly horizontal and the entire sculpture balanced.


When the two ends have equal weight, what is called a balance point is at the exact center of the rod. The balance point is where the tether attaches to that rod from above.
If two objects have different weights, the balance point will shift towards the heavier object.
Every subsequent branch hung from a parent rod factors into the total weight of that rod's ends.
So, if you find that your mobile is lopsided towards one end, try shifting the balance point towards that end. However, if the difference is too great, you will need to add additional weights to the lighter side or remove some from the heavier end., You will need drinking straws, paper clips roughly the same width as your straws, and whatever objects of your choice you would like to hang from your mobile. Paper shapes or letters will be easier to balance than heavier items.Don't pick objects that are too heavy to be supported by a straw.

, Arrange your straws and objects on a flat surface. Remember that, to keep the rods horizontal, the ends of each side must either be equal or able to achieve balance by shifting the point of attachment. If your objects are heavy or of unequal weight, you will need to be careful when it comes to placement. Start from what will be the bottom of your mobile and pair the objects accordingly. Then, go up to the next branch and either plan to hang an object or new branch equal in weight to your first from the other end. Keep going until you reach where you want your mobile to begin.If you don't plan on making too many branches, this step is less important.

, Slide the straw through the free loop of the paperclips where there isn't a second smaller loop right under it. Arrange the paperclips so that one hangs from each the right and left ends and one is somewhere in the middle., Do not attach these to the paperclips on the straws just yet. Using varied lengths to stagger your rods and objects will prevent your mobile from looking too crowded. Remember that longer chains will add weight to whichever end you hang them from.

, Hook the paperclip chains to the straw paperclips and to your objects. If your objects are paper, you can attach each by simply sliding them into the clip.For objects that have a loop of their own, such as a charm, hook them into the paperclip's wire. For other object types, you may need to unwind a paperclip and wrap the wire around the object for the end of the chain to hook on to. Attach a free chain to the middle paperclip of your top straw. This will be how you hang your mobile.

, Pick up your mobile by the top chain and hold it in front of you. Starting from the bottom, look for any areas of imbalance where the straw is not straight.


Try to correct this by sliding the middle paperclip to a new potential balance point.
If it cannot be balanced this way, either swap out the items for ones of a different weight or add additional branches to the lighter end.

Figure out what you want to hang on your mobile.,
Gather your materials.,
Separate the inner and outer hoops of the embroidery hoop.,
Tie four strings to the inner hoop.,
Tie the opposite ends of the four strings together.,
Attach the decorations to the outer hoop.,
Reattach the two hoops to finish your mobile.",How to Make Mobiles3," This could be ribbons, string, beads, paper crafts, or small objects. Keep in mind that incorporating heavier objects into your mobile will mean you must be more careful about your placement. Weight must be balanced on each side to keep your mobile straight., In addition to your decorations, you will need a wooden embroidery hoop, yarn or string, masking tape, and scissors.A hot glue gun is also useful but not necessary.


If you are using objects that are heavier than paper or plastic beads, try to have a few more than you think you may need in case you must add some for balance.

, There will be a metal clasp that will likely need to be turned counterclockwise to release the two hoops. The inner hoop will be used to hang the mobile, while the decorations will be attached to the outer hoop. Keep in mind that the visible portions of the hoops in the finished mobile will be the outside of the outer hoop and inside of the inner hoop., How long you choose to cut these strings will depend on how low you want your mobile to hang. Try to make sure that each string is roughly the same distance from each of its neighbors. They should create four equal sections of the hoop. Finalize placement before securing the knots. Position the knots on the outside of the hoop and cut off the excess., Make sure that the distance between the hoop and the end knot is the same for each string. Check that the knot is secure. It will need to be strong enough to support the full weight of your mobile. Hold the hoop up by the knot to make sure it hangs horizontally. If it is uneven, determine which string must be corrected to make the hoop hang flat., There are two different ways you can secure the decorations depending on their type.


Light decorations, such as those made of strips of paper or ribbon, may be attached permanently using masking tape or a hot glue gun. Simply decide on placement somewhere along the circle and secure them to the inner side of the outer hoop.
Heavy decorations must be attached to the outer hoop with string. Cut a number of strings slightly longer than you would like your objects to hang. You may make them all one length, but staggered strings of different lengths will look better. Attach one end of each string to each decoration, either through adhesive or by tying a hoop around the object. Separate objects into pairs of roughly the same weight. Tie the opposite end of each string around the outer hoop. Make sure that each paired item is directly across from the other to create balance. This method may also be used for light objects, such as beads or origami, which you would prefer to hang rather than attach directly. With lighter objects, balancing them is not necessary.

, Hold the mobile by the top knot to make sure the hoop hangs horizontally.If it does not and you used heavier objects, you will need to readjust them to achieve the right balance. Determine the source of imbalance. It may be caused by objects that were not matched properly or ones that were not spaced correctly. Loosen the knots to reposition the objects. Reattach the hoops and check again. Repeat this step until your mobile is properly balanced.

Gather your materials.,
Print out a picture of a trophy.,
Trace the trophy shape on a piece of cardboard.,
Cut the trophy out of the cardboard.,
Decorate the trophy.,
Attach the base.",How to Make a Trophy2," To make a cardboard trophy that stands up, you'll need cardboard, a pencil or pen, paper, a printer, scissors or an exact-o knife, and paint and a brush.


For the cardboard, cereal boxes and shipping boxes work well.

, Do an image search for ""trophy clip art"". Find an image of a trophy that you like, then print it out.


Make sure you find an image of a trophy that has a wide enough base, so that it can stand on its own once it's done. The base in the image should be at least half the width of the widest point on the trophy.

, First, cut the trophy out of the paper. Make sure you cut out the empty space in between the handles and the body of the trophy. Then, use the cut-out trophy to trace a trophy shape into the cardboard.

, Use scissors or an exact-o knife to cut the trophy shape out of the cardboard. You'll also need to cut out a base. For this, draw a semi-circle in the cardboard and cut it out.


The base needs to be large enough to support the trophy, so make sure it's at least as wide as the width of the base of the printed out trophy shape.

, You're only limited by your creativity and your materials in this step. You can paint the trophy gold or another color. You can glue little beads and other things to it. You can write a title for the trophy on it. Whatever you want to add to your trophy, go for it.

, To attach the base, cut an inch-long slit into the middle of the semi-circle base. The slit should be cut out of the curved end, not the flat end. Then you just need to slide the base onto the bottom of the trophy so that it's perpendicular to the rest of the trophy."

Make trophy handles out of the model magic clay.,
Wait for the trophy handles to dry.,
Glue the trophy handles to the glass.,
Prime and paint the trophy.,
Decorate the trophy.",How to Make a Trophy3," To turn a glass into a trophy, you'll need a wine or champagne glass, model magic clay, a hot glue gun, spray paint, and spray paint primer.


The clay you want to look for is made by Crayola. Look for the kind that's air-dry.

, Form the model magic clay into two trophy handles. Lay the handles on top of one another so you can make sure they're close to the same size and shape. Trim and reform them as necessary so they're fairly identical., The model magic clay should take about 24 hours to completely dry. So wait a day before continuing.

, Use your hot glue gun to glue the trophy handles to the wine or champagne glass. Wait a few minutes for the hot glue to dry before continuing.


Keep in mind that glue doesn't stick to glass very well. It will stay but only if undisturbed. So handle the trophy with care, without pulling or holding on to it by the glued on handles., Prep the trophy for painting by spraying it with the primer. Then spray paint the cup all over.

, After the spray paint has dried, you can decorate the trophy any way you'd like. Use a sharpie or acrylic paint to give the trophy a title, or glue other little decorations on it."

Gather your materials.,
Find an old trophy.,
Paint it.,
Decorate it.,
Label it.",How to Make a Trophy4," You'll need spray paint, craft decorations, spray adhesive (optional), glue, scissors, markers, and paper.

, If you have an old trophy, lying around somewhere in storage, see if you can dig it up. An old trophy that isn't doing anything but taking up space can be given new life and a new purpose with a little paint and crafting.


Make sure no one in the family wants the old trophy first before repurposing it.

, You can use acrylic paint on plastic trophies, but spray paint will be quicker and last longer. Get some newspaper on the ground or table so you don't get paint everywhere. Lay the trophy down on its side. Spray it with spray paint, making sure to get all the sides. Then flip it onto the opposite side and spray it again. Let the paint dry before touching it., Use whatever craft objects and tools you'd like to decorate the trophy. Glue some stars on it or use a spray adhesive and some glitter. The possibilities are endless.

, Use a label maker if you have one to make a label for your trophy. You can place the label right over where the old one was before it was painted over. Or you can cut out a small rectangle of paper that will fit over the old label. Write the label on the rectangle with paper, and then glue it on.

, The supplies are listed below, under ""Things You'll Need"".

, Pop out the glass or perspex in the frame, if relevant. This will stop it from getting glitter on it. An alternative is to cover it with newspaper and painter's tape but it's much easier to remove it, if you can.

, Position it over the printer page, if using.

,, Aim for an even covering, avoiding the creation of clumps on any part of the frame.

, By doing a side at a time, you can take it slowly and ensure a neat and even covering of glitter.


If you'd prefer to just add a design on one part of the frame, simply add liquid glue to that part of the frame and sprinkle the glitter there. For example, you could use a stencil, holding it over the portion of the frame where you'd like the design to go, infill with glue, then sprinkle the glitter on. Remove the stencil before it gets stuck to the frame too.

, Collect all loose glitter and restore it to the jar by funneling it back in.

, Although optional, a sealant will protect the glitter layer and reduces the amount of glitter that will flake off the frame over time. Use a suitable sealant, such as Mod Podge or varnish. Allow it to fully dry before using the frame.

, Slide the glass back into the frame, add your photo and tighten the fittings at the back. The glitter frame is now ready to shine on your shelf.

Protect yourself and your work area.,
Mix fabric dye with warm water.,
Pour your dye into bottles.,
Add more hot water as needed.,
Choose clean, white, cotton socks.,
Combine soda ash and water.,
Soak your socks.,
Tie your socks off.,
Apply the dye.,
Place the socks in plastic bags.,
Rinse the socks in warm water.,
Wash in hot water.",How to Tie Dye Socks," Wear rubber gloves and clothes that you can get dirty. Cover your work area with rags and large sheets of newspaper.


Fabric dye can stain your clothes, your skin, and just about any other surface.
The rubber gloves will protect your hands from dye stains, and they will also shield your hands from the caustic soda ash used later on while preparing the socks.
You may also want to wear a smock or apron over your clothes to add another layer of protection against the dye. Tie-dying can be a messy process, and it is very possible that you might get dye on your clothes during the process.
Another alternative is to dye outdoors to further avoid staining your indoor tables and floors.;
, Dissolve your nontoxic fabric dye in hot water according to the instructions on the package of dye.









While the instructions for dye varies depending on the manufacturer and the chemicals used in the dye, as a general guideline, you should mix 2 tsp (10 ml) of a standard fabric-reactive dye with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt and 1 cup (250 ml) of warm to hot water. Mix thoroughly in order to form a concentrated dye.Repeat this procedure for as many colors as you want to include. A color scheme including one to four colors is usually best. Including more than that may make your socks look too busy and too messy.

, Transfer each concentrated dye solution into an empty squeeze bottle.









Use a squeeze bottle, like an old mustard bottle, and not a spray bottle. You need to be able to apply to dye in solid strokes, not as a mist.
You could also transfer the dye into small bowl or buckets and dip-dye your socks instead of squirt-dying them. This works especially well if you only plan on using one or two colors.

, Pour enough hot water into the bottle to fill it to the top.









If dip-dying your socks, add enough water to each bowl as needed in order to cover a couple of socks.

, Wash your socks before you tie-dye them.


Cotton holds dye the most effectively, so the socks you choose should be at least 80 percent cotton. Spandex and polyester will not dye.You need to use white socks in order to get the strongest, purest dye color.

, Mix roughly 3








Soda ash is caustic, so it is important that you wear gloves when handling it. You should also keep small children and pets away from the soda ash solution.
Mix the solution using a wooden spoon with a long handle.
Soda ash, or sodium carbonate, is a dye fixer. It ensures effective chemical bonding of the dye with the fabric. Not all fabric dyes will require the use of soda ash to be effective, but most do.

, Soak your socks in this solution for at least 5 minutes.









You can soak your socks in the soda ash solution for up to 30 minutes or so. Soaking them for a longer period of time may or may not make a difference in how effective the dye holds to the cotton fibers, but at the very least, you should do more than merely dip the socks in the solution.
Stir the socks around with the same long-handled spoon as they soak.
When done, remove the socks from the solution and wring them out.

, Use rubber bands to tie off sections of your socks so that the dye will create patterns.Make stripes by wrapping three to four rubber bands around the foot of the sock and along the leg of the sock.
Make circles by pinching off a section of the material and tying it off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down with a single rubber band. This is especially useful for heels.
Create small ring patterns by slipping buttons or pennies into the socks. Tie them off by wrapping a rubber band around the section of sock holding the button or penny.

, Lay the tied-off socks flat on your work surface. Squirt the dye onto your socks using your squirt bottles.








To create tie-dyed patterns, the dye should be applied around the tied-off portions of the material. You can use the nozzle of the bottle to get into some of the fabric folds.
As you apply the dye, try to avoid leaving too many patches of empty, colorless space in between different colors.
If dunk-dying the socks, place the socks in your bowl of dye and let them sit anywhere from 1 to 20 minutes. You can create multi-colored socks by dipping one section at a time into various colors., Seal the socks in resealable plastic bags and let them sit in a warm area for 24 hours.









The dye needs to set in a warm, moist area for about 24 hours in order to get a strong color.
When you remove the socks from the bag the following day, the bag should be steamy and warm inside.
If the weather is warm and bright, you can sit the socks out in direct sunlight as the dye sets. During seasons of cooler weather, you should let the socks rest in a warm indoor location. The dyed socks should sit in an area that is at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius).

, After the dye has set, remove the socks from the bag and strip away the rubber bands, buttons, and pennies. Place the socks under warm running tap water and rinse until the water runs clear.









If you have a conventional washing machine, you could also put the socks through a warm rinse cycle. If you have an energy-efficient washing machine that does not use as much running water, hand-rinsing your socks is a better option., After rinsing the socks, wash them separately in your washing machine using hot water and regular detergent.

When deciding what you’d like to tie dye with Rit dye, choose:Rayon or nylon
Cotton, linen, silk, wool, and ramie
Nylon-based plastic
Natural materials, like wood, paper, feathers, and cork
Fiber blends with at least 60% cotton. Blends will tint evenly but won’t fully accept the color of the dye.;
, It’s best to get everything together before you start dyeing your fabric so that you don’t run the risk of getting dye on yourself or, worse yet, your floor, clothes, or other fabrics. Each method is a little different, requiring different tools, but you will generally need:


Plastic bags (preferably bags that seal)
Newspaper (to protect your work area)
Gloves (to keep dye off your hands)
Rubber bands (to make patterns)
A large tub – plastic tub, a sink, a washing machine, a child’s swimming pool, etc.
A clear work space
Enough dye for your project – 1 package of Rit powder for approximately every pound/3 yards of fabric
Hot water – heat locks in dye
Salt, vinegar, or laundry detergent (depending on what fabric you’re using)

, You want to start out with clean fabric. Wash and dry your fabric and ensure that there are no stains. Stains will prevent the fabric from picking up the dye, so look over your fabric for any blemishes and use a stain remover if necessary.You’ll thoroughly wet and ring out the fabric again right before you begin dyeing it.

, The hotter the water that you use, the more vibrant the dye will be. Always follow the package directions when preparing your dye, which should direct you to dissolve one package of Rit powder into two cups of very hot water. You want to make sure that the powder is thoroughly dissolved before you use the dye solution., Just like when dyeing eggs, you want to add a color booster to the dye solution. While this isn’t imperative, you’ll achieve brighter, more vibrant colors if you thoroughly dissolve a booster in your liquid. What you add will depend entirely on the type of fabric that you’re using.


1 cup salt – add this to a dye bath if you’re dyeing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen.
1 cup white vinegar – add this to a dye bath if you’re dyeing nylon, silk, or wool.

, You’ve seen all types of tie dye patterns – some may have swirls, whereas others have boxes, and even others have lines. Every pattern is achieved by manipulating the fabric in a particular way.There are hundreds of designs that you can perfect with some imagination and practice.

, Fold your fabric in short layers to form a tube, and then put rubber bands around the tube at intervals. Each fold creates a new line in the pattern. The rubber bands will create a line that spans the length of the fabric, as it is wrapped around everything and will prevent the dye from reaching the fabric., Pick your fabric up in the middle and twist, forming a band or a twisted tube. Place rubber bands around the twisted fabric band at intervals. The twists will create a swirled bullseye, while the rubber bands will separate the colors.

, Pick your fabric up in the middle and twist, but form a disk instead of a band. Place rubber bands around the disk as if you were portioning it into six, ten, or even fourteen equal parts. This spiral design will appear to be turning in the direction that you twisted the fabric.

, Pick up small, random portions of your fabric and twist, forming small pillars. Secure with rubber bands and even place one or two rubber bands up each pillar. This technique is busy, but it allows you the opportunity to work with several color combinations and have more than one focal point in your fabric.

, Immerse your fabric in the lightest color dye that you’re using for the time indicated on the Rit powder directions, usually 4-10 minutes. The longer you let the fabric sit in the dye, the more vibrant the color will be. Keep going through your dye colors, working to the darkest color.Because Rit dye is a union dye, the colors won’t be quite as vibrant as those from other dyes. The versatility of this dye more than makes up for any lack of vibrancy, though.

, Use a 3-gallon bucket for every color dye that you’re using instead of a sink or bathtub. This method offers complete portability, allowing you to tie dye anywhere that you choose. The bucket method is great for larger dye jobs, or dipping your fabric, but doesn’t allow you as much precision as some other methods.The bucket method also allows you to dye larger pieces or do batches, which is handy if you are going to do several pieces.

, For this method, you’ll wet the fabric first, ring it out, and set it aside. Then, mix one color per squirt bottle (you can pick these up at any dollar store, usually two for $1.00). Fold or band the fabric as you want it, and then squirt the dye solution on your fabric.This method allows you the most precision, but isn’t as quick as the bucket method. The squirt bottle method also allows you to do very detailed designs and color patterns.

, You won’t make a solution when you ice dye your fabric; instead, you’ll carefully apply the powder directly to the fabric. To begin, wet and ring out your fabric. Then, scrunch up the fabric over a rack of some kind, like a baking rack. Put ice on top of the fabric, and tap the dye powder on to the ice with a spoon. Cover your creation with an old sheet for 24 hours. When you return, the ice will have melted leaving a magical, blended design unlike any other.Just as with the squirt bottle method, ice dyeing fabric is really for smaller jobs.


Because you’re tapping loose powder on to the ice, you’ll need to wear a face mask for this method.

, This method works best if you are in an open area, or if you use large plastic bags to contain any overspray. Fill one spray bottle per color of dye that you’re using. Prepare the fabric as normal, and either place in a plastic bag or set in an open, protected area. Spray the fabric with your spray bottles until the desired effects are achieved. This method offers some precision, but likely will not fully saturate the middle of your fabric., Some tie dye artists prefer to let their project sit in a sealed, plastic bag for 24 hours before they rinse the dye out. The idea is that this allows the dye time to set or cure, yielding a more hearty, long-lasting dye job.Other artists insist this step isn’t necessary, so it’s really up to you whether you bag your project or not.

, Whether you bagged your project or not, you will rinse your fabric after you’re done dyeing it. Remove any bands in the fabric and run the whole piece under hot water. Gradually decrease the water temperature until the water runs clear (or almost completely clear).Once the water runs clear, immerse your fabric in ice water.

, While not required, some tie dye artists choose to apply a dye fixative to their work, locking the dye into the fabric and preventing fading. You can find dye fixatives, such as Retayne, at some craft stores and many online stores., Hand wash your fabric in warm water with a mild detergent. Rinse your project thoroughly and then dry it, either by hanging it up to dry or in the dryer. If you hang your fabric up to dry, put old newspaper underneath to catch any dyed water drips that might fall.


Wash your fabric alone the first two or three times, so that you don’t run the risk of dyeing your other clothes, as the dye will still potentially bleed if you haven’t applied a fixative.

Understand the anatomy of a balloon.,
Blow up the balloon.,
Pinch the balloon’s neck.,
Stretch its neck out.,
Pinch the balloon’s neck between the index and middle fingers on one hand.,
Pull the lip toward you with your non-pinching hand.,
Loop the stretched length of neck over the top of your pinching hand's thumb and index finger.,
Transfer the lip from the looping hand to your wrapped-up finger and thumb.,
Pull the lip backward through the loop you’re created.,
Allow the loop to slide forward off your fingers.",How to Tie a Balloon1," In order to make sense of these instructions, we should know how to refer to each area of the balloon that we’ll be dealing with. Memorizing these terms—or just consulting this list if you become confused—will help immensely in the task ahead of us.


The body is what we might consider the main area of the balloon; it’s the spherical or oval-like chamber that we fill with air.
The lip is that ring of thicker material that surrounds the balloon’s opening and is where air enters and exits the balloon.
The neck is that slightly elongated area leading from the body to the lip.;
, Whether you’re using an air compressor, pump, or just your own good, old-fashioned lungs, start blowing into the balloon through its lip. If you’re having trouble keeping the balloon steady while you inflate it, delicately grip it by the neck.


The balloon should feel full, but not as though it has been filled to its utmost capacity. Stop inflating once it can hold its form with little give. A balloon that’s filled too full can easily pop, and will be difficult to tie off.
Ensure that the balloon still has a discernible neck. If you can’t tell where the body ends and the neck begins, your balloon is likely too full.

, We need to keep the balloon inflated, so one hand should always be holding the balloon for this purpose. Pinch the neck of the balloon once it’s been sufficiently inflated.

, You’ll need the balloon’s neck good and loose for the next step, so you’ll want to gently, rapidly tug on the neck a few times with the hand you’re not using to pinch the balloon shut. Three or four times should be sufficient.









Shoot for 3-6 inches of give when you stretch out the neck. You'll need it stretchy enough so that it can wrap around two fingers. Any less and you’ll likely have a hard time trying to tie this balloon off; any more and your balloon might not be fully inflated.

, The neck should be held as close to the body as you can manage, with the lip pointed toward you.

, At this point, you should place the thumb of your pinching hand against the pinching hand's index finger.








, Bring the lip all the way around and underneath your pinching fingers, without wrapping up your middle finger.









If you’re unable to pull the neck far enough, this could be an indicator that your balloon is too full, or that your neck wasn’t properly stretched. Loosen your grip on the balloon to slowly, slightly deflate it.

, Your pinching hand's thumb and index finger should now have the material stretched taut across them, but your middle finger should be excluded from the loop., Retract your thumb and finger—now grasping the balloon’s lip—back through the loop which you’ve wrapped around them.









You should be pulling your thumb and index finger inward, toward the hand that they belong to.

, If you kept hold of the lip, you should have created a knot. This balloon is ready to party!

Spread the glitter glue onto the non-sticky side of the tape.,
Allow to dry.,
Wait about 4 to 5 hours.,
Check that the glitter tape is dry.",How to Make Glitter Tape1," When you wiggle it, it should feel kind of like Jell-O.;
, Find somewhere to put the tape covered with glitter glue safely to dry. For example, you could hang if off the edge of a table somewhere away from people traffic and curious pets. Or, place it flat but if so, it needs to be sitting on a surface that won't prevent you from lifting up the tape again; a silicone sheet or wax paper are good options for resting the tape on, sticky side down.

, (If you make it before bed, when you wake up it will be dry!)

, Then carefully peel off the glitter tape. It can now be used on your decorative projects.


If the glitter tape isn't sticking that well, put double-sided tape on the back of it. It should stick better now.






You can keep on sticking this tape elsewhere because the tape you used to make the glitter tape is reusable!

Stretch the opening of the balloon's lip around the faucet.,
Fill the balloon with water.,
Remove the water balloon from the faucet, with its neck between the index and middle fingers of one hand.,
Grab the lip with your free hand and loop the balloon’s neck over the top of your pinching hand's thumb and index finger.,
Pass the lip from your looping hand to your wrapped-up finger and thumb.,
Retract the lip, along with your finger and thumb, backward through the loop that's wrapped up around them.,
Allow the loop to slide forward, off your fingers, and the water's weight should tighten the knot for you.








",How to Tie a Balloon2," Hold the lip in place around your water source, to ensure that it doesn’t slip off as the balloon begins to take on water weight. If you have any trouble with slippage, use your other hand to support the expanding balloon from below.


The ""lip"" of the balloon is that thick ring of material which surrounds the balloon's opening, through which water and air can flow.
You should make sure the area around you can handle an accidental water balloon explosion, as even seasoned pros will have their fair share of these. Make sure there are no electronics or non-waterproof valuables nearby.

, Ensure you’ve firmly secured the balloon before turning on that faucet, hose, or spout. Experience will help you determine the speed at which to fill the balloon but opt for a slower pace at first, increasing water flow only as you gain practice with the procedure.









Water balloons are typically smaller than balloons designed to be filled with air or gas mixtures, so keep this is mind if you’re used to dealing with air-based balloons.
If you overfill the balloon, it will let you know by politely exploding on you. If your balloon does indeed burst, take note of the point at which this happens to ensure you don’t fill your next balloon to that point.

, The lip should be pointing up, and the weight of the full balloon should stretch its neck. If the sagging balloon doesn't appear to have enough neck—you'll likely require 2-6 inches—you've likely overfilled your balloon.









The ""neck"" of the balloon is that slightly elongated section of the balloon where the main body of the balloon meets the lip.

, The lip should come all the way around and underneath your pinching fingers. Exclude your middle finger from this loop.








, Grasp the lip with that finger and thumb.

You should be pulling your thumb and index finger inward, toward the hand that they belong to.

Cut a square out of batting, linen, and cotton fabric.,
Layer your fabric.,
Stitch the fabric together, but leave a small gap around one of the edges.,
Clip the corners.,
Turn the fabric square inside out.,
Press the square using an iron.,
Topstitch around the square.,
Draw a square in the middle of your fabric using a dressmaker's chalk or pen.,
Topstitch around the square at you drew.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.,
Fold and stitch the corners.",How to Make a Simple Fabric Box1," Use a square cut out of thin cardboard to trace your pattern onto your fabric and batting first. This will ensure that all of the squares are the same size. Cut the squares out using a sharp part of fabric scissors.


The linen fabric will be on the inside of your box. Consider a solid color for this.
The cotton fabric will be on the outside. Consider a coordinating pattern for this.
Use thin batting. If you can't find any, iron fusible interfacing to the wrong side of your cotton fabric.;
, Set the batting down first. Place the linen fabric on top, right side up. Set the cotton fabric down last, wrong side up. It may look weird now, but it will look fine once you turn everything inside out., Sew around all four edges using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a 1 ½ to 2-inch (3.81 to 5.08-centimeter) gap along one of the edges so that you can turn the square inside out.Pin the fabric and batting together with sewing pins first, if necessary. Be sure to remove the pins when you are done.

, This ensures that your box will have nice, sharp corners. Start by cutting straight across the corners, close to the stitching. Then, cut the seams to either side of the corner at angles to make it narrower. This will help further reduce bulk.

, Keep the linen and batting together as you turn the fabric. This way, you will have the linen fabric on one side and the cotton on the other. The batting will be sandwiched in between.


Use something long and slender, like a knitting needle, to push the corners out.

, Use the cotton setting on the cotton side. Flip the fabric over, and iron it again. This time, use the linen setting, if your iron has one. Ironing the square will get rid of any wrinkles and make the next step easier.


Be sure to tuck in the seams from the gap nicely. Use sewing pins to keep the gap closed, if necessary.

, Use a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance. Be sure to go over the gap that you left earlier.Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing a few times so that the stitching doesn't come undone.


Use a thread color that matches your cotton, and a bobbin color that matches your linen.
Consider using a contrasting thread and bobbin color. This will make the top stitching part of the design!

, The square will make the base of your box. The larger your square is, the shorter your box will be. The smaller your square is, the taller you box will be.


For a perfect cube, measure your fabric, and divide it by three. Draw a square in the center according to those measurements.

, The stitching will help the box ""fold"" properly. Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing!


Remove the ink or chalk by gently wiping it with a damp cloth.

, Take the two bottom left edges and fold them together so that they touch. Use an embroidery needle and some embroidery thread to stitch the edges together, ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the corner. Repeat this step for the remaining three corners.You can also glue the corners together with a drop of hot glue or fabric glue. If you use fabric glue, secure the corners with clothespins until the glue dries.
You can match the embroidery thread to your fabric, or use a contrasting color for a hint of design.

Finished.

",How to Make a Simple Fabric Box2," Choose two different colors or patterns of cotton fabric. You can use solid colors, patterns, or a combination of the two. Stack everything together, and cut a 15-inch (38.1-centimeter) square out.Make sure that the two fabrics go well together. One of them will be your main fabric and the other will be your lining.

, Follow the instructions that came with your interfacing as each brand will be different. In general, you will need to: pin the interfacing to the wrong side of the fabric, cover it with an ironing cloth, and iron it for 10 to 15 seconds with an iron. Use the coolest setting you can and no steam.

, Stack your main fabric and lining together. Trace a 4½-inch (11.43-centimeter) square into each corner. Cut the squares out using a pair of fabric scissors. You will end up with something that looks like a + sign.To ensure that each square is the same size, use a template cut out of thin cardboard.
Discard the squares that you cut out, or save them for another project.

, Place the main fabric down with the right side facing you. Bring the left and bottom flaps together, and pin them along the edge. Repeat with the remaining flaps until you have a box.


Repeat this step with the lining fabric.

, Sew the main fabric first, then the lining. Do not stitch the two boxes together just yet., Turn your main fabric box so that the bottom is facing you. Snip the hems at the bottom of each corner. Be careful not to cut through the stitching.


Repeat with step with the lining.

, Turn the main fabric box right side out. Tuck it inside the lining box. The right sides of both boxes should be touching. You should only see the interfacing and the wrong side of the lining.

, Pin the box together along the top edge. Sew along the top edge using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Leave a few inch/centimeter wide gap for turning., When you are done, push the box back into shape. Tuck the lining into the main box, and push out the corners.

, Set the box down on its side on the ironing board. Press the top hem with an iron. Turn the box onto its other side, and iron it again. Keep doing this until you have ironed all four sides.


Tuck the hem in at the gap neatly. Keep the opening shut with sewing pins if you need to.

, Be sure that you match your thread and bobbin colors to your main and lining fabric colors.


Consider using a contrasting thread color for the top stitching. This will make it part of the design!

Select the buttons and beads.,
Prepare the elastic cord.,
Thread the button, then a bead, onto the elastic cord.,
Keep threading until the buttons and beads fit neatly around your wrist.,
Tie the two elastic ends together.,
Snip off any excess elastic ends that stick out after you've tied the knot.,
Wear.",How to Make Button Bracelets2," For a standard size bracelet, you'll need around 20 or so buttons, and a matching amount of beads. Choose the buttons and beads according to your pattern preference; some suggestions are:


Choose all one color or a varying range of the same color.
Choose buttons in one color, beads in another color.
Choose multiple colors, such as changing color patterns or a rainbow spectrum.
Choose all the same size or choose differing sizes. These can be placed on randomly or in a set size order but do plan this ahead. (It is recommended that the bead size remain the same, to provide a pleasing consistency to the eye.)

, Cut the cord to about 25cm (10 inches) in length. Tie a knot at one end, to prevent the buttons and beads from slipping off as you make the bracelet. Tie this about 5cm (2 inches) in from one end of the elastic cord.

, Thread the button so that it stands upright, rather than sitting flat along the cord; use the bead to help keep it in this position. Continue doing this according to any pattern (colors or sizes) you've chosen to follow, making sure that you alternate between a button and a bead.

, You'll need to check this now and then as you get closer to the end of making the bracelet. If you don't need all of the buttons and beads, that's fine––use them for your next project. Leave at least 5cm (2 inches) at the finishing end of the elastic.

, Use a double knot or even a reef knot, for certainty. If the bracelet is not tied together properly, and it breaks, it can be hard to retrieve all of the lost pieces.

, The bracelet should now sit tight and neat, with all of the buttons and beads arranged snugly around the cord.

, To put on, simply stretch it gently and only enough to get it over your hand. Wear with pride; you made this!

Select a suitable bottle.,
Obtain the glitter.,
Pour in ordinary water to three quarters of the way.,
Add one bottle of the glitter glue.,
Add the lid.,
Use.",How to Make a Bottle of Glitter2," The idea behind this bottle is that it can either be a source of calming you by staring at it or it can be used for timing a time-out with a misbehaving toddler. Either way, it's a beautiful object to stare at., This could be a soda bottle, juice bottle or any other good bottle. It doesn't have to be plastic but if it is to be used by toddlers, plastic is safest. Adults may prefer to use glass, just ensure it is clear glass so that you can see the glitter easily., You'll need both glitter glue and ultra fine glitter as these two make for the most interesting mixture once added., Use a funnel to make this easier to do., Add another small container of the ultra fine glitter to complete the glittery look., Screw on tightly. Give the bottle a shake to check that you're happy with the outcome. If not, add more ultra fine glitter until you like the appearance., To use it, simply shake the bottle and watch the swirls that happen. Keep shaking as often as you like, but you should find it a calming experience fairly quickly.

To use for a child in time-out, shake the bottle and have them watch it until it settles. Their time-out is over when the bottle settles completely. Or, if the child knocks the bottle over or shakes it, the time-out doesn't end until the glitter has all come to a standstill.

Add the lid to each bottle.,
Done.",How to Make a Bottle of Glitter3," For this project, it is important that the bottles are all the same size so that they make a neat and consistent group or row of bottles. If you want different sizes, ensure that they match nicely in style and the height differences aren't too disparate.

Ensure that the bottle labels are removed, the bottles are cleaned and completely dried.

, The measurements given are based on a bottle measuring about 600 milliliters (20  fl oz) or a pint. Change the ratios if the container is larger.

Pour 3/4 of a cup of the light corn syrup into a see-through measuring cup. The measuring cup must be able to withstand heat, Pyrex makes a good choice.
Add 1/2 cup hot water to the corn syrup. Stir to combine.
Pour the liquid into the empty bottle.

, Do each bottle with the same amount of syrup water., For each bottle, add a few drops of glitter liquid watercolor. The glitter will shine through the color added. Have a red, orange, green, yellow, blue, indigo and violet, or variants thereof for the group of colors. You're free to vary this with pastels, ranges of the same hue, or whatever combination pleases you., Use glitter of any size and color to add to each bottle. While it'd be best to match the glitter color to the bottle's color, it's not totally essential, as the watercolor glitter will provide the color strength., Secure firmly to ensure the lid stays in place. Shake each bottle around to distribute the glitter through each bottle., These can now be used for play or display. If displaying, a row can be interesting, or use as a table setting or place in front of lighting to increase the glow given off. They can also be used in classes for toddlers and youngsters to play games, talk about rainbows or to be used for quiet time."

1 tbsp (15 ml) organic nitrogen (to help conserve the color in the dye)
1 cup (236.5 ml) warm water
1 ounce (28 g) color dye

, For every gallon (3.79 l) of water, mix in 1 cup (236.5 ml) of soda ash, also known as sodium carbonate

Directly after rinsing, wash the shirt in the washer with soap and warm water.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt with Soda Ash4," When applying the dye, you want to add enough so you don't see white. At the same time, you don't want so much dye that there are little puddles of it on top of the shirt. There are several ways you can apply dye:


If using the spiral pattern, apply one dye in the center and move outwards, encircling each new ring with a different color.






If using the spiral pattern, apply different dyes in each quadrant created by the overlapping rubber bands.
If using sun pattern, apply different dyes in each segment created by the rubber bands.
If you wish to have your whole shirt tie-dyed, stain both the back and front with the same dye pattern. If you wish to only have one side of your shirt tie-dyed, stain only the front or the back side.

Roll out a thin sheet of clay.,
Add some texture, if desired.,
Cover the clay with a sheet of plastic wrap.,
Cut the buttons out.,
Peel the plastic wrap and excess clay away.,
Poke two to four holes into each button.,
Bake the buttons in a preheated oven.,
Paint or glaze the buttons, if desired.",How to Make Polymer Clay Buttons1," Knead some clay in your hands until it turns soft. Place it onto a smooth surface, then roll it out into a thin sheet using an acrylic tube. How thick or thin you roll the clay out is up to you.

If you can't find an acrylic tube, you can use another smooth, cylindrical object, such as a rolling pin or fat pen. You can also use a pasta machine.;
, You can leave the clay blank to make plain buttons. You can also make fancy buttons by adding texture. Press a stamp or texture mat on top of the clay to make an imprint, then peel it off.Background stamps with damask, scrolled, or floral designs work great for buttons.You can also use lace, doilies, or even draw your own design using a toothpick., This will give your buttons rounded, beveled edges. It will give them a more professional-looking finish. If you do not want rounded or beveled edges, you can skip this step.Be careful not to smooth your stamped designs.

, You can do this using small cookie cutters or shaped clay butters. Press the tool into the clay, right over the plastic wrap, then pull it out. You can cut as many buttons as you'd like., Discard the plastic wrap. Crumple up the excess clay, and add it back to the brick or to your scrap clay bin., Smaller buttons only need two holes, but larger ones might need four. Make sure that all of the holes are centered and spaced evenly apart. You can poke them using skewers, toothpicks, knitting needles, or even plastic coffee stir sticks.

Wiggle toothpicks and skewers around a little to widen the holes.

, Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the clay's wrapper. Once the oven reaches the right temperature, place the buttons onto a foil-lined baking sheet. Put the baking sheet into the oven, then let the clay bake for the time specified on the label.

It does not matter how far apart or how close together the buttons are on the baking sheet.
Each brand of clay is a little different, so the baking times and temperatures will vary.

, Allow the buttons to cool first. Add some designs to the buttons using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush. Let the paint dry, then apply some glaze using a paintbrush. Let the glaze dry completely before you use the buttons.

You can also apply glaze to unpainted buttons as well.
If you added a stamped design, consider rubbing the paint off with a paper towel. This will reveal the clay's original color along the raised areas.Thick glaze may cover up the button holes. If this happens, run a toothpick or a skewer through the holes to clear them up.

Push a jump ring into the back of the button.,
Smooth the slit under the jump ring shut.,
Remove the clay from the mold.,
Bake the button on a foil-lined baking sheet.,
Allow the buttons to cool before using them.",How to Make Polymer Clay Buttons2," Purchase a silicon mold kit from an arts and crafts store. Inside, you will find two containers labeled ""Part A"" and ""Part B."" Take out equal amounts of each part and knead them together to form a ball.

The silicon will set quickly, so have your desired button or cabochon ready. You will need one to make an imprint.

, Use your fingers to press the silicon around the sides of the button or cabochon for a tight fit. Be careful not to cover up the back. Work quickly as the silicon will start to set fast., In most cases, the silicon will harden and turn a darker color. It will still be somewhat flexible and rubbery. Once the silicon sets and you can't ""shape"" it anymore, pull the button out. You should now have a perfect cast., Knead some clay to soften it up first. Next, roll it into a ball, then press it into the mold. Use your fingers to press all along the back so that every crevice gets filled. The back of button should be flush with the mold.Leave the clay in the mold for now.

There may be some excess clay sticking out of the mold. Run a thin blade across the back of the mold to cut the excess clay off.
Clay should not stick to silicon, but if you are worried about this, mist some water into the mold first.

, Choose a large jump ring, then press it halfway into the button. You can use a round jump ring or an oval one. The color of the jump ring does not matter, but an unpainted one will probably hold up to baking the best.

If you can't find a jump ring, you can glue a button shank to the back of the clay piece after you bake it.

, When you pushed the jump ring in, you may have noticed a small slit in the clay. Use a pointy tool, such as a toothpick, pen, or knitting needle to smooth the slit shut. Don't worry if you end up with a slight groove. This groove will actually make it easier to sew the button on., Pick the mold up and hold it in both hands. Bend it back, like snapping a stick. You should see the sides of the button coming away from the mold. Rotate the mold, and bend it again. Keep doing this until the button is loose. Flip the mold over, and let the button fall out.

You must remove the clay from the mold. Do not bake the button in the mold.
At the point, you can make more buttons using the same mold.

, Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the clay's label. Once the oven reaches the correct temperature, place the baking sheet inside. Let the button bake for the time specified on the label.

Each brand of clay is different. Follow the instructions on the label closely.

, If you'd like, you can paint the buttons with acrylic paint. You can also glaze them with acrylic sealer or polymer clay glaze. Let the paint and/or glaze dry completely before you use the buttons.

Consider adding the paint just to the raised edges of the button for an interesting design.
If you didn't add a jump ring, buy a button cover kit from the fabric store. Take a shank backing (a flat disk with a wire loop), and super glue it to the back of your button.

Consider tie-dyeing your shirt using acrylic paint.,
Find a white-colored shirt to dye.,
Prepare your paint.,
Lightly mist the shirt with water.,
Tie rubber bands around the shirt.,
Apply the colors in the spaces between the rubber bands.,
Leave the shirt on top of a wire rack and let the colors set.,
Remove the rubber bands and let the shirt hang dry.,
Heat set the colors.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt the Quick and Easy Way1," You can tie-dye your shirt using watered-down acrylic paint. The shirt will need to dry, but once you heat-set it by tossing it into the drier, it will be ready to be worn. This method is similar to the traditional tie-dying method, but it does not require hot water or as much preparation as the traditional method.;
, Although this method uses acrylic paints, which are more opaque than fabric dye, you will get the best results with a white or light-colored shirt. The paint will be watered down, so some of the shirt's original color will show through.


You can tie-dye almost anything, from T-shirts to pants and skirts to even baseball caps.

, You will need ½ part fabric textile medium, 1 part paint, and 3 parts water. Pour everything into a plastic applicator bottle and shake it up to mix everything together. The fabric textile medium will prevent the paint from becoming too stiff once it has dried.Use a different applicator bottle for each color.
The colors will bleed together, so avoid using contrasting colors such as red and green, blue and orange, and yellow and purple, or you will get some muddy browns in your finished piece!, You can also dip the shirt in some water and twist it tightly to wring all of the excess water out. You want the shirt to be damp, not soaking-wet.

, You can create different patterns depending on how you wrap the rubber bands around your shirt. Here are a few popular designs:Stripes are the easiest and simplest design. Simply fold your shirt up like a fan or accordion creating a sort of rope. You can do width-wise, length-wise, or even diagonally. Wrap a rubber band around one end of your ""rope,"" then wrap another rubber band two to three inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) down. Keep doing this until you reach the end of your rope.
The sunburst is a circular design, with each ray or ring being a different color. Pinch the middle of your shirt and pull it towards you. Tie the end off with a rubber band. Go a little further down your shirt and tie it off with another rubber band. Keep doing this until you have a thick ""rope"" made out of fabric and rubber bands.
The spiral is another popular design. Place your shirt down on a flat surface. Pinch the middle of your shirt and twist it. Keep twisting until you have created a spiral, or something like looks like a cinnamon roll. Wrap a large rubber band around the ""bun"" you have made. Then wrap another rubber band, but this time in the opposite direction, making a cross shape. You can wrap more rubber bands around your bun, sectioning it like a pizza or cake.

, Work over a container, such as a plastic container or an aluminum tray. Press the tip of the applicator against the fabric and squeeze gently. This allows the paint to absorb directly into the fabric as opposed to squirting out everywhere.

, Place a wire rack over some paper towels, newspaper, or a baking sheet. Then, without removing the rubber bands, set the shirt down on the wire rack.This will allow any excess paint to drip down, and prevent it from pooling under your shirt. Let the shirt sit for one hour, so that the colors can set into the fabric., The shirt should be mostly dry by now, but the center might still be wet. Hang it up in a sunny spot until it is fully dry. This will also help relax any wrinkles. Keep in mind that the cooler or more humid it is, the longer it will take for your shirt to dry.

, To make the colors more permanent, toss the shirt into a drier for about 15 minutes. After this, your shirt is ready to wear and wash.

Consider reverse tie-dye.,
Lightly mist the shirt with water.,
Find a colored shirt.,
Tie rubber bands around the shirt.,
Protect yourself and your clothes.,
Prepare your bleach solution.,
Apply the bleach to the shirt.,
Let the bleach set.,
Remove the rubber bands and rinse.,
Dry the shirt.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt the Quick and Easy Way2," By using bleach, you can take away color from an already-colored shirt. This is known as reverse tie-dye and takes less than traditional tie-dyeing because you do not have to prepare the dyes or let the dyes cure. Adult supervision is recommended for this method.

, You can also dip the shirt in some water and twist it tightly to wring all of the excess water out. You want the shirt to be damp, not soaking-wet.

, Unlike with traditional tie-dying, you will be taking away color instead of adding it. For this, you will need a colored shirt. The bleached out areas will be lighter in color, except in the case of a black shirt—the bleached out areas will usually turn copper.


The brighter color the shirt is, the more effective the bleach will be.

, You can create different patterns depending on how you wrap the rubber bands around your shirt. Here are some popular designs:


To create some simple stripes, fold your shirt up like a fan or accordion. You are creating a sort of rope. You can fold width-wise, length-wise, or even diagonally. Tie off one end of your rope with a rubber band. Wrap another rubber band two to three inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) down from the first one. Keep doing this until you reach the end of the rope.
To create a sunburst, pinch the middle of your shirt and pull it towards you. Wrap a rubber band around the end. Go a little further down the shirt and wrap another rubber band around it. Keep doing this until you have a sort of ""rope.""
To make a spiral design, place your shirt down on a flat surface and pinch the middle. Give the shirt a small twist. Keep twisting until you have created something like looks like a cinnamon roll. Wrap a rubber band around the ""bun."" Then wrap another rubber band, but this time in the other direction, creating a cross. You can wrap more rubber bands around your bun, sectioning it like a pizza or cake.

, Because you will be working with bleach, you will need to protect both yourself and your clothes. Wear some gloves to protect your skin, and an apron or artist's smock to protect your clothes. You can also wear some old clothes that you do not mind potentially getting ruined or stained.

, You will need one part bleach and one part water. Pour both into a spray bottle. , Working over a sink or a deep aluminum tray, start squirting the bleach solution onto the shirt. Cover the entire shirt and get it as wet with the solution as possible.

, Place the shirt some place where it will not be disturbed, and let it sit for about 30 minutes.You can also use undiluted bleach instead, and apply it to the shirt at five minute intervals. The shirt will be bleached in about 10 to 15 minutes.

, Once the shirt has bleached to your preference, remove the rubber bands and rinse the shirt under cool water. You may see some of the dye come out. Keep rinsing until the water starts to run clear.If you cannot take them off, because you wrapped them too tightly, you can cut them off using a pair of scissors. Be careful not to accidentally cut your shirt!

, You can now either hang the shirt up to dry, or you can toss the shirt into the drier.

Consider tie-dyeing your shirt using Sharpies.,
Start with a clean, white shirt.,
Insert a plastic cup inside your shirt and secure it with a rubber band.,
Start creating small rings and circles using dots.,
Drip the alcohol onto the design.,
Let the shirt dry.,
Set the design using heat.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt the Quick and Easy Way3," While it might be a little more difficult to create large designs that cover the entire shirt using the Sharpie method, you can use this technique to create smaller designs, such as flowers and spirals. This section will teach you how to create smaller tie-dye designs using Sharpies and rubbing alcohol.You will need:


Sharpie permanent markers in various colors (or one color if you so choose).
Rubbing alcohol.
An applicator bottle or an eye dropper.
Rubber bands.
Plastic cups.

, Because Sharpies are translucent, the color of your shirt will show throw. This means that if you draw with a yellow sharpie over a light blue shirt, you will get green. A white base, however, will give you the brightest, most vibrant results. Make sure that the shirt (or any other item you are using) is clean, as any dirt or oils may prevent the Sharpie inks from adhering properly.

, Decide where you want your first design to be, then place a plastic up inside the shirt. Pull the fabric taut over the rim of the cup. Secure it with a rubber band by stretching the band around the fabric and the cup.You are creating a sort of mini fabric-and-cup drum.


You can also use an embroidery hoop instead of a plastic cup and a rubber band. Simply tuck the inner circle inside the shirt, and secure it by placing the outer circle over it and the shirt.

, Press the tip of your Sharpie down onto the fabric, creating a small dot. Make the next dot no more than a centimeter away from the first one. Keep making dots until you have a complete circle or ring—you are essentially making a dotted line. You can make the dots as big or as small as you want, but they should not be touching. Be sure to work inside your cup. Here are some design ideas:


You can create fireworks by making two circles, one inside the other. Use a different color for each circle.Create flowers by making one big dot, and then making a ring of smaller dots around it. These smaller dots will become petals.

, Once you are satisfied with your design, you can start adding the rubbing alcohol. You can soak up some rubbing alcohol with an eyedropper and squeeze it onto your design. This will give you more control, and works best on smaller designs. You can also fill an applicator bottle with rubbing alcohol and drizzle the alcohol over the design. This will give you less control, but it is much faster and you won't have to refill as often. As you continue adding alcohol, the Sharpie inks will begin to dissolve and spread, resulting in a tie-dye effect.

, Because you used rubbing alcohol, this should not take very long. Once the shirt is dry, take it off the cup.

, You can either toss the shirt into the drier (set to high) for 15 minutes, or you can simply iron the design for 5 minutes instead. If you are using an iron, find and adult to help you, and make sure that it is set to the highest temperature."

Consider using the traditional method.,
Find something white-colored to dye.,
Wear protective clothing.,
Protect your work area or work outdoors.,
Decide how many and what colors you want your shirt to be.,
Prepare your dye baths.,
Consider adding salt or vinegar to the dye bath to help set the colors.,
Tie rubber bands around the shirt.,
Start dyeing your shirt.,
Rinse the shirt.,
Hand wash the shirt and hang it up to dry.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt the Quick and Easy Way4," While the traditional method may take some extra effort, it is both fun and easy. If you use salt or vinegar in your dye bath, you will not have to let the dye sit for as long.

, Because clothing dyes are translucent, you will get the brightest and most vibrant colors if you use white-colored clothes. You can use other light colors, such as pastels, yellow, light tan, and light grey, but keep in mind that the original color will blend with the dye color. This means that if you try to tie-dye a yellow shirt blue, you will get green instead.


Clothes made from cotton, linen, rayon, and wool work the best.
Avoid, acrylic, metallic, polyester, and spandex fabrics, as they will not take dye as easily if at all.You can tie-dye almost anything, from T-shirts to pants and skirts to even baseball caps.

, Fabric dye may not only dye the white shirt you will be using, but it may also dye your clothes if you are not careful. It can also irritate your skin, or stain it for a few days. To protect both your clothes and skin, you will need to take some extra precautions. Here are some tips:


Wear old clothes that you do not mind getting stained or dirty. Dark-colored clothes will hide dye stains better than light-colored clothes.
If you do not have any old clothes to spare, then wear shorts, a sleeveless top, and an apron.
Consider wearing some plastic gloves, such as the type you might use to wash dishes or dye your hair. You can also find plastic tie-dyeing clothes in the T-shirt and tie-dye section of an arts and crafts store.

, Tie-dyeing can get messy, and while it is possible to clean up the worst of the stains using some rubbing alcohol, it is best to work outside. If you must work indoors, spread several layers of newspaper over your work area to protect it.

, Most tie-dye shirts look best with two to three colors, and use either the primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) or the secondary colors (orange, green, and purple).How many colors you decide to use will determine how many buckets you will need. Each color will need its own bucket.

, You can do this by willing a bucket with hot water, pouring in the dye, and stirring. The water will have to be at least 140°F (60°C). Most dyes will need to be diluted with hot water, and how much water will usually depend on the brand. In general, ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of liquid dye requires 2 to 3 gallons (7.57 to 11.35 liters) of hot water. Most powder dyes need to be dissolved in 1 cup (225 milliliters) of hot water first, and then added to the 2 to 3 gallon dye bath., While adding salt or vinegar to your dye bath may sound strange, adding one of these items will not only help the colors appear brighter and more vibrant, but it will also help ""seal"" them in and make them last longer. Once you have added the salt or vinegar, give your dye bath another stir to make sure everything is combined. Here is how you can use salt and vinegar in your dye bath:If your clothing is made out of cotton, linen, rayon, or ramie, add 1 cup (280 grams) salt for every 3 gallons (11.35 liters) of water.
If your clothing is made out of nylon, silk, or wool, add 1 cup (225 milliliters) white vinegar for every 3 gallons (11.35 liters) of water.

, You can create different designs by wrapping rubber bands around your shirt in different ways. Here are some ideas:


To get a striped pattern, fold your shirt up like a fan or accordion. You can fold it width-wise, length-wise, or diagonally. Wrap a rubber band around one end of your shirt, then wrap another rubber band two to three inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) away from the first one. Keep doing this until you reach the other end of the shirt. You are creating something that looks like a rope.
The sunburst is a circular, radiating design, with each ray being a different color. Pinch the middle of your shirt and pull it towards you. Wrap a rubber band around the end. Tie a second rubber band a little further down your. You are creating something that look like a rope.
To make a spiral, start by placing your shirt down on a flat surface. Pinch the middle of your shirt and twist it. Keep twisting until you have created something like looks like a cinnamon roll. Wrap a rubber band around the ""bun."" Then, wrap another rubber band, but this time in the opposite direction, making a cross shape. You can wrap more rubber bands around your bun, sectioning it like a pizza or cake.

, Take your shirt and dip part of it into the dye bath. If you are using multiple colors, dip it into the lightest color first. Leave the shirt in dye bath for 4 to 10 minutes before taking it out. For a more intense color, leave the shirt in the bath for 30 minutes.If you are using multiple colors, rinse the freshly-dyed part of the shirt under cool water first to remove any excess dye. Squeeze the extra water out from the shirt, and dip it into the next color.
The longer the shirt sits in the dye bath, the darker the color will become.
If the water is too hot for you to handle, try wearing some dish washing gloves to protect your hands. You can also use a pair of chopsticks or tongs to move the shirt around instead.

, Once you have dyed your shirt to your linking, you can snip the rubber bands off with a pair of scissors and rinse the shirt with cool water to get rid of any extra dye. Keep rinsing until the water starts to run clear. Squeeze the extra water out from the shirt.

, Wash the shirt using warm water and a gentle detergent. Rinse it out again using cool water, and hang it to dry. You can also toss the shirt into the drier.

Wearing gloves, soak the fabric in soda ash mixture for about ten minutes.,
Place the fabric on a clean table with a plastic drop cloth or shower curtain on it.,
Wearing gloves, on a drop cloth, starting with the lightest color, dye the fabric, use the bands to guide you, overlap your colors for mixing effect, use enough dye to soak the deepest fabric to get a unified pattern throughout the fabric.,
Wait at least ten hours for the dye to set.,

",How to Tie Dye Anything Made from Natural Fabric," Wring out enough liquid that the fabric is still damp.;
, Decide what fold you want to make, and what colors you want to use in step three. There are several folds.


A spiral is easy. Place your finger in the point you want the spiral to come out of, spin the fabric around your finger until it is a tight twist. Tie it with bands it should look like a pizza.






A bunch pattern is how it sounds, bunch and tie.
A yolk is more complex. You have to fold the fabric down the middle. Start to accordion fold from the unfolded ends at a forty five degree angle until you have folded all the fabric. Experimentation is needed to understand the art.

Make stripes.,
Create a spiral.,
Create polka dots.,
Make rosettes.,
Give your shirt a crumpled look.,
Create pleats.,
Create a lightning bolt.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt1," Lay your shirt out flat on a table. Roll it from the bottom hem to the neck, so that you end up with a long tube of shirt. Use string or rubber bands to tie loops around the shirt roll.









To create only a few stripes, space out the ties so that there are three or less. For many stripes, use a dozen or more ties around the shirt.
Rolling the shirt upwards will create vertical stripes.
If you are interested in creating horizontal strips, roll the shirt from left to right (or vice versa), and tie the strings along this direction.;
, This is the most basic of the tie dye techniques and one of the most popular. To create a spiral on your shirt, first lay it flat on a countertop or table. Then, put your thumb and index finger in the center of the shirt. Begin moving them in a circular motion, spiraling the shirt around the center point.









When you have spiraled the entire shirt, use large rubber bands or strings to tie the shirt. You will need to create at least six sections, so use at least three rubber bands or strings over the shirt. It should be roughly round shaped, and have “pie slices” with the addition of the ties.
For a more intricate pattern, use more ties. Make sure that there is one center point at which they all cross though.
You can create multiple small spirals by spiraling your shirt in multiple smaller sections using the method from above.
If your shirt begins to form ridges, flatten them out. Your shirt should be spiraled, but it should stay flat on the table.

, Take your shirt, and pinch small sections of fabric between your fingers. Tie a piece of string around the end of the fabric. To create small dots, only leave one-half to one inch of fabric outside of the tie. Larger dots can be made by tying the fabric further down so that a larger section of fabric sticks out.









You can create target-shaped dots by adding more pieces of string on the ends of the pieces that have been tied. Adding more ties will create more rings.
Try using string that has been dipped in dye before tying it to add an extra ring of color to the outside of your dots.

, These are small floral shaped dots spread out around your shirt. To do this, pinch a small section of your shirt together. Transfer the pinched section to one hand, and then pinch another nearby section. Again, transfer this section to your opposite hand. When you have a group of pinched sections, lace them with a string or rubber band.









Use multiple strings to create more of a striped/spiraled pattern in your rosette. You can make as many rosettes on your shirt as you have room for.
Use more pinches of fabric to create a more detailed rosette. Using only a few will leave a very basic, simple rosette print.

, The easiest way to tie dye is to take your shirt and crumple it up however you would like. It should be very messy and rumpled, not neatly rolled or folded. Then, take as many strings and rubber bands as you would like, and wrap them all over the shirt. You can create a pattern with them, but for the most “crumpled” look don’t follow any direction.








, Start at the bottom of your shirt, and fold it upwards in the accordion style. To do that, you should fold a section towards the front, and then take that section and fold it towards the back. Repeat this pattern until the entire shirt has been folded.









Tie the shirt in as many times as you would like. This style is similar to creating stripes, so the number of ties you add will determine the number of stripes.
Folding the shirt upwards will create vertical pleats. To create horizontal pleats, follow the same directions and fold the shirt from left to right (or vice versa).

, This is the most complicated design and requires a lot of folding. It is, however one of the most attractive. Begin by folding the shirt upwards at about chest level and then folding the section back down, creating an N-shape if viewed from the side. Do this again, but lower down. Fold a section about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the top of the first fold upwards, and then fold it back down. Repeat this 3-5 times, until your shirt has several layered folds.









The layered folds will have an appearance similar to that of an old-fashioned washboard.
Turn the shirt diagonally and visually mark a line down the center. Accordion fold from one side to the center, and then turn the shirt and accordion fold from the other side to the center.
Tie the shirt in bunches once you have finished all the folding. For a more detailed lightning-bolt shape, use many strings or rubber bands. If you prefer a more basic look, use only 3-4 ties.

Dry and wear your shirt.",How to Tie Dye a Shirt2," Tie dying, or any fabric dying, is a very messy business. To prevent unwanted dye accidents, set up a table with a plastic covering (like a plastic tablecloth or garbage bags) outside or away from any furniture or carpet.









Make sure that you have all your supplies gathered with you at your work area, so that you don’t have to run around with gloves on or worry about spilling anything in the process of moving things.
Consider using a cookie drying rack to elevate your shirt above your workstation, to give you the best access to every angle of it.
Be sure that you have extra paper towels or old rags handy to wipe up accidental spills.

, Many dye packages come with a soda ash solution, which helps the dye to bond with the fabric of your shirt. Dissolve the soda ash solution into a bowl of water, and let your shirt soak for around twenty minutes.


If your dye did not come with soda ash, you can soak the shirt in lukewarm water. You can also choose to buy soda ash separate from your dye kit at a local craft store.
Do not use cold or hot water, as they will make the dyes less effective.
If you don’t want the dyes to spread very far on the shirt, don’t get it wet before adding the color. Dying a damp shirt helps the color to travel further, faster. So, if you want your color to be relatively isolated, dye it while it’s dry., Each dye package should come with directions listing specific amounts and proportions of dye to water. If you would rather wing it or don’t have your directions, mix your different dyes in bowls of lukewarm water as you like.









To create colors that are more pastel or faded, use more water and less dye. To create bright, vibrant colors, use most of the dye in the package and not so much water.

, Keep the dye in the bowls to do a layered dip tie dye, or carefully pour them into spray bottles. To do a dip dye, pick up your shirt and dunk it into the dye in different places. You can soak the whole shirt in a single color, and then dip the shirt (after ringing the initial color out) into other bowls of dye. Using a spray bottle to dye your shirt is easy; simply squirt the dye onto the desired area, layering colors if desired.









If you plan on layering colors, always apply your lightest ones first. Applying a light color over a dark one will only muddle them.
If you mix complementary colors - colors opposite each other on the color wheel - the places they meet will be a brownish hue. These include orange and blue, yellow and purple, and red and green.
Don’t feel obligated to dye the entire shirt. You can do a few small sections of tie dye and allow the original shirt color to show through on the rest of the area.

, Wrap the shirt up in a plastic grocery bag or saran-wrap to keep it moist. Then, set it aside for 4-6 hours so that the dye has time to react with the cloth. Placing the shirt in a warm area will help the dye to cure faster.








, Wearing rubber gloves, take the shirt out of the plastic bag and unwrap any string or rubber bands that you used. Then, rinse it with cold water in your sink to remove any excess dye. Be careful not to splash the water too much to avoid dying your clothes or countertops.








, Throw your shirt into your washing machine by itself. Put the wash setting on cold water, and wait for the process to finish. If you want, you can run your wash again with an empty cycle and a bit of soap to get rid of any dye that might have transferred to the inside of the machine.








, You can toss your shirt into the dryer by itself putting the machine on the coolest setting, or simply allow the shirt to hang dry. Then, wear your new shirt around town!

Dilute vinegar in a bucket or large glass bowl.,
Submerge the fabric to soak for a period of time.,
Wash the fabric in a washing machine.,
Wash your fabrics in cold water.,
Add baking soda to your washing machine.,
Pour in vinegar during the rinse cycle.",How to Set Tie Dye," Pour salt and/or vinegar into the pot. Add enough cold water that you will be able to submerge your fabric later.For berry dye, use 1/2 cup of salt for every eight cups of water.
For plant dyes, use one part vinegar to every four parts water.;
, Bring the solution to a boil over high heat. Reduce the temperature to medium-low to maintain a simmer. Submerge the fabric and allow the solution to simmer for one hour.You can use tongs to carefully lower the fabric into the simmering solution.

, Remove the pot from heat and allow it to cool. Remove the fabric from the pot and wring out the liquid. Hand wash the fabric with just cold water.If you’re in a hurry, you can drain the pot and cool down the fabric right away with cold water in the sink.

, Pour in one to two cups of vinegar. Add a generous sprinkle of sea salt or table salt. Pour enough cold water in the container to submerge your fabric.Use a teaspoon or two of salt for a large bowl. Use more for a bucket.
Use one cup of vinegar for a bowl or two cups of vinegar for a bucket., Put on gloves before handling the dyed fabric. Place the fabric into the solution. Swish it around with your hands so that the fabric is fully moistened and submerged.Allow the fabric to soak for at least 30 minutes, up to one hour.

, Take the fabric out of the bowl or bucket and wring it out. Place your fabric into the washing machine. Add 1/2 cup of table salt and one cup of white vinegar, if desired.Use a cold water setting. Tumble or hang dry.Don’t add anything else to the load the first time or two that you wash your tie dye fabric.
Adding salt and vinegar is optional. Make sure that is compatible with your washing machine.
Laundry detergent is not necessary for this first washing. If desired, add just a small amount., Don’t use warm or hot water to wash your color-dyed fabrics. Choose the cold water setting, and use a color brightening laundry detergent., Pour in 1/2 cup of baking soda while your machine is on the wash cycle. Alternately, use a liquid laundry detergent with baking soda in it.Baking soda helps dyed fabrics to stay bright.
As a bonus, baking soda can also tackle washing machine odor!

, Add 1/4 cup of white vinegar for a small load, or 1/2 cup for a large load. Use this technique to help colors stay vivid, and also as a natural fabric softener.Vinegar softens fabric by dissolving mineral, soap and residue build-up.Vinegar is also anti-microbial and safer than chemicals.

Protect yourself and your workplace.,
Find an assortment of rusty items.,
Choose a light-colored fabric.,
Spread the fabric onto a tray.,
Spray the fabric with a solution made from vinegar and water.,
Arrange metal items over your fabric in a pattern that you like.,
Spray the fabric once more with the vinegar-water.,
Cover the fabric with a large plastic bag or sheet.,
Leave the fabric some place warm until the rust develops.,
Remove the metal objects.,
Prepare a saline solution.,
Soak the fabric in the saline solution for 30 minutes.,
Wash the fabric.,
Dry the fabric.",How to Rust Dye Fabric," Cover your work surface with a plastic bag or cheap, plastic tablecloth. Put on an old set of clothes you don't mind ruining. Lastly, put on a pair of plastic gloves. The type you'd use in the kitchen work best., The items don't have to be completely rusted through, but they should already be old. Nails, bike chains, and gears work especially well for this. You can find items in second-hand shops or garage sales.

, White is deal, but you can use natural, unbleached cotton as well. Both natural and synthetic types of fabrics dye well, but cotton or silk work the best. Wool also takes dye well, but it tends to come out darker. Consider a wool/cotton blend instead., If you can't find a tray big enough for the fabric, you can spread the fabric in a large, plastic sheet instead. You can also wrinkle or ripple the fabric; this will help create even more texture later on.

, Fill a large spray bottle with equal parts of water and white vinegar. Shake the bottle to mix the two together, then spray the fabric with it. Make sure that it is evenly soaked., Avoid clumping the items together, or the top pieces won't show on the finished piece. You can use as many or as few items as you want..Here are some more arrangement ideas:Stripes: wrap the fabric around a pole, then scrunch it down.
Starburst: fold the fabric over a small metal object, then tie it into a knot below the object.
Specific shapes: lay down a template over the fabric, then fill the template with iron fillings.
Grid: weave metal nails in and out through the fabric, like sewing. Have some going horizontal, and others vertical.

, Make sure that you coat the rusty items as well. If you bundled the fabric around the items, make sure that you spray it all around, including the back., Tuck the edges under the first plastic sheet (or tray) to help lock in the moisture. If you spread the metal pieces across the fabric, consider placing some heavy books on top. This presses the objects into the fabric and ensures a clearer print.Bundled or wrapped pieces don't need to be weighed down.

, How long you leave the fabric depends on how intense you want the rust to be. The longer you leave the objects on the fabric, the darker the color will be. For a subtle effect, leave the objects in the fabric for a few hours to one day. For a darker color, leave the objects on the fabric for 4 to 5 days.Check on the fabric every so often. If you leave the fabric rusting too long, it may develop holes.

, Remove the plastic covering first, then put on your plastic gloves again. Take the metal items off of the fabric and set them aside so that they can dry. Recycle them or save them for future project.

, Fill a large bucket or plastic tub with 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of warm water. Stir in 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of salt. The saline solution will help stop the rusting process.The salt also helps make the dye permanent.If you dyed a large amount of fabric, make more of the saline solution. Use 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of salt for every gallon (3.8 liters) of water.

, Place the fabric into the bucket, then press down on it. Make sure that it is completely covered by the water. Wait 30 minutes, then remove the fabric from the solution., How you wash it depends on what it is made out of. If you used cotton or synthetic fabric, wash it as you normally would in the washing machine. If you used wool or silk fabric, you will need to wash it by hand with dish soap or hand-washing laundry soap., Again, how you dry the fabric depends on what it's made from. You can cotton or synthetic fabric in the dryer or on the clothesline. Wool or silk fabric should be hung up to dry. Once the fabric is dry, you can use it as you wish.

Clean the tie-dyed fabric.",How to Make Simple Tie Dye," Tie-dyeing is a messy activity, so you’ll want to set up a work area that allows you leeway for working with colored dye and, generally speaking, making a mess!


You’ll need a plastic covering for your work surface. A paint tarp will work. Or you can lay down garbage bags according to your needs.An apron or smock will be needed to protect your clothes. It’s best to wear old clothes. Consider them your “dye” clothes and use them whenever you tie dye.Wear rubber gloves. They’ll protect your hands from the dye and also the hot water.Have a good pile of rubber bands on hand for wrapping your fabrics to create different designs.You also might need about half a dozen marbles if you choose the marble-made circular design.You’ll need scissors, a large metal spoon for stirring, and tongs for removing clothing from dye bathes.Set aside cleanser or bleach. They’ll be needed for cleaning up.;
, You can buy individual packets of dye, or you can use bottled dye. You can also buy kits from a craft store.Purchase a squirt bottle if you don’t have one. Sixteen ounces will dye about a dozen shirts., There are many colored dyes to select from. Some colors that wouldn't otherwise be compatible work when they're gradually blended together, as happens during the tie dye process. Be creative.One of the most popular choices is rainbow. Yellow, orange, aqua, blue, purple and fuschia make up the rainbow color.Turquoise with a lighter amount of fuchsia will make blue.Try mixing raspberry, brown, turquoise and bronze for a darker result.Jade brown, turquoise and olive green result in greenish hues.Green apple, yellow and olive also create a green finish.Deep purple and turquoise are a bright combination., White cotton works well. You can also dye nylon, wool or silk.White cotton t-shirts are often used for tie-dyeing, but there are lots of possibilities, from gloves to tennis shoes.
Put aside 1 cup of salt if you're working with cotton. Adding salt to the dye bath enhances color.If you're dyeing other materials like nylon, silk or wool, you'll need a cup of white vinegar. It gentles the process for sensitive materials., Use enamel or stainless steel rather than plastic containers if you can. Plastic will stain. The buckets will be filled with hot water and dye. They should hold about 3 gallons each.You'll need a separate bucket for every color you plan to use.

, Rubber bands bunch or shape the material in various ways to make patterns, once the bands are removed. Patterns are created because the dye of the immersed item does not reach the parts of the fabric that are bunched together.Wrapping the fabric tightly will produce more white areas that the dye can't reach.
You can use string instead of rubber bands if you wish.

, Find the center of your fabric where you'd like the core of the circle to be. Pinch that section and slip a marble inside the material just behind where you're pinching it. Than fasten a rubber band behind the marble.








Continue to add marbles and rubber bands. The rubber bands prevent the material from being dyed. This, in turn, will leave white circles on the dyed background. , Roll your fabric tightly from side to side or top to bottom. Side to side will make horizontal stripes, while top to bottom will make vertical stripes. Make spaces along the fabric with your rubber bands. Make the spaces even so that the striped pattern will look neat. The bands will produce white stripes when finished.







, Fold the shirt/fabric in half. A mirror image results on each layer folded.Using a t-shirt for example: fold the material from right to left so that the arms overlap. This will make the pattern run side to side. To make the mirror top to bottom, the bottom part of the shirt should be folded up to the neck.








, Pinch the center of the t-shirt or other fabric and twist until the material is in a circle. Use rubber bands to hold it in place.








Another method for making a spiral design (using a t-shirt as an example) would be to twist the shirt around your finger while pinning the shirt to the table. Your finger serves as the axes around which the shirt is rotated. When you’ve wound the shirt tightly, remove your finger and wrap the shirt in rubber bands. Use three or four bands fixed to the fabric so that they crisscross in the center of the material., Crunch the fabric into a ball. Use rubber bands to wrap the fabric in different directions. Remember: the tighter you wrap the fabric, the more white areas will be left on the fabric.







, Fill your three-gallon containers with hot water. You can heat up water in the microwave or use a tea kettle if necessary. Arrange the buckets from darkest dye to lightest dye so that you begin with the darkest dye.









You'll only need one three-gallon container if your fabric is going to be all the same color.
Alternately, you can try low-water immersion, leaving just enough water to cover the garment. Bunching the garment in a smaller container will give it a crystalline appearance., Follow the instructions on the package. For powdered dye, dissolve the powder in a little hot water before adding it to the bath. About ¼ cup dye to 1 cup hot water should do the trick.








For darker or brighter colors, use twice the amount of dye.
For cotton items, add a cup of salt to the dye bath to bring out the color.For silk, wool or nylon, add 1 cup white vinegar to protect the material.Stir well using your metal spoon to be sure the dye is mixed with the water. If you're using salt, make sure it has dissolved before moving on., If you're using more than one color, hold the section of the fabric to be dyed in its color. Remove it when you're finished. Move on to the next dye bath and repeat the process with a new section of the fabric.








If you're working with only one color you can let the fabric soak up the color in the dye bath according to how dark you'd like it to be. The longer you leave the fabric in the dye bath, the darker the color will be.
Remove the item when it looks a little darker than your preferred shade. When it dries it will lighten up.Use tongs or rubber gloves to immerse a multicolored item in each of its dye baths. When you're finished, cut away the rubber bands using your scissors.

, The dye will most likely bleed onto the white areas of the fabric. This adds to the ""tie-dye flair.""









Rinse the newly dyed item under warm water. Choose a mild detergent for your dyed item.Gradually cool the water and continue to rinse as it cools.
Rinse in cool water, until the water runs clear. Keep those rubber gloves on so that your hands don't get dyed!Squeeze out excess water gently. You can roll the item an old towel.
Machine dry or hang to dry."

Purchase a cover button kit from a fabric store or a craft store.,
Find the template in your kit.,
Use the template to trace a circle onto your fabric.,
Cut the circle out with fabric scissors.,
Place the fabric center into the bottom part of the tool.,
Press the button cover into the rubber cup, right over the fabric.,
Tuck the fabric into the button cover.,
Place the back of the button cover on top.,
Place the plastic cap on top of the shank.,
Push down on the cap with your thumbs.,
Remove the finished button from the kit.",How to Make Buttons1," They come with metal button covers and metal button shanks. They also come with two cap-shaped tools: a large rubbery one, and a smaller plastic one.
, Some kits include a plastic disk inside the package. Other kits have a disk printed on the back of the packaging. If your kit is the latter of the two, cut the disk out.

Some templates have a hole in the middle. This is for printed fabrics to ensure that the design is centered.Some kits have a semi-circle printed on the back. You will need to trace this on a piece of folded fabric, with the flat part along the folded edge.If you lost the template, cut a square out of cardstock or thin cardboard that is twice the size of the button cover, then round the corners., Choose a lightweight fabric, such as cotton. Spread it out on a flat surface, wrong side up. Place the template on top of the fabric. Trace around the template using a pen or chalk. It would be best to use a washable tailor's chalk or pen for this.

If your fabric is very thin, use two layers of fabric. You can also iron some interfacing to the wrong side of the fabric instead., If you need to make more covered buttons, trace and cut more circles. Depending on how thin your fabric is, you may be able to cut several circles out at once by folding the fabric a few times., Find the rubbery, cup-shaped piece in your button cover kit. Set it down on a flat surface with the cupped part facing up. Place the fabric circle on top of it, right-side-down., Find one of the dome-shaped metal pieces in your kit. Place it rounded-side-down into the rubber cup until it hits the bottom. The hollow part of the button cover should be facing up. The fabric will wrinkle around the button cover as you sink it into the rubber cup.

The fabric circle may get dislodged during the step. You want an even amount of fabric sticking out all around the button. If it gets dislodged, gently tug on the edges to adjust it.

, Hold it in place with your finger. You can also sew around the edges of the fabric circle, then pull on the threads to gather the fabric. This is not really necessary, however., Find one of the pieces in your kit that looks like a flat, metal disk with a looped wire sticking out of it. Place it into the rubber cup, on top of the fabric and button cover. Make sure that the fabric is tucked inside the button cover. Hold the backing in place with your finger.

Some kits include two different types of backings: a shanked type and a flat type. The shanked type are if you want to sew the button onto a garment. The flat type are if you want to glue the button onto something (such as an earring post)., Find the other part of your kit: the one that looks like a plastic cup. Place it cupped/hollow side down over the shank. The smooth side should be sticking up. Make sure that everything is even and tucked in., You will feel a slight click as the metal backing sinks into the button cover. You may even hear a light click. If you are having trouble pushing the cap down, you can tap it gently with a hammer or mallet.Be very careful, however; too much pressure may crack the plastic cap., Pull the plastic cap away. Gently turn the rubber cup upside down. If the button doesn't fall out, gently pull on the sides or press on the back, then pry the button out. Avoid pulling it by the shank, as it could come apart."

Get a small, plastic ring.,
Make your template.,
Trace the circle onto cotton fabric, then cut it out.,
Sketch out your stitching guidelines.,
Sew a simple straight stitch around the edge of your fabric.,
Gather the fabric around the ring.,
Tack the gathers into place.,
Fold the raw edges of the fabric inside.,
Sew the gap shut.,
Sew around the button, just inside the ring.,
Cut a circle out of felt.,
Stitch the felt to the back of the button.,
Make the shank.,
Reinforce the shank.",How to Make Buttons2," They are often called ""bone rings."" You can find them in the drapery section or crochet section in a fabric store. A well-stocked craft store may also carry them.

Aim for something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in diameter.

, Measure the diameter of the ring. Multiply it by 21/2. Draw a circle on a sheet of cardstock with the new measurement as the diameter. Cut the circle out.If your fabric is a pattern on it, cut a circle out of the middle of your template. The circle needs to be the same size as your ring.

, Spread your fabric on a flat surface, right-side-down. Place the template on top of the fabric. Trace around the circle using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out when you are done.If your fabric has a pattern on it, make sure that the template is centered. Use the hole in the middle as a guide.

, Place your fabric circle wrong-side-up on the table. Set your plastic ring down in the center. Trace around the plastic ring using a tailor's chalk or pen. Keep your line halfway between the ring and the edge of the fabric., Thread your needle and tie both ends of the thread into a knot. Start sewing on the wrong side of your fabric. Finish sewing on the right side of the fabric. Do not knot the thread when you are done.Make sure that the thread you are using is strong, preferably nylon or polyester., Place the ring on the wrong side of the fabric. Make sure that it is centered. Gently pull on the thread until the fabric gathers around the ring. Don't cut the thread yet.If your fabric has a pattern on it, check the front to make sure that it is centered. Adjust it, if needed.

, Using the same needle and thread, pass the needle back through some of the gathers, anchoring them in place. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button. Tie the thread into a knot when you are done. Don't cut it yet., Use a knitting needle or small crochet hook to tuck the raw edges of the fabric under itself and into the covered button., Make two small stitches across the back of the button. Pull on the thread to close the gap. Make two more stitches right across the first two, forming an X. Tug on them gently to further close the gap. Knot the thread, then snip it off., Thread a needle with some embroidery floss. Knot the end of the floss, then sew around the button using a straight stitch or a backstitch. Keep your stitches against the inside edge of the ring. When you are back where you started, knot the floss on the back of the button, then cut it.You can use matching or contrasting embroidery floss.

, Place your button on a sheet of felt. Trace around it using a tailor's chalk or pen. Cut the circle out.The felt can be the same color as your button, or a contrasting one., Use a small whipstitch to secure the felt to the back of the button. When you are back where you started, pull the needle under the felt and out through the center-back of the button. Be careful not to pierce through the front of the button.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.

, Place a pen over the back of the button. Make two stitches over the pen and through the felt. Make sure that the stitches are coming out of the same spot. When you are done, slide the pen out. You should now have a loop made out of thread.You can also use a pencil, crochet hook, knitting needle, or paintbrush.

, Wind the thread around the shank to make it thicker. When you are done, knot the thread to the bottom of the shank. Pull the needle and thread through the felt, and out on the other side of the shank. Snip off the excess thread. Your button is now complete!"

Get a thick branch.,
Cut off jagged the ends of the branch.,
Mark off on the branch where you want to cut your buttons.,
Saw across the branch, using the lines you made as a guide.,
Draw the button holes on the flat side of the button.,
Drill the holes in the button using your dots as a guide.,
Buff the front and back of each button with a piece of sandpaper.,
Paint or decorate the buttons, if desired.,
Polish and seal the buttons.",How to Make Buttons3," How thick the branch is depends on how wide you want your buttons to be. The bark will give your button a nice texture. If you want a simpler button, choose a wooden dowel instead., You can use a hacksaw or an electric table saw for this step.This will get rid of the jagged, spiky ends of the branch, and ensure that your first and last buttons are smooth.

Wear safety glasses and gloves for this step.

, Use a pencil to sketch lines across the branch. They should be ⅛ to ¼ inch (0.32 to 0.64 centimeter) apart.If you make them too thin, they may end up breaking or cracking.If the pencil doesn't show up, lightly score lines using a craft blade instead.
You do not have to draw the lines across the entire branch. It really depends on how many buttons you want to make.

, Once again, use a hacksaw or an electric table saw for this step. If the branch wobbles around too much, consider setting it down into a miter box, and then using the grooves as a cutting guide.

, Pick up one of the wood disks. Choose a side to be the back. Draw 2 or 4 dots in the center with a pen or pencil. These will be the guides for your holes., Set the button down on a piece of scrap wood. Use a 1/16-inch (1.6-millimeter) drill bit to make holes through the top of the button; use the dots you made as a guide.You can use a larger or smaller drill bit, depending on the size of the button and the project.
The scrap piece of wood is there to protect your work surface.
Wear safety glasses and gloves for this step.
If you need to, flip the button over, and drill the holes through the other side. This will help make them more even., This will help soften the edges around the button and the button holes, and prevent snagging., You can leave the buttons plain, if you'd like, or you can decorate them. For example, you can etch designs into the buttons using a wood burning tool, or you can paint them with acrylic paint. You can also dye them with watercolor paint or fabric dye.


If you painted or stained the buttons, be sure to let them dry.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it is highly recommended. Not only will it bring out the natural color and pattern of the wood, but it will also help the buttons last longer. Here are some options for you:


For something quick and simple, polish the buttons using furniture polish and a soft cloth.If you painted the buttons, seal them with an acrylic sealer. Apply two coats, allowing each coat to dry inbetween.
Consider staining the buttons by rubbing some linseed oil, tung oil, or beeswax over them."
"
Purchase a silicon button mold and a resin kit.,
Prepare your work surface.,
Mix your resin according to the package.,
Pour the resin into the mold.,
Wait for the resin to cure.,
Pop the resin button out of the mold.",How to Make Buttons4," You can find them online and in well-stocked craft stores. Resin typically needs a catalyst to set. Some resin kits include this catalyst; the bottles are usually labeled ""Part A"" and ""Part B."" If you bought the resin just by itself, check the label to see if it needs a catalyst. If it does you will need to purchase it separately.

You can find basic, clear resin in an arts and crafts store.
Read up on the type of resin you are buying. Some types of resin turn opaque after they cure. Others turn a different color.

, Resin sets quickly, so have everything laid out and ready to go. Choose an area with adequate ventilation. Next, cover your work surface with newspaper or a cheap tablecloth. Put on a pair of gloves. Set out you stir sticks, button mold, and any additives. This includes things like resin dyes, glitter, and confetti.


High-humidity levels can sometimes affect curing times or cause resin to cure improperly. Plan on making your buttons on a dry day.

, Most resins come in two parts, and need to be mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Some resins are different however, so be sure that you read the mixing instructions carefully. If you don't use the correct amounts, the resin may not cure properly.Typically, however, you will need to pour Part A and Part B into separate mixing cups, then pour Part A into Part B, then stir it together with a stick


If you wish to dye the resin, do so during this step. Follow the instructions on the dye package, as each brand may be different.
If you plan on making a lot of buttons, consider mixing only small amounts of resin at a time. Resin sets quickly, and it may harden before you finish filling all of the molds.

, Hold the cup close to the mold, and pour the resin in slowly. This will help prevent splatters and air bubbles. Do not overfill the mold. If you do, you will end up covering the button holes.


If there are any air bubbles, gently blow on the resin.Consider adding some glitter or confetti into the resin after you pour it into the mold. If you need to, use a toothpick to stir the glitter or confetti around., Leave the buttons undisturbed during this time. How long the resin takes to cure depends on the type of resin you are using. Some take only a few minutes to cure while others take a few hours. Read the label to specific curing times.Just because the resin is hard does not necessarily mean that it is cured and ready to go. Follow the curing times exactly.

, Once the curing time is up, you button is ready to go! Turn the mold upside down, and gently pop the button out.

"
Get a pair of matching buttons.,
Prep the buttons, if desired.,
Set the buttons face down.,
Place a bead of glue onto the back of an earring post.,
Gently place the post onto the back of the button.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Wear your earrings.",How to Make Button Earrings1," Plain, 4-hole or 2-hole buttons would work best for this method. You can still use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, however. Whichever style of button you use, make sure that it is the same size, or a little bit bigger, than your earring posts.;
, For a cute look, pass some embroidery thread through the holes. If you are using a 4-hole button, pass the thread through the holes to create an X-shape. If you are using a 2-hole button, simply pass the thread through the holes once or twice. When you are done, tie the thread off in the back of the button, and snip off any excess.


If you are using coat-style buttons, cut the loop off with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters. Use a piece of sandpaper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges., It might be a good idea to do this on a piece of wax paper in case any glue leaks out through the holes. If you added thread to the buttons, however, you won't have to worry as much about this.

, The best type of glue to use for this would be super glue, industrial-strength glue, or some type of epoxy glue. Avoid putting too much on, however, or it may leak through the button holes!If you do not have pierced ears, you can use clip-on earring backings instead.

, Try to make the post as centered as possible. If you are using a 4-hole button, use the holes as guides., Depending on the type of glue you are using, this may take a few minutes to a few hours. If you don't wait long enough, the earring may fall apart. Refer to the label on your bottle or tube of glue for specific drying times.

, Once the glue has dried, your earrings are ready to wear. Be gentle when taking them out, however, or they may break apart.

Lay out a black shirt on a large plastic garbage bag.,
Mix bleach with water.,
Spray the bleach onto the shirt.,
Create a galaxy star cluster in the middle of the shirt.Twist the fabric in the middle of the shirt and liberally spray the center of the twist with bleach.,
Dry the bleach spots.,
Wash and dry the shirt.,
Splash white fabric paint onto the shirt.,
Blur larger specks of paint.If you do get a few larger, thicker dabs of paint on your shirt, remedy the situation by gently blurring these dabs with the palm of your hand.,
Purposefully add a few larger dots of paint.,
Sponge on a few other colors.,
Blur the colors with water.,
Alternatively, spray the color on instead of sponging it.Use spray fabric paint to lightly spray the edges of the star clusters, creating depth.,
Dry, rinse, and dry again.",How to Make a Galaxy Shirt," Line the inside of the shirt with plastic, as well.









Any plastic sheeting or large plastic surface will work. You simply need something that is capable of preventing bleach and paint from dripping onto the floor or bleeding through the shirt.
Placing plastic inside the shirt prevents the bleach from bleeding through and staining the other side.
If possible, use a plain black cotton shirt. Cotton and similarly absorbent materials work best for this project. You must also use a black shirt, rather than a white or color shirt.;
, Combine three parts water with seven parts bleach in a spray bottle. Shake the bottle to make sure that the liquids are thoroughly combined.









A travel size spray bottle should be large enough. You do not need much bleach solution for this project.
Avoid using straight, undiluted bleach, as it could eat away at the fabric.

, Randomly yet carefully spray the shirt with your bleach solution.









Make some sprays close together and others further apart. Spraying the bleach near other bleach spots will create the appearance of connected star clusters, while spraying them further apart helps to create the illusion of depth and distance by making it appear as though there are other star clusters in the distance.
The bleach will create a rusty red-orange color on the black shirt.
Do not spray too much of the shirt. You want some black area to remain in order to highlight the galaxy pattern. Otherwise, your shirt may end up looking like a rust-colored laundry accident.

,









This step is only optional, and you can create a galaxy shirt without creating a central star cluster.
Wait until after you get a decent pattern of bleach on your shirt before making the central star cluster.

, You can let the bleach dry naturally or you can speed the process up with a hair dryer.









If drying naturally, place the shirt in a sunny location and let it dry completely.
If you want to speed the process up, dry the shirt by pointing a hair dryer, set to a low setting, at the wet bleach spots.
Drying the shirt can take 30 to 40 minutes.

, Rinse the shirt in lukewarm water and let it air dry.









Washing the shirt stops the bleach from working further into the fabric. As a result, the bleach is less likely to eat away at the material.

, Dip a stiff paintbrush into white fabric paint and flick the paint off the brush by pulling back on the bristles and quickly releasing them over the shirt.









Make sure to use fabric paint, since many other type of paint may wear off when washed.
You could also use an old toothbrush instead of a paintbrush.
Similarly, you could flick the paint off the brush by holding the brush in one hand and quickly snapping your wrist in the direction of the shirt. This may give you less control over where the paint dots fall, however.
Try to concentrate the flecks of paint around the bleached star clusters you created. A few stray stars are okay, but the majority should be near the bleached portion of the shirt rather than the empty portion.
You may want to practice first to make sure that you can get the flicking motion right. You will need to create small dots of paint, and if you don't know what you're doing, you may end up creating large blobs, instead.

,









Simply press down on the blobs with your hand. Do not rub your hand back and forth, since doing so will smear the dots. Merely pressing down on the dots of paint will thin them out, making them stand out less.

, If desired, you can create a constellation effect by purposefully dripping a few larger blobs of paint or bleach at various places around the shirt.









This step is only optional. If used, these larger blobs should only be about twice the size as a normal speck.
Do not add too many larger blobs, since these have a tendency to be distracting.

, A normal palette consists of blue, yellow, and purple, but you can get more creative if desired. Use a sponge brush to lightly dab these colors around the edges of your bleach star clusters and in the midst of your white-speckled stars.









You do not need to add more colors, but the right colors can add further depth and visual interest to your galaxy shirt.
For a more feminine look, you can use shades like magenta, deep purple, and lighter pink.
If you do not have a sponge brush, a plain sponge will also work. Choose a sponge with small holes, however. A dish sponge is too porous.
Use thin acrylic paint for this step. Fabric paint tends to be more opaque, and you need something a little more translucent to create the desired effect.

, Lighten and smooth the appearance of the paint by dabbing it with a water-soaked sponge or paper towel.









When done, you should still be able to see any painted stars or bleached star clusters beneath the added paint.
Blend until you achieve an effect that appeals to you. Some portions can be darker than others, but these extra colors should only be used to create depth. They should not be the focal point of the shirt.

This method works best if you ended up bleaching a large portion of your shirt rather than a smaller, confined portion.
You can use multiple colors, but it may work better if you only use one or two similar colors, like purple and blue.
Water-down tie-dye paint will also work if you cannot find spray fabric paint.
You do not need to dilute the paint with water afterward.

, After all is said and done, let the shirt dry flat overnight. Rinse it with cold water and let air dry.
